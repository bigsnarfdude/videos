Thank you for the introduction. Thanks for the invitation. It's always wonderful to be in Banff. And this is a very appropriate talk, I think, to give here. So I'm going to talk about a sort of road field model. And this is for situations where you have kind of like a distinguished road type thing that your individuals move really quickly on but don't reproduce on. And then a field where they move maybe slower, but they can reproduce and sort of live their happy lives easier. And it's appropriate because I believe my understanding of the sort of history. I believe my understanding of the sort of history of this model is all sort of due to Mark Lewis tracking wolves in the Rockies in Alberta. And these wolves will use seismic lines, so the sort of roads that oil companies create to get around. And they'll get on it, and they'll move much quicker, and then they'll get off of it to, you know, go find prey or whatever. I'm also going to talk about a particular choice of model, which is by the one by Beresticky Rokshaw. One by Berasticki, Rokshoff, and Rossi. But there's other models, there's a few of them, and Thomas Hillen also has one, so I want to advertise for those as well. The reason that we do this model is basically because Adrian and I were in Paris, we saw Jean-Michel Rokshoff give a talk on it, and we thought, okay, hey, maybe we should have something interesting to say about this. So let me write down the equation. So let's just take some generic domain. I'm going to add some curvature to it for a second. Going to add some curvature to it for a second. Inside the field, right, we're going to have our population be given by v. So we have vt equals Laplacian V plus V1 minus V. So this is Fisher KDT. And then we're going to have this distinguished road. And on the road, our population is going to be U. And let's call the sort of road variable tau for tangential and the going. And the going interior is a normal. So you move quickly on the road. So we're thinking of D as being quite large. But now you also need to be able to exchange. Your population on the road has to be able to exchange into the field. So what you need is some sort of coupling. And the way you do that, and I always forget which one is u minus z and which one is v minus u. u minus v plus v minus u. So these are both on the equations on the road. So this is kind of just exchanging back and forth. And the main question that we have is sort of, let's say you have a very fast road. How does the road change the invasion behavior or s invasion slash threat behavior? Slash credit behavior. So, you know, you put a new pack of wolves down here and you watch as they sort of take, you know, reproduce, spread out, and take over your Banff National Park. How does them using the roads affect how fast they're going to make it through the territory? So, in the special case where you have the half space, okay, this is half space. Half space. The Beristicki, Rokchov, and Rossi team have a fairly complete answer to this, which is, okay, let's say you call C of theta the speed in the direction of theta. And theta here is always measured from the y-axis. Then, okay, there are a few things. Then, okay, there are a few things. Okay, they say a lot, but let me give you the highlights. So, C of 0 should be 2, and that's not really a surprise because if you're going just straight north, the road plays no role whatsoever. And so you just have to fish your KPP speed. If you go along the road, you get something that's like order root D, and actually they have something more precise in this to say what the pre-factor is. And then the other thing, which is like half a result and half actually the reason that they can prove everything. The reason that they can prove everything that they want is: let's say you call WT to be sort of the populated area. So, W is for a wolf shape, but it's wolf like the German name, right? Yeah, from crystals, not from wolves in Danf. This is going to be convex. Okay, so let me kind of draw a little picture. I'm really kind of milk a little bit. I'm really going to milk all the space out over here. Well, maybe I can just add it to this picture. So let's call this. What you end up getting is: you know, you get something that kind of looks like this, say. So that will be our W side T. And the speed C theta will just be the length divided by T from the origin to the boundary in the direction theta. Okay, now why is the convexity important? Why is the convexity important? Because what they want to do is they'd like to bound everything by using planar super solutions. Why? Because, okay, it's hard to build super solutions and these work. So if you want to have planar super solutions that sort of touch the boundary, that's kind of like touching this shape with lines in any direction. And the only objects that you can touch by a line at any point is a convex shape. This is sort of an equivalent definition of convexity. So their proofs work because. Their proofs work because they have a convex hole shape. Okay, so that'll come up again. I'm glad that there's colors here. This is very nice. So, what did we want to do? So, our motivation, it starts out quite modest, which is just we want to add a sort of control formulation to it. And if you don't know what I mean by control formulation, let me just say that it's sort of phrasing the front in terms of optimal paths. And that makes sense, right? Because this is a whole And that makes sense, right? Because this whole story is one about sort of individuals taking advantage of the road to get to certain places. And so you should sort of phrase things by how, you know, if you're here and you want to get up here, should you go on the field? Should you go on the road? How long should you go on the road? And so we thought, okay, it would be nice to have, this would be a nice sort of ecological result to have. But then what we realized, okay, you know, you start working on something and you start getting greedier because you realize you can do like a little bit more. Because you realize you can do like a little bit more. And so, what we realize is we can actually kind of do sort of more generic domains. And so, instead of doing the half space, we work on sort of conical domains. We can also do conical domains. Okay, and so here let me draw that. So, this uh bisector gamma has angle A, that's what the A is here. And omega A is the domain between this two. Omega A is the domain between these two. And so that's what I'd like to get to. So that's kind of the goal. It's like, what is the control formulation for the problem even on the half space? And then how does that go to conical domains? Okay. So the way you do this, there's a strategy developed by Craig Evans and Takisuganidis. And the sort of first step is you do what's called this sort of hoppole transform with some rescaled variables. Variable. So it's just a change of function. So let's call our new function v epsilon. And this is going to be negative epsilon log capital V T over epsilon x over epsilon y over epsilon. So why do you do this? Well, you want to look at the long time behavior. And okay, what's the right scale to look at? Well, you expect things to move at a constant speed, so you should look at distances proportional to the time. So if you scale To the time. So if you scale time by 1 over epsilon, you should scale space by 1 over epsilon. And now, y log? I don't know, right? There's some principle in math that, like, you should just try to take a log of any function and see what happens. Yeah, indeed. Okay, so before we, and so similarly for you, okay? And what's some, maybe the first thing you might want to observe. Okay, well, let's say that we have v epsilon and u epsilon, which are kind of like zero. Well, for those to be like zero, if we just look at the log part, that tells me that sort of v and u should be like zero. Excuse me, v and u should be like one. Log of one is zero. I just gotta get my. I just got to get my calculus correct. On the other hand, if v and u are positive, well, how could that possibly happen? You have this epsilon here. This is getting very small, so your log has to get very big. When is log big? When you're plugging zero into it. So that tells you that v and u are like zero. So this tells you that if you want to track the front of v and u, capital V, capital U, it's And u, capital v, capital U, it's like tracking where little v and little u pull off from zero. You want to find the boundary of that zero set. So the front in some rough way is the boundary of these guys being zero. But squiggly. Okay. So now we have that, we can write down some equations, and then there's no way I'll get this right. So let me just steal a piece of paper and Steal a piece of paper and copy it. Okay, so the epsilon t minus epsilon Laplacian V epsilon. Let me just drop the epsilons because I'll drive myself crazy. Plus grad v squared plus 1 minus e v over epsilon equals 0. Okay, before I write the other equations, let me just make a sort of simplification. So when we take epsilon to 0, we're going to use these disc. When we take epsilon to zero, we're going to use these viscosity solutions, these things called half-relax limits. And they have this miracle that if you have an epsilon, you can just ignore the thing. You don't even have to worry about getting good balance. Life works out magically. So let's just cut this off because it's not really a huge difficulty. And let's also just get rid of this, because okay, if V is positive, this thing should disappear. That one's a much more severe thing to ignore in the talk. That can cause some real problems. But for this talk, let's forget about it. But for this talk, let's forget about it, right? So, Adrian cruelly only gave me 20 minutes to talk. I know Adrian best of the organizers, so I'm blaming it on him. So, I have to forget about some things. Okay, so then, so let's ignore these types of terms for u as well. So, u t, we're going to have something that looks like d u tau squared, and then minus Yeah, I should cheese. E to the u minus v over epsilon minus 1. And then our last one is v n will be e to the minus u minus v over epsilon minus 1. Okay, so let's make a few observations. This term right here, let's do it in red, that underlying thing, if you want that to be well behaved, then you better have. To be well behaved, then you better have that u and v are going to go to the same function w. Because if they don't, either this thing's going to blow up and life is going to be bad, or this thing's going to blow up and life is going to be bad. So now we get to work with some function w. Okay, now let's take the second and third equations. We combine them because they have essentially the same terms showing up, and what you can end up getting. And what you can end up getting is that, okay, well, now let's convert everything to w. This first equation will be wt plus grad w squared plus 1 equals 0. And the second equation will be wt plus dw tau squared minus wn over 1 plus wn equals zero. Chris, got a question. Do we have all questions? Do we have all questions? Yeah, yeah, go for it. Of course. From you? So, yeah, I love your frames. I'm just, so I want to call this H subf and F naught, and I'll see something about that. Another question? So U and V live on different domains. How can they be the same functions? It's true. So when I say they converge to the same function, I mean when you restrict to the boundary, they converge to the same function. In the field, U doesn't exist. So V just converges to something, and I'm going to call it W. So W on the domain. call it W. So W on the domain is U and on the boundary is V. So V is defined on the boundary, U is defined on the boundary. And as epsilon goes to zero, U and V on the boundary converge to the same thing. And there's enough continuity that you can say that, okay, the thing that you converge to in the field matches up with the thing you converge to on the boundary. No, I don't understand, since you already asked the question. So, again, how do you put V, U, in the domain of V? Of V outside in the second equation, therefore. So V is defined all the way up to the boundary and it's continuous up to the boundary. So I can take the restriction of it on the boundary. When you write the second equation for u sub t, u sub t, you put the e to the u minus v. Yeah. But v is only would you be happier if I wrote restricted to d omega? I really not ask this question. Not ask this question then. I think I don't understand your question. It's okay. Yeah, so I can ask you. No, no, no, it's continuous up to the boundary. What's this? It's just continuous up to. V is continuous up to the boundary. The boundary bar. Okay. Yeah. Let's talk afterwards. Okay. So I'm going to call this h sub f for the Hamiltonian in the field. And I'm going to call this f0 because it's a garbage function that we'll get rid of in a second. Okay. It's not garbage, but it's not a Hamiltonian. So the problem with this is that there's going to be no control formulation. And the reason is because it's not a true Hamilton-Jacobi equation. It's not a true Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the road. Right? This is the road variable tau, you're taking that derivative, that's fine. This is a variable going completely out of the domain. It makes no sense, right? So you have no good way of making a control formulation for this. But luckily, very smart people have thought about this. And there's some nice papers by Serial Ambera and Régie Monod. And they're thinking about Hamilton-Jacobi equations with junctions, which is related but a little bit different. Which is related, but a little bit different. And they basically tell you that this is kind of like a weak formulation. And they give you some way of figuring out what the strong formulation is. And let me not do a great credit to their work and give you a sort of lying answer as to what we're going to do. So, here, if you're near the boundary, these two operators are kind of associated to a cost. But as an individual, But as an individual, if you're really close to the road, you can just kind of hop on or hop off at will. So if this one is really bad, then you hop onto the road and you take advantage of F naught. If that one's really bad, you hop off of the road and take advantage of the field. So what you should kind of get is you should kind of get where these two things are equal to each other. So let's let PQ be the solution to F naught of Q PQ. PQ, HF of Q PQ. Then let HR, which is sort of the Hamiltonian on the road, to be Q squared plus PQ squared plus 1, which is essentially plugging PQ into this Hamiltonian on the field. Now, this is not actually going to be the Hamiltonian, it's not actually going to be the Hamiltonian that we plug into here. The W satisfies some kind of other equations. Satisfy some kind of other equation. But at the level of control formulations, this is the thing that matters. So what you end up getting is you get, okay, j of t xy is going to be the minimum over all paths that start at the origin and go to the ending point that you've decided on, xy. And they have some cost associated to them. It could be positive or negative. And if you are on the if you're in the field, If you're in the field, then what you should do is you should take the convex conjugate of the field Hamiltonian, and that's your cost. If you are on the road, then you should take the convex conjugate of the road Hamiltonian. So you're sort of optimizing all paths where you get a cost on the road and a cost on the Where you get a cost on the road and a cost on the field. It sort of quantifies your ability to reproduce and your ability to move quickly. And then what we can show. There is no capital D in HR. There is no capital D in H. The diffusion of the road, the not C, the diffusion of the row? It is implicitly in here because this depends on F. Yeah. So if you can write out, but you can sort of Do some work solving for this, and then you see the D pop up in some explicit way. And in fact, you see it show up as a square root of d, which is maybe a little surprise. And then what you can show is that, okay, w is actually given in terms of this j. Okay, and there's a lot of work that goes into these steps. For the people who know, it's you use half relax limits. It's used half-relax limits. And then you need a comparison principle. And the comparison arguments are things that people like Americ Mono and Leon Suganese have developed a lot for these Hamilton Jacobi equations with junctions. But okay, now that you have this in hand, what can you do with it? Right? So the first thing you can do is you can say, okay, well, the front. Well, the front at time t will be exactly the set where j is equal to 0. Right? Because when j is negative, that's when w is going to be 0, and that's this case. When j is positive, that's when w is going to be positive, and that's this case. So exactly when j is equal to 0 is the interface between the two. You need to show that that's You need to show that that's not a fat set, it's one-dimensional. We can also say what the optimal pads look like. So, the optimal pads, you know, it's ringing at me. But Avner asked me a long question. So, I'm just saying. So, the optimal pads are piecewise constant, or piecewise constant velocity. And let me show you what they look like. What they look like. But in the half space, what it's going to do is it's going to run along the road for some fixed amount of time, and then it veers into the field, and then it ends up at x, y. Okay? Now, what's really nice about that is the following thing. Well, okay, I got a little flustered. One thing I should say is once you have these two things, you can recover the Veristicky, Rokshoff, and Rossi results pretty easily. It's hard to get the control formulation, once you have it, you can kind of read off everything. But what I'd like to say before I get the hook is the following. Is the following, which is that these optimal paths only see the closest road. Okay. So now if you take our conical domain and you take our gamma sub A, which is the bisector, if you sit below gamma sub A, then the optimal path is going to go along here. To go along here and then veer up. But this path sees nothing about the other row, which means that the optimal path for the conical domain is going to be exactly the same as the optimal path for the half-space problem. So, what this tells you is that, okay, if you look at the control problem on the half space, what you end up getting is, okay, if you're below gamma sub A, you just get the same J as for the half space problem. And if you're above gamma sub A, you get the reflection. Okay? And so, in particular, what you can see is that the formula for the speeds gets this. The theorem, and then I'll finish. C of theta is either going to be C of theta for omega sub A is either going to be the half space or it's going to be the half space but with the angle reflected. Space, but with the angle reflected. Pi minus 2a minus theta. And the other thing that you get is: okay, let's draw our wolf shape. So the half-space front looks kind of like a flying saucer. So that's one. That comes from this computation. But then if you take the reflection, you get a flying saucer starting from over here. And so you end up with something like this. And so you end up with something like this. And then the front will be everything behind those flying saucers, which means this will be your wolf shape. Okay? And so what we see is that WT is not convex, at least if D is sufficiently large. And we can kind of quantify that. Which means that the super solutions that you use for the parabolic setting kind of are. The parabolic setting kind of aren't going to help you here. But if you have the control formulation, you can kind of read off everything you want about the conical domain just straight from the half-space problem. I think that's a good place to stop. So thanks very much for your research on that. Any additional questions? Nothing to answer. So for determining the wall shape, do you actually particularly choose a Yeah, so because we've scaled everything with these epsilons, the sort of width of the front and any fluctuations that might happen gets completely killed by the scaling. In the Beresticki, Rokshoff, and Rossi paper, what they do is they Do is they say, okay, take the front at time t and then scale it by t and then take t to infinity, and then those it's in the same way those fluctuations kind of fade away. So you don't have to worry about having it be well defined. Does that answer your question? Yeah, that is. So a wolf shape scales with t? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It basically just becomes bigger and when time goes bigger. Yeah, so you can in fact say that this is like, you know, take the wolf shape at time one and scale it by t. The wolf shape at time one and scale it by t, and you get exactly the whole shape at time t. That's the sort of nice property of it. Then, what was the control variable? The road variable is the velocity. The velocity of the path. Velocity. Velocity. I see. I'm very curious. Does this lag red prevent from aggregating outside of the domain? Because maybe an additional constraint. Yeah, no, no, we don't. We optimize only over paths that stay in the domain. It's not a state constraint thing. Sorry? It's not written in the logitermin, like the like it can't wander outside of that, like wander to why. Outside of that, like wonder to y being negative. Yeah, I don't know. It's not in there. We sort of impose it from the outside. We only look at paths that say in the domain. I had a question. So for the cost function, you didn't really say what these gamma dots are. Oh, so gamma is a path. So yeah, yeah. So, right, if you want to be very careful, gamma of t should be a map. A map from 0t into your domain, and gamma should be in h1 so that these things make sense. So, gamma dot is the speed. So, gamma dot is the velocity, yeah. Yeah, okay, so I missed that. Yeah, yeah. No, no, you're being very polite, singing, missed it. I didn't say it. All right, let's thank the speaker again. All right, let's send the speaker again.
