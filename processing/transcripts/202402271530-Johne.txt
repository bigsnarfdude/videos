So today I will join up. I will talk about a joint project with Steemon Grendler and Sven Hirsch and moreover joint work with Aaron Chao and Jing Bo Wan and then maybe in the end if there's time I will talk about some recent ongoing work by myself. So I will talk about this notion of M-intermediate curvature and I will first try to motivate it how we came up with this notion. How we came up with this notion and why this may be something interesting. So, the general question which we want to ask ourselves is: you know, how does the existence of positive or negative curvature metrics So, and also I want to mention for most of my talk we will look at closed, smooth, orientable connected manifolds in dimension three greater or equal than three. But first, let me remind you of some obstruction results, right? So, in two Results, right? So, in two dimensions, we have obstructions given by Gauss Bonnet. And so, the situation in two dimensions is very different. So, we mainly look at three dimensions or higher. And of course, as was mentioned before, if we know that if you have a metric with If you have a metric with if you have an n, a metric with negative non-positive sectional curvature, then we know that well, the universal cover is diffeomorphic to Rn. This is a theorem due to Qatar and Hadama. And well, if we pass to negative Ricci curvature bounds, then I mean, this is a result due to Yao and Lukan, which basically says that any three-dimensional manifold or admits a complete metric of negative Ricci curvature. A negative Ricci curvature. So on any n exists some G complete with Ricci curvature with some negative Ricci curvature. So in particular, negative Ricci curvature cannot obstruct somehow the topology. Existence of a metric with negative The existence of a metric with negative Ricci curvature cannot obstruct the topology in any way. So, on the other hand, for positive curvature, the picture is somehow different, right? So, if you have a lower Ricci bound, then the estimate by Bonnie Myers. Estimate by Bonnie Myers tells us that we get a diameter bound. So we first get a diameter bound. And then we also get that for this, we get that the fundamental group is finite. And here, of course, kappa should. And here, of course, kappa should be positive. And in particular, we conclude that if we look at manifolds which have an S1 factor, then there cannot exist the metric of positive Riji curvature on these, right? And everything will be closed here, right? So there exists. Exists no G with positive Ricci curvature, right? Because otherwise it would contradict the theorem of Bonnet Myers. So also as and for scalar curvature, right, we have the following results. We have this question, or we should maybe call the theorem. This is the George conjecture. So on the end Taurus, there exists no metric with positive scalar curvature. Okay, right, and this was first proven by Schumann, Shane, and Yao. And Yao in 1979 for dimension three between seven, and then later it was proved by Kromov Lawson. I think this was 1984 for all dimensions greater or equal than three. And then recently there was this very nice work by Daniel Stern, which somehow seems Stern, which somehow seems to have triggered like lots of renewed interest in positive scalar curvature, at least from my perspective. So, this I think was 2019, and this was for n is equal to 3. And all these three tools use somehow different methods, right? So, this here uses minimal surfaces, more precisely, stable minimal surfaces. This here uses spinners. Uses spinners and this here uses harmonic bond forms. Okay, and then what was, you know, in particular for three dimensions, we can, you know, we can take the following picture. So for three dimensions, we can maybe look at some simple manifolds, say S3, S2. S3, S2 cross S1, and the tree torus. And we can ask ourselves, you know, what kind of notions of positive curvatures do these manifolds admit? So, well, on the trees here, right, we just have the standard metric, which has positive spridgey curvature and positive scalar curvature. So, this is certainly a yes. And And on S2 cross S1, well, because of the S2 factor and the properties of scalar curvature, the product metric will just have positive scalar curvature. But for example, from the Bonnet-Meyers argument, or also by using three-dimensional Ricci flow, we know that this manifold cannot carry a metric of positive Ricci curvature. And similar for the tree torus, right? By the previous arguments and by the resolution of Geros conjecture into. The resolution of Geros conjecture in three dimensions, we know that there cannot be a metric of positive Ricci curvature, nor a metric of positive scalar curvature. So, in a certain sense, you know, in three dimensions, Ricci curvature and scalar curvature allow us to distinguish between these three manifolds, right? So, and then some of our starting point for our work was what happens in higher dimension. So, then let's turn. Let's turn this around. So, I've prepared a table. So, in four dimensions, I just decided to write down some simple manifolds, which you might be interested in. And basically, from the things which I've discussed, right, we get this picture. And we see that at this point, with the typical notions of curvature, say, positive curvature operator section. Say positive curvature operator, sectional curvature, Rigi curvature, and positive scalar curvature, we cannot distinguish between s3 cross s1 and s2 cross t2. So, and the idea is what we'll discuss in this talk is this intermediate curvature. So this is called C2. And the goal in the end is that we will understand that this is a metric of positive, I mean, positive two-intermediate curvature, but it's also called positive. It is also called positive B Richty curvature, and we want to show that this is not the case here. So, in a certain sense, this notion of curvature should allow us to distinguish partial tori. So, this means like Sn cross Tk for different values of N and K. We should be able to distinguish this. This is the idea. And this is, you know, it's just a little table, right? I mean, for example, this follows by the work of Hamilton. By work of Hamilton on four manifolds of positive curvature operator. Of course, this is the famous Hopf conjecture, which is open for a long time now. And well, right, I mean, this here, for example, follows by the Bonnet-Meyers argument. And this line here follows by the resolution of Geros conjecture in four dimensions. So that was basically the idea. And then at this point, right, there's really several candidates for a notion of Of or a notion of positive curvature. So, a notion for right, so what we want to do is we want to interpolate between positive Ricci curvature and positive scalar curvature in a sense, and there are different options to do this a priori. So, right, the idea is to interpolate between these things. To interpolate between these things, where you know you have to worry about what interpolates means. So there are different notions between these things. So one notion is to require Require k positivity of the rich curvature. For example, you know, a question which is to the best of my knowledge still open is on can you find on S2 cross T2 does there exists symmetric G such that if I look at the smallest The smallest two eigenvalues of the Richie, can this be positive? And where you know the Ritchie, right, we sort the eigenvalues, at least say in four dimensions like this. This is, for example, an open question still, but we went somehow in a different direction, which turns out to work very well with minimal slicings. So, and this is the notion of positive intermediate. Possibly that we get curvature. Okay, so maybe turning this off again. So let's start with the definition and some properties of this curvature. So, well, let n be greater or equal than 3 and fix another integer between 1 and n minus 1. Then fix a point in our manifold, fix an orthonormal frame in the tension space X. Then we can define the M-intermediate curvature as follows. So we set Cm at the point X of an orthonormal, well, of E1 up to Em. We define this as a suitable sum of sectional curvatures. Curvatures. So this here should be the sectional curvature of the plane of the plane PP batch Q And well, what do we have to do? We have to use this combination. To use this combination. And because this is maybe not, you know, it's maybe not completely clear what this combination means. So let me illustrate this with kind of a table. So here we illustrate the four-dimensional case, right? So in four dimensions, we have an off-normal frame E1, E2, E3, E4. And then we have, right, each dot represents a sectional curvature. Each dot represents the sectional curvature. Sorry, this is the wrong way wrong. And of course, right, I mean, the sectional curvatures on the diagonal, they vanish. And then basically the idea is that Ricci curvature is an average of, say, of three sectional curvatures like this. So this is the orange one. So, this is the orange one. Scalar curvature is the average up to a factor of one-half of all the sectional curvatures, and intermediate curvature somehow sits in between. So, in this case, in the four-dimensional case, you take an average of exactly five sectional curvatures. Okay, so this is the this is kind of how you can visualize these kind of okay, so then let's let's collect some properties. So, I mean, as already mentioned, well, C1 is the Ricci curvature, and C n minus 1 is 1.5 times 1. Is one and a half times the scalar curvature. Then I should also mention that if I have positive sectional curvature, then I get that Cm is positive for any n. And positivity of Cm implies that the scalar curvature is positive. Let's write this like this. But we actually don't know what happens in between. So it's, you know, except for, you know, if you're locally conformally flat or something like this, it's not. formally flat or something like this. It's not known let us say C3 implies that C4, C3 positive implies that C4 is positive. Okay, I should also mention that for M is equal to 2, this was studied by Chen and Ye in two papers in 96 and 97. And also in the paper which I just recently found, which is kind of very hidden, there's also a paper Of very hidden. There's also a paper by Tano, where he studies this notion of curvature independently. This is 1996. And they call this notion for m is equal to 2, they call it Byric curvature. And they prove quite some interesting things. Okay. So then let's turn this one around again. Round again. Okay, what else do I need to say? Okay, well, I should also mention that on S two cross T two, we have we have We have that C2 is non-negative and C3 is positive, which in this case is just the scalar curvature. So this is strictly positive. And so this at least, if you come back to the table, back to the table here. So if you look at this entry here, we actually know that this is true. This is true. So, this is just by construction, this is true. And we want to prove that this metric where C2, right, on the product metric, C2 is non-negative, we kind of want to prove that there's no perturbed positive. And of course, you could, you know, there seem to be chances for doing that because, right, on the four torus, you have a metric of, you know, a flat metric. So, in particular, a metric of Metric, so in particular, metric of non-negative scalar curvature, which you cannot perturb to be positive. Okay, so let's collect some more properties. Yes, so there is also another notion of another notion of curvature interpolation. Polation and this is due to Kromov and Laby and this is basically the scalar curvature of the organ complement of the Of the orthogonal complement of a plane, and our somehow it's the complementing curvature to our curvature. So, we have that if I look at two times the intermediate curvature of E1 to Em and I add this Romov-Labi curvature of the plane, which is, you know, which is spanned by E1 to Em. Then I exactly get. Then I exactly get the scalar curve. Okay, that's an important property. And then, what are some more properties? It's also interesting that these intermediate curvatures appear very naturally in the Gauss equations. So, right, so recall so. So, in Schön, yeah, all right. If you have what you basically do is you look at you look at such and sub-manifold, and then you look at the twice-contracted Gauss equations. So you look at this thing here. And then the basic idea of the, you know, one way to think about the hyperserve, the minimal surface method of Chen Yao is that you want to somehow, you want to be able that the scalar curvature here and the scalar curvature here, they can both somehow communicate. And for this, you have to control these terms over here, right? And while this here is controlled by, well, this is basically controlled by minimality. Controlled by minimality. And this here is controlled by the second variation. And so what we observe, at least locally, right? Because you don't know that we can actually find this globally. So observe locally, if you have sigma n minus m sitting in nn, then And then the intermediate curvature is about the curvature defect term. The curvature defect term, where you now take, I mean, you have to take not just one unit normal vector field, but many of them. So nu1 up to nu m. And then, of course, you get the extrinsic curvature terms, which I'll write as h squared minus a squared. h squared minus a squared in this care. So this is also a very nice property of this intermediate curvatures. And it's also at the end while we proved this, we didn't really know this relationship, but it explains why the method we use actually works at the end. And then there's also, where do I put this? There is a surgery result by Herzl. I mean, it's a very general result. General result. This is due to Sebastian Herzl. It applies to whenever you have a suitable, you know, in the space of curvature tensors, whenever you have a cone, which is ON are invariant, and basically your surgery neck lies in the cone, then you will know that for two between for m between two and n minus one, For m between two and n minus one, connected sums of manifolds with Cm positive again have Cm positive. It's actually much more general, but this is a more important thing. So you can, you know, you can just form connected samples or more general surgeries, and if you're More general surgeries, and if your initial two bits have, say, positive C2, then your final bit will also have positive C2. But this does not apply to each curve. Okay, and with these observations, I can state somehow our first main theorem. Let's do this here. And this basically confirms what I've tried to hint at at this following table. So, um, this is by Simon Sana myself. So we consider manifolds which are closed, smooth. Orientable and we assume that dimension n is smaller equal than 7 and we assume the typical bounds for which, you know, like this. And then, well, we also assume that there's a map. Assume that there's a map from this manifold to this manifold across the material factors. So I should rewrite this like this. So if this holds, then this original manifold does not admit a smooth metric. Such that the intermediate curvature is positive. And of course, this map here should have non-zero degree. Okay, so this is our main result. In particular, right, I mean, if it's already a product, then, well, you can just take F to be the identity. So let's do some remarks. So this applies. Well, this shows there exists no g with c2 positive on s2 plus t2. So this confirms the table which I hinted at earlier. And so we can distinguish these kinds of manifolds with this notion of curvature. Manifolds with this notion of curvature. And of course, more generally, there is no exists no G with C M positive on this kind of manifolds. Okay, so then let's talk about the dimension restriction because, of course, you might just think, okay, this is just, you know, typical. Think okay, this is just you know typical dimension restriction from the minimal surface method, but actually turns out that this is actually a bit more involved so yes yes and minus m, yes, thank you yeah so you basically want to slice of that thanks. Okay, so some remarks. So the first remark is that on the one hand, n is more like zap and is due to minimal surface regularity, or more generally, I mean, it's essentially minimal surface regularity. But actually, you know, even if we would live in the best of all possible worlds and we could assume that all minimal surfaces are smooth, there's still an algebraic constraint. And this is kind of the really interesting thing. And this algebraic constraint is n times n minus 2 has to be smaller equal than m squared. smaller equal than m squared minus 2. Well, it turns out for n is smaller equal than 7, this constraint here is, you know, it's just checking cases this holds automatically. And also for all n greater n3 and n in the boundary cases, so for positive Rigi curvature, positive bi-regi curvature, something which has no name yet, and positive scale up curvature, the constraint also holds. But then there are also examples, for example, for let's see, for n is equal to. Let's see, for n is equal to 8 and m is equal to 3, star does not hold. And, you know, it would be a very natural question to just ask, well, maybe this is just, this is just, you know, maybe the method is just not good enough to pick this up. But then actually, you know, I think it's quite surprising that. quite surprising that Kaikzu has constructed wonderful examples which show that basically this condition, basically this algebraic condition is sharp. Let me state this with the algebraic question. Sharp in some sense is clear on I 2023 so that means here for us so for n is greater than or equal to 8 and if you have You have the reverse inequality, and if f is a MOS function of the torus, then there exists G on systematic on these things with Cm strictly positive. With CM strictly positive. So this is quite surprising. And okay, there's also an explicit font. Okay, let's not, you know. It's a relatively explicit form given as a warp product and using the computations I mentioned yesterday. And okay. Then I should also mention that it is expected that one can for the case for one and two. For the case for one and two, that one can use geometric measure theory to remove the dimension constraint here. So, you can, you know, for positive Riggy curvature and positive by Riggy curvature, you can, I mean, prove this theorem in all dimensions. Because, I mean, you can probably, you know, because you only have to do one or two slices, then you can probably handle the singularities. Okay, so what else do I want to mention? There's also extensions to, you know, if you replace these manifolds by taking products between X and an arbitrary manifold then this cannot admit the next metric G complete with C and positive again with similar restrict algebraic restrictions and this was Restrictions, and this was done by Shui Chen in 2023. I think maybe 2022. Okay. Yeah, and then let me erase this here. There's also a rigidity result. This is due to shoes and man should leave and for n smaller equal than five and two to chi. And to chi for n is equal to smaller or equal than six, and basically tells you you know on the setup as above if Cm is not negative then you obtain a splitting result. So then this manifold has an isometric Has an isometric cover where you see the M torus vectors. So an isometric cover. And moreover, this metric here, this has a non-negative rich curvature. Then let me explain or give a very sketchy, very sketchy argument for the proof of this theorem with similar stand. So the idea is to use minimal slicings and let's focus on you know let's focus on the case n is equal to 4 s two cross S2 cross D2 and we want to show right show that there exists no metric G with C2 positive. So how do we proceed in doing this? So the basic idea is we start here with our manifold, which I'll just write as SS2 cross T2. Then in the Then, in the first step, we find the stable metal hypersurface, which we call the R1. So, this is stable at minimal. And you should think of this. And you should think of this surface, you know, morally, it should really mean that you get rid of one of the toroidal factors, but that's not necessarily true. So this should be like this. And then inside this manifold, we can minimize the stable minimal hypersurface obtained by minimizing area. So we can minimize again. So we have this here, and then inside this thing, we have a we have this, and so sigma 2, you should morally think of it as being just an S2 or zero. And this here obtained, this is a stable weighted minimal hypersurface. So that's the only thing that's going to be a little bit more difficult. And what is the weight? Well, here we have a Jacobi operator. So the first eigenfunction of the Jacobi operator. Let's write this as row as row. This gives the weight here. So, what we do here is we minimize, we minimize somehow, you know, we minimize this functional here. Okay, and that's the idea. So, basically, if I have, you know, if I look at C3, I would take three such slices and Slices and so on. And the idea is that basically from each step, I get two PDEs. So I get here a first variation formula and a second variation formula. And here I get also a first and a second variation formula. Then on the bottom slice, so on this slice here, the basic idea is to use all this information. So this will be two MPDEs to derive a contradiction. To derive a contradiction, so you know, assume assume that there is a metric of C2 positive, then you get basically a contradiction to the stability inequality, which is modified by using these two M PDEs here on these M slices. And so, if there's time at the end, I would give a more detailed proof, but there is probably not. So, let's continue here.  So, another observation which is the following. So, if you have a uniform positive lower bound on Cm, then you obtain that Cm minus 1 has also a positive, the same positive lower bound in a spectral sense. And here what I really want to assume is that u is smaller equal than m is smaller equal than n minus one. One and also, there's you know, there's some restrictions on dimensions. Maybe I should maybe should phrase this a bit better. So, if so, if sigma n minus one sits in and It's at an end, and if the if the magic on n has this larger than lambda, then induced metric here has As the induced metric on the pocket, sorry. So we want that this is a stable two-sided minimal hypersurface. And if this thing has uniformly positive energy, it's not a good thing. Has uniformly positive intermediate curvature. So if this thing here has uniformly positive intermediate curvature, then this here with the induced metric has spectrally positive m minus one curvature. So, in an integral sense. So, this is basically for, I mean, this is classically due to Shunyao for well, for you know, m is equal to n minus one. So, you know what this means. So, you know what this means: if the scale-up curvature on m prime squared equal to lambda, then you get the same thing spectrally on the minimal hypersurface. So, for and for m is equal to two, this is due to Shen and Y and due to chi. And I would say, you know, for, you know, with some restrictions on dimension for n, but for the other cases, this is, you know, I would say for chlor. And this inheritance property was also used in a very significant way recently in work by so the inheritance. Anyway. So the inheritance C2 uniformly positive to Valvichi positive respectful sense was recently used in the proof of the positive in In this close by Jodos Lee Minter and Stryker for the stable Bernstein in R5. Okay, so far this was mainly topology. Let me make some remarks on geometry. So, well, we know from work of Xi and Pan and work by Miao. Now that if you have somehow, you know, if you have say positive scalar curvature in the interior, then this and this, then this interacts well with positive mean curvature on the boundary. So these two things interact well. Yes. Okay, sorry. So, this is a computation. So, basically, you just plug in the right things, the stability, inequality, and then you get this. And this is really an important thing in. Important thing in this proof of Georges Lee Minton's striker. So, what they do is they start with their pore surface, then you know, think in the model case that's like a four plant, then they use this transformation by Galliper and Lawson to roll this up into a cylinder. This cylinder will have, I mean, by a computation, will have this positive. And then, okay, they don't go to a stable minimal hypersurface, but they go to a mu bubble. But that's more the same. Bubble, but that's morely the same thing. And then this new bubble will have positive Ridging curvature and spectral sense. And then this is enough to get all kinds of diameter bounds and volume bounds. So this is the main idea. So, okay, so these things interact well, and then this is this. This is just this theorem with Aaron Chow, myself, and I'm Jin Govan from 2023. And okay, to put it very informally, so if we have, you know, it's stated a bit differently, but if we have But if we have two metrics like this on the same manifold, and here now we consider n is a manifold with boundary. Then, okay, it's kind of an informal statement. So if If these two manifolds have positive intermediate curvature and if the difference of the second fundamental forms is m positive. Then we can kind of, you know, then we can smoothly glue these things together such that the clued manifold still has Still has positive intermediate curvature. And of course, right, I mean, you should think if m is equal to n minus 1, then this is just a scalar curvature. And, you know, you can also think that one of these two metrics has totally geodesic boundary. Then this here is this term vanishes. And then this m positivity here is n minus one positivity. Here is n minus one positivity, but because the boundary is an n minus one dimensional manifold, this is then basically positivity of the mean curvature, not the boundary. So, this, you know, it's not, it's not a, you know, in a certain moral sense, this generalizes this boundary behavior to the intermediate curvatures. Yeah. I do have five slides fifty minutes. Or should it suddenly be fifty minutes on the ground? So, and I should maybe I should also remark here basically the proof of this. This relies on an algebraic lemma plus a cluing scheme which was developed by Was developed by Aaron Chow in his PhD thesis. And this scheme works, for example, very nice. This fluing scheme by Aaron works very nicely for the curvature conditions which arise in Reedshifie flow, for example, for this positive isotropic curvature. Positive isotopic curvature, or for positive scalar curvature, or for these peak one and pick two conditions, which give you the nice conversions results for achieved on. So this is a very nice, very nice scheme. Okay, and then maybe just in the last two minutes, so a question is, you know, how do manifolds with With say Cm greater equal than lambda look microscopically. So, you know, a conjecture which is too naive would be that so if this is greater or equal than lambda, then equals lambda then then the manifold looks macroscopically n minus one dimensional let's see here right in particular for But in particular for Ricci, the manifold should look zero dimensional. And I mean, this is for scalar curvature. The manifold should look n minus two dimensional. This is an interesting conjecture. And then there was a theorem of i again so. So if n is smaller or equal than five, and if the manifold is simply connected, then C2 greater or equal than lambda implies that the manifold is one-dimensional, but for n is greater than equal. n is greater than equal to n 6, they're counter examples. So this conjecture, you know, it's too naive for the intermediate curvatures. But of course it's still open for positive scalar curvature except in 3D where this was resolved. And then to conclude my talk is concluded. So For C2 and N is in four and five, and for C3, and N is, well, it only really makes sense in five dimensions. They are a kind of diameter. They are, you know, they are generalized diameter inequalities. So, what do I mean by this? For example, for if a manifold has positive scalar curvature, say greater or equal than lambda, and we consider such a metric on the cube. Then, what we get is that the premium over the cube of the scalar curvature is smaller equal than some dimensional constant, which you can make almost sharp. And then you have the you have this, you know, this. You have this, you know, these inverse sums of this here. And what is Lk? Well, LK is just the distance between the faces. This is the distance between the faces. Okay, and then you know, you get for which you. For Ricci curvature, you get basically one summit, and for C2 and C3, you get several summits, and it is some. So, you kind of control how large these manifolds are in some directions. Okay, and then I will probably stop here. Thank you for your question.
