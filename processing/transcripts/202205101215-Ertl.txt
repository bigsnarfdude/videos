Thank you very much for the introduction and also for the invitation. It's very nice to be with you online. Today I want to report on a project with Atsushi Shiho from Tokyo and Johannes Spang from Essen on integral PID homology theories for augment singular varieties. So first I will give you some motivation So first I will give you some motivation and then I will talk about our main construction where we use very strong conditions of resolution of singularities and positive characteristic. And if I have time in the end, I will also talk about what we can do without resolution of singularities. So for a long time, the research for good integral paietic homology theories Pietic homology theories, one can say that it started with the Weil conjectures, where the notion of a Veil chomology was introduced. Of course, this was then solved by Dirin by using L-Atic homology, where L is not equal to P. But there was a strong desire to fill the gap for L equals P. There's, on the one hand, there's aesthetic reasons because it's very nice to Aesthetic reasons because it's very nice to have something for all the primes, but also there are some technical reasons because one wants to study, for example, p-torsion questions. So in my talk, I will fix a perfect field of characteristic P, small k, and I denote by WK the ring of width vectors of k and capital K its fraction field. So there have been So there have been several candidates for an integral pietic homology theory. The first one by the crystalline homology, which was constructed by Betelo after a suggestion due to Grotendik. And however, it's only finitely generated over WK for proper and smooth varieties. In the case, for the case of non-proper For the case of non-proper or non-smooth varieties, of course we have rational, we have rigid cohomology. However, it has rational coefficients. So in capital K. Then only recently, in 2011, I think, Lebesgue, Langer and Sink introduced an integral periodic homology theory, the so-called overconvention de Ramit homology. And there were strong hopes that this could give be a good Hopes that this could give be a good candidate. However, it turns out that it's not finitely generated in general, even modular torsion. And at Sushishu and myself, we gave a counter example, several counterexamples for this. So the question is, under which conditions can we expect a good integral pairing homology theory that is also good for Oakman singular varieties. Good for Augment singular varieties. Maybe first we should understand what do we mean by a good P-common G theory. So what we want of it is that the common G groups are finitely generated over WK for all K varieties. Then of course we would like to have comparison theorems with existing homology theories. Comology theories. So when X is smooth and proper or log smooth and proper, we would like to have a comparison theorem with log crystalline or crystalline cohomology. And we would like to have a rational comparison theorem with rigid cohomology. So now I would like to introduce our construction and for this there are some useful notions. Are some useful notions that we use extensively? So, first, we have geometric pairs. This means we have an open immersion of k varieties where the outer variety is proper. And I denote this category by k U. Then nicer ones, normal crossing pairs. crossing pairs. This means that the boundary is a simple normal crossing divisor. Then of course we have natural definitions of morphisms of geometric pairs and this gives also the definition of morphism of normal crossing pairs. So we can think about normal crossing pairs towards geometric pairs as the same as As the same as the same concept as smooth varieties are to general varieties. As I said, we have very strong conditions concerning resolution of singularities. So, first, we need strong resolutions of singularities. I denote this by SR and I will use this notation throughout my talk. Probably you all know the hypothesis. This basically means that by a proper birational morphism, we can make all varieties smooth such that it is an isomorphism on the smooth locus. And secondly, for a proper birational morphism between smooth varieties, we have a sequence of blow-ups along smooth centers. Blow-ups along smooth centers which factor through f. Now we would like to have something similar for the pairs that I introduced before. So for the geometric pairs, we want to make geometric pairs into normal crossing pairs, for example. And this is the hypothesis of embedded resolutions of singularities. So it's basically the same as above, just that for we can make a geometric pair by a proper parational. Geometric pair by a proper parational morphism into a normal crossing pair. It's not reasonable to have to expect a similar condition for the morphisms, but instead what we use is weak factorization. So this means that for every proper birational strict proper proper birational morph strict proper birational morphism between non-crossing pairs there exists a weak factorization basically this means that we can factor it in such a way that either the morphism or its inverse is a smooth blow-up and the last condition that we need is called a better resolution with boundaries this Solution with boundaries. This concerns closed immersions of geometric pairs. So, here we have this is a little bit subtle. So, here for such a morphism, a strict closed immersion of geometric pairs where the target is already a normal crossing pair, but not necessarily the source, we want to be able to make also the source into a normal crossing pair. So, we encode this by saying that there exists such a community. saying that there exists such a commutative diagram such that the new pairs x prime bar and yy prime bar are both null crossing pairs okay so now we can basically start with our constructions and i will um so the first thing that we are concerned with is um if we take such a geometric pair we first look Geometric pair, we first look just at the inner part. So, the first thing is we want to make just take a variety and make it smooth. And we encode this by using certain topologies, namely in our case, the topology generated by blow-ups. And this is called the CDP topology. CDP means completely decomposed proper morphism. And indeed, Suslin and Wawatski proved that the CDGP topology on K varieties is generated by blow-ups. Now, of course, it's natural to also work with Tsadiski locally. So we take the topology that is generated by the CDP topology and by the Tsadiski topology. This is called the RHD. This is called the RH topology. Okay, so now we just worked for, at the moment, we just worked on K varieties, but we want to restrict these topologies to smooth K varieties. Yes, those will be very useful. So you can just You can just restrict it and recall it the same. So, we have also the CDP topology and the RH topology on smooth k varieties. And what we now showed is that for any topology that is finer than a CDP topology, the inclusion of smooth k varieties into k varieties induces an equivalence of topoi. The proof is not very difficult, but it uses a strong resolution. It uses a strong resolution of singularities. Okay, and then once we have this, it's relatively easy to show that also the CDP topology on smooth K varies is generated by smooth blow-ups. Now we really have on K varieties and on smooth K varieties the topologies we want. The topologies we want to have. However, since we not only want to work with varieties, but also with geometric and normal crossing pairs, we have to improve our topology a little bit. So this is the next step of our construction. And here we use three of the four conditions, namely strong resolutions that we already used before, embedded resolutions and embedded resolutions with. And embedded resolutions with boundaries. So, what we want to do now is we want to take a smooth K variety and we want to embed it into a normal crossing pair. And we also want to do something similar with C D P morphisms of smooth K varieties. And how we do this? I will explain how we can do this. So, the first statement is not very. The first statement is not very difficult to show because we have such strong conditions on embedded resolutions. This is crucial here. So the statement is that for every smooth k-variety, we can find a strict simple normal crossing compactification. So we can find an associated normal crossing pair. Now I want to take the category of all. To take the category of all such embeddings, all normal crossing pairs for X. I renote this like that. And we know already that it's non-empty. And by standard methods, we can show that it's also filtered. So now we want to do something similar with the morphisms. So what we do is So, what we do is we embed blow-ups into blow-ups of pairs. So, we introduce this notion of a good smooth blow-up. In smooth K varieties, we start with a smooth blow-up and we call it good if it can be embedded in such a way that for the outer morphisms, this is a blow-up is sent. This is a blow-up with center z-bar. So, this is just the definition, it doesn't say anything yet about the existence. However, we can show that if we assume strong resolutions, embedded resolutions, and embedded resolutions with boundary, every smooth blow-up square is a good blow-up square. So, in the proof, you can see where we used You can see where we use this additional condition of embedded resolution with boundary. So, what we do first is we take a normal crossing compactification of the X and we take Z1 bar as the closure of Z that is the center of the blow-up and X1 bar. So now we have basically the slower more fill. Basically, this lower morphism here. However, this set one bar is not necessarily a normal crossing pair, but with this condition of embedded resolutions with boundary, we can make this into a normal crossing pair, basically. And now we can just take the blow-up along the Z-bar. Take the blow up along the Z bar and we are done. Okay. So before I said it would be nice if you can also use the Tselsky topology. So we have a similar notion also for the Tselerski topology using such squares. We start, we also want good smooth Tselerski squares and here it's a little bit it's not as straightforward. It's not as straightforward to define what a good smooth telescope square is. So we start with some smooth telescopi square and we say it is good if it embeds into one of the following. So here you see the first one, the compactification for all elements in the square is the same, but we also have such degenerated squares where two parts are empty. Empty. Okay, so as before, we also would like to make every smooth status key square into a good one, but this is not possible in general. However, it's possible CDP locally. And for our purposes, it's good enough because we can always work CDP locally if first we work, since we work in the CDP topology. So for this, we need the conditions of strong resolutions and embedded resolutions. We start with a telescope square of K-bar IPs. And the statement here is that there exists a CDP hypercovering such that the pullback is a good simple Schultz key square. Okay. Okay. So now that we have these topological notions, we can start with our construction. And first, I will explain how to do the construction of our commodity theory for smooth and open varieties. And afterwards, I will explain how to generalize it to all varieties. So now we need all four. So now we need all four of our hypotheses. And also we will use log structures. So if I just write K, I mean the variety spec K with the trivial log structure, and the same for W n K and for W K. We also consider the geometric and normal crossing pairs as log schemes, namely Namely, as the log scheme X bar with the log structure induced by the divisor, which is the boundary. So we have, in the case of smooth varieties, in particular smooth proper varieties and normal crossing varieties, we do have constructions. Namely, we can use either we can use crystalline homology, which can also be computed by the Durham. Can also be computed by the Durham complex or log crystalline homology, which can be computed by the Log-Durambut complex. And what we want to do now is at first we take a complex that computes, an explicit complex that computes Loch crystalline homology. So we start with the normal crossing pair and we denote by A and by A n. By an by A n, an explicit complex which is functorial in this normal in normal crossing pairs and which represents crystalline homology. This can, for example, be accomplished by using Woodmore resolution. So the first statement where we really use weak factorization is that all these complexes for different choices of compactification. Of compactifications for a fixed smooth variety are quasi-isomorphic. I just give a quick sketch of the proof. So we know already that the normal crossing pairs for X, this category is filtered. So we only need to show that for a strict propomorphism between normal crossing pairs, Between normal crossing pairs, the induced morphism is a quasi-isomorphism. Now we use weak factorization, so we may reduce to the case that we have a blow-up with smooth center. And after that, we can work TZKI locally since crystalline comology satisfies Tadisky descent. And then we can really do explicit computation. Really, you do explicit computations. These are not very nice to do, so I will spare you, but basically, it's just computations. Okay, now that we know that all these complexes are quasi-isomorphic, to obtain a canonical complex, we take the limit over all normal crossing pairs over X. So, this is our definition. Here, of course, we need Here, of course, we need all the conditions, the hypothesis that we used so far. So we define our complex an and then by taking the derived limit, we can also define just the complex A. Okay, now for this, we first want to prove some descent conditions. Um, descent conditions. Ah, no, first we have to prove that this is a good definition in the sense that it's functorial in X. It's a nice proof to show this. It's not very difficult and uses only standard methods. So, what we do is if we have such a morphism between smooth k varieties, being smooth k-varieties we take the category of all embeddings of these morphisms similarly to before we can to before we can show that it's non-empty and filtered and then we have projections into the normal crossing pairs over x and the normal crossing pairs over y and in particular the second morphism The second morphism, the second projection P2 is search active. This plays an important role. So now every such lift, every such embedding F bar of F induces a natural morphism. And now we can write down a zigzag like this by taking limits everywhere. And because the second projection is surjective, The second projection is surjective. The first left pointing arrow is a quasi-isomorphism. And then we are basically done. Okay, so we have a very nice definition so far. Now we want to see some descent conditions. And to do this, we first we may regard our complex as the complex of pre-sheaves on smooth k varieties. Smooth clay varieties. And since we have introduced this CDP and RH topology, we can shifify it. So we have, we define the following sheaves. We first shifify with respect to the CDP topology and also with respect to the RH topology. So now we have natural morphisms between Fils between our AN than the CDP GPID version and the RH GP5 version. And the next statement says that under these four conditions, so here again we need all four conditions, all four hypothesis, these natural morphisms are quasi-isomorphisms. So for the proof, we So for the proof, we use work of Cortinius, Hesme, Schlichting and Weibel, where they show that it suffices to prove that this complex AM satisfies the Mayabia tools property. Basically, we first show that the first morphism is a quasi-isomorphism, and after that, we take care of the second morphism. So basically the Maya-Wier-Toulis property means that we take a smooth block square and we have to show that the end used diagram for complexes is homotopic co-cartesian. To show this, we can take a good compactification since we showed that all smooth glob squares under the conditions that I mentioned are good smooth global squares. And after that, we work telescope locally and make really explicit computations. So this takes care of the first quasi-isomorphism. And for the second quasi-isomorphism, the proof is similar, just that we now work CDP locally, which is okay, since we already showed that the first morphism is a quasi-isomorphism. Sacrasia isomorphism. Okay, now I think we are ready to generalize the definition to all k varieties. So in this part, we again meet all four of our hypotheses. And what we do is we use this equivalence of topoi that we showed at the beginning to To extend the construction to all k varieties. And all what we do is we say that this equivalence of topoi means that the sheaves that we defined before in the CDP and the RH topology define also complexes of sheaves on k-varieties. Okay. As before, we have a similar descent result, at least between the CDP GIFID version and the RHIFID version. And to show this, we just use the previous result. So what we do is we choose a CDP hypercovering by By smooth k-varieties. So we obtain basically the quasi-isom, the vertical quasi-isomorphisms here and here. It doesn't matter that for the one we have the CDP and for the other one we have the RH topology. It's sufficient that we just use a CDP hypercovering. Now, for each of the elements here, the xi, we already have seen before that since they are smooth, we have seen that this is a quasi-isomorphism and therefore the bottom vertical, the bottom horizontal map is also a quasi-isomorphism. And this shows that the upper horizontal map is a quasi-isomorphism. Horizontal map is a quasi-isomorphism. Okay, this finishes the construction and we have some very nice properties of our commology theory. So we have comparison, a comparison theorem for normal crossing pairs with crystalline homology, block crystalline. block crystalline homology. So if x is equal to x bar, this is just the usual crystalline homology. And if x is not equal to x bar, this is the log crystalline cohomology. Next, we can show that the cohomology groups that we constructed are finitely generated. We also have vanishing of Of the common algebra groups for smaller than zero and bigger than the dimension of the variety, we have a canonical class isomorphism, a rational one between rigid cohomology and our cohy theory. And then we have certain very nice properties that one expects of a good comology theory, such as the Multi-theory, such as the Kunet formula, and therefore also homotopy invariance. And we also constructed chang classes, which are compatible with crystalline and rigid chain classes. Okay, are there questions so far? Okay. So you've seen that we used So you have seen that we used very strong conditions on resolutions of singularities. So of course the question is what can we do if we don't assume all of this. The first thing that comes to mind is to use alterations instead of resolutions. So by the Young's alteration theorem, we can also make K varieties into smooth varieties and we can Into smooth varieties, and we can even make geometric pairs into normal crossing pairs. The problem is that there's a real problem in positive characteristic is that we have to allow finite extensions. You will see in a moment why this can be a problem. But just if you think in the same terms as we did before, we want it again. Did before we want it want again to consider the topology that is generated by alterations, and this is the proper topology. So, this is the direct analogon to the construction before. So, basically, what we do is what one does is one takes the Nagata compactification, so one gets a geometric pair. And then, when Nakachima showed that one can obtain a split property, That one can obtain a split proper hypercovering of this geometric pair by a normal crossing pair. And he also showed that rationally we can compare the hyperchomology of this simplest normal crossing pair of crystalline chromology to rigid chromology. So this is very promising. But really, we are interested in just We are interested in just in the non-rational version, in the interval version. So, the question is: Is this common theory that one obtains independent of the choice of the hypercovering? The first thing that one realizes is that in general, this is not the case, and it's relatively easy to give a counterexample by using something that is not generically etal. Not generically et hal. So one has to work, for example, with Frobenius to obtain such an example. And this is a very easy example that I give here. We start with an elliptic curve. So this is a non-logarithmic example where x bar is equal to x. And we take the absolute Frobenius x. And we take the associated And we take the associated check hypercover to this Frobenius and take the reduced version. And in that case, each of the xi equal to x. So now we obtain a split proper hypercovering, which satisfies all the conditions that we wanted before, but now we can. But now we can make small computations. We can take the induced map first by this proper hypercovering, and then the second one, oh, here's the typo, there should be the cohomology theory. So the second map is the edge map, which comes from the spectral sequence. Now we can show that, so the composition of this just gives the morphism. Just gives the morphism that is induced by the absolute Frobenius. And now one can just look at the fact that H1 has non-trivial slope part, that F star cannot be an isomorphism. And therefore, this pi can also be not an I is also not an isomorphism. So this gives a relatively simple counterexample. So what one has to do is one So what one has to do is one has to restrict to generically etal hypercoverings. But this up theory is not a problem because we still have Dean's theorem. And for example, for low homological degrees, we can use this method to construct a homology theory, an integral cohomology theory, which is In integral cohomology theory, which is independent of the choice of hypercovering. So, for H0, this is well known. And for so, the second one should be H1. The independence was shown by Andrieta Bardielegiale for P greater or equal to 3, and then by Atsushi Xiu, Johannes Plan, and myself for P greater or equal than 2. So we just Than two. So we just slightly generalized their proof. However, for higher homological degrees, this is not true. And in fact, we can give some counterexamples for H2 and then from that it's relatively easy to construct counterexamples for higher commodity degrees. So let me just give the example for H2. The example of 4H2. What one does is one works with a ramified cover. So we start relatively simple with X bar is just P1 and we let X be the coordinate of A1 and P1. Now for some integer Integer R, we take elements in our field K, which are distinct, and we let N1 to NR be natural numbers, which are prime to P. So next we look at the morphism, which is induced by the following field extension of this form where we use all Yes, basically, what one does is one construct a morphism of degree P between proper smooth curves such that the associated field extension is a Gallo extension. And the Galois group is just set model P. Okay, so the next thing that one does is one looks at the ramification points, the ramification locus. And this is just by our definition given by the points that are given by the equation x equals to IA, where the AIs are the distinct elements of k that we chose before. Chose before. And now we just take away from X the ramification locus to give from X bar the ramification locus. Okay, so we have we can construct such a simpler scheme and We take away from our X bar the ramification locus, and we so we get a split proper generically ital hypercovering of this form that we wanted before. So this is exactly we don't we don't have any additional conditions and now with this hypercovering we can show this is again a relatively This is again a relatively complicated computation that the associated induced morphism on homology groups is not an isomorphism. So this gives a counterexample for H2 and for higher cohomological degrees. It's, as I said, it's relatively easy to generate from this one more counterexamples. Okay, I think I will stop here. And yeah, please let me know if there are questions. Questions for Veronica? So is your periodic convology theory gives you some kind of good notion of periodic Wi-Fi conjecture? So I think just. I think just Nakachman studied, for example, the slope filtration and the weight filtration on the rational version of what we did. And very similarly, you can also construct these filtrations, but we didn't investigate further. Okay. Thanks. Other questions? Something on Zoom or something. Something on Zoom is checking okay. Um okay, ah, well, let's thank Ronica again, and this ends the
