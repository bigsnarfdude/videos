All right. So the next one is Shengu Shao, and after him, this will be Lambert. Thank you, Aka. I'm a PhD student in England's group. And my topic today is about, in one way, is to use the deep learning model proposed by the depositional model proposed by before to model the non-stationary human dependence. Yeah, we know that modeling of stationary issuing dependence is challenging, but model the stationary isotropic model is much more easier. Model is much more easier. So, intuitively, we think about to use the deformation approach, mapping the original spatial domain onto a dating space where we can reasonably assume the station narrative and isotropic. But the problem in this deformation approach is that this vaulting function, this estimation would be computationally expensive. Computation is expensive and the transformation, like in previous work, the transformation shows to be lacking in flexibility, and in many cases, it's not guaranteed to be injective. The model proposed by Professor Demi Majin last year, the deep concentration model some issues by taking some techniques in deep learning and deep models. And here, the transformation is constructed. And here the transformation is constructed using a deep transition of a series of injected walking functions. And here we present an extension of this level of documentation to model the spatial extreme process. And here we use our interface to the latest version of TensorFlow. And here, because about the model, we simply use the boundary smash label process with the semi-variability. Here, you have the power semi-variability. Here, the range is positive. Here, the range is positive, and spoon this parameter is between zero and two. Regarding inference, yeah, we use the stupid pairwise most likely to be, and yeah, because we don't want to use 1000 years for the full likelihood. And we also try to inference with the issue coefficients by minimizing the by minimizing the square, the d square objective function using the in Using the empirical each remote coefficient. And regarding the transformation estimator, each layer FR is the in the network is parametrized by some basis function and rates. Different choices for the basis function lead to different types of warping units. And the warping units we consider in this work includes like that. So actual working unit, database function, and morphism transformation. Do some work regarding about the nonlinear mapping and local extension or contraction. And network base and variable parameters estimate jointly by minimizing the log function. We did a simple simulation study and data is simulated over a bulky domain on 101 grid and essentially born risk. With a stationary bottomistic model and fixed parameters. 2,000 locations are randomly sampled from that space and with 100 independent gravitations. And our deep model includes 12 layers. And here we carefully choose a smaller number of solution pairs to speed up, to balance the computational and statistical efficiency. Our results show. Our results show that if we use only 1% observation pairs, the whole optimization time reduced to one hour comparing to the semi-hour if we use all observation pairs. And the experience with issuing efficiency method is basically less than one hour. If we use smaller number of observation pairs, it can even speed up that. Here it shows the true obvious space and the Obvious space and the yeah, in the first row is the two obvious space and fitted boppy space, and we can basically recover that. And the second row feature shows that the fitted HTML coefficients for the reference point. Reference point is the point with the darkest color. We can talk about this more in the post section. Based on this, this is just a premium work. This is just a premium work, and based on this first step, we plan to do some extension to like further the extreme process, especially the arcade process, and the inverting max stable processes. And also, we would like to model the temporal non-stationarity and propose the method to achieve a certain assessment. Yeah, all these problems are welcome to be discussed and plus.
