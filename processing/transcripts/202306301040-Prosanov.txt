So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for providing me this opportunity to speak about my research. I thank all the audience for hopefully your interest. So, it's a huge pity that I cannot be in Ohake in person. So, I really hope that all the people there have a great time and hopefully are making productive collaborations. Okay, so I'm So, I will start from the following very basic definition, which is underlying all my talk. So, that's the notion of conmetrics on surfaces. So, for instance, a Euclidean conmetric on a surface is something which is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane, except a discrete set of points, which I'll refer as vertices, where it is locally isometric to the Euclidean pawn of angle, which may be distinct from 2π. And similarly, we can. And similarly, we can define a spherical or a hyperbolic conmetric. So, just we consider as the local models the standard two-dimensional sphere or the hyperbolic plane. And I will be saying that such a metric is convex if all conangles are smaller than 2π and concave if all conangles are greater than 2π. All right. So, that's an intrinsic way how to define it. But the way I am thinking about it, the way I suggest you to think about it. So, at least. To think about it. So, a Euclidean codometric is something glued out of polygons. Of Euclidean polygons, so the best thing is, of course, the simplest polygon is a triangle. So, I will draw some silly picture. So, like, you have plenty of Euclidean triangles. So, Roman, we don't see any pictures. You don't see my whiteboard? Yes, sorry, just. Yes, sorry, just a second. Let me do. Do you see now? Yes. That's great. Okay, so you have a bunch of Euclidean triangles, and you just identify edges of equal size, and you are getting some surface outroby. I'll probably something like this. Okay. So any such surface can be represented like this. And the point is that when you glue two triangles together, yeah, then on the edge of gluing. So like those triangles are not assumed to be embedded anywhere. So there's just an abstract blue. And intrinsically, metrically, there is no singularity around edge point. So, at edge points of gluing. But when you glue several triangles together, so around the vertex, there might be an angle distant from 2π. Okay, so that's the whole idea how to think about this. So, any, do you see my slides again? Yes. Okay. So, any such metric can be represented this way, but I just But I just would like to let you know that normally a generic metric on a compact surface has infinitely many geodetic triangulations. So there are infinitely many ways how to represent it. And the question about which triangulation is canonical, which way is canonical, yes, so like it's a special matter. So this definition was designed in order to describe the intrinsic geometry of polyhedral surfaces. So polyhedral surfaces. Pahlahedral surfaces. So, Parahedral surfaces in models, three-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. So, Euclidean three-dimensional space, hyperbolic three-dimensional space, and the standard three-dimensional sphere. And so the model result, the model result is the following theorem of Alexander, who used this notion to describe the intrinsic geometry of the boundaries of convex polyhedra, of convex polyhedra in model three-dimensional spaces. So, if you think about Uh, if you think about it, then it's quite easy to figure out that the induced metric on the boundary of any polyhedron is a convex Euclidean quantum metric. And Alexander proved that every convex Euclidean quadrimetric on the two-dimensional sphere can be realized on the boundary of a convex polyhedron. This convex polyhedron is unique up to isometry, and it might be degenerated to a polygon. So, like if you take a polygon, if you take two corpus of the same polygon and glue them along the boundary, you will also obtain such thing, but that's the only degeneration. But that's the only degeneration that can occur. Okay, and Alexander proved just similar things for three-dimensional sphere and three-dimensional hyperbolic space. Okay, a very curious thing that Alexander's proof is completely non-constructive. So like, and those all are discrete objects. And you can define your metric as a gluing of triangles. And then you should find some realization. But so it's a very complicated problem actually how to do it algorithmically. Probably actually how to do it algorithmically. So it was more or less fully resolved only relatively recently. And so I would like to mention that when you find such a realization, the phase structure, the phase structure of your prehedron may have nothing to do with your initial triangulation. Yeah, maybe because generically, there are infinitely many triangulations to represent a given method. All right. So this is a counterpart of a fundamental result from. Of fundamental results from differential geometry. This is what is called the whale problem. Nowadays, it's a theorem. It's a theorem proven in collective efforts of many people. So I put here some main contributors, but this list is not exhaustive. So this theorem states that every smooth Riemannian metric on the two-dimensional sphere of positive curvature can be realized on the boundary of a smooth, strictly convex body in three-dimensional Euclidean space, which is unique. Space which is unique up to isometry. Okay, and similar statements hold in three-dimensional standard sphere or in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. So in this list of contributors, they can be divided into parts. So Wei, Levy, Niederberg, Canfosen, and Herglots, they were mainly using analytical tools. And among them, Canfosen and Herglots were only proving the rigidity part, and Wei, Levi, and Niren were. Part and way lay near and where they were dealing with the realization part. And they were using analytical tools. On the other side, a completely different proof was provided by Alexandrov and Pagaryov as an outcome of their general theory of metric geometry of general convex surfaces in model three-dimensional spaces. So they found nice ways, nice totally different way how to resolve this problem. Way how to resolve this problem. So that's a very parallel result to the polyhedral, to the Alexandrov result on the Alexandrov theorem on Polyhedra. And there exists a common generalization. There exists a common generalization obtained in the works of Alexandrov and Pagareov, but this time I won't be speaking about it. But it's also a very interesting story. Okay, so that's the first source of my motivation. So now So now I'm basing to the second source. So it's hyperbolic three manifolds. So as you might know, in the 70s, Charleston completely revolutionized the field of three-dimensional topology by introducing his geometrization program, which was very unexpected back then. So, like that, any three-dimensional compact manifold can be canonically cut into pieces. Those pieces can be indoved with one of eight. With one of eight homogeneous torsed geometries. And then, like any topological question, it anyway becomes much simpler when you have to work with geometric manifolds rather than with just manifolds. So, all topologists had to learn a lot of geometry. All geometers were just having their fun. So, Thurston himself proved many results, many results supporting his geometrization program. And I would say that his Would say that his main results, so the main result from his heritage that he proved is that hyperbolic three manifolds are awesome. So that's a very interesting class to study. So it's very fun. Anybody can have fun with them. So during this talk, I will hopefully tell you a little bit how I'm having fun with hyperbolic three manifolds. So the whole point is that among charged geometries, Jordan geometries, manifolds that are indoor with seven other geometries were relatively easy to classify. I mean, that was a hard and long and complicated work, but people did it relatively fast. But hyperbolic stream manifolds are in a way impossible to classify because generic stream manifold is hyperbolic. Okay, so in the scope of my talk, the most important feature, the most important feature of hyperbolic stream manifolds is their rigidity. Is their rigidity. So, this is what is called most of rigidity, which holds also in higher dimension, but most of the rigidity is optohematopic equivalence, which is so a supple thing, a supple thing, and its own. But luckily, in dimension three, it was promoted by Gabay Mirkov-Jorstan to the following statement that if you have a closed hyperbolic three-manifold, and you are asking yourself, okay, but how many essentially different hyperbolic metrics can I put on it? The answer is one. The answer is one. So, so, so, like, those only thing you can do is just change it. The only thing you can do is just change it by Zotopus. Yeah. And by the way, it's a different Jorston. So this Jordan is a son of William Johnston. So that's Nathaniel Jerston. All right. So that's the starting point. So one can describe it as for closed hyperbolic three manifolds, their topology is determining the geometry. So which is a very curious feature. So like from the beginning, there are no signs that it really should be happening. It really should be happening in this way, okay? And so, from now on, until the end of my talk, I will switch to the following class: to compact three manifolds with non-empty boundaries. So, oriented, and with additional assumptions that all boundary components have higher genius. So, I exclude spherical and toroidal boundary components. Yeah, but so, like, that's an important technical exclusion. Yeah, but so. Technical exclusion, yeah, but so it does not reduce much the class, the class with which we are working. Okay, so I will be saying, so I will be considering a hyperbolizable such manifold. So, what is hyperbolizable in this case? So, by hyperbolizable, I mean that there exists a hyperbolic metric on the interior which extends to the boundary, which extends to the boundary so that boundary can be convex. So, various hyperbolic metrics may extend in different. Hyperbolic metrics may extend in different ways to boundary, so that it admits at least one hyperbolic metric with convex boundary. Okay, but there are various equivalent ways how to put it. So particularly, Thurston showed that there is a simple topological condition which is equivalent to being hyperbolizable for this class. So a complex three-dimensional manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of surfaces of System of surfaces of hydrogen A is hypervaluizable if and only if it's irreducible and a toroidal. So, so I'm not going to say what are those conditions, but those are fairly easy topological conditions, which also kind of show that a generic compact manifold like this is hyperbolizable. So it's a very large class. And maybe you want some exact examples to think about it. So, like the examples I myself always thinking about. So is Always thinking about so is a bundle over a surface an interval bundle over surface so something like this so it's something homeomorphic just to S times segment or a handle body. Or a handle body. So a handle body, if you consider a standard ambiguity of surface of higher genus in three-dimensional space, so it bounces a handle body. So this handle body. So like there are some meridians. Okay, so important difference between them that for the first, the boundary is incompressible. So the inclusion of boundary in manifolds induces Of boundary in manifolds induces injection of fundamental groups, while in the second example, there are many loops that can be compressed inside the manifold. Yeah, and so there is a very big difference between them. So normally all results about this class of manifolds are first proven for incompressible boundaries and then so like it's another struggle to extend them for compressible boundaries. Okay. So So, the point is that even when you are interested only in closed three-dimensional manifolds and low-dimensional topology, a lot of things are done just by cutting and pasting technique. So, even if you are interested only in closed manifolds, you anyway have to deal also with compact manifolds with bug. And you can state and you can attempt to solve many interesting. Attempt to solve many interesting geometric problems in this class. So, for instance, people were interested in trying to prove the wheel problem for this class. So, you fix a manifold and you are asking, okay, if you are prescribing some metric on the boundary, some metric on the boundary of curvature greater than minus one cannot be realized by a hyperbolic metric on the manifold itself. So, when I will be speaking about metric on the main on the manifold itself, I will be sometimes saying ambient metric. Saying ambient metric. Ambient metric is some hyperbolic metric in the interior which extends to boundary for me. Okay, and in the boundary, it induces a boundary metric. So when the boundary is smooth, the curvature is at least minus one. And so the question was if any such metric can be realized by some ambient hyperbolic metric on the manifold itself. This result was proven by François Lobury, and the rigidity part was shown almost 15 years ago by Jean-Marc Schlander. So he proved. So he proved that such a metric is unique by up to the top. So the geometry of such manifold is dictated by its topology and by boundary geometry. So in model spaces of constant curvature, such results go along with polyhedral results, and polyhedral results are normally easier to prove and to understand. And here also you can define what is polyhedral boundary. I will do it in a while. Polyhedral boundary. I will do it in a while. But curiously enough, polyhedral, so there were no polyhedral counterparts, no polyhedral counterparts to those statements. And the point of my work is to bridge this gap. So the point is that when you start to consider, so what should be induced metric on the polyhedral boundary, so the induced metric is convex hyperbolic on metric, something which should be intrinsically. Metric, something which should be intrinsically polyhedral. But they maybe might be realized also in a way which is not exactly polyhedral, which is not exactly polyhedral. And something like this does not happen in trivial topology. So it does not happen in model spaces of constant curvature, but it may happen when you have no trivial topology. So and another thing that the techniques of Loborie and of Schlenker were very smooth. So they were. They were very smooth. So they were very specific to smooth situations. So I spent a really long time on trying to adapt those techniques to polyhedral boundaries, but actually I could not. So I had to find another way around in the end. So far, the only known polyhedral result was proven by François Ephelester, who proved a polyhedral version in this topologically toy case of interval bundle over surface, but also with additional geometric condition that there exists an isometric evolution switching the boundary component. Switching the boundary components. So, this condition is a metric evolution, so it's quite rare. So, it's definitely not generic, but so it exists. And when you have such a manifold, then there exists an embedded geodesic surface. An embedded geodesic surface in it. And so, your manifold exhibit wire product geometry, and it's much easier to operate. And it's much easier to operate them. So, this geodesic surface provides a very convenient system of coordinates. So, Francois Philaster proved the polyhedral version in this case, but so everything else so far was quite open. Okay, so now I will speak about another source of my motivation and also a source of difficulties. Also, a source of difficulties. So, I will try to explain how some difficulties arise here. So, but to this purpose, Arise here. So, but to this purpose, I need to introduce what is called convex hyperbolic manifolds. So, that's a very important class. First of all, I will be saying that a subset of hyperbolic manifold, or not necessarily of a hyperbolic manifold, but any manifold with a fine connection where you can define geodesics, is totally convex if this subset contains every geodesic segment between any two points. So, particularly, if you pick just a point in manifold with non-trivial topology, then point is not. Fault with non-trivial apologies, then the point is not totally connected because normally there are plenty of geodesic loops from this point from this point by itself. And if you consider the totally connected scale of a point, then it will be something much bigger than a point. Yeah. So any totally convex subset, it already contains all the topology. So it already contains all the topology of the manifold. And so if you consider a closed hyperbolic three manifold, then there is no non-trivial. Then there is no non-trivial totally convex subset, no non-trivial closed totally convex subset, it's only the manifold itself. But it's a very important tool in studying open hyperbolic manifolds. So I quickly recall what are open manifolds. Open manifolds are those that are connected, that do not have boundary and that are non-compact. Okay, and such a manifold is called convex compact if it is complete and if it contains a compact totally convex set. So you may ask, So, you may ask, okay, but who starts to study open manifolds? So, when you are studying open manifolds, basically everything is possible. So, it's very hard to deal with them. So, people normally do not study open manifolds by themselves. So, like these days, people actively study surfaces of infinite type. Yeah, but that's an exception. But people rarely come to open manifolds by themselves. But sometimes they just appear. Sometimes they just appear in some situations. So, like convex compact. Like convex compact hyperbolic C-manifolds, they appear so at least in two types of events. First, they are heavily connected with compact hyperbolic C-manifolds with this convex boundary. So, whenever you have a compact hyperbolic C-manifold with convex boundary, you can always extend it to a compact manifold in a canonical way. So, like basically, it happens that you are gluing tubes, you are gluing. You are gluing tubes. You are gluing tubes to every boundary component, to every boundary component. That's like an expanding tube. Okay, and you obtain a complex hyperbolic three-manifold. Another thing is in study of Klanian groups. So Kleinian groups are discrete subgroups of the isometry group of hyperbolic three-dimensional space. And those are very funny objects. So people are studying Klanian groups since late 19th century. They are very interested. There are many things happening. But there are still many open questions about that. So, when you have a Kleinian group without torsion, when you take a quotient, a quotient of hyperbolic space, you obtain a complete hyperbolic three-manifold. So, in some cases, this manifold is closed, then you're playing on group as cold lattice, but in some cases, it is open. In some cases, it is open and generically. Open and generically, when it is open, it is convexompact. So, convexompact are generic things that appear in this situation. Yeah, and people were studying Planian groups since late 19th century, but they were studying them mainly from the perspective of complex analysis. So, because they also appear as discrete subgroups of the group of Merbius transformations, because the group of Merbius transformations, it coincides with the isometric group of the hydrobolic 3 space. But actually, it was more or less only Jorsten. So, before him, More or less only Chorston. So, before him was Martin, yeah, but it was only Chorsten who completely renovated the study of Klanian groups by attracting also the attention to the corresponding hyperbolic three manifolds. Okay, and a very important thing, a very important thing about convex compact manifolds is the convex score. So, the convex score of a hyperbolic stream manifold is the intersection of all closed totally convex subsets of it. So, it's an inclusion minimal closed topically convex. Minimal close to teleconference upset. So the point from this definition, it's not even clear that it is well defined, but it is. And it contains all the topological complexity, all the topological and geometric complexity of the manifold. So the geometry of such a manifold is well understood outside of the convex core. There are canonical falliations by surfaces of constant. By surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature, by surfaces of constant mean curvature. So there are many things. So all the complexity is contained kind of in the convex score. And Thurston observed a funny thing that the induced pass metric, that if you consider the convex core and consider the induced pass metric, then it is intrinsically hyperbolic in the sense that it's a surface. And so locally, the surface is the metric to hyperbolic plate. So it's a honest hyperbolic surface. So its intrinsic geometry is smooth, but it is embedded in the manifold in a very crumpled way, in a very crumpled way. So that it's quite hard to deal with it. So particularly, it could be bent along what is called the Ben denomination, and this band denomination may be irrational. So a rational band denomination would be just a set of finitely many close geodesics over here. So, such a surface may be bent along those geodesics here under some exterior angles. So, I'm trying to draw angles here, but probably it does not work well. Okay, but it may be bent along an irrational bending elimination. So, that's a set of uncountably many open geodesics, which are non-intersecting. So, they are non-intersecting and the surface is compact. So, they are winding around each other. Is complex, so they are winging around each other in a very fractal manner, and so it's quite hard to understand what's going on. So, the whole point is that when you consider what should be intrinsically polyhedral metrics and consider they are convex ambedins, some things like this may happen, some things like this may happen in non-trivial topology. They may be bent in a very complicated manner. So, in a very complicated manner, I spent quite a long time actually on learning how to draw this. So, like, there are ways how to. So, like, there are ways how to visualize it, and that's very fun. Yeah, I spent a lot of time on learning it, yeah, and I wanted to draw something, but my estimates show me that then I won't have enough time to finish. So, like, in an unlikely situation, if I finish ahead of time, then I can try to draw this to you how it's happening. Okay, so, but as I told you, convex compact hyperbolics remaining. Conflicts compact hyperbolics remaining falls, they are generic. In the setting, they are generic. So, if you consider a Kleinian group and consider its deformation space, so all isomorphic Kleinian groups up to conjugation, then convex compact things constitute the interior of the corresponding modulus space. So, if you are studying things like this, then the first thing that you do, you are trying to parametrize the interior. And it was a long string of works of plenty of people who learned how to parametrize this. Who learned how to parametrize this by conformal structure at infinity? So, what it is. So, you have a convex compact manifold like this. And wait. You have conformal boundary somewhere here. You have a conformal boundary. So, that's a natural way how to compactify it. Yeah, and so that's the predecessor of Gromov's boundary or of Gromov's boundary on spaces of non-positive curvature. So like that's the first instance when people were dealing with it. So there is a way to conformally compactify it. So this boundary, it does not inherit a metric. So like metric does not extend there because metric is complete inside the manifold, but there is an Manifold, but there is a natural conformal structure. There is a natural conformal structure, and so in a long stream of efforts, people prove that every conformal structure can be realized and in a unique way. But the whole point is that this result belongs to the domain of complex analysis. And if you know something about boundary at infinity, it doesn't say you much about what's happening in the manifold itself. So, like, that's Cell. So, like, that's a very big direction of research when people try to relate the boundary at infinity to what happens inside the manifold. But also, some people are just not satisfied with this parametrization. So that was Jorsen, for instance. And Jorsen suggested another way to parametrize it. He told, okay, so I observed that the boundary of convex score is intrinsically a hyperbolic surface. But can you similarly prescribe any hyperbolic metric? And is the way you Is the way you are prescribed and unique. And there is a dual thing, there is a dual thing for this that Jorston also suggested that it can be uniquely determined by banded elimination. So like by the way, how it is bent, you may describe it as a measured lamination. So a measured lamination was also another concept of charge. Another concept of Charston, which had incredible impact. So, Charleston used it in a lot of ways. So, like measured laminations should be sought as good closure of the space of simple closed curves. So, if you consider all simple closed curves on a surface, there is a nice way how to put topology on them. And it's not the Hausdorff topology. Hausdorff topology is really bad for this. So, but there is a very nice way how to predict. A very nice way how to produce this closure, and then the objects that appear in this closure are measured terminations. Yes, so that's a very nice concept of Thurston, which then was applied for a lot of questions in the topology of surfaces. And so, for both those conjectures, the realization part is known, but the rigidity part is quite open. So, the only thing that except the realization part, Banachona Tal also proved. Also, proved the rigidity for a discrete lamination. So, when the support is discrete, then Banachon Atal have rigidity. And Banachon also proved the rigidity for what is called function locus. So, that's another small result. Okay, so now I proceed to my results. So, but in order to formulate them, first I need to introduce a few definitions. So, first of all, what is actually what I need to do is. of all uh what is actually what do i mean by palhedral boundary so i define so i have a hyperbolic metric on my compact manifold which extends to the boundary at indoes it with symmetric so i will give some definitions on what is this ambient hyperbolic metric in terms of what is the boundary what is the boundary uh so how the boundary looks like so i will say that the boundary is polyhedral if uh every boundary point so so every boundary point has a local So, every boundary point has a local model. It's locally modeled by convex polyhedral sets in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. But the point is that this notion is insufficient. So, if you want to work with polyhedral surfaces, you just have to extend this class. So, I call this extension band surfaces. So, band surface, so I will say that this ambient matrix is bent if the boundary is bent. So, then the boundary is locally convex and every boundary point except finitely. And every boundary point except finitely many belongs to the relative interior of an exterior geodesic segment, of an ambient geodesic segment. So, what does that mean? What does that mean? You might ask. So, the point is that if you consider closed band surfaces in three-dimensional model space, so in Euclidean or in hyperbolic, it's not the geometry which matters here, but the topology. So, if you consider this definition without any topology in the ambient space, then any closed-band circle. Ambient space, then any closed band surface is just a polyhedron. So it's another way how to define a polyhedron. Okay, but if we return to those banding laminations, so the boundary of convex square is an example of thing which is bent, so which is bent and not polyhedral. So if it is bent along an irrational elimination, then it is bent. It is bent with respect to that definition, but it is not polyhedral. Okay, and I need to introduce a couple. And I need to introduce a couple of technical classes, a couple of technical classes. So the first class is strictly polyhedral. So strictly polyhedral, if it is polyhedral, and the distance between the boundary and the convex core is positive. Okay, and another class is controlled polyhedral. So controllably polyhedral is polyhedral boundary, and either the boundary stays away from the convex spore or the intersection is one-dimensional. If the intersection is one-dimensional, it consists of simple positive geodesics. Simple positive disease. All right. So now I rearrange, I rearrange these notions in terms of their generality. So the notion of bent boundary is the most general among them. Then any polyhedral boundary is necessarily bent. Any controllably polyhedral boundary is necessarily polyhedral. And any strictly polyhedral boundary is necessarily controllable polyhedral. Okay, so I think that this is an awful slide because here are many definitions here and it's probably. Are many definitions here, and it's probably hard to grasp to grasp what's going on. So, if I have time, yeah, I might explain it more, but anyway, first I need to formulate the statement. Okay, so that's the result. That's the result then. The result is the following. Okay, so we fix our manifold and consider all convex hyperbolic pawn matrix on its boundary. So, what we expect to be realized as polyhedral boundary. So, I prove that every such convex hyperbolic metric. Every such convex hyperbolic metric can be realized by a band hyperbolic ambient metric, and if the realization is controllably polyhedral, then it is unique up to zotopy, it is unique up to isotopy in a strong sense among all band metrics. Okay, so how much time do I have? Like five minutes? It's about nine minutes. Oh, it's about nine minutes. Okay, that's wonderful. Okay, I will very briefly try to explain. Very briefly, try to explain. So, like, what do those classes actually mean? What do those classes actually mean, and why? So, how do they appear here? Okay, so I wanted to study first of all just polyhedral surfaces, polyhedral surfaces in hyperbolic stream manipulations. So, it's very natural when you define a polyhedral surface just to define it by means of local models. So, like that's how you do when you work with homogeneous geometries. But then, okay, you want. Okay, you want to, then you would expect that if you have a convex hyperbolic con surface, then when you have a convex realization, it is polyhedral. The point that it is not, the point that it is not, it is bent. It is bent but not polyhedral. So when you start thinking about it, you quickly realize that in order to consider isometric realizations, you need to expand. You need to expand this class to this band class. All right. So. So, I wanted to prove the realization in band class. And of course, the conjecture is that this realization is unique in band class. But the point is that it is very hard to prove, that it is very hard to prove rigidity for band class. So it is also very hard to prove rigidity in polyhedral class. So the class for which there was my hope that I can prove rigidity was strictly polyhedral. So why? So what is good in strictly polyhedral? The point is that when you are in strictly The point is that when you are in a strictly polyhedral class, then all your faces are polygons in the sense that all faces are simply connected and the edge graph is connected. But this does not happen anymore for polyhedral boundaries. So for polyhedral boundaries, the point is that something like this might be a phase. Okay. So I picture some double crown. So like arcs here are geodesic segments and hyperbolic geometry. Yes. So like here I use not clearing model. Yeah, but like in order to depict also like segments and hyperbolic geometry like this. Okay, so that's a surface with piecewise geodesic boundary. Piecewise geodesic boundary, a hyperbolic surface with piecewise geodesic boundary, which is not simply connected. So, like the paradigm, the paradigm in when you are working with polyhedron, when you are working with polyhedron in simply connected spaces, the paradigm that when you have a polyhedron, yeah, and you vary it slightly. So you just move it slightly. For instance, you move vertices a bit. If you move vertices small enough, then there are only finitely many ways how your combinatorics can change. Your combinatorics can change because if you move vertices small enough, then all your edges may still stay edges, and only new edges that can appear can appear from faces that are not triangles, right? And there are only finitely many of them if you are working with compact surfaces. But when you have a face like this, a face which is not simply connected, then it can change its combinatorics. There are infinitely many ways how it can change its combinatorics. And it's very hard to deal with it then. Very hard to deal with it, then. So, so, like, you do something, you vary something, it's very complicated. So, I wanted to prove striggity in the class of strictly polyhedral, and I have a plan for this, but it did not work. So, it did not work. Some things just did not patch together. So, I came to an understanding that I actually have to work in the class of controllable polyhedral things in order to implement my plan. But the point is that in the controllable perihedral class, In control, perihedal class, you already have non-simply connected surfaces, and so infinitely many ways how kaminotorics can change if you just move slightly, if you do something slightly. And that's awful. So that's really awful. That's very hard to work with. Yes. So like I got stuck on this for a year. So for a year, if somebody in the department was asking me, oh, okay, but how are your perihedral boundaries? I was just producing strange sounds. So it didn't work. Okay, but then. But then I eventually got it. So I eventually got, yeah, I was just one cycling and I had a vision. I really had a vision. So how to patch it together. I did patch together incredibly beautifully. So yeah, it turned out to a wonderful proof, which I unfortunately do not really have time to explain. So, but I really liked it. So even if I have to quit mathematics, at least I had my fun. Also, at least I had my fun because this is just wonderful. Okay, so there is another result. There is another result which explains that actually the class of bent ambient metrics, it is sufficient. So it's necessary. It's necessary to consider it, but it's also sufficient. So I can prove that every convex realization of a convex hyperbolic metric is band. So it belongs to this class. The whole point is that, so, what's the quantity of this result? So, what's the content of this result? So, it's probably hard to understand what's the content. So, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, if you have a convex body with a general boundary, which may be neither polyhedral nor smooth, then anyway, it's rigid with respect to its metric. That's a result of Pagariel. That's a very strong result of Pagariel. And so, if you have a general convex body, but somehow you know that your intrinsic metric is polyhedral, intrinsic induced metric is polyhedral, then the It's polyhedral. Then the combination of results of Alexandrov and Pagareov imply that this convex body is a polyhedron, right? But the point is that this result was proven before, before Pagaryov proved his complicated general rigidity. This result was proven before. It was a result of Alaganishnikov, another student of Alexander. And this second theorem is an analog, is an analog of Alexander's result in this case, that like any convex surface which is intrinsically, intrinsically convex hyperbolic conmatrix or like intrinsically polyhedral. So, like intrinsically Palehidro, it is necessarily banned. So, like band class is exactly the right class here to work with. Okay. And I want to say that the rigidity result here is generic. It is generic because of what? So, actually, that's the point of my struggles, why I could not prove my result for strictly polyhedral metrics, but had to turn to controllable polyhedral. So, the point is that I expect. I expected that strictly Palihidroizations are generic, but unfortunately they are not, or at least I cannot prove it. So, why control Palihidro are generic? So, I say that a hyperbolic one metric, so on the boundary, is called balanced if the set of vertices is sufficiently dense. And so, it's very easy to show then from this definition that the set of balanced metric is open and dense among all hyperbolic one metrics equipped with the Lipschitz topology. The Leech topology. So, and I can show that a band realization of every convex-balanced conmetric is controllable polyhedral. So, altogether, this means that this rigidity result is really generic. Okay, so yeah, and a funny thing that from the techniques of my proof, some rigidity results for convex-compact hyperbolic matrix also fall. Yeah, and so that's very nice because many people were concerned with this. So, many people were concerned. So, many people were concerned about convex complex hyperbolic manifolds and their convex cores. So, I can show that there exists a huge open subset, a huge open subset in the modulus space of convex-compact hyperbolic metrics. This open subset contains all metrics with polyhedral convex core, and those metrics are globally rigid with respect to the boundary metric of the convex score, and are infinitesimally rigid with respect to the band denomination. So, infinitesimally rigid means that. Infinitesimally rigid means that the realization map has so its differential is an isomorphism. So, like with the second thing, it's much harder to promote it to local rigidity and then to global because the space of band denominations, it doesn't have smooth structure. Yeah, so like, okay, just in the remaining minutes. So, what is the profile? The proofline is called continued man. Proofline. The proofline is called continued to method. So I fix a finite set, some marking set, and I consider the space of convex hyperbolic matrix on the boundary with vertices marked by this set up to esoteric, and the space of bent hyperbolic matrix once again with vertices marked by this set. Once again, up to esotope. Those are finite dimensional smooth manifolds. And the boundary is the boundary of every band hyperbolic matter. Every band hyperbolic metric on my ambient manifold is a convex hyperbolic one metric. Okay, so then I have a realization map. I have a realization map between them. So this map is differentiable over the space of controlled polyhedral matrix. It's infinitesimally rigid in the sense that the differential is non-gendering. It's proper. And but the point is that I can show all this only over the subset of control replicator matrix. Okay. Of control of the prehistorial matrix, okay. And the image, the image here may be very topologically complicated, very topologically complicated. So, another topological arguments, another topological argument is required to make the transition from local to global rigidity. Okay, so is my time already over, I guess? It is more or less. Okay, yeah, then I can finish. So, thank you so much for your attention. So, thank you so much for your attention. Thank you very much, Roman. Are there any questions or any questions from online, online audience? Just speak up. Okay, then we thank Roman. Okay, then we thank Roman again. So, thank you a lot for organizing all the conference. Thank you. Yes, and then, well, this was the last talk, so let's thank all the speakers.
