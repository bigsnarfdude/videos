Good afternoon, everyone. Can you see my slides? Yep, yes, yep. Okay, perfect. Thank you, Jean, and all organizers for the invitation. It's a bit unfortunate that I cannot join in person, but I'm very keen to join. But my visa didn't work, so I gave a talk on Zoom and still hope to get more in. Still hope to get more interaction about SAC. So, I have been in Hong Kong U for three and a half years, leading a lab working on most on the modeling of the temporal structures of single cells. So, particularly including the cellular dynamics on both on the differentiation and also lineage. I know this today's topic. Today's topic is a lot on gene regulation. So, gene regulation is one of the key and also dream topic that I would love to work on, but haven't done much work. Here is one work that we recently done, which is very related to this topic, is on using the five prime single cell RN-SIG to study the regulatory patterns. One of the key messages is actually, Message is actually, you see that the read one in the five prime data is actually captured some C being and it's actually started very precisely from the PSS. So if you look at the tracks of your first the read one, you will see these are all very sharply starts from the TSS. Actually, so you can very accurately detect the TSS from five prime data. And here I Diapram data. And here I want to show you that just one example: we look into one particular NPC cancer samples and we found that different cell types in this gene, L1MS1 genes, that different cell types actually use very different major TSS. And also the TSS, the cancer condition actually give different effects. For example, in the T cells, the minor TSS actually has been increased, while in myeloids, the minor Increased while in myeloids, minor TSS actually can be decreased. And so, this is actually quite fascinating. What we did, we didn't understand all mechanisms, but we start trying to put this in a framework called Camel TSS for the analysis and hope it will be useful for other colleagues. So, I stop here on the regulatory and focus on the cell dynamics. So, the topic that The topic that will be mainly talk about RN velocity frameworks, and we will very briefly talk about how the lineage-specific cell differentiation bias and some potential markers. So if I give you a landscape of the single cells, can you tell me whether this is differentiation or reprogramming? Actually, this is very difficult. And usually, we only know this differentiation directions by experiment design. By experiment design, that we know some of the root cells, or sometimes we know the domain biology, we know it's from the stem cell to a potential differentiation state. And sometimes we may have some information from the transcription. For example, stem cells may have more diverse expression. But in general, can we infer that directly from the data? In 2018, the data concept has been introduced called arm velocity. called RN velocity. This is based on the kinetics of the RNA processing. So as we all know, the RNA has need to be synthesized or transcribed first, and then the RNA supplies machinery will work on to make this unsupplied or nasal RNA into a supplies state. And then the supplies state, the RNA will be trans translated into protein and then it will be dig degradated. Then it will be degraded. So, usually, the supplies and the unsupplies, they are in a steady state that the cells are in equilibrium. So, a low expressed supplies and unsupplies, they are in a certain ratio, and the highly expressed, they are also in this ratio. But if we're lucky to capture the cells in a trending state, that we see the cells are dense enough that they are in this very short trend state. These very short trending states that we see cells that when they increase, they will have be more unsupplied than expected or than the status states ratio. If the cells are in the repression for this certain gene, that will be less unsupplied than the status ratio. This is just one example. So, what RN velocity method can tell us on the self-transition, actually, if we can measure the we can use the We can use the unsurprised actually to predict the future of the RNA, right? So we call this the velocity of the RNA is a derivative of the S. So if we can make all genes and we can compute the difference on the supply space and also calculate the velocities, then what we can directly calculate the cosine angles of this velocity and also the difference. Then we can calculate the probability that if one cell Calculate the probability that one cell I transit into cell J. And the problem is: how can we predict or calculate the velocity? Here is a very big assumption: that the velocity can be predicted with unsliced RA as a linear predictor and also an active feedback. So, in the first R velocity methods, they actually just pick out the steady state cells and then fit a linear regression to get the supply to get the The supply to get the static ratio and to calculate the velocity. And then, in the soon after the S Val, they ask why not use all the cells that introduce a full dynamic model that's a big fit, actually just a latent tongue and two linear ODE on the induction and repression. So, here we're trying to ask: linear ODE is fun, but if we if the If the transcription rate is a static function, that is actually a bigger supply. So, we're asking: can we use any smooth function to do it? So, we actually just introduce an arbitrary dynamic function. And then we also use this big assumption that the derivative is actually linear combination of s and u. We can write it a different way that we use s and s derivative. We use s and s derivative to predict you is the same. And here we use a simple RBF function. And another big assumption we introduce is that to make all genes just use a unified time. So you can see that the S function is RBF and the U is a derivative and alpha we can further get it back. So for each gene, we will get a little tan and then we'll assume it to And then we assign it to aggregate time for all genes. And then the assignment of the states will look like this. Then we can keep updating the dynamical function parameters and keep update the time. So these are a few examples. This is in the mouse eraser data set that we know that the direction, differentiation direction should go this way. So overall, we see. With this field, so overall, we see that the unity value or unity value is given more character directionality compared to S value. And if you look at the examples, if you look at one single gene, you may not see that SM value actually make mistakes. Because this actually, the static state is actually stable and it's hard to fit that the cells goes in this way. But if we aggregate all the genes together, then we can see. all the genes together then we can see that while the fitness of the the goodness of fitting for these two genes are worse than than s of well but overall the direction will be more correct that is by aggregating the information from from all genes and this is another example is that if you look at the unsupplies and supplies you it's very hard to imagine that the the direction is good like this way But actually, if you aggregate all cells, then you will have the, you will see that the supply circles up and goes down, and then the unsupplied circles up and down. Actually, this will be a bit earlier than the supply. So if you look at this expression, this here region is the highest. So it goes up and goes down. And then the velocity actually goes up earlier and then goes down. So then we can also. So then we can also expand into the whole data set of the hematopathysis, which is actually quite challenging because it has the multiple branching and also a lot of kinetic tangents during the so if you look at example genes then it's hard to look to fit the as to the velocity assumption so they're the bigger model violation so aggregating the all genes into a same um latent time actually brings Latin time actually reinforced the model to capture the right direction. So at this workshop aims for a lot of open challenges. So I try to highlight a few major open challenges here. The first is select which features to view the temporal structure and also how can we measure the uncertainty. Can we capture the uncertainty from the parameters or how or the marble selection or can we get? Marvel selection, or can we get a good surrogate predictor? And also, there are general data science challenges, including model flexibility and overfitting. And also, local optima is keeping being a big challenge. Lost loss may not be the best direction. And also, can we used to introduce some heuristic diagnosis and also technology challenges, which a bit beyond from us, but there are a lot going on. On last, I very quickly introduce some of the lineage-specific differentiation. So, this data is from Gotman Nak from Cambridge. Here, they actually use the Larry-Buckle system to capture six major clones of the cell during three data points. And as you can immediately see that the clone three actually have very strong feedback on the university branch, and while others will like while others will like two and three that they or three and four, they have a strong bias towards the microphage and the monocyte, and others may have master cells. So here what we were trying to do is we want to model the cell transition probability on the cell counts by introducing neural ODE model, which is non-linear ODE. You can think it this way. Can you can think it all this way here? We use the MLP over the cell count, so it actually becomes time-dependent. So you will see that the transition matrix is actually changing. And if you look at the clone zero and the clone one, you can see that they already have a very clone-specific differentiation bias. And very quickly, actually, for this lineage mark, besides the back holding system, we're actually trying to look into the semantic. Actually, trying to look into the semantic mutations, including copy number variation. For example, in this neoma sample, we see that a steam V from the single cell RNA6 actually strongly capturing the lineage. Lastly is using the markondo variance. I'm sure my colleague Joshua Hoh will ask more. Here is a very quick illustration on that. Well, start thinking using to do some mapping the Mapping the disquiet space into a continuous space for easier optimization on the phylogenetic inference. So, this work is still ongoing, but I'm very happy if you have any questions suggested for discussion. So, that's all this in my lab a year ago when everyone is happy, and I'm happy to take any questions. Thank you. Hello, Ayurveda. Can you hear me? Yep. Oh, hi, really cool talk. I had a question about this latent task, because you first started with like this other method with the probability transition matrix, where they can also develop some latent time, and then you have your own kind of latent time. And I'm curious how they compare with each other. So are they kind of So are they kind of very different or are you handling it better at transition states or something like this? Yeah, very good question. So the motivation actually comes from when people doing the categorical features for the phylogenetic tree, then there's a huge searching space. So it usually works. So, it is usually very difficult to do the optimization. We want to see that if we find a good encoding so that we can.
