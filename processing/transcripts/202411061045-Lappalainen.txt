And so, during this meeting, we have heard a great deal about cell migration, and I will focus in my presentation on the machinery which is driving the cell migration. And this is the actin cytoskeleton. And one very important thing to remember is that in cells, we have many, many different types of actin filament structures. So, for example, if you look at motile cells, we have a branch, the lamellipordial network. Lamellipodial network, then we have phyllopodial actinfilament bundles, and then we have somewhat more complex actinfilament structures called stress fibers, which are connected to focal adhesions. And what is really important is that each one of these structures have a very different set of actin-binding proteins. They have very different set of very different dynamic properties, but they all have the same actin. And it's also important to. Actin. And it's also important to keep in mind that if you use actin inhibitors or cells, these actin inhibitors have different effects on these various actin filament structures. So in my presentation, I will mainly focus on stress fibers and focal adhesives at the tips of stress fibers, and then I will also talk a lot about chochomyers in family protests and their functions in these structures. And the topics of my study. Topics of my study presentation are to tell you about how functionally distinct actin filament populations can be specified in cells. And then I will especially tell you about what are the roles of tropomyosin family proteins in this process. And I say short introduction to tropomyosins. So, structurally, they are relatively boring proteins. So, they are these alpha helicolid coiled coils. And as far as we can say, when tropomyosins are in solution, Myosins are in solution, they are inactive, but then when they see actin filaments, they polymerize in head-to-tail fashion to form this continuous polymer along actin filament, and this tropomycin polymer then affects the biochemical properties of these actin filaments. And tropomycins have been mainly studied in context of muscle sarcomeres, where it is well known that tropomyosins, together with troponin complex, regulate interactions of myosin. Regulate interactions of myosin motor proteins, with actin filaments, and hence control muscle contraction. And there are also tropomyosins in non-muscle cells. And it has been shown that tropomyosins in non-muscle cells regulate myosin-based transport processes. And it has been also shown that tropomyosins can protect actin filaments in non-muscle cells from co-filamed actin filament separately. Okay, so the situation in So, the situation in animal cells is relatively complicated in the point of view of tropomyosins, because in humans we can express more than 30 different tropomyosin isoforms, which are generated through alternative splicing from four different tropomycin genes. And as shown by Peter Gunning and others, a typical non-muscle cell express typically several different tropomycin isoports. And we got interested in tropomycins more than 10 years ago when, together with Peter Gunning, we learned that in our favorite cell line, which is U2 osteosarcola cell line, there were at least three, sorry, six different tropomyosin isoforms expressed. And based on some localization studies, we learned that all of these tropomycin isoforms localize to actin stress fibers, and some of them also localize to focal adhesions. Adhesions. And initially, we thought that probably these dopamycins are functionally redundant with each other. But when we did some RNA studies, we actually learned that these topomycin isoforms, each one of them are functionally non-redundant with each other. So depleting any of these tropomyosins led to defects in stress fiber organization. Right. Okay, so in mammalian cells, we have a multiple. In mammalian cells, we have multiple different tropomyosins, and these tropomyosins are functionally non-redundant. So, therefore, we wanted to ask: do these different tropomyosin isoforms bind to same actin filaments, or do they segregate to different actin filaments? And then, also, do these different tropomycin isoforms have different effects on interactions with other actin binding proteins with actin filaments? And this is a work done by a mainly done by a former PhD student, Gergan Gate. Got them. And to answer, to ask this first question, so this is a little bit similar to the last evening of a five-day scientific meeting. So everybody is tired, they are waiting to be seated for a dinner table, and then it's always interesting to see if people from different nationalities are randomly segregating into dinner tables or whether people from different nationalities have a tendency to go to the same dinner table. It to go to the same dinner tables. And the idea here is that each one of these identical tables are actin filaments, and each one of these scientists from different nationalities are tropomycin isoforms. So the question is that do tropomycin isoforms, different tropomycin isoforms go to different actin filaments or do they randomly segregate to actin filaments? And then the next question is that if tropomycin isoforms, different isoforms go to different actin filaments. Ice bombs go to different acne filaments. So, do they also bring different properties to this acne filament? So, do Germans eat sausage, Italians eat pizza, and Americans eat hamburgers. And the way to approach this question was very simple. So, we purified actin, then assembled actin filaments on cover slips, and then we added two tropomyosins in pairs, one labeled in green and the other one in red, and then mixed these tropomycins on the coil. I then mixed these tropomycins on the copper slips and then used turf microscopy to see if tropomycins go, or these two different tropomycins go randomly to actin filaments, or do they segregate to different actin filaments or different actin filament segments? And this is how the experiment looks like. So this is our poncho experiment here. So we had one same tropomyosin in green and red, and we don't see any segregation as expected. So the experiment itself works. So the experiment itself works. In some cases, we see that two different tropomycin isoforms seem to copolymerize on the same actin filament. But in most cases, what we see is green and red segments in these actin filaments, indicating that these two tropomycin isoforms do not want to copolymerize with each other on actin filaments, but they rather segregate to different actin filament segments or different actin filaments. And then to look at how these tropomoiseu isoforms. How these tropomycin isoforms regulate interactions of other proteins with actin filaments. It's known or it has been reported that tropomycins protect actin filaments for cofin-mediated disassembly. And to our surprise, we learned that most of the tropomycin isoforms, when they are decorating actin filaments, so these actin filaments are not protected by cofilin, and only two of the isoforms we tested, tropomycin one point six and tropomyzin one point seven. And tropomy 1.7 protect active filaments from a coffin-mediated disassembly. So then, tropomycins have been also reported to regulate myosin activity on actin filaments. And so then we tested how well these different tropomycin isoforms, when they have decorated actin filaments, so how well they activate the ATPS activity of myosin 2. And now these two isoforms, tropomycin 1.6 and chopomy 1.1. Tropomazy 1.6 and Tropomosy 1.7, its protected filaments from ADF-4 fillin had no effect on myosin ATPS activity, but then actin filaments decorated by other tropomyosin isoforms activated to ATPS activity of myosin 2. So to put this data together, so we have learned that different tropomyosin isoforms are functionally non-redundant, they have a tendency to segregate to different active filaments, and they also have And they also have different effects on interactions with other active binding proteins with active filaments. And then we wanted to understand what is the structural mechanism underlying these differences between these tropomyosins. And here we focused on two isoforms, tropomycin 1.6 and tropomycin 3.2, because these two tropomycins don't copolymerize the same actin filaments. And these two tropomycin isoforms also have opposite effects on Effects on interactions of actin filaments with cofilin and myosin 2. And Srikanta Silverite postdocs in the lab then determined the cryo EM structures of actin filaments decorated by tropomycin 1.6 and then actin filaments decorated by tropomycin 3.2. And in both cases we saw that the structure looks relatively similar to what has been shown before for muscle tropomyosin. Shown before for muscle tropomyosin. So it forms this continuous polymer along actin filament. And neither one of these tropomyosins affected the conformation of actin filament, but interestingly, we noticed that these two different tropomycin isoforms follow slightly different paths along the actin filament matrix rule in a way that this tropomycin three point two is shifted kind of five oungstrom towards left in this orientation of an actin filament. This orientation of an active filament. And we think that these different two tropomyosins following different paths along active filament have also important consequences for the functions of these tropomyosins. So first of all, in order for tropomyosins to form this continuous polymer along active filament, the ends of tropomyosin dimers have to match with each other. And this is what happens if we have tropomyosin of the same kind. But because these two different tropomycins, But because these two different tropomycins follow different paths on active filament, the ends don't match. And we think that this is probably the reason why these two different tropomycin isoforms do not want to copolymerize on an actin filament, but rather segregate on different actin filaments or different actin filament segments. And then this tropomycine isoforms following different paths on active filaments may also explain why tropomycin wallpoint. Why tropomyasin 1.6 protects actin filaments from ADF-cofillin, but tropomoiser 3.2 does not, because if we dock ADF-cofillin to actin filament decorated by tropomycin 1.6, there are steric clashes between these two molecules explaining why cofilin does not want to bind these filaments. But in the case of this other tropomycin, which does not protect acne filaments from cofilin, we don't see any stereo. From cofilamin, you don't see any steric clashes, and this may explain why tropomycin 3.2 does not protect actin filaments from cofilin-mediated filament separate. Okay, so different tropomycin isoforms segregate to different actin filaments in vitro they follow different paths along actinine filaments and they also have this distinct effects on the interactions with other actin binding proteins with actin filaments. But then, so what are the cellular functions of these different actin filament populations specified by these tropomycin isoforms? And here again, we focused on these two tropomycin isoforms, tropomy 1.6 and tropomy 3.2. And the reason why we focused on these two isoforms is that although all tropomycins localize to act as stress fibers, these two tropomyosin isoforms also localize to focal. And isotropes also localize to focal adhesions, which are structures at the ends of active stress fibers. And just a small reminder about focal adhesions. These are the structures which connect the acne cytoskeleton, mainly the stress fibers to extracellular matrix. They're composed of transmembrane adhesion receptors called endocrines and many scaffolding and signaling proteins. Focal adhesions also contain actin filaments and many actinines. Contain actin filaments and many active body proteins, and they're important for cell adhesion, migration, signaling, etc. And then focal adhesives are dynamic structures in migrating cells. They typically assemble at the leading edge of the cell and then they are disassembled towards the back of the cell. And then, as beautifully shown by Sasabertsarski, focal adhesions and stress fibers are mechanosensitive structures. So, they become bigger if the cell is in a stiff matrix and then they are smaller. Is in a stiff matrix, and then they are smaller if cell is in a soft matrix or if no force is applied to a cell. And then still around 15 years ago, the picture of focal adhesions was pretty messy. So they were depicted as like a huge blob of proteins in disorganized manner. But this picture actually changed when at clear. So it changed when Clear Watermelon's lab started using IPALM super resolution microscopy to look at the vertical localization of different proteins in focal adhesions. And with this eye palm microscope, we actually learned that focal adhesions are composed of specific vertical protein layers. And it's actually shown better here in this cartoon. So, what they showed is that. Tune. So, what they showed is that at the bottom of the focal adhesion, if you look from the bottom of the cell, there are endocrines and many endocrine-associated proteins. Then, a little bit further up, there's this so-called force-transduction layer, which contains elongated tailin proteins and then tailin-interacting proteins like pinculin. And then, at the top of the focal adhesion, we have so-called actin-regulatory layer composed of alpha-actinin cross-linked actinin. alpha actinin cross-linked actin filaments. So so far so good. But we think from our studies is that the situation, or we thought from our studies, that the situation may be more complicated, but the reason is that we also have tropomyosin actin filaments in focal adhesions. And we also knew from our earlier biochemical studies is that tropomyosins and alpha-actinine compete with each other for actin binding. So they should not be in the same actin filaments. Be in same actin filaments. And then, furthermore, we have both tropomycin 3.2 and tropomycin 1.6 actin filaments in focal adhesions. And as shown by our biochemical studies, these two tropomyosin isoforms do not want to be on the same actin filaments. So therefore, our biochemistry suggests us that in focal adhesions, we actually do not only have these alfactini cross-link tactic filaments, but we should also have two other. But we should also have two other types of actin filaments decorated by tropomycin 1.6 and undecorated by tropomycin 3.2. And then, of course, the obvious question was that are all these three different types of actin filaments located in these actin regulatory layers, or is it possible that they form specific layers along the three-dimensional architecture of focal adhesions? And to do this or to understand this. And to do this or to understand this, we went to Chanelia campus at the US, where the only functional eye power microscope of the planet is located at the moment. And this is actually a video from our visit there. This is the eye power microscope. It's a very sophisticated machine. It's handmade there. And so what we have here is a very happy PSD student operating this microscope. Uh, microscope, and the reason why she was so happy is that the results were very exciting. So, first of all, our controls worked. So, Paxilin is supposed to be at the bottom of the adhesion, and also in our experiments in Il Chanelia, paxilin turned out to be at the bottom of the adhesion. Alfactinin is towards the top of the adhesion, as was reported before. And interestingly, we learned that tropomosy 3.2, troposy 1.6. 1.6 makes specific layers which are listing from this alfactinine layer, which has been reported before. And then actin spans all these three different layers, which are supposed to contain actin filaments. And we quantified this for many cells, and it's consistent. I think I will skip this slide and then just jump into our cartoon. So we think that focal adherence actually not containing one acting regulatory layer, but One actin regulatory layer, but they have three different layers of three different types of actin filaments. So we think that at the top of the focal adhesion, we have alpha-actin cross-linked actin filaments. Slightly further down, we have trochomyosin 1.6 decorated actin filaments. And then towards the bottom of the focal adhesion, we have trochomyosin 3.2 decorated actin filaments. Okay, so this is what we think is the organization. Is the organization of actin in focal adhesions? And the next question is: What are the roles of these different actin filament populations in focal adhesions? So, why we need different actin filament populations in focal adhesions. And to study this, we generated topomycin one knockout cells, so these are lacking topomoxin 1.6 and closely related topomycin 1.7. And then we also generated topomycin three knockout cells, which are lacking topomycyclins. Cells, which are lacking topomycin 3.1 and 3.2, which are very closely related to each other. And this just shows Western blood. It's one of the analysis which we show that we really have clean knockout cell lines. And initially, the phenotypes were not very surprising. So in both cases, we saw that the stress fiber networks of these knockout cells are disorganized. And this is consistent with our previous RNAi studies. But then things. Studies, but then things got a little bit more exciting when we started looking at cell migration. And what we noticed is that these two different tropomycine knockouts have kind of opposite effects on cell migration. So tropomycine I knockout cells move more quickly or more rapidly than wild type cells and tropomosa 3 knockout cells. And then these tropomozy 3 knockout cells seem to be less directional than wild type cells. And then the other interesting thing in tropomoiser - The other interesting thing in tropomaries III nochart cells was that they seem to have some sort of problem in tail retraction as they migrate because we see these long tails following these tropomosy III knockout cells as they are migrating. And this is probably better seen in these thick cell images. So the morphology of wild type cells and tropomosy I knockout cells are kind of similar to each other, but in these troponacy III knockout cells, we have these extremely elongated tails indicating. Elongated tails, indicating that they have problems in releasing their tails when they are migrating. Okay, so because these two tropomoisons localize the focal adhesions, and because focal adhesions are very important for cell migration, we then stained these knockout cells with vinculin to visualize focal adhesions. And we noticed that also there we have kind of opposite phenotypes. We have kind of opposite phenotypes. So, in supoxy, one knockout cells, we have typically only very small focal adhesions located at the cell edge, indicating that there's some sort of problem in focal adhesion maturation. And in the tropomosy3 NOCART cells, we have an abnormally large number of focal adhesives at the cell center. And we also looked at or did some live cell imaging to look at the turnover of focal adhesives, and we noticed that in supramasy 3 knockout cells, there's a problem in focal adhesion. There's a problem in focal adhesion disassembly. So, the focal adhesions are abnormally unstable, and this also explains why in tropomycine III knockout cells we have more focal adhesions at the cell center. Okay, just to summarize this part, so we have learned that tropomycine I and tropomycine III localize the focal adhesions, they form specific layers there. And in tropomycine I local cells, there's a problem in the focal adhesion maturation, and the tropomozy I local cells. And the tropomozy I knocked out cells are also more migratory as compared to wild-type cells. And on the other hand, in tropomosy III no-card cells, there's a problem in focal adhesion disassembly. And this is also why these cells have some morphological defects and problems in rear retraction during cell migration. Okay, because this 2.3-NOCAT phenotype was quite surprising, we decided to study in more detail. We decided to study in more detail why focal adhesions are abnormally stable in this tropomycin R3 logout cells. And it has been already known for a long time from studies by Shasha and others that interaction of microtubules with focal adhesions is important for focal adhesion turnover. So when microtubules associate focal adhesions, this stimulates focal adhesion disassembly. And disassembled. And therefore, we decided to look at if there's anything wrong with microtubules in these topomachini III knockout cells. And indeed, we learned that while in wild-type cells, microtubules are relatively straight, so in these topomasin III knockout cells, the microtubules are typically bent and they form this kind of crisscross pattern, which is very abnormal. And we also did blind analysis of this phenotype to make sure that what we are seeing is real and indeed. Is real, and indeed, the microtubules are severely disorganized in tropomycin 3 knockout cells. And we also did some live imaging. So, focal adhesions are here in pink, and microtubules are in white. And in wild-type cells, microtubules are growing and then they are associating with focal adhesions. But in these tropomycine III knockout cells, microtubules are growing towards the cell edge, then they are bending and they seem to be kind of insensitive. And they seem to be kind of insensitive to focal adhesions. And we also qualify the lifetimes of mitochondrial plus ends with focal adhesions, and that's also severely diminished in the tropomycin III knockout cells. Okay, so tropomycine 3 is critical for proper interactions with microtubule plus and with focal adhesions. And then we still don't know what is the precise mechanism by which stock moisture 3 regulates a microtubule. Regulates microtubule focal adhesion interplay, but we actually have some hints from our studies already. And it has been shown that two proteins, or at least two proteins called CANC and ACF7, are very important for linking microtubule plus ends to focal adhesions. And therefore we wanted to see if anything would be abnormal in the localization of CANCA ACF seven in otropomos and threenocard cells as compared to wild type cells. Cells as compared to wild-type cells. And indeed, what we learned is that in tropoSA3 NOCART cells, ACF7 no longer properly localizes the focal adhesions. And the same is also true for CANC. So in Wild-Tapp cells, CANK localizes the focal adhesions. And in tropomy-3-NOCAT cells, we have a significantly less CANC in focal adhesions. And based on our FRAP analysis, we also learned that in wild-type cells, CANK stably associates with focal adhesion. Stably associates with focal adhesions, but entroposin3nocard cells can display a highly dynamic association with focal adhesion. And this is my last conclusion slide. So, what we have learned from this last part of the study is that focal adhesions contain at least three different actin filament layers. At the top, we have alpha-actinine cross-linked actin filaments. Slightly further down, we have totally 1.6 actin filaments, and then towards the bottom of the. And then towards the bottom of the focal adhesion, we have tropomasy 3.2 decorated actin filaments. And this tropomosy 1.6 actin filaments are somehow involved in focal adhesion maturation. We still don't understand the mechanism. And then the tropomosy 3.2 actin filaments maintain stable association of gang and ACF7 at focal adhesions. And we think that therefore these tropomas 3 actin filaments are important for microtube. Filaments are important for microtubule targeting to focal adhesions. And depletion of this topomoisein three-active filament layer leads to the effective focal adhesion disassembly and then a consequent problem of symptom acceleral migration and tail retraction. Okay, so I will stop here and the people in red are the ones who contributed to this study. And then these are pictures from our lab retreat last fall and we also made an active filament. Okay, thank you.
