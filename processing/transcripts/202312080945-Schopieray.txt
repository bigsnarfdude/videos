Well, a few of you have, so you're already prepped with this sort of mindset that we have no idea what's going on in the Fusion I category world. So sort of a meta goal. So this is sort of a goal that transcends this field area, but it's to take things that look like exceptions and sort of transform them into Transform them into some very familiar infinite series. Or infinite family, if you will. So to start off with an example, but this is a very rhetorical example, and it's actually going to be labeled as a joke example, which you'll see in about two seconds why. Because imagine that we were at the very beginning of group theory. We were at the very beginning of group theory, and someone discovered that the very important groups that you might look at are the symmetric groups. They're the symmetric groups, you know, Sn. And these are the only groups that we know about. We think that groups are going to be very important in the future, and we discover this big infinite series of symmetric groups. But someone comes along and says, well, there are actually terrible wild beasts in the symmetric group. Wild beasts in the symmetric groups, right? And so they prove a theorem appears in Annals or Duke or one of these higher journals, which says that there exists a unique symmetric group, a unique, let's say, non-trivial symmetric group. Which is a million. Right? And there's this monster, there's this monster in the symmetric groups. And decades go by, and no one can figure out what is the deal with this monster, this abelian symmetric group. And of course, the audience can probably think of many, many, many different infinite series. Many, many different infinite series that this one monster example lives in. And so, this is a very good example that if you sort of don't have the benefit of the historical record of all of these finite groups, you might miss out on very obvious sort of gigantic families of examples. So, this joke example is sort of what I think of whenever I hear, you know, these words that we have some exotic, exceptional, you know, etcetera, whatever adjectives you want to add to. Adjectives you want to add to them. So the example that comes from our field, which is not silly at all with our current knowledge, because we haven't been studying this for hundreds of years, is actually a theorem of Josiah Thornton, who is a student of Victor from 2012, which, when I read it, I had similar feelings as when I read, you know, I read a theorem like this, which A theorem like this, which was that up to equivalence, there are exactly seven braided near group fusion categories. With some exceptions. I'm adding the content of the proof after this, which are not either symmetrically graded, these are the obvious ones. Or Tom Barry, we got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a So at the point this was written, these two big infinite families were known. We knew the symmetrically graded near group fusion categories. We knew the family of Tambari and Amigami graded fusion categories, which is a near group with coefficients. Which is near group with coefficient zero. But outside of that, there were these monsters. There were these seven, exactly seven equivalence classes of rated near group fusion categories. So their fusion rules, just as a note, are the fusion rule rules of Fibonacci, of rep S three, and of rep A four. And of rep A4. So you look at the list, and they don't look like monsters, they look like very familiar things, finite groups, and one additional one that looks a little bit scary. So you think that possibly, just like the very exotic abelian symmetric group, that these seven sort of fall into some larger class of categories that we're just too hyper-focused to see the big picture for. For. I understand those are ref S3 with like a different breeding. Exactly. So there's only two symmetric breeded fusion, near-group breeded fusion categories that you can sort of modify the breeding on. Exactly. So yeah, so Jing Chengdong wrote me an email telling me about this paper they had written about a very particular object, which was very interesting to me, which might help answer this sort of question, or at least give us a slightly Or at least give us a slightly broader scope than we currently have. So the definition is: rather than looking at these near-group fusion categories, which we've been looking at for a very long time, you just ever so slightly expand the definition to not require that the gigantic subcategory that you're very familiar with is pointed. So you just require that it has some very large subcategory like this. So we'll start with fusion rings. So we'll start with fusion rings, just because it's easier to write a definition. So a fusion ring R is near integral if there exists a fusion subring Fusion subring, which we'll call S, giving the side of R, which has maximal rank. So that means that the rank of S is just one less than the rank of R. So this could be a near-group fusion category, where your sub-ring is just a group. It's just an invertible basis element. But this could be lots and lots of other things. Of other things. I'm sorry? Surely you're missing one word over there. Oh, fusion ring R is near interlife. There exists a fusion subring S. Subset of R. I'm sorry? Should S have any good property? No? This is it. This is. It's just big. Why is this called Niri New? Well, we'll see. Okay. Skeptics in the crowd, you know. So, as an integral? That's what I was trying to ask. Well, all right, let's write it as an exercise since everyone's so sassy this evening. Exercise. Prove that for all x in S, the Frobenius-Brand dimension of X is an integer. So I was going to explain it, but now it's an exercise. To explain it, but now it's an exercise. So, this is an accurate name, even without including that additional assumption. So, for examples, of course we have the near groups. So, a huge group of examples that we're very familiar with. And where do you look for examples after you've exhausted sort of the exotic fusion categories? You go back to the Fusion categories, you go back to the representations of finite groups and you poke around and try to find examples there. So these actually have a long history in group theory. I think the papers are almost 40 years old at this point, studying this exact thing. So studying groups whose representation category sort of has a maximal fusion subcategory. They clearly did not word it in that way, but I won't go into how they actually worded it, but you can find lots and lots of papers on this subject. Of the subject. So, for one example from finite groups, just to give you an idea of what these sorts of things look like, so you can look at the character ring of PSU32. The character ring of PSU3E2 has, let's see, six basis elements. There's six irreducible representations. There's six irreducible representations of this group. And I'm going to draw them in kind of a. What the school do? Sorry? What the school does? The order of this group is 64 plus 872. 72. So it has one irreducible representation, and I'll write the dimensions of these as the numbers, because this is how I visualize them. It has this very large irreducible representation, and then it has. And then it has a smaller representation of dimension two, and it has four little irreducible representations of dimension one. So this down here is our little subring S, and this is our little object that lies outside of it. And just for future notational purposes, I'm always going to call this rho because that's what people do with the new groups. The new groups. So actually, you can see that this is a subarring because there's no possible way you could, you know, tensor these representations together to get the larger one. And you'll also note that this is sort of two examples in one. So if I have color chart here, you'll see that inside of this one, unlike the near group, so if I take a near group fusion ring and I try to add another object to it, I almost Object to it, I almost never get another near group fusion rate. You can do this for the smallest possible example of trivial to Z2 to E6. But that's the only example where you can do that here. But here, you start off with a near group. So this is a Tambari Yamagami with C2 cross C2 near group. And inside of that is a maximal. That is a maximal subcategory, which is sort of an S prime. And you can actually build sort of larger and larger examples of this just by adding single objects. So they sort of could possibly lie in infinite series of larger and larger size by adding objects, unlike the new groups. That's one special fact about them. So, in general, if you have G of this type, there's a formula for the multiplicity of rho tensor rho, which you've Rho tensor rho, which you've seen with near groups, is sort of the important fusion role. And just in this case, I'll write that the multiplicity rho in rho, in this case, is exactly 7. And for people who are familiar with neo groups, this is not a coincidence. This is exactly the Frobenius Boron dimension of S minus 1. So it sort of reminds you a lot of similar. Reminds you a lot of similar results for new groups. So stop me if you have any questions, but I feel like I'm moving at a good pace. Because Frobini's Perot formula is always true. That's right. The Frobini's Perot formula is always true for this new integral. Always true for what? I see. So can you, for any new integral, say what n row, row, row, yes, because of finite group theory, there's a formula I have written here, you know, in general, just as a little footnote. In general, just as a little footnote here, this coefficient in small printnere is just two times the dimension of rho minus g over the dimension of rho. So if someone gave you one of these examples, this is the coefficient of that. And this time from what holds it the level of fusion thing, whereas this is a group theory. This is a group. You use facts about group theory to get this coefficient. In general, in fusion categories, we should. In general, in fusion categories, we should be able to vary this and get more interesting fusion categories by changing this coefficient, just like we do with the new groups. So we use facts about character tables to get this fact. Any other questions? Okay. So we definitely have a larger set of fusion rings, and because these are representations of finite groups, we actually have some fusion rings. We actually have some fusion categories which correspond to at least some of these near integral fusion rings. So, our definition of a near integral fusion category, of course, is going to be a fusion category whose underlying ring is near integral. So, I won't waste the time to write that down. So, in the categorical setting, Which is what I'll spend the second half of my talk talking about. We don't always have that the dimension of this sort of excluded object over here is an integer. It could be something which is not an integer. So, if it is not an integer, you can prove much stronger things about your fusion category. So, we're just going to let C. So we're just going to let C be a near integral fusion category. And we're going to let D, which lives inside of C, be a fusion subcategory of maximal ray. So that More n. So that produces the assumption that we need for our fusion ring to be near integral. We'll use the same notation. We'll use rho to describe that excluded little object or the excluded isomorphism class, a simple object for our categories, etc. So, some results, so some facts. Call them theorems, but they're really the same theorems that you would have for near groups, just extrapolated to these near-integral fusion categories. So as I mentioned before, if we have a situation where a Frobenius Peron dimension of rho or the Frobenius-Peron dimension of C is not an integer, then we can say a lot more about this situation. So these should look familiar. Familiar to people who study near groups. So if our Fubinius-Beron dimension is not integer, then this multiplicity right here must be a multiple of the Fubinius-Baron dimension of the maximal fusion subcategory. Just like with our near groups, this is usually some multiple of the order of the group. So for some k, which is a non-negative integer. Integer. And you can also prove, as we have, that in this case, the fusion rules of C are commutative. So, for some reason, the irrationality of this Rubenius prawn dimension, or your coefficient for rho tensor rho with rho getting too large implies. With rho getting too large implies that the fusion rules have to be commutative. But for near groups, we know that there are examples of near groups where the fusion rules are not commutative, where the group is an extra special two-group. So I'm ashamed to say that I actually have no examples of non-commutative near integral categories which are not near group. So an exercise or a project would be to find any would be to find any near integral fusion category which is non-commutative and not a near group. So surely we believe that the abelian things in the world are sort of more numerous than non-abelian things. At least that's how it goes with most mathematical objects. So I would assume that there is some monster, well current monster, out there like this. Out there like this. So, another thing you can prove is in any case, I won't go into the details, but these categories are Galois conjugate to a pseudo-unitary category, just like the near groups. And so you can replace the Frobenius-Peron dimension with the categorical dimension if you want. The most natural question to ask, since all of these near integral fusion categories, All of these near integral fusion categories are commutative, is which are the nicest ones? Which ones have gradings that are associated to them? So we're approaching our original question here. So if, and this is in complete generality, so in generality, so not in the irrational case, like over here. Just assume that our C is graded. And we have two different situations. So, this very structured setting where the convenient param dimension isn't an integer, this is the first place that you would look for something which is graded. I guess we could call this a theorem, since this is quite a bit more work than these other facts over here. But if our Frobenius-Perron dimension of C is not an integer, Perhaps dimension of C is non-integer and you're braided, this implies that C is a Fibonacci category. So it's actually the only rated one which has a rational dimension. So I won't write it next to this exercise down here, but these irrational dimension near integral fusion categories, which aren't near group, are hard to find. And in fact, Hard to find, and in fact, I cannot find any which are not also near group. But I have some reason to believe that they would exist, which hopefully we can get to before our end of time. But in the integral setting, so if the Frobenius-Perran dimension of rho is an integer, or the whole Frobenius-Perron dimension, the global Frobenius-Peron dimension is an integer, then we have sort of a sort of a set of cases. Sort of a set of cases that we have to look at, which might look familiar. So in these cases, the Frobenius-Perron dimension of C can only be one of three things. It can be twice the Frobenius-Peron dimension of D. It can be three times the Frobenius-Peron dimension of D, or it can be four times the Frobenius-Peron dimension of D. And that's it. And that's it. So, this is again not near group, making no other assumptions than this is Brayden. So, if you look at the twists, I know I haven't introduced this, you might not have seen it in a while, but these three cases actually correspond to, again, I said it was a Galois conjugate to a pseudo-unitary category, so there's a nice spherical structure. So, these are pre-modular categories. These cases are split up by the order of the twist. Of the twist on that excluded object, rho. And in fact, the order of the full twist on rho sort of goes in reverse order from these. So in the first case, it has order 4. It's plus or minus i. In the second case, it has order 3. And in the last case, it has order 2. So there's a nice little symmetry in these cases. So, if we look back at the thing that I erased, which was written right here, you can see that the Fibonacci category fell into the previous classification. Our Tambari Amagami categories fall in this location right here. So, in Near Group, in Near Group Land, this would be Tambari Amigami, and there were infinitely. And there were infinitely many of those Tambari anagamis. In the second case, this was the Rep S3 one. And there were exactly two of those categories. And in the last case, this is a rep A4. And there's only one of those. So you can see why the first result, which is a great The first result, which is a great result, it motivated this work. This result was kind of very biased because it was taking sort of an oblique slice of some other classification of a slightly more generic object that they weren't looking at. So the question is, is can you show that these two families are actually infinite families as well? And yeah, you can. So you actually have to think about rep S3, the symmetric groups, coming back to haunt us. Symmetric groups coming back to haunt us in a kind of a strange way. So, to make this family infinite, and in the interest of time, I'll be very brief, but to make this family infinite, you sort of have to think of the cyclic group of order 3 as an extra-special 3-group. It's not an extra-special 3-group for obvious reasons, but you think But you think about extra special representation theory of extra special three groups as two irreducible objects whose dimensions are powers of three, and then some elementary abelian three group that sits below it. And C3 you can think of as an extra special three group where you have three to the first one-dimensional representations and sort of invisible, non-invertible. Non-invertible representations. And if you think about it that way, that fits into this series of extra-special three groups. And repS3 is just taking those two irreducible representations and squashing them together. So you can find non-symmetrically graded versions very easily. Of the category that I was just saying. The extra special three groups that see to action, which collapses the two non-invertible representations. And you don't have to look far. You literally just take the center of this category, and you can find objects which have such large dimension and not twist one that they generate these types of categories. And you can do similar things for this third family. And you can do similar things for this third family. So we have not proved this yet, but it might be possible actually to list all of the categories which fall in all three of these families to give a perfectly complete classification. So I have just enough time. I probably won't write anything down. I'll just wave my arms at you like this. But this construction actually gives us sort of hope that you can construct more exotic fusion categories. Exotic fusion categories using a very similar method. So if you take some of the quadratic categories, or it was almost near group when you have two non-invertible objects. Okay, so we'll call it almost near group. So the extra special three group is an almost near group fusion. I accept it doesn't act transitively, does it have to act transitively on the LET modulates? Anyway, we're at such an early age in the uh in the study of these things that the words will change eventually. That the words will change eventually. But you have a similar setup here with the almost near-group fusion categories, but some of them have irrational dimensions on the non-invertible objects. And the hope is, and there is very promising data to support the fact that you can take some of those irrational, almost near groups, and equivariantize and collapse those two large objects that aren't in the subcategory together. And with a non-trivial action on the invertible objects, you'll get up. On the invertible objects, you'll get objects of dimension 2, for example, and you can create things that kind of look like this, but with some irrational dimensions. And just by looking at, playing around with some possible modular data, you would think that you could create a lot of examples using that method, but not all of them. Kind of like, you know, the dihedral group of order 8 is a semi-direct product, but the quaternion group, you know, it's not. And there's evidence to believe that there are some that kind of To believe that there are some that kind of look like this, but you can't decompose into a semi-direct product like that. So there's a lot of evidence that going down this road, which is a different road than these generalized near-group categories, might actually produce some very interesting examples in the future. So I'll leave a couple of minutes for questions, so thank you for listening. Yeah, theo. So I can obviously take larger primes than three. It's sort of smashed with it. Yeah. Are you saying that those just don't emit gradings or what kind of? They don't emit non-symmetric gradings. So if you have, oh, did I not write that up here? Yeah, so here, it just requires one more assumption. Or I can continue it, and then we can cut the video so it looks like this was written here the whole time. Then, if C is not symmetric. That's my bad. What you're saying is like I would try to do the symmetric, they look in the center, and I just sort of. You'll get the exact category that you want, but it only has a unique rating, which, well, yeah, it has a unique rating for the odd primes, which is symmetric. So, these are sort of the only. So these are sort of the only ones that you can ruin, you know, by twisting the braiding by. If for some reason I didn't like braiding, how to kind of find fusion subcategories then? I mean, any fusion subcategory was sended. What are you looking for? I don't know. You're looking for other categories that look like this that aren't coming from finite groups. I mean, the construction I was talking about is sort of the. Talking about is sort of the best place to look for sort of easy examples where the Frobenius prone dimension is not an integer. You take some of the things that Pinos and Izumi have been studying and you sort of try to equivariantize to create more interesting examples. But I think what we'll find is those fusion rules that we get, you know, there's going to be some that are going to be equivariantizations of generalized near groups, but there's going to be some that aren't as well. So go ahead and So do I understand correctly that the only examples that occur in Geno are obtained from near-no categories by some sort of procedure such as equivariantization. Yes, exactly. So the only known examples of the irrational global dimension, yes, yes. But, you know, I'm the only one who's been looking, so I wouldn't take that too seriously. Yeah, but not. So you're contrasting the two ways of generalizing near groups by either using other quadratic categories or your method of your direction of looking at other kind of integral categories or other groups. You can do both simultaneously. So you can look at things like categories that have an integral subcategory and maybe like one irreducible module over that. And in that case, there are also examples known. Like the one that's been studied a lot is the circle 4442 subfactor where you have. 4442 subfactor where you have a rep A4 and then another module that's with the same rank as rep A4. And in that case, actually it does also come from temporary decisions of how you're using, but that would sort of further give us first things first, but that would give a further place to look for more exercise. Yeah, exactly. I want to think this through before I start trying to generalize even more. But a good exercise for someone would be to just try to classify those ones which are legitimate extensions. Which are legitimate extensions by C2. So try to classify all fusion categories that you can add one object to in a non-trivially graded component. I think that's a reasonable task to do. So this would be like a Tambari Yamagami where the subcategory, the trivial component doesn't have to be pointy. I think that would be an interesting place to look as well for someone with a lot of time on their hands. Any other questions? Good morning.
