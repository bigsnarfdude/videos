Vina Barutello Conterino talk about regularized variational principles for the perturbed K-PER problem. Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. And sorry, finally, I'm here in Turin and not in Wakaca. So the work I and the research I will talk to you about today is. I will talk to you about today is a research in collaboration with Rafael Ortega from the University of Granada and Giamaria Verzini from Milan. And what we have done is regularize variational principle. So first of all, I will try to just give some words about regularization and variational techniques, and then I will go in our results. So, first of all, regularization technique. It is a matter of fact that collisions have an important role in solar mechanics and also when you study small systems that as in atomic theory. For collision, I will mean for all this talk when two bodies have the same position in the space, and so when the voter distance it becomes zero. Distancy becomes zero. In this sense, of course, Newton's equations are meaningless. Singular set can be singletons as in the Kepler problem or in the anisotropic one, or maybe usual set as a conic set for the n-body problem. Okay, but in this talk, I will just talk about potential of this kind, of the kind of the Of the kind of the Kepler problem. So, starting from the last century, from the 20th century, many scientists, many mathematicians proposed some techniques, mainly geometrical techniques, in order to regularize collisions. What does it mean to regularize a collision? The aim of regularization is to transform a singular system, for instance, the dynamic. For instance, the dynamical system associated with the potential that I written here, to a regular one, possibly providing some tools, some mathematical tools to analyze the motion that leads to a collision in order to extend the flow beyond the singularity. Okay, this is the idea. So the main names involved in regularization theories are written here. So started from Are written here, so started from Levicilita Viet of Kusolemo Stiefel and then go on with the School of Dynamical Systems. But there are also many other names also today that are working on this kind of subjects. Then, so this is the first ingredient. The second one is variational techniques. Variational techniques for singular problems. So also, let's say from the Let's say from the 90s of the last century, variational classical variational techniques have been applied to singular dynamical system with many, many positive results. So here I wrote also just a list of names. It's quite a long list, but there are also other names involved. And I will just give some ideas of what variational techniques mean. Variational techniques means. So, this means to find solutions where solutions are in some sense classical, weak, generalized, we will see. So, solutions are understood as critical points of suitable functionals. If you want to fix your time, you will use a Lagrangian action functional. Otherwise, you can use other functions as the Jacobi length or the Moker tweet function. Jacobilen or the Moker tweet functional, if you, for instance, want to fix your energy. But anyway, solutions are understood as critical points of functionals. Typically, due to the presence of the singular set, you have a lack of compactness. This lack of compactness can be overcome imposing some symmetries or some other topological constraints. Some other topological constraint or some other constraint of some kind. So, once that you have imposed this kind of constraint, you can try to apply the variational machines and you can sometimes prove the existence of some solutions in some sets. Once that the solution is produced, let's say approved the existence of the solution is. The existence of the solution is proved, it turns out that this solution can indeed interact with the singular set. Indeed, it has been proved that the way in which in a lot of this kind of problems, in the way in which the bodies or the atoms approach the collision, is integrable. And so functionals can be fine. And so functionals can be finite also on collision orbits. And so it is completely natural when you apply a variational method to find the solutions that interact with the collision set. And so if you want to see this in a positive way, you can think that the variational techniques are a natural tool to investigate cohesion motions. Okay, so now just this was just a So now just this was just a brief, very, very, very short introduction. Now, what is our goal? Our goal was actually, we started this research quite many years ago, four or five years ago, and our idea was to try to develop a method that combined the use of relational technique and the regularization methods in order to study. In order to study existence and multiplicity results for the perturbed problem that can be considered, I think, a prototype model in CSM mechanics. And our steps to do that was, first of all, to regularize the action functional because we work with fixed time. Second, we tried to prove that Tried to prove that critical points of the new functional, so the regularized functional, I will call it a regularized functional, are solutions of the problem in a suitable sense. And now I will explain this. And last, we will prove the existence and the multiplicity of critical points for this new functional that finally will be solutions for the starting problem. Okay, so now. So now let's come to the problem. The problem is the classical Kerkel problem with a perturbation P. We work in indeed theoretically in any dimension, but finally the deep results that we have obtained are in dimension two and three. And in the talk of today, I will talk about periodic solutions. Periodic solutions. Okay, we have also results for the Richard problem, one problem, but today I will concentrate on periodic solutions since I think that are the situation, the most interesting situations. And so P, the forcing term, is chosen to be periodic and smooth. I always work with C1P. This forcing term actually can also be replaced by a term of this kind. By a term of this kind, but this will just complicate the notation, let's say, and so I just write P. Okay, so it is well known that classical solutions for the Partaskeeper problem have to be collisionless. So X, a solution X, must be always different from zero, that is the singularity for every T. But what But what we do is to understand solutions in a slightly more general sense. And so we will talk about generalized solutions that can have collisions. And indeed, generalized solutions is the concept of solution that coincides with the notions obtained via regularization theories. And now I will explain this. What are for us solutions? Okay, so generalized solutions. Okay, so generalized solutions. It is the same notion that Levichivita talked about. Okay, so let's just to understand very beefy, let's think to the Kepler problem. Kepler problem with energy negative and at negative energy. Okay, we know that we find families of ellipses. Here I also fixed the here i also fixed the x the axis okay um so we have families uh of families of um of ellipses and we also know that as the eccentricity approaches one the ellipsis degenerates into an ejection collision collision solution so a solution that starts from the singularity then bounce on the east region and then go back okay Back. So it seems natural to understand a generalized periodic solution as a solution that at conditions preserve both the energy and the direction. Okay, so actually this idea traces back to Ledicilita in his famous paper in 1966 and 1920, where here I just Where, here I just write the transformation in the plane, okay, where, using this change of variables that I think that I'm sure that Alexao talked about, using this change of variables, he transformed the Kepper problem in an harmonic oscillator with the energy relation transform like this. And now, if you want to, if you try. Want to if you try to go back to the singular problem, and so yes, we take Z that satisfy the harmonic oscillator, we invert this relation here, and we obtain a solution, indeed a solution of the Kepper problem with energy H. So, this, of course, since the harmonic oscillator is no more singular, when we take a solution We take a solution of Z, we can find a solution that interacts with the singularity. And what happens is that if Z is smooth, then when we go back to the Kepler problem, we find a solution X that preserves energy and direction at collisions. And so we are ready to give our definition of solution. So we have the Kepper problem in Keeper problem in any dimension, if you want, but finally you will see that we will restrict to two and three on some interval of the VM line. Then we assume, first of all, that the set, the zero set, so the collision set is discrete. Then we ask to this function that we call generalized solution that That we will call generalized solution that outside collision it is a classical solution. And finally, and this is the interesting assumption, and finally, we will ask that these two limits exist for night. And so, in particular, the left and right limits agree. Okay, so this is exactly the notion of Legita. And so, actually, if you want, just to briefly compare. If you want just to briefly compare what happened in literature in the main works of the 19th, starting for instance from Balirabino, 1891, and then going on with many others, the authors consider more generally autonomous singular Hamiltonian system, but a weaker notion of solution because only the energy was conserved across collisions. While the direction While the direction was not necessarily concerned, except in a case of collision break orbits considered by FANAFA in 93. So as far as I know, this notion of solution, of generalized solution, has been introduced by Rafael and Rafael Ortega in 2011. And up to date, today, the state of the art is the following. is the following when study the perturbed problem uh key periodic perturbed problem in one dimension so on the real line or tega proof that there exist infinitely many solutions for every p then some years later boscajin alberto boscajin with rafael ortega and etc proved that um there exist many There exists many solutions, infinitely many solutions in dimension 2 and 3, but just for small p. Okay, so there was an epsilon in front of the forcing term. While in dimension two, for every p, there exists a nice variational result obtained by Aberto Bostavgini, Ducio Pottini, and Darth Ambrosio. Okay, our contribution will be Will be near these two words, let's say, but we will prove the existence of infinitely many solutions from any P. And the technique that we will use is different from the one proposed by these authors. There are also other contributions by Let Sau and Carlotta Revella and her students, Simon. So, this is our main theorem. So this is our main theorem, that is what I have already said. So for any p-periodic, there exists infinitely many p-periodic generalized solutions for the territorial Kepler problem in dimension 2 and 3. What we will do is to prove the existence of infinitely many distinct critical points of a regularized action functional. In such critical points, we In such critical points, will be actually internalized solutions. But so the final theorem is this one, but there are some intermediate steps in this work that I think that can be interesting. The first step is that the regularized function themselves can be interesting, okay, and so the Okay, and so the link between now we will see this: the link between action functional, regularized functional, and critical points of this new functional and solution of the starting problem. These can be interesting aspects. Indeed, Frauen Felder and his group in the last few years catch this fact, maybe also better. Maybe also better than the nanzo or than me at least, because they applied in many different, very interesting situations, this kind of regularization proving existence of periodic solution in different kind of Hamiltonian system with a delay. For example, one of the, I think, the first paper appeared from this group with this technique is the frozen. technique is the frozen planet orbit in the helium atom that is a one-dimensional um one-dimensional atomic uh atomic model let's say okay so uh i think that okay the main result is this one but also this strategy can be interesting i i guess okay and so let's come to the to the strategy now i will uh give you the what we call the heuristic The what we call the heuristic derivation of the new functional. So we start from the classical action functional here, classical action functional. And what we don't want to do is to impose a symmetry or something like this to find solution, because otherwise we need to impose some assumptions also on P, on the forcing term, and this is not what we want to do. And this is not what we want to do. So, via a non-local change of variables, we will go from A to B. So, B will be always our regularized functional, and we will try to understand the link between A, B, and the solution of the problem. So, we make a variable change. There is a time scale that is a classical star phase. Is a classical stuff, it's the same of Levitica, it's the variable change of Sunman. So we work in this space here: H1 loops with integrable inverse of the norm, and we define for any X this quantity, for a fixed X, let's say this quantity. So we make a time scale, then we make a spatial transformation. The spatial transformation, I call it Transformation, I call it phi, and must fix the sphere and must be homogeneous of degree two. If you assume that given x, there exists z such that x is the image of z, okay, this is not trivial, but let's assume this. So, we assume this and we make the variable change in the The variable change in the action functional, and we obtain, after some computation, we obtain a new functional b. This new functional has this part here q that comes from the potential part, sorry, the kinetic part, while this second part here are these two terms. This one is how it has been transformed, the inverse of the form the inverse of the norm of x while r contains t. Let us remark that I go in the next slide where I wrote one smaller functional that q and r depends on the transformation c, on the choice of phi. R contains the term with t and is always of class c1, while the regularity of the term q depends on phi. Okay, in particular, Okay, in particular, this function here is defined on any z in h1 except the zero function. So here functions that touch the singularity are no more a problem. But we have to pay something to have obtained this functional because the price to pay is that we have some non-local terms in this functional and so the And so the classical methods do not apply. Okay, but just very briefly, examples. In any D, you can choose, I think that the easiest choice is this function. So norm of Z times Z that satisfy our assumptions, and for which the term Q is this term here. It's not wonderful for this term. On the other hand, if you work. On the other hand, if you work in two dimensions and you choose the Levi-Civita transformation, or in three dimensions you work with the Custanemo-Stiefeld transformation, that is this one here at the bottom of the page, the term Q becomes a little bit nicer because it is just the norm, the L2 norm of Z prime. Okay, as you can see here, when we deal with Here, when we deal with the three-dimensional setting, we work with the quaternions. We work with quaternions and indicate that the map phi take R4 to R3. Okay, we will see something more maybe later. Okay, so let's go on. What is our goal? Our goal is to develop a method that we combine verbal... Develop a method that we combine verb and block. But we have already done that. What we have already done is that we have already regularized the Lagrangian action functional. Now what we want to prove is that critical points of the functional B are generalized solutions for the problem. So let's go to step two. For step two is not always true. For instance, when you For instance, when you choose this transformation here, spatial transformation, you can construct many counterexamples for which a critical point of B is not a generalized solution. In particular, here we have a very simple example with a critical point with a single zero in the middle of in the middle, somewhere in the interval zero, one in the interval. interval 0, 1 in the interior of 0, 1 and for which the two limits, left and right limits, are different. Okay, so this is not the generalized solution. And you can also construct nice examples also with p equals zero in dimension one, for which this is not true. So to go back as we have done in Levitica in the Levitic Trivita transformation, is not evident, okay? Not evident. Okay. And for instance, in this case, you need to impose some further assumption to go back. But let's go to the case that we are interested in. So dimension two, and maybe if we have time, also dimension three. So in dimension two, as I have already said, this is the term Q, so it's quite easy. And also R is not. Also, R is not so complicated. Okay, so this functional BLC for the Vicheta is well defined and it is C1 except for the zero loop. And indeed, we can prove with some computation that critical points of this function really correspond to generalized periodic solutions for the planar perturbed taper problem. The proof of this. The proof of this theorem, that here I work with all the details and the right assumptions and thesis, requires quite several steps. So first you have to find out the only Lagrange equation for the functional that are not short equations, I mean, because are integral differential equations. Then you prove that critical points are regular enough that they just have isolated collisions or a machine that you see. Or a machine that you start and you go on and on, and finally, you have to prove that you have really a generalized solution. So, if we find a good way to apply variational methods to this functional, then the solutions that we find, the critical points that we find, are the kind of solutions that we were looking for. And indeed, in order to do that, we just To do that, you just have to make a very simple remark. The remark is the following. So, if you're looking for key periodic x, so it should be natural to look for one periodic loops that are critical points for the functional. Okay, so to work in this space here, but this space here has exactly Here is exactly the same lack of compactness of the functional A. Okay, because indeed, what is called the Paula's main condition, it is a compactness condition, phase. But you can remark this fact. Your function is not equal to z, but is equal to z square. So the periodic condition is not the optimum one. Not the optimal one, I mean, yes, it's not the optimal one, because the right condition to impose is that the absolute value of these, the norms of these two quantities are equal. So you can try to find solutions in this set here, that is the set of anti-symmetric to periodic functionals. Sorry. So after time one, the z is at the opposite point with respect to the position at zero. So in some sense, this regularization with the function z squared solves the problem of compactness. Okay, because you gain a symmetry symmetric Yes, so you don't need to impose a further symmetry assumption, but you can symmetry just for your regularization. Okay, and so you can look for solution in this space where the compartments conditions are assumptions that you need to make the sequence, the approximating sequence to converge, actually. Converge actually. Okay. And so you add this symmetric condition without a further assumption on P. Okay. And so actually generic the periodic X can be associated to anti-symmetric two periodic Z. Okay, fine. So once that we have understand that we can work in this That we can work in this space with a symmetry, but without imposing any symmetry. This is the core of the situation. You can observe that you also have some more hidden symmetry because the function is even and so we can deduce the existence of infinitely many critical points just Just applying the theory of christmases genus. This is a theory that provided the existence of infinitely many distinct critical points of the functional and characterized the critical level in this way. So to any pair of critical points of BCL at some level correspond a distinct periodic generalization. A decent e-periodic generalized solution for a something problem. Okay, so this, um, what is, I think, interesting is that this new functional adds some hidden symmetries that allows us to prove the existence and the multiplicity of solutions without imposing any further assumption. Okay, and so let me see. Okay, I still have. Uh, let me see. Okay, I still have five minutes. Yes, yes, yes, okay. Just so I just conclude with the last two or three slides, where the same machine is indeed applied in the three-dimensional space. But here is a little bit more complicated, the situation, because the map is more complicated. The map C, the map C, okay, all right, or you have already the quaternion. Already the quaternions that are more complicated than the complex plane, but it's not only this, the fact. The fact is that if you restrict your Custanemos differna to S3, you find the opposite vibrations. So you have fibers that are S1. And this complicates the situation. Second fact, in order to obtain In order to obtain a regularized functional from the action functional, we also need to impose a further condition. Okay, this is a geometric condition that if you want to enter in the deep of this condition, I suggest the papers from Leidzao, in particular the paper of 2015, where it's well explained. But you need to put the condition, this condition. put the condition this condition to obtain to simplify let's say to simplify the um the kinetic part of the function okay once that you have imposed this uh this assumption that it indeed is a completely natural assumption in this regularization you find your function here that indeed has more or less the same form as levita except this term this final term This term, this final term, and then you have your theorem exactly as for the dimension two. So you can pass from critical points of the regularized functional to generalized solutions. And you go on with your machine, because now you try to find infinitely many critical points. Many critical points. But now, pay attention. The fibers are as one, not just a pair of points. And so you need to work in a manifold that is stratified. This is the manifold where you have to work. It's a disjoint union of this set here. But you can prove that is a nice C-infinity manifold, it is modeled on. Manifold, it is modeled on an inverse space, and so on. And finally, you can once more apply the Carlos Histogenous theory, now working with a little bit less restrictive condition, less restrictive compactness condition that is called Palestinian Charan. But anyway, the machine still works. And so we find, we proved also the existence of infinite. Also, the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions for the perturbed problem for any p, for any p. And we give also, of course, a variational characterization of this solution through the Krasnozevsky genus. And with this, I think that I stopped. Thank you. Okay. So, is there questions in the audience or online? Can I just jump in and say something? Okay, so this technique, I can see it right away that it would work just fine if you instead of one over X as potential, you take one over. You take 1 over 2 minus 2 over n. And I'll tell you right away why. For n equals 1, we get exactly the Kepler problem and that the collision is a transmission. For n equals 2, we would have a reflection, but the direction is the same. So if you have 2 minus 2, I know because I did it in my thesis years ago, right? And then, okay, so for A. And then, okay, so for n equals odd, it's a transmission, and for n is even is a reflection. Okay, and at your key assumption with the w minus one, with the anti-symmetric, yes, okay, that one will be similar to the one in Gustav Hermo would be something like z in one is a root of the unity times z in zero. Unity times z is zero, yes, in fact, yes, yes, exactly, exactly. I mean, when you have the chita, you ask that after alpha of the period, you are here in the opposite. Otherwise, with Costa Remo, you can you are in a rotating, and so you have to basically, yeah. So, did you guys? So, did you guys do this already? No. To try with 2 minus 2 over n, no. Okay. Let's talk. I have a student. Okay. Okay. No, no, we just tried with alpha equals 1. I see. Okay. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. It's just great. Yeah. That's, it's just, yeah, I was just seeing as I was following you. And then, yeah, that's great. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay, thank you. More questions? I'll email you. Yes, thank you. Okay. So we think Vivina again. Thank you to you and have a good day. So now we need two minutes. We'll continue. I also wanted to make some complete tutorials in the power.
