So over to you, Wendo. Thank you. I also thank the organizers for giving me the chance to talk about our recent results on the municipal flow. Please join to work with my collaborators, Sho Li Wang and Li Xia Ye. The equation we will consider is the so-called mean curvature flow B equals to H. So for a plane curve or a high-dimensional hypothesis, this V means the normal velocity of the curve or the hypersurface, and H means its mean curvature. So it moves. So, the curve or the hyper surface moves according to such a law. When the hypersurface lies in a cylinder or in a band, in two dimensions, its contact will also require some boundary conditions, like this. It means the normal vector of the hypothesis and the boundary. A boundary context with such an angle. In a special case, that the hypothesis is a graph, is the graph of a function u. The normal velocity is expressed this way and the normal vector in this way. Mean cover equals to the divergence of the normal direction. So this equation now is converted to such a form, a querilinear parabolic y. And the boundary condition is expressed in this way. The parilinear parabolic coefficient compared, combined with nonlinear lobbying boundary conditions. Here is an example. In the one-dimensional key, the equation is a simple one, but it is also a quasi-linear parabolic one. And the boundary condition now is written in this way. So the boundary angle equals to some parameter H. In a special case, when H is a constant, so it means the boundary angle is fixed. Then, such a problem always has a special solution, which we call it a traveling wave solution. Like this. The traveling speed and the profile. So, when we submit this special solution into the problem, Problem. This profile and C should satisfy this ODE. And this is the boundary condition. This ODE can be solved very simple explicitly by equals line cosine cx. The shape of this function is look like this. look like this for any c for c defined by this formula this function is defined over minus pi over to c and pi over to c that is the life span the lifespan the definition domain of this function is The definition to me of this function is this one. It's a bounded one. The graph of this function looks like this, which is called a Bunjupa by Otula and Wu. This is a very special solution. In PDE, it is always it's generally called a traveling wave solution, but in geometric analysis. Geometric analysis in the field of geometric, they often call it a translating solution or a translator. Using this travel wave solution, when we consider initial value problems, if the initial data is a little large, then we can put this traveling with solution. This traveling with solution below it, and then it pulls this real solution upward to infinity. So, generally, the solution of this problem is unbounded. To study such quadrilinear parabolic equation, it generally requires that it is a parabolic wave or even a uniform parabolic wave. So we need Uniform parabolic wine. So we need the estimate of this coordinate. To ensure the global existence, we only need a global coordinate estimate, which can depend on time t. If this is true, we can obtain the existence of tear t, t capital T. But we even want to know To know the convergence of the profile. So, for a solution with some initial data, what will happen when t goes to infinity? What does u converge to? In this case, actually, we hope we can have a uniform gradient estimate. That is, the bound does not depend on. The bond does not depend on t about 20 years ago. Oshola and Wu showed that the profile of the solution to an initial data value problem converged to this special tremendous way. Later, such results are generalized by many authors. One direction is H can be a function of U. For example, when H is the boundary angle is a periodic or almost periodic or even recurrent function of the position of the height of H or U. Professor Matano and Nakamala and myself show that the So that there is this special solution which is called almost periodic travel wave and so the initial value problem is solution converges to this way now we want to study another case that is H equals equals to U it looks simple It looks simple, but the feature is that the boundary slope is unbounded, can be unbounded when u goes to infinity. Or in general, how about this part is unbounded? We will see some results in one dimension case and high dimensional radio symmetric curve. We hope to We hope to treat all the non-radiosymetric pieces, but we still have no set file results in this for such cases. And when the initial case, the problem turns out to be such a one, intuitively, you will see that when initial data. The initial data moves upward and the boundary is slope equals to its height, so it becomes steeper and steeper and steeper. So intuitively, as t goes to infinity, the shape of the graph of the solution u converts with such a special boom reaper. We denote by phi zero. This special repair whose life is just minus one to y actually 10 years ago, two and one studied such problems and for more general loving boundary conditions, they show the convergence of you to many in many different cases. Different cases. One case is that it can go to infinity as t goes to infinity. Oh, an open question is when it goes to infinity, what does the graph converge? The difficulty is that the as I just said. said there are no the boundary slope is unbounded so there are no uniform coordinate estimate basically by using zero number arguments we know this is a powerful tool in the study of sympathetic behavior for solutions but now now we found that it can be used to study the uh query estimates Guardian estimate it can give interior uniform coordinate estimate. More precisely, we consider such a solid. This is the tremendous weave or the boom reaper with such a ship. Its left base is mountain to wide wide and we combine all of its shifts. Combine all of its shifts to form a solid. So we have all of this. And then if we put the initial data above this solid, each of the tremendous wave contact with the initial data at exactly two contact points. If this is the initial data So, if this is the initial data, we see that it contacts with each terminal wave in such a way. And at the contact point, at the right contact point, the tremendous wave is steeper than the real solution. So, when time increases to a large one, to T2, to T For the zeuthalosa is immersed in this solid. Therefore, at any point, there is exactly one tremendous wave, exactly one shift R, such that this tremor wave contact with the real solution at such a point. Because in the very beginning, the contact in such a way that we can see the The context in such a way in the middle, this is bigger than the travel wave, and outside, this is smaller. So at this, by zero number argument, the contact, there will always be two contact points. And at the right point, the terminal wave is deeper than the real center. So in such Reuthousen. So, in such a way, we obtain the upper bound for the quarantine term. It is also a uniform one. In a similar way, we can consider a solid that consists of lower solutions with all large shifts. So, it forms such a solid. So it forms that a tholid and we put the real solution below it and then we use another lower solution which moves faster than the solid and then this lower solution pulls the zero solution into the solid for large time. And then this is a little complicated to state the zero number zero number uh intex integrated number uh numbers uh uh between this real solution and the the the uh any of the this lower solution because they can contact at the end point at the very beginning anyway when the time be it becomes large the the real solution is immersed in this solid and at any point there is exactly one low Exactly, one lower solution they contact in such a way. And so the zero solution is steeper than this lower solution, this terminal wave. So we obtain a lower bound for this protein. In such a way, we have lower and up bound for this solution, but uniform one. Just inside. So we obtain uniform, uniform interior. interior coordinate estimate and then we can we can use the normalization method and to take the sequence sub-sequence to convert to an entire solution as u itself the entire solution also has such boolean bounds because when t goes becomes larger and larger we can you change change the hy hy Change the HY. Hy is the lower solution of this to form this solid. And this HY denotes the boundary angle. It can be larger and larger as long as T is large. So actually, we can choose a list H1 larger. Actually, we can choose this H1 larger and larger. So this one dripper converges to this one. This one dripper lies with life span from minus 1 to 1. Actually, we have such equality. And then the limit of the entire solution is actually this way. So since it's also a solution, Since it's also a solution, submit it, substitute it into the equation, we have this limit. In summary, we have such a results. For the one-dimensional case, we see that u goes to infinity and we can have a uniform interior estimate. And with the help of this, we can show the convergence of the geothermal. convergence of the real solution to such a tremor wave. The limit does not contact the boundary. But the convergence is only takes place inside. I forget to mention that above we just consider symmetric solutions. For non-symmetric ones we can use symmetric ones to sandwich Once to find which the real solution to also give the uniform coordinate estimate near the boundary. For five-dimensional cliffs, the equation reduced to such a one. The radiosymmetric velocity satisfy this equation, also with such low-brain boundary conditions. And this problem also has a lot of terminal waves with such. Of tremor waves with such a form, and the C and the profile satisfy this ODE, and the profile now looks like this. The difference between this and the one-dimension case is that in one dimension case, it has a bounded lifespan, but now the lifespan is unbounded. Moreover, as R goes to infinity, y looks like a paraboliad. like a paraboliad for small c the profile looks like this and for large c it looks like this at any and at any point fixed point when c goes to with c becomes larger and larger the flow is also larger and larger So, as in the wind image case, we want to know the sympathetic limit of the radio symmetric. So, when T goes to becomes larger and larger, it becomes steeper and steeper on the boundary. However, we can use travel waves as any. Traveling waves as in YDP to compare with this zero solution and the tremor wave, we see that the zero solution is steeper than the tremonic wave. So this means this one and larger than this one. But when t goes to infinity, we use another steeper, another large C2, another large term of the wave. Consider the intersection points. See that it can be steeper than this one, not only steeper than this one, but also steeper than this one. So C2 can become larger and larger. So actually, we have unboundedness for this. This is different from the 1D case. In 1D case, we have a limit by zero. By general the profile to control the to control the to give the upper bound for this grid. But now we have no limit. So zero solution becomes steeper and steeper, just like the traveling waves with larger and larger speed. So intuitively, the So intuitively, the real solution itself becomes vertical lie looks like this. We cannot expect to show a profile, a limited profile for this yield. On the other hand, we can show that the content of this one has a limit. As a limit, and so using this, we see that you converge to this limit. So, this we consider the equation for this cushion. It sets by such a quadrilinear parabolic equation. And also, we consider initial data from W0 lies between 0 and 1. And also, consider the initial data 0. The initial data zero and y, we contain the three solutions, and actually, this is a lower solution and it moves upward monotonically. And so, it converts to some decision-making one. It converts, it increases and converts to some limit. Also, this one decreases monotonically and converges to some limit. All of them satisfy the familiar equation, but the denominator of this part converts to infinity because u goes to infinity. W is bounded from below, bounded from away from Away from zero. So, this solution is not a uniformly parabolic one, and we cannot hope to have a standard RP estimate or shoulder estimate for the breathings. However, we can still have some results from Ladisitka's work that there is an interior. Uh interior uniform coordinate estimate. And so we can have the convergence locally uniformly in a locally uniformly way. And then we regard the solution as a weak one and it affected by this equation and this. And this one and this one is bounded, and the denominator goes to infinity. So this part goes to zero. Actually, finally, the limit as t goes to infinity, we only have this. The limit of w is v star, we have this one. So the limit signifies that this is a constant. And by And by using the boundary condition, we actually see that this limit is R. And then using this limit, we show that W equals has such a form and substitute into the equation. We see that C prime equals minus one, n minus one C, and then we get the R. We have no. Real. We have no time to think of the non-GDS metric. If we just mention that omega is strictly convex, it is studied by many authors. And for non-convex case, no study. And also for unbounded Unbounded boundary slopes, we have no idea till now. In fact, we have no idea. We have no direct for unbounded boundary slopes. But for non-convex case, when we put a large driving force here, we can show such a real force. When A is large enough, we can deal with the non-convexity. non-convexity and to obtain uniform reading estimate and so the convergent to travel wave in this case we cannot use the zero number argument we hope we can use but we have no idea we use standard uh uh method to construct uh auxiliary functions like this looks like this and like this and consider its maximum point and It's maximum point and so by very complicated calculation that at the interior maximum point this phi satisfy this one but also satisfy this one when a is larger if this is impossible so we can so the maximum point of phi must uh uh be obtained on the boundary so we can get the uniform coefficient. In summary, In summary, with such a lobby boundary condition, we show by zero number argument the uniform interior coordinate estimate and the convergence of u to a one-dripper. And for high-dimensional radiosymmetric case, we obtain similarly, also obtain some results. But for non-radiosymetric case, we have no results till now. But only for bounded boundary solutions. Uh, bounded boundary slope cases. Uh, sorry, uh, I uh my time is over. Thank you. There are some quick questions for anyone in Zoom, any quick question for Bendo in your talk. So in your talk, you assumed that robot boundary point has left-hand side and right-hand side is probably all I cannot hear clearly. So, in your project. So, in your boundary condition, so symmetry. So, if you change a little bit, then asymmetry cases, can you apply the method or not? But because as a result of archura, I'm can apply the known I'm not so sure. I got radiosymmetric or not, but in any one case with different problem parameters on each boundary. Did you did you get the question, Bendo? Oh, no, no, sorry. Okay, maybe you can continue the discussion afterwards because of a carbon limit, Bendel. Maybe so we stop now with you. Okay, let's thank Bendel again. Oh, okay, thank you. So it will be what we discuss with them now. Francois, are you online? Yes, I am. Oh, hi. Can you see me? Yeah. Yeah, okay. We can see you.
