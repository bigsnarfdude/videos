The speaker has agreed to take questions during the talk. There will be no QA after the talk. So, if you have questions or comments, please unmute yourself. Or if you rather write questions in the chat box, please do so. I'll try to pay attention to the chat and then call them out. Okay, so please start. Thank you very much for the introduction and the invitation to speak here. So, I will speak about Katana Keller. So I will speak about Cortana-Keller manifolds, which is the scalar geometry of n equal to supergravity coupled to hypermultiplets. So this is a physical motivation to consider such geometries, but it's also interesting from a mathematical point of view. And I will focus on some mathematical properties of examples. Oops, okay, yeah, so now it works. So, let me first recall what is a quaternionic Kehler manifold. So, this is precisely the analog of the notion of a Kehler manifold. If you replace the complex structure by a quaternionic structure. So, the precise definition is that there exists a parallel and skew-symmetric, almost quaternionic structure on a Riemannian manifold. So, you have a Riemannian metric G. Here to exclude some special. For to exclude some special cases, we assume that the scalar curvature is non-zero, and then the assumption is just that you are given such parallel skew symmetric almost quartagionic structure. This definition is very good in dimensions eight and higher, but in four dimensions it is not sufficient. So, in four dimensions, you need to add some additional conditions to obtain the definition of a quaternion Keller manifold. So, for completeness, I also mentioned the four-dimensional case. Case, I have a problem in switching to the next page, so I don't know why. If you do, if you quit non-screen more, even though it shows border, but you might be able to handle that better. Okay. This happens often if you use full screen mode. So you can just quit the mode. The mode. Yeah, but even the escape is not. Ah, now the escape is working. Yeah, so it's not very convenient. So it's the first time I have this problem. Okay, let me let me. I suppose you can just scroll this through. We can read your slide very okay with this in this way. If we just scroll through it. Let me try. Well let me try another oops sorry yeah so scrolling works nice now. Okay so this this was the definition of a Potagnione Keller manifold. So in four dimensions it's just a half conformally flat Einstein manifold and half conformally flat means that half of the while tensor vanishes and so some well And so some well-known facts about quaternion-Keller manifolds is that they are Einstein, and the holonomic group is a subgroup of the group Spn times Sp1, where Sp1 is the usual notation for the group of unit quaternions acting on a quaternionic vector space, and Spn is its normalizer in the orthogonal group in 4n real variables. So, up to homo 30, it's known that there are only finitely many. It's known that there are only finitely many complete quaternionic Kalar manifolds of positive scalar curvature. So we can distinguish positive and negative scalar curvature and positive scalar curvature. It's known that there are only finitely many in every dimension. But these finitely many examples are possibly not all known. So there's a conjecture that these finitely many examples should be exhausted by Cartagnone-Kehler symmetric spaces of compact type. So this is a Lebron-Salamon conjecture. Lebron-Salomon conjecture. But a priori, there might be more, but only a finite number of examples in every dimension. For negative scalar curvature, the situation is completely different. So we know for a long time, so the first examples were already constructed in the 70s by Alexievsky. So we know that there are many examples of complete quaternionic Keller manifolds of negative scale. Manifolds of negative scalar curvature. But still, we don't know any examples which are compact or, more generally, of finite volume other than locally symmetric spaces. So, this is the state of the art today, that all known examples of finite volume are locally symmetric. So, they are of either two types. So, they are either symmetric spaces of compact type, these are, of course, compact, or they are. Compact, or they are quotients of symmetric spaces of non-compact type. So, where you take a non-compact space and then divide by a co-compact lattice. And so, this exhausts all known examples until today. And so, this should be compared with the situation for other holonomy groups from Berger's list. So, you may know that Marcel Berger classified the possible holonomic groups of Riemannian. possible holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. So these are the groups generated by parallel transport along closed loops in the Riemannian manifold based at some base point. And the surprising thing is that the list of such groups is rather small if you exclude all groups which come from symmetric spaces. So you have the classification of symmetric spaces and there you can easily determine the holonomy group for each of these examples. And there are many such And there are many such holonomy groups, and they occur in infinite series. But if you exclude these known examples, and then the remaining possible holonomy groups form a very short list, and each of these groups is very well known to mathematicians and physicists alike. So they include such groups like SUN, which defines the Calabiao manifolds, like SPN, hypercalor manifolds, and also G2 and SPIN7, which define exotic holonomies. And for each of And for each of these groups, there are by now we have compact examples. So these are due to Yao, Bovil, and Joyce in the Ricci-Flatt case. So for all these examples. So the only case which remains open with respect to this problem is really the group sp1 times spn. And so there has been no example until now. And there we only have these conjectures. only have these conjectures, or at least for positive scalar curvature, we have a conjecture, for negative, there's not even a conjecture. And so the problem is to know if there are complete non-locally symmetric Patagonians Keller manifolds of finite volume or more generally with an end of finite volume. I think this is also interesting in the context of the swampland where there are conjectures about scale affected field theories and the geometry thereof. So some So, some conditions which say that the space should be non-compact and of finite volume. So, of course, it would be interesting to know if, for instance, with this kind of scalar geometry, it is possible to have examples of finite volume which are not already locally symmetric. So, here's a construction. So, we have a construction to propose. And so, I will explain the different steps of the construction and then go through the steps in a series of examples. Go through the steps in a series of examples. So, show that all these steps can, in fact, be realized. So, the idea is to start simply with a quaternion-Kehler symmetric space of non-compact type. So, these are very well-known spaces, and we know that they have compact quotients. This is due to Borel. So, where gamma is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the symmetric space. And then we want to deform the space X. This means deform the metric. Deform the metric, the quaternionic Kala metric, such that it is no longer a homogeneous space but still quaternionic Kala and complete. So, we want to preserve these nice special geometric properties, but it should no longer be a homogeneous space. So, we want to deform it away from the homogeneous example. And then we hope that we can do this in a controlled way, such that the deformed space has still a large group of isometries. So, one should not. Group of isometries, so one should not deform it in a brutal way but preserve as much of symmetries as possible and in such a way that we have a large group G of isometries and that this group still has a lattice gamma. So gamma def is a lattice in the group G which acts on the deformed space. And so a large group could mean, for instance, that it acts with cohomogeneity one. This means that the orbits are hypersurfaces, so of course Orbits are hypersurfaces, so of course one, and the orbit space is one-dimensional. And let us assume that the orbit space is a real is diffomorphic to the real line. In fact, it can be proven that it must be diffimorphic to the real line. And then we will also hope that we can find the lattice gamma def, which is co-compact in the group G. Then in this very special situation, the quotient of the deformed quaternion-Keller manifold xd. Quatanion Keller manifold X def by the lattice gamma def in the group G is a manifold which has a cylindrical shape. So it's topologically it's a cylinder product of a real line with some manifold, in fact a compact manifold, and it has precisely two ends, which correspond to the two ends of the real line. And so then we are left with the problem of computing the volume of the ends. So if we find that one of the ends has finite volume, then we have The end says finite volume, then we have succeeded in finding an example with an end of finite volume. So, this is a very naive idea, but it turns out that it really works. If you do all right and choose the right spaces, then you can really perform all these steps. Okay, so this is the series of examples with which we start. So, we take these quarten unique symmetric spaces. So, this series is a dual. So, this series is a dual to the space of to the complex Grassmannians of two planes in the complex space of dimension m plus two, which is one of the compact symmetric spaces which are Cortana-Keller and this one is non-compact. And in fact, this series is privileged in some sense because it's the only together with the compact duals, these are the only ones which are at the same time Kela and Cotagnone Kela. So typically, these two properties are not constant. Properties are not consistent, but in this case, for this series, it has the same both properties. It's a KLA manifold for some complex structure, and at the same time, it is quaternionic Kela. And moreover, it is an example of what is known as a C-map space. So there's an old construction going back to Ferrara and Sapaval, where they write down some general metric from dimensional reduction of supergravity. And these type of metrics have a one-loop deformation, which Have a one-loop deformation, which was described by Rovers Jana, Sauer, Estegen van Doren back in 2006, generalizing results which were previously found for the universal hypermultiple in four dimensions by Antoniadis, Minasian, Thyssen, and van Robert. So this means that we not only have a symmetric space, we already have a candidate for the deformation. So this is the candidate. And of course, for mathematicians, it's interesting to understand why. Mathematician, it's interesting to understand why this metric is called Tanya Nikela without invoking supersymmetry. And in fact, in the study of this type of metrics, we have found that there's a geometric construction providing a proof that these one-loop deformations are always, of C-MAP spaces, are always Cortana-Kala. So, this is joint work with Alexievsky and Mohaupt and also with Dick Mans. And it relies on a relation between hyperkala geometry. Between hyperkelar geometry and quaternionic Kalar geometry, which is known as the HKQK correspondence. So, this goes back to Andrei Heidis' idea, but he studied originally only positive definite hyperkalar manifolds and positive definite quaternion-Kalar manifolds. And to obtain the C map and its one-loop deformation, you need to allow indefinite hypercalar manifolds, and then you need to control the signs of various functions to get the quaternion-Kalar manifold in the end. The quaternionic Keyl manifold in the end, a positive definite. So you start with an indefinite hyperkeler manifold, but you obtain a positive definite quaternionic Kehler manifold. And in this way, you can obtain the C map and it's one loop deformation, which proves that these spaces are really quaternionic Keyler. So we have one of these properties, which was in this program, which I'm working down now. So the next property, which I wanted to have, is the completeness. And in fact, we know The completeness, and in fact, we know also that these spaces are complete if the one loop parameter is non-negative. So, this depends just on the sign of this parameter. If it's zero, we have the undeformed space, a symmetric space, which is of course complete. And if we deform only in positive directions, then it stays complete. So, you should not deform in negative directions if you want to complete Cortani Keller manifold. Yeah, here, just for illustration to show you that these metrics are really completely explicit. This is the simplest case in n equals one. So this means four dimensions. So n is the quaternionic dimension, if you like. This is the explicit metric. So it is not too complicated in real coordinates in R4. And for C equals zero, this metric is the complex hyperbolic plane. metric is the complex hyperbolic plane metric. So we may ask, can one characterize this metric at least in four dimensions? I think it's good to situate the problem to give this characterization. So in four dimensions, this family of metrics can be proven to be the only complete quaternionic Keynes manifolds with the principal isometric action of the Heisenberg group. So they are characterized by this property. Characterized by this property. So there are no other Partner Nikkela manifolds in four dimensions with this property. And more generally, if you allow, instead of Partner Nikkela, if you allow more generally Einstein, complete Einstein manifolds with the principal isometric action of the Heisenberg group, then under the additional assumption that you have, in addition to the Heisenberg group, an SO2 symmetry, then you get the same result. So these manifolds are also. So, these manifolds are also unique in the class of complete Einstein four manifolds with principal isometric Heisenberg action and additional SO2 symmetry. So, here's the metric in higher dimensions. So, there it turns out that it's useful to use complex coordinates. So, these W in here are complex coordinates. Let me first explain what is the manifold on which the metric is defined. So, V is the ball. So V is a ball in n plus one complex dimensions. So it is here, it's just a ball. And then we have this trivial bundle over the ball where the fiber has dimension n plus complex dimension n plus one. So we have C star and Cn. Cn here is parametrized by these complex coordinates W. So WA, as you see here, goes from one to n minus one, but then we have also W0. So in total, it's n. So, in total, it's n complex variables, and C comes from combining this variable rho, which is known as the dilaton, with this axion phi tilde. So, this again show, you see that the metric is fully explicit, and it is, you can consider it as a fiber bundle over the complex hyperbolic space. So, the base, the base manifold here, the ball, has a complex hyperbolic metric. So, this is explicit. So, this is the explicit form of a complex hyperbolic metric, and we see here the parameter C appearing. If you put C equals zero, you get the symmetric space with which I started, this SU2, N modulo maxima compact subgroup. And so I think one question which you can ask is: okay, you wrote now some metric which looks a bit complicated depending on a parameter C, but perhaps this metric is just. C, but perhaps this metric is just isometric to the symmetric space, and you have just made some complicated change of coordinates and have not really changed the geometric nature of the manifold. And of course, this is a serious question which you should ask for any, whenever you have some solution or some theory or something of some metric, you should ask this question whether you are just writing some known metric in new coordinates and it's only apparently And it's only apparently new. But here we can exclude that this is the case. We can prove that this one-loop deformation is, in fact, non-isometric. So if we take the positive parameter, then it is not isometric to the undeformed metric. And the reason is simply that there exists a non-constant scalar-valued curvature invariant. So if you have an invariant, then of course it is invariant under any isometry. And if you had an And if you had a group of isometries acting transitively, or even with an open orbit, then this would imply that the function is constant, but we have a non-constant curvature invariant. In fact, this scalar curvature invariant is not the Ricci scalar, because Ricci scalar is, of course, constant for an Einstein manifold. So instead, we take the norm squared of the Riemann tensor. That's the invariant which we compute. That's the invariant which we compute for the series, and we show that it is not constant as soon as the parameter is strictly positive. So excuse me. So not being homogeneous does not necessarily mean that there is no isometry. No, no, I'm not saying, no, there are many isometries. Oh, okay. There are many isometries. Sorry? So they still have isometries. They have many isometries. Yeah, they have many isometries, in fact, cohomogeneity one group of isometries, but this group is not big enough to be transitive. It's not big enough to have an open orbit. So this means that the manifold is everywhere locally inhomogeneous. So inhomogeneous means that there's no transitive group of isometries. And so this is the case even locally everywhere on the manifold. So in particular, this manifold cannot be isometric to the simulation. Cannot be isometric to the symmetric space which we deformed. Okay, so this is comforting. So we are on the right track. But still, here in answer to your question, we still have a large group of isometries. In fact, a group which acts with cohomogeneity one. So the orbits of this group are hypersurfaces, but they are not open. So the space is not homogeneous. And we can compute the We can compute the group. In fact, first we computed in this previous theorem, practically the Lie algebra of the group, and this was big enough to show this co-homogeneity one property. But then in joint work with Goersa, we even computed explicitly the group. And we showed that the group is closed in the full isometry group of the manifold and has precisely this structure. So it's a semi-direct product of some special unitary group. In fact, here's a Special unitary group. In fact, here's the universal covering of the special unitary group with the Heisenberg group. So we have a natural action of the special unitary group on the Heisenberg group, because Heisenberg group is a central extension of a symplectic vector space, and the SU1N minus 1 acts by symplectic transformation on its defining representation. So, in this way, we have such a semi-direct product, and we have to divide the cyclic subgroup, which is diagonally. Subgroup which is diagonally embedded. So, this is what we find after a detailed analysis of the group. So, we have the group. And now, what remains to be discussed in the program which I announced is lattices in this group. So, whether we can find lattices in GE. But before I do this, just for illustration, I show you the algebra of killing fields. So, they can be. So they can be, I think a short way to describe it is as follows. So we consider these complex valued fields and then take the real and imaginary parts and also brackets of those real fields. And this will generate the full algebra SU1 and minus 1 acting on this one loop deformed CMAP space. And the Heisenberg algebra has this very nice and simple form. So again, by taking real intimate. form. So again, by taking real and imaginary parts. And in addition, you have to take the partial derivative vector field d over d phi tilde, which corresponds to center. And this way you get the Heisenberg algebra. And then from this algebra of killing fields, you have to integrate it and find the group. And that's what we did. And you may ask whether there are more killing fields. And in fact, there is one additional. And in fact, there is one additional killing field which is always there, which enlarges this algebra to u1 in minus 1 times Heisenberg. So you can replace the special unitary by the pseudo-unitary algebra. But then you cannot enlarge it further, at least not in four dimensions. So, in four dimensions, we prove that this is the full, that the corresponding connected group is the maximal connected group of isometries and the full group of isometries. Isometries and the full group of isometries is non-connected and has precisely two connected components. So, this is all known now. And now, about the lattices. So, with Roersa and Tung, we show that for every dimension, there exists a lattice in the group G. So, G was this essentially a semi-direct product of the pseudo-unitary group and the Heisenberg group. So, there exists always a lattice in this group. Always a lattice in this group, such that when you take the quotient of your deformed Britannionic Keller manifold by the group gamma, you get topologically a cylinder. And the fibers of this cylinder are of finite volume. So they depend, of course, on T, since the metric depends on everything. So they are not all isometric, but they are all of finite volume. And you can study the domain. And you can study the domain where the parameter t in this real line is larger than some number t0 or smaller than some t0. And it turns out that the volume of the domain where t is larger than t zero is finite, whereas the volume of the other domain where t is smaller than t zero is infinite. So we have two different types of n's which which are distinguished by the By the volume. In fact, I should not say ends because this will be only ends in the technical sense of the term if this cross-section K is compact. And this is the case when N is smaller or equal to 2. So in four dimensions and eight dimensions, we show that there exists co-compact lattices, gamma. And then this cross-section of the cylinder is a compact space. And then we can call these two domains. Two domains, the two ends of the manifold. And so one is a finite volume, the other of infinite volume. So this is the main result of the work with Wolse and Tung. And so as a corollary, we obtain that indeed there exists complete locally inhomogeneous quaternionic Keller manifolds with an end of finite volume in dimensions four and eight. And here I give you the examples. So, just to let you see that these are really very nice, explicit examples. So, to describe the examples, it's convenient to consider instead of the universal covering and the quotient by this diagonally embedded cyclic group, it's convenient to consider just the semi-direct product of the special unitary group and the Heisenberg group. So, this is a certain quotient of our group of isometries G, and it acts on a cyclic quotient of our quaternionic K-like. Quotient of our quaternion Keller manifold, and it has certain nice properties, which I in fact use, for instance, to prove that the group is closed in the full isometry group. We use these properties. And then the lattice can be obtained as a semi-direct product of a lattice in the Heisenberg group with a lattice in the special unitary group. And more precisely, in the case n equal one, so for n equal one, you see that this. So, for any queen one, you see that this semi-simple part disappears, and you have just the three-dimensional Heisenberg group. And so, we have just a lattice in the three-dimensional Heisenberg group. This means that our manifolds, which we have constructed, are just diffeomorphic to a cylinder over a Niel manifold. So, this quotient of a three-dimensional Heisenberg group by the lattice gamma is an example of a Nil manifold, because Heisenberg is a new potent group. Group. In eight dimensions, the examples are more complicated. So it's not so easy to find co-compact lattices in higher dimensions. And okay, in eight dimensions, we succeeded in doing this, but this method doesn't extend to higher dimensions. And there are some obstructions to do this in higher dimensions. So it doesn't work in higher dimensions. But in eight dimensions, it's possible. So here's a construction of the co-compact lattice in SU11 semi-direct product with a five-dimensional. Direct product with the five-dimensional Heisenberg group. So you consider a prime number b and a natural number, which is not a square mod B. And then you can consider the integer span of these three or four matrices. You take the identity matrix and these matrices I, J, and K. So the square of I is A, the square of J is B, and the square of K is minus AB. And so we. And so, these types of algebras generated by such types of matrices are known as quaternion algebras. So, it's not the standard algebra of quaternions, but it's some sense similar, it's a similar construction. And we consider this over the integers. And then the lattice which we take in SU11 is obtained by intersecting this integer span of these four matrices with the group SU11. With the group SU11. And it turns out that this intersection can be described just by the equation determinant A equal to one. And this group acts co-compactly on the upper half plane. So it's a co-compact foxium group. And moreover, it preserves a lattice in the five-dimensional Heisenberg group under the action in the semi-direct product. So it's not only acts co-compactly on the symmetric spaces. Symmetric space associated with this semi-simple group, but it preserves also a lattice in the Heisenberg group, which means that it is good for our construction. And we can then take this semi-direct product of a lattice in the Heisenberg group and this Fuchsian group, gamma one. And in the construction, it's important to take the one-loop parameter in a particular way. So we choose it to be a rational multiple of square root of AB over pi. Of AB over pi to avoid some non-Hausdorff quotient. So this is also needed. And so this is these other examples. So you see, there are many such examples in eight dimensions. So these examples give these Quaternion Keller manifolds of dimension eight with two ends and one end, as I said, is a finite volume. So here. Volume. So, here are some comments about the computation of the volume. So, in fact, we compute the volume density and in the above coordinates. And it turns out that the volume density is just the invariant volume density on the orbits. So, you have this co-homogeneity one group. And there's on the group, there's an okay, so on the orbit of this group, there's an invariant volume. There's an invariant volume form, and this descends to the quotient by the lattice. And then the only problem is to study the dependence on the remaining variable on the dilaton. And this is exactly the expression for the dependence on the dilaton and on the one-loop parameter. So this is, and from this, you can deduce what is the total volume of the two ends. So for instance, when rho goes to infinity, To infinity, we see that we can ignore here these two factors, and only this first factor is relevant. And we can see immediately that the primitive of one over rho to power n plus two is given by some constant over rho to the power n plus one. So, this the volume will be asymptotically of this type, and so it is finite. It's finite. And on the other side, when you go with Other side, when you go with the whole to zero, then we have to distinguish two cases because then it's relevant whether the constant C is zero or not. If C is zero, so this corresponds to a symmetric space, we get a divergent volume with the variable rho one going to zero, as you see here. And the power is the same as before when we took the other limit for rho to infinity. But when C is But when C is different from zero, then you have a jump in the volume growth. So you have here much bigger power. So this distinguishes, so in some sense, this quantum correction distinguishes the properties of the volume, or you can distinguish the correction by looking at the volume growth along the end of infinite volume. Okay, so now in Okay, so now in the second part of the talk, or towards the end of the talk, I want to discuss some open problems. So just state as an open problem, the first question. I will not discuss it further now. So the question which I left open is whether there exists complete quartagion and Keller manifolds of dimension large or equal to 12 with a finite volume end in the technical sense of the term. So such that you have this compact cross-section in the construction. Compact cross-section in the construction that are not locally symmetric. So there might be other constructions by which you can get such examples in higher dimensions. So this is, we did not solve this problem. And the other question is whether one can use non-perturbative quantum corrections in string theory to construct complete quaternionic Keller manifolds of finite volume. This is a speculative question, but I think it fits well into this conference. Well, into this conference, and so the state of the art, please. Probably somebody forgot to somebody from meeting room. Is there anybody in the meeting room? Probably it's good to turn off the speaker in the meeting. Maybe the host can turn off the speaker. Okay. Okay, so I want. Okay, so I wanted to say that this study of these instantaneous corrections, I mean, the mathematical study is very complicated. And so there are many works from physicists, exclusively, I would say, on the instant corrections of quaternion Keyler metrics. So in particular, Alexander Pioline and many others. And we are from mathematics. Uh, we are from mathematics side, we are just starting to understand a little bit of all of this picture. So, I think there are many technical questions, even to define the metric and some this is absolutely not clear, let alone to study its properties. So, a well-defined quaternionic Keller metric has only been obtained in very special situations, so particularly as a paper with Ivan Tully, which I would like to mention, building on Mention building on previous work of Alexandrov and Banerjee from 2015. So, in this special setting of Enstantron corrections, we can define rigorously a quantagion Kehler metric. And with this method, we obtain a deformation of this finite volume end, which I described in a neighbor. So, we have a Cortagnion-Keller metric which deforms this one-loop deformation. Deforms this one loop deformed metric, including these mutually local variations of BPS structure. So these are certain types of instanton corrections, which I will discuss a little bit, explain what they mean. And the metric is defined in the neighborhood of rho equal infinity. So when this Gilaton variable goes to infinity. So it's even not defined on all of the manifold. It's just in the neighborhood of rho equal to infinity. But at least there we can rigorously define the metric. The metric. Okay, so at the moment, we don't know whether such metric can be extended to a complete quaternion Keller metric and when the volume of the extended metric is finite. But it's expected from the swampland picture that the volume should become finite after inclusion of all instanton corrections predicted by string theory if the metric describes an effective field theory consistently coupled to gravity at the quantum level. At the quantum level. So there are many ifs here. Okay, so perhaps it is conceivable that one can, by including non-perturbative quantum corrections, in the end, find a way to define a metric of finite volume. Okay, so I would like to explain a little bit the notions which enter in the construction. So I mentioned this variation of BPS structures, which encodes Which encodes this instanton corrections. So they are basically given by a complex, we have a complex manifold and a bundle of lattices, roughly speaking, lambda over m, endowed with some skew symmetric pairing and a holomorphic section of the associated complex vector bundle. So this holomorphic section is usually called the central charge in physics. And we have Physics and we have a function omega which is related for instance Donaldson Thomas invariance in a certain context, which is just a map which associates with every element in this lattice some number and which is symmetric with respect to multiplying with minus one and should satisfy the Koncevic-Sorbelmann wall crossing formula. In fact, I will not need this formula at all because the special situation which we are considering is a situation where Which we are considering is a situation where there are no walls and no wall crossing. So it's a simplified situation. And then there are some technical conditions. I think now it's too late to go into this technical conditions. So there are some admissibility conditions which ensure that in the end we get convergence for all the expressions. So using these assumptions we can prove convergence of the metric. And yeah, so this mutual local And yeah, so this mutual locality is very important, an assumption which we make. So basically, we are assuming that the skew pairing is zero on the support of the function omega. So when these BPS indices omega are different from zero, then you always have the pairing equal to zero. And this is a very helpful condition. So this mutual locality implies that there are no walls. Locality implies that there are no walls of marginal stability. So the walls are defined here, they are empty in our setting. And the only remnant of the wall crossing is simply that these functions omega, which are defined on the set, set functions, that they are constant for every local section of the letters. And in the particular application which we do, this place manifold, this complex manifold is a Manifold, this complex manifold is the so-called conical affine special Keller manifold. And the lattice lambda is the lattice invariant under parallel transport under the flat connection of this conical affine special Keller manifold. And Z is a very important object in special Keller geometry. It's a conical Kalerian Lagrangian section. So in some sense, it is a map which defines the special Kalar geometry on M. So which you can use to define the special Kela geometry. And from all Geometry and from all this, you in the end you can extract this metric. So, this is the explicit form. I think it is, we have no time to go into the details of all these symbols, but you see it fits in half a page together with some explanations which cover the rest of the page and a little bit of the next page. But instead of explaining all these symbols to you, which would take too long, I would like to explain the main. To explain the main idea of how we obtain this metric and how we prove that it's got an uniquela. In fact, we use the construction joint with Alexierski, Mohaupt, and Dickmans and apply it to an indefinite hypercala metric, which is written here in very compact form. So, this metric already includes the instanton corrections at this hypercalar level. And then we apply the construction, obtaining a quaternion Kela. A Cortana Keller metric. So, what is the structure of the hyperkela manifold? So, you see, this is the hyperkela manifold. It looks formally almost the same as the so-called rigid C-MAP metric, which was introduced by Chicotti Ferrara-Girardello. So, these ignore these factors. These are just to match various conventions of different authors. They are not important at all. So, Nij is the imaginary part of second derivatives of the holomorphic. Of second derivatives of the holomorphic repotential in the models, you know. And these W i's are exactly these combinations of the differentials of fiber coordinates theta in the direction of the tangent bundle where we are dividing out the lattice lambda star. And then all of this is deformed. So these n's are deformed to m as it is written here by adding some instanton contribution. Adding some instanton contributions to the metric matrix, but also adding instanton contributions to these differentials. And these instanton contributions depend on the variation of BPS structure. I mean, they are written explicitly on the previous page, and they include infinite sums and so on, and Bessel functions. It is too long to explain the details, but this is the rough structure. And then what we find is that And then what we find is that we have a rotating killing field for this instantaneous corrected indefinite hyper K large. How many more minutes do you think you need? I'm already over time. I think I can almost finish with this. I think two minutes will be sufficient. Is two minutes okay? Okay, so we find that we have a rotating killing field. It has a very clear geometric origin from the Clear geometric origin from the conical affine special keler manifold. It is Hamiltonian. So we have a Hamiltonian function which encodes also the instant corrections. And we find that a certain set where the functions have some prescribed sign is non-empty. And therefore, we can apply the construction joint with Alexievsky and Mohaup and can define a hyperholomorphic connection, which is part of the construction. The construction and obtain in the end the here's the metric as it appears in the construction. This is the metric. And if you do a direct calculation, inserting all these explicit expressions with instant corrections, you find the explicit form which I gave before. So, this is all what I wanted to present. So, thank you for your patience. I'm going a little bit over time. No, not very much, but. No, not very much, but thank you very much for your very nice, interesting presentation and the result. So we had some questions during the talk, and we don't have formally Q ⁇ A, but if there is one urgent question, and it seems like Mariana as an organizer has one, so please. I'm not sure if it's urgent, but can you take this one loop parameter continuously to zero or it's always fixed? It's always fixed, yeah. No, no, no, you can take it continuously to zero, and then the isometry type jumps. So, in fact, this parameter is only important whether it's zero or positive. The precise value is not important. In fact, we can show that any two of these metrics for C positive are isometric. But can you always find the lattice with a, or in order to have a lattice, it needs no no, you can't do that. No, no, this is not possible. No, no, this is not possible. And the reason, so now I understand why you're asking this. So this is not possible. In fact, there is a no-go theorem, if you like. So this locally symmetric space, which is compact, cannot be deformed. So we cannot deform the compact space. We can only deform the universal covering. And that's that's why it's so difficult to get the finite volume. And in fact, we only succeeded in getting an end of finite volume, but not the whole manifold. So it's still open. The whole manifold, so it's still open. I see. Thank you for your question. Okay, in view of time, probably this was the last question. So thank you, Vicente, again for the very nice talk. You're very welcome. Okay.
