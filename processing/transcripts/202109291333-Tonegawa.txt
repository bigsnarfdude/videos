Existence of canonical multi-phase mean curvature flows. Thank you. Okay, yeah, thank you for the invitation. It's a great pleasure to give a talk here. It's just that the time is a bit different. You realize why you have a jelly when you go to bound back. Okay, so that there is this existence of character multiphys Nicaragua flow. Carnegie Multiphase Nicaragua Flow. And this is a joint work with Salvador Stibert and Padley with Damien Kemp. Okay, so let me just go quickly. This talk is about this multi-phase mean cover flow. Well, a lot of people work on the mean cover flow of two-phase in the context that I'm going to talk about, but the one that I'm talking about is the multi-phase. So you have a serial. The multi-phase, so you have several phases or grains, I may say either way, and they're evolving by mean curvature. And so you think this as a boundary of sets. And the mean coverage, obviously, not everybody knows that normal velocity is mean coverage vector, and V is a velocity, and H is mean coverage vector in my talk. Talk. And I think everyone knows that the mean curves is a gradient law of the area. Hn is an n-dimensional household measure in my talk. You have this dissipation, energy dissipation law. And the one that I like to show the existence is this type of flow that has grains and there will be a lot of topological changes. Changes and then you can have this picture in mind. So, that and what we claim is that we basically show the existence of this type of solutions for global in time as well. Okay, so before I go into the main results, I'd like to tell you about some various notions of the encouragement flow, but particularly three notions. One is a well-known level set solutions of events tracking changing. Of Ivan Sprach and Chang Yegoto. And this is given by this Scala nonlinear PDE. Each double set is supposed to be moving by mean curvature flow. The solution is unique, but as everybody knows, this has this so-called fattening phenomena whenever you have a singularity. And also this formulation is just for two-phase. Of course, in many interesting problems, already two-phase is a very difficult question. Two-phase is very difficult problem. So, but anyway, you can't make a multi-phase problem with this level set solutions. And the next, I'd like to mention this bounded variation solution due to Lookhaus and Sturzen Hecker. This one is a family of sets of finite parameters, Et, and you have the scalar velocity with this parameter. As this parameter set. And the way you formulate is the following. So, first, you ask for any vector fields and almost all time, the divergence of this phi integrated over this reduced boundary of ET is, you ask this to be equal to minus of the phi dot this velocity dot nu. Nu is the x, the unit normal of this reduced boundary. Normal of this reduced value. So, this is basically asking this the following that is velocity is equal to h dot the unit normal. If you think about this, this is a function variation formula. And if everything is nice, this part is going to be a mean cover vector. So, asking this would be just asking this is equal to mean coverage of new. And the other one that you ask is. and the other one that you ask is this uh you know this equality for any test function z uh you ask the time derivative of z integrated over the e t plus the uh b times xi integrated over the reduced boundary this is equal to zero so this is uh what this is saying is this is that the time derivative of the characteristic function is equal to basically v so this is a weak formulation of Formulation of this relationship: that the characteristic time the characteristic function is equal to V times the n-dimensional half-traft measure on the reduced boundary. So, this is, in some sense, a weak formulation of v is the velocity of the motion of this reduced boundary. So, this combine these two, this is you see that the v is roughly, well, actually in a weak sense, real say v is equal to h. Equal to h. So that's one way. And now this formulation, you can make it to a multi-phase setting by just having more cleft functions. But so far, the results of the lookout Susan Hecker and also there is recent work by Lowe and Otto existence results with somewhat conditional existence. I don't want to go into this. I don't want to go into this in detail, but so there's a multi-phase, but existence without this has been somehow insufficient. Now, the benefit solution is another one that I'd like to mention. The bracket law is the one that you have a surface measure, basically mu t is endemic, so measure restricted to the surface times you allow also integer mortificity. You allow also integer mortificity, and this has generalized mean curvature, that's the requirement. And you ask this so-called bracket inequality to be satisfied. I don't want to really go into this much, but this inequality, at least formally, tells you that the mean curvature is equal to the normal velocity of this surface measure. Now, this one comes with a very satisfactory local regularity theory. Local regularity theory, but no uniqueness. Well, because of this inequality, you don't expect the uniqueness, really. You can have a sudden vanishing, for example. Now, these two notions, well, okay, so dealing with multi-phase problem, I need to take either two or three. And these two and three are actually do not seem to imply one, one does not imply the other somehow, in either way. okay uh so okay so uh the i there are two recent development one is the uh it's uh our result that but it's a it's a time growth existence of non-trivial multi-phase bracket flow that I did a few years ago with SCIM. This is obtained, the bracket flow is obtained at the boundary of grains. And nice things about this result is that this grains moves continuously in the Vegue measure. In Lebesgue measure, so you know that there has to be some non-trivial bracket flow. So, um, now the other one is even more recent is the work by Fisher Handel, these three, four people about this weak, so-called weak strong uniqueness. What they proved is that, at least for dimension one and also recently dimension two, they have some results, that any V V solution starting from a regular network A regular network initial datum must coincide with a regular curvature flow. So, this is what they proved is that the VB solutions in the multi-phase setting, so it's slightly different from what I just described, but in a multi-phase version, they proved that this if you have a weak BV solution, then it has to be unique as far as you have a regular solution. And the idea of proof is. And the idea of proof is, I just mentioned this keyword of gradient flow calibration. They constructed some type of calibration and show that you have any just having these VV solutions. It's more like an entropy method of sort. And so the one that I'd like to tell you about today is the joint work with Civil the Following. So we show We saw recently that for general initial data, just rectifiable sets basically, there exists a multi-phase mean coverage flow, which is actually both bracket flow and also a BB solution in a generalized sense and time globally. So what we had before with this, the one with Kim, was bracketable, but actually we could prove that these grains is also a BV solution. Also, a VV solutions in a way that I tell you exactly. So, with the mount condition initial data, which I'll tell you, they are at least, okay, so here is a generalized view social. So, it's actually not exactly viewed society, but if we assume a little bit of a little assumption on the initial data, which allow in particular networks and various reasonable singularity. Reasonable singularity for initial data, you can make sure that for short time at least that it stays bracket law as well as a real DV solution, not generalized DV solution, but real one. And so in fact, it's not a surprising first, but it's actually the first existence result for the multi the V V solutions actually, even well actually for general. for for general general general data and um uh yeah uh so uh before it was sort of conditional but now you we have the real uh existential uh we don't have any uniqueness but um i think what we constructed has a better chance of being unique uh in suitable sense and uh we might want to call this as a canonical um in coverage of law okay Coverage of law. Okay, so let me just tell you exactly what the assumptions are and what the results are. So, assumption is that you have a n capital N and you have an N non-empty mutual disjoint open set. So it's just like what we saw in the picture. And gamma zero is the complement of this open set. And this, I assume this is bounded. It does have to be actually bounded, but just for simplicity for this talk. For simplicity for this talk, just as impounded, and also n-dimensional household measure is finite. And the three is the topological boundary of these grains is equal to the reduced boundary of these grains. So that's actually also, we don't need this, but just easier to explain this way. So this means that you don't have any sets like this sitting in. Sets like this sitting inside of the set. Okay, so this is the kind of things I don't want. So I assume that the topological boundary and reduced boundary is the same measure theoretically. So these are the assumptions. And under this assumption, we basically have the existence results. So there exists a bracket law and also a moving range such that you start out with basically with this given With this given international house of measure. So it's continuous at the t equal to zero. And this grains start out with this given grains. And it's a bracket flow, so satisfy this inequality. And also, there's various definitions I skip as a bracket law. And also, you have an energy, energy law, these are ones. This tells you energy. This tells you energy dissipation is mean to the square. And these grains are mutually disjoint open sets. And if you write the conformant as gamma t, the n-dimensional household measure of gamma t is finite, and in fact, actually less than or equal to this total energy. And for almost all time, this topological boundary, topological boundary in the support of this measure. the support of this measure and basically coincide up to dimension up to a small set. So you can actually say that this bracket flow is nothing but just a topological boundary, n-dimensional house of measure restricted topological boundary times the sum integer male physicians for almost all time. Okay and let's see if we also okay so this is a BV characterization. So So for each i, you saw that it's something similar, but slightly different. Here, the v is at this point, it's already h dot nu. Okay, so this means that this velocity of the reduced boundary is given by basically h dot nu. Okay, so this is true for each grain. And in particular, this formula gives you the change. Gives you the formula for the change of the volume of each grains. If you integrate this, basically, you get this formula that the difference of the measure of the grains is given by just the integration of the mean curvature over the reduced boundaries, which, of course, you expect if everything is smooth. Certainly, this should be true because if it's smooth, then the change of the border. Smooth, then the change of the volume is given by the integration of the mean curvature. But with this setting, it's actually very non-trivial to prove this. Okay, so for and the other thing is for if you know that it's this bracket law is so-called unit density flow, that is the integer mass species one almost everywhere and almost all time. Then this mu t is nothing but just n-dimensional. N-dimensional measure restricted to the reduced boundary. So the point is here, it's not a topological boundary, but the reduced boundary. So there is no left out sort of topological boundary, which does not belong to the reduced boundary. It's just precisely the reduced boundary. Okay, now this three, in some sense, is not exactly, well, I think I didn't explain what the V source is. I think I didn't explain what the VB solution is precisely for multi-phase solutions, so it's not so clear. But this is in some sense, it's not BV solution, strictly speaking, but more like a generalized PV solutions. But once you have a unit density, then it's actually precisely PV solutions. So, okay, anyway, so this is, you might think that this is a new V. You might think that this is a new VB solution formulation, but anyway, so it's slightly different from the classical VB solution formulation. All right. So let me add a few more conclusions. For dimension one, we have extra regularity for this support of this bracket flow. We know that for dimension one, under the way that we construct these solutions, we know that for almost all time, That for almost all time. In fact, this support of mu t is actually quite regular. It's a w to two curves, so meaning mean curves L2 or purpose A L2. And even the, you know the endpoints has to be meet with relatively precisely in a way that it's like a regular junction, except that it's a bit degenerate. So you can have something, the only possible configuration. The only possible configuration locally you have is this triple junction, this 60 degree and 120 degree junctions and 60 degree junction like this. This is like a degenerate hexagonal configuration, in fact. And the other possibility is something like this. I'm not saying this is going to happen, but that's only possible configuration you can have locally. And if it's two-phase, then there's the only way that the curves can The curves can come together, it's actually transversal, no transversal crossing, sorry, only zero-degree crossing. So, none of these can happen actually in two-phase case. And the sixth is if you assume some additional assumption on the initial data, such as this, I don't want to go into this too much, but then you know that for there is a short time that the bracket flow stays unit. Bracket flow stays unit density. And in that case, we know that there exists a BB solution for at least a short time. Okay, so I just add a few more remarks. For unit-density bracket flow, which we know under suitable assumption exists for short time, there is a partial regularity theory that tells you that this gamma t is actually almost everywhere and almost all time it's smooth. It's smooth. Okay, so that's nice. And for dimension two, in fact, that's more or less concerning the Alenkai equation and the limit. Well, we have a measure and also actually phase function as a limit of the Alenka equation. In fact, in retrospect, actually, there is the result I... The result I told you about is actually, you can derive this also for the limit of anka equation to the work of people like Imanen and myself and Amuna Koga. Except that maybe the conclusion five about the junctions. So, but this somehow the proof is somewhat implicit in the work. It in the work. So it took me some time to realize that. But for two-phase case, then yeah, you can derive this. It was sort of, I think, a variable. And also one can do, even though it's not reading anywhere, but it's possible to do the same, more or less the same things with velocity, not just mean curvature, but plus u, which is given. U, which is given a sort of background time dependence over vector in a suitable radiality class, which I don't want to go into, but the one that I studied with at a few years ago. And we have also a similar result under fixed boundary conditions that's been studied by Stubert. And you can have a sort of a solution of the plateau problem through this work. Through this work by fixing the boundary. Okay. All right. So some aspect of proof I just want to go through very quickly. Yeah, I have, well, I have about no, but I have about 15 minutes. Is all right? Yeah, I have a stopwatch. What is 35 minutes? Oh, 30 minutes. Okay, so then it's about 14 minutes. So then it's about 14 minutes. Yeah, okay. So let me just describe some aspects of the by the way, is there any questions up to this point? Just quick one. Okay, is that fine? Yeah, so let me just go through some aspects of the proof. So this construction of the solution is very much based on the previous work I did with Kim, and which is really another reworking. Another reworking of Bracket's original work of existence theory, and with one modification which makes this BV solution characterization available. Okay, so let me just tell you how you do it. So if you are given this initial grains, the domains, and let's gamma zero be the initial set. Sets that you start with via assumptions. So it's a finite measure and so forth. Now, starting from initial these guys, what you do is you do a construction of time discrete approximate flow. You don't try to stop to construct a continuous one right away, but you do that time discrete approximate flows. So now you fix J. So now you fix j, j is going to go to infinity. I need these three lengths scale. One over j, I'll tell you what this is. And then you have another parameter equation j, which was also zero, and a time step, a time grid size, delta tj. And they have this relationship, just roughly speaking. These numbers doesn't matter so much, actually. It's computationally, it's necessary. Computationally, it's necessary to introduce all these technical numbers, but you see that if chunk j is like one over j to the seven, so it's much smaller than one over j. This time grid size delta dj is like really sort of strange number like this. Now, what you do is you start with the initial given ones and you construct time discrete way. You know, time discrete way, the sequence of open partitions, so-called, partitions of Rn plus one, you know, time discretion. And then basically you take a limit at the end. So until say, let's say, this time, until you get to, say, time t equal to j, so when j goes to infinity, you have a time global existence. Global existence. Now, each of these sets at time k times delta tj is an open partition in the sense that they're open set, you know, separating Rn plus one into finitely many open domains. And also important thing is the, so there's a complement, this gamma at time k time delta t. At time k times delta tj is a country rectifiable and a finite measure. So you have a constructive scheme so that you have this property that you have open partition and it's rectifiable and a finite measure with a good bound. Okay, so now to do this, it's important to introduce this class of test functions, script AJ. j. This is this when you first look at it looks kind of very strange class but it turned out to be a very natural class of functions. So this is the one that it's bounded between 0 and 1 is enough. And the gradient of phi itself is bounded pointwise by j times phi x and also the second derivative pointwise bounded by the j times phi. Okay, so this tells you that the gradient of tells you that the gradient of phi is more or less bounded by one over no sorry j so you see phi is less than one but also uh you can actually check that this test function is the one that if you look at the scale of one over j in a very small scale then the phi behave more or less like a constant the minimum and maximum in the scale of one over j can be actually comparable to each other and To each other. And so if you look at the scale, length scale of smaller than one over j, this function, this test function behaves more or less like constant. But if you look at globally, it behaves more or less like just a usual test function. So you're introducing some length scale of one over j, which test function behaves more like a constant function. That's important. Yeah, I just said that this. Uh, yeah, I just said that this is more like it. This when J is huge, this is more like a usual test function or like with a compact support. This this function cannot have a compact support, by the way, because if it's zero at any point, even at one point, then this condition actually make phi to be identical to zero. Okay, so it cannot be zero at any point, but it can be very close to zero. Very close to zero. All right, so behaves more like a constant function. Now, the way you construct the one to the next one, this construction is composed of two maps, basically, actually, this so-called Leafsystem formation map, and we call it smooth new pauser map. So basically, what you have is you have this intermediate open partition. Intermediate open partitions, then you so first you get different, and then you move this by so-called smooth Mikausa map. So let me explain the smooth Mikausena. This is the, you do, what you do is you do smoothing procedure. So you write gammatilla to be, sorry, I think let's see, yeah, I guess. I think let's see. Yeah, I guess I'm working on this one. So let me let's call this one as E1 tilde and so forth E and tilde. So you want to change this to this. So for simplicity, let me write like this. And gamma tilde is the complement of this set. And let's try to be a Gaussian kernel with. With integral to be equal to one. Now, you see, this set even may not have a bounded first variation as a variable because there's no regularity assumed. It's just a finite measure in any vertical. That's it. So it may not have even the bounded transpiration or certainly not mean coverager vector of usual sense. So you need to have some kind of approximation or some kind of proxy of Or some kind of proxy of a mean curvature vector. And to do that, you define this quantity here h okay, so maybe I plot time. So note that this quantity is a good proxy for a mean calculation vector because if this gamma tilde is happen to be smooth surface, then this gradient of This gradient of the time derivative, and the gradient of this Gaussian integrated over the gamma tilde, by integration by parts, this is equal to, in fact, to this. You see, if everything is nice, you know, if this gamma tilde is a smooth surface, then by first variation formula, this turn out to be just h times the phi integrated over the. integrated over the gamma tilde and which you can write this as a convolution of the h times the n-dimensional half of measure convoluted with this Gaussian curve. Okay, so that's well that's just this is just definition. Now if you divide this, you see this quantity is this one. So if everything is nice then this is equal to this. Is equal to this dividing by this quantity. You know, if since this is just like a delta function, you can kind of see that as epsilon goes to zero, this should converge to the mean calculus if you have a mean coverage of theta. So, but you see, I'm not saying that, okay, but I take this as a proxy of the mean coverage of vector. The mean coverage of vector. Yeah, you have to do this convolution again, but now you call this a chipsham j. This is a smooth vector field, very much concentrated on the surface. Now, this is a smooth and it turned out to be a good approximation in terms of some affiliate estimate, in fact. And well, you know, it doesn't behave so well. Doesn't behave so well, really. It's like a one of equations on square size, but you can have a very nice estimate. And you move the and also if delta tj is very, very small, as I told you, delta tj is very, very small compared to extreme j. So this map is actually diffeomorphism for large j. Large j. You see, this h has this property that that is you know, at most the size is epsilon square, one over epsilon square, and the gradient is one over to the to the fourth. So, and delta tj is extremely small compared to epsilon j. So this is diffomorphism, and then you move this set by this diffomorphism. So, that's how you get from this intermediate set to the I said to the next step. Now, okay, so this is a uniformity. And the point is, since this episode J is much, much smaller than compared to 1 over J, you see, as I told you, this script Aj is a test function, which behaves more or less like a constant in the scale of 1 over J. And this smoothing is much, much smaller than 1 over J. So this test function actually do not see this smoothing. Actually, do not see this smoothing in some sense, it's kind of fooled by this smoothing, and then it just this test function sort of believes that this is a mean coverage flow in terms of estimate. You can make an estimate like that, very much like the usual mean cover in terms of estimate for bracket flow and a V V solution. Okay, so I don't go into the detail. Now, so this seems to be a good way to So this seems to be a good way to get a mean coverage of flow, but actually there is a problem that this step is actually just diffomorphism and do not have any topological change. And also because of this smoothing, you don't have any information in a small scale, small dimension there, at least. So that's how you need this extra lipstick deformation step. So lipstick deformation step is a one that, okay, so it's a Um, okay, so it's a lipsys map, and uh, it's I need to make a this uh so-called admissible class to keep the open partition structure, you know, in intact somehow. I want to keep this open partition structure, so I need to define this admissible class, which I don't want to go into. I think I run out of time and if you assume that if you define a suitable admissible class, you can make sure that you can make sure that you can map, even though it's a division, it maps to open partitions. And also what you do is you do some kind of minimization, local minimization. So the way you choose is the following. So you define another class of admissible class functions, boldface EJ, as the following. So you As the following. So you're only allowed to move point by one over j square. And so you define the, you know, by this difference of function, you define new open partition called the E tilde. The difference of this is bounded by how much you reduce the measure divided by j. And the third one is that you ask is that you ask and whenever you are in this class script the bold face ej you always reduce the integral so it's an integral reducing map always for any test function but also you ask the volume change to be small compared to the the change of the measure okay so and then the way you choose this diffusion is more like a minimizer more like a minimizer, almost minimizer of this within this class. So you choose a lift system which almost minimizes the area in this class, so that it ended up having some kind of regularizing effect at the end. And also at the same time, allows topological change. Okay, I think I'm running on time. So there are many questions after this works is done. Uh, this works is done. I just list this, and uh, okay, I'd like to thank the uh your attention. I, by the way, the um this paper we just finished yesterday to put in the archive, so it will appear tomorrow. Yeah, thank you for your attention. Thank you for a very interesting talk. Are there questions? Let me ask you, so you mentioned that one ingredient. Let me ask you. So, you mentioned that one ingredient in your construction was different from the earlier Kim Toniga. Yeah, I may have missed this. Right. So, yeah, sorry. Yeah, so this one thing which was only difference, actually, turned out to be the only difference is that before we asked this difference to be small, just one over J, less than one over J, I needed this volume change on each. Volume change on each step to be small. But actually, it turned out that if you ask this smallness relative to this reduction of the measure, then it turned out this Lipschitz definition doesn't change the volume of the grains at the end at all. In fact, the only volume change comes from this smooth mean curvature vector motion, but not from Lipschitz definition. So somehow this lift situation doesn't affect the volume change at all. That was a sort of a key, it's a small difference, but it's a key difference to get this V V formulation because V V formulation is based on basically on the volume change of the grains, not the surface measure. And then if you can make sure this lipstick depression part doesn't change the volume. is the freshman part doesn't change the volume uh then uh yeah this smooth mean curvature flow uh motion uh if you have only the smooth mean coverage of motion then you can actually show that uh at the end in the limit uh this this grains has to satisfy this vv characterization that that's sort of the idea yeah okay thanks if there are other questions just feel free to If there are other questions, just feel free to unmute yourself and ask. Okay, if not, well, it's been a long day or night or morning, wherever you are. Five in the morning.
