So uh So, our last speaker this morning is Nick Rensay. We'll talk about what is this chemical independence anyway. So, this is the new stability problem. So, I'm going to talk about a very pure new stability topic about chem independence. And maybe the first thing I should say is this is joint with Tycom. So the point of the talk is to give a definition of chem dependence. And the reason that that's kind of non-trivial is that chem independence is normally defined in terms of something else. So you want to define chem independence as dividing a generic scale that requires a notion of genericity around in order to define what generic means. And so for that reason, over models, there are many such notions and they all kind of collapse to give you this. Such notions, and they all kind of collapse to give you the same notion of independence. But over SETS, the situation is a little bit dicier. And we don't really know how to do it, except under a strong assumption, assuming that every type has a global non-fortin distinction. So the goal of this project was to sort of axiomatize what it is that it would mean to have chem dependence defined over an arbitrary set prior to defining any notion of genericity, and then ask what are the consequences of that existence. Of that existence. And along the way, I'm going to mention some connections to a very interesting theorem of Lascar and Hallett, which characterized non-forking in the simple theories in terms of the fundamental order, and talk a little bit about the question about relating forking to kit forking in arbitrary disposition. So that's the goal. But maybe since this is the first talk that mentions in this, if we wanted this meeting, Mentions in this. So if we wanted in this meeting, I'll just give the definition. So we say definition, formula Pxy has, so P1, if there exists a collection of tuples, a eta, theta, and two to the less than omega, so these are finite strings of zeros and ones. Finite strings of zeros and ones, such that two things happen. So one is that paths are consistent. So what this says is that if I take an element of 2 omega, so it's a path in the tree, and I instantiate my formula using parameters that come from just that path. dx theta restricted to i, where i less than omega is a consistent partial theta. Okay, and then two is where things get weird. So you get some kind of strange version of inconsistency. So what this says is that if I take Is that if I take eta and nu, which are incomparable, but in a very specific configuration. So if beta extends the meat to the left, and new is actually just equal to the meat to the right, then if Eta extends the meat of eta and new to the zero structure. I'll draw a picture in just a second. This is a new, but uh in any case, let me drop a change in a second. But this is inconsistent. Extension on quality side. Sorry? You also want extension on the new side, not equality. No, I want equality. Equality. Equality, I'm sorry. Yeah, so Martin is exactly right that you would expect something symmetric and sensible. That's not what we get. That's not what you get. So, okay, let's draw this picture. I grabbed the colored chalk. Let's draw this picture. I grabbed the color chart. So paths that are consistent means what you think. If I pick some paths from the tree and I plug in parameters coming from this path, I get something that's consistent. But contrary to expectation, the idea is that if I take something in this cone, one thing in this cone, wherever it is, it's inconsistent with this point in particular. So my idea is that beta is living somewhere in here, and nu is living here, and the meat of anything in this column with this. And the meat of anything in this column with this thing is what I'm calling eta meet new. So if I extend anywhere inside this cone, including this point, so that extends eta meet new somewhere in the zero direction, and nu is equal to eta meet nu in the one direction, then they're inconsistent. Okay, so this was defined by Shella and Majimonia and Shella, and you know, when they wrote it down, When they wrote it down, they didn't really prove much about it, and it was left entirely mysterious about where this definition comes from. And you look at it and you just think, how in the world could this be a meaningful notion? In fact, I think I've mentioned to many of you before, I went to Jerusalem and I asked, like the first question I asked, Inshallah, was, where does it come from? And he started explaining to me where SOP2 came from. And I'm like, no, no, no, that's not what I mean. And he's like, oh, I thought that that surely must have been what you meant because I couldn't imagine that you were interested in masking. That you were interested in asking this question. So there it is. It's a definition. You can write it down, but it doesn't mean anything. And the surprise is that it means something. So the way that you sort of give it meaning by interpreting it is connecting it to a theory of n. So there's a theorem. So there is a theorem. So I'm going to first write it the version that RCMA proves it, which is just to say, suppose there is an on invariant notion of independence. Satisfying. Okay, I'm not going to write the properties in full, but let me just give their names. So existence or extension. These two I will define explicitly in a bit. Symmetry. Sorry, not piecemeal. Monotonicity. Four strong finite character. Five transitivity. Six, independence theorem. Actually, we didn't have transitivity in our list, but you can assume it if you'd like. So if you have an independence relation like all of this. Yes, so I was just about to say that, thank you, where the base in one, two, six is a model. Is a model length T is MSOP1. So this gives a point of contact, of course, between the theory of independence and MSOP1, but it's not as satisfying as the points of contact you get in the Kinperl√© theorem we know and love for simple theories. So that theorem says, suppose you have such a thing, some notion of independence which satisfies these axioms, then not only is the theory simple, but Then not only is the theory simple, but that notion of independence agrees with non-forking independence. And so here we just get that if you have some notion of independence, then the theory is not too bad by making some kind of comparison. But we didn't have the theory of independence. That would give us sort of the analog of the Kimpolythereum. By the way, the placement differs from the Kimpilatherems, so we don't ask for base monotonicity. I could have added local character. Yeah, so monotonicity just says that I can drop things from the left and the right. drop things from the left and the right. So A prime independent B. A prime implies A is independent B. So you can just drop things from the left to the right, which is different than being able to move things into the base. Transitivity is a sort of way. So so transitivity for me would say like A is independent over A with B plus A is independent over A B with C, then A is independent. Then A is going to be a model. But you only allow base has to be a model, so then B has to be a model? No, okay, because you're C. Yeah, yeah, so if you wanted to say it over models, then maybe you would make this like a model N. So maybe M is taken N, so you could say N, then here you'd say NC. Anyway, it's just stating the property. But here, if you want to go over models, that's what you want. Anyway, this is just background. Anyway, this is just background. So Kim independence was defined to be sort of the thing that's going to make this look more like the Kim Pelasier. So Kim independence was defined to be a notion of independence. That would hopefully, I mean, I'm saying it was defined, so it was defined with the hope, although it pretended to be realized, give a converse. Namely, if you assume you're in SOP1, then you have this. So how does that go? So attention. We say a formula and I'm going to give it a vague definition. I'm going to give it a vague definition and then bear with me for just a moment and I'll explain how to make it precise. So a formula Vxv chem divides over M. I'm going to assume for the time being that M is a model. Theory. And I'm working in chem divides over M if there is a generic sequence. generic sequence over m v0 equals p such that px vi for i less than omega is inconsistent. Okay. And then once you have this, you naturally get Kim Fort Kim. Very good. Great question. Very basic. I'll share with you. No, sure. So, yeah, so I said this thing like, wait for me, bear with me. No, but Amador, he was so enthusiastic about this question. I love it. I love that enthusiasm. What is generic? I didn't mind it, might be. Is generic means independent? So there are various candidates for what a generic sequence over a model can mean. So the strongest one that we might take is a core sequence. Okay. That's maybe definition one. And then you could look at a broader class, which is. Look at a slightly broader class, which is you could look at invariant more or less units. Okay, this was the first official definition of kicking hackings. And then you could look at an even broader class, which is forking Moreland sequence. And then in the Kimenefinitz paper, it became necessary to consider a technical strengthening, or technical broadening, of that notion, or weakening of Moreland sequences, which were called tree-more than sequences. Consequences. Okay, and then once you've developed the whole theory and you've got Kem independence defined, you could of course look at mkmorley sequences. So this is an indiscernible sequence where each term is chem-dependent with its predecessors. And an important fact is that all of these give the same notion. In a subdividel. You define chemicals and chem independence, right? It's the last problem. Yeah, yeah, so this is in terms of chem independence. So of course, yes, you're getting, yeah, see, everyone's doing so great. So I'll give the same in K. You get a kind of fixed point. So if, you know, it's sort of like you gotta get the car jump started, right? So you start the ignition. So, you start the ignition and you find your coordinator sequence, then you define some notion of independence. Like, it's the sort of machine deterrence. And then, once you have that notion of independence, it turns out that it's a kind of fixed point. So, if you define generic to mean in terms of that notion that you've defined, then again, you get the same notion of independence. So, generic can mean any of these things. And you get the same notion of independence in NSOP form. You could start with overmodels, different first notion. You could. Yeah, so a natural question is like, sort of, what conditions do you need? That's something we're going to talk about. Yeah, this is really fun. Okay. Poki-do. So what's the reason that we start with models? Well, because every type has a global, finitely satisfiable extension over a model, or a global invariant. Extension over a model, or a global invariance extension. So these just always exist over models, which means that you can start the car, that you can get this process going, and then you can develop kinetic functions. Okay, so there's a natural question, which I think is still maybe the most interesting question in the pure theory of this one, is what about arbitrary sets? Okay, so there we don't have a notion of genericity and you know we can stipulate it by fiat and then just ask if it yeah non-forking multi-sequence I mean it's it working yeah great so so in a simple theory every type has a global non-forking extension regardless of what kind of set it's on. But in SOP1 we don't know that that's true. So a natural question that you might ask is what if you just assume it? Then can you develop the theory? Assume it. Then can you develop the theory? So first attack screen. So assume the existence X. So this is every D in. So for every A, for every set of framers, every P has a global number of constitution. As a global unfortunate question. Another invariance questions. So we'll talk about that too. Okay, so this. Yeah. So it's a type of A. I take a clone of a. Extension of a what? Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. So I'm forking over A. Sorry. Is that better? So it doesn't fork over A, but it's full. So I type over A, I take an extension to the monster model, and I ask that it doesn't fork over A. That seem reasonable? Okay, good. Okay, so this is maybe the first setting in which you might try to develop interdependence over arbitrary sets. Can I ask a question? Yes. The annotation is generic. You see what for everybody. Yeah, so this is Kim's Le Mont, and that's characteristic of NSOP1. So it turns out not to matter. So in the definition... It's still working in the NSOP1 case, right? Yeah, but okay, I mean, so the official definition, even sort of in our arbitrary theory, is there is an engineeric sequence. And I think sometimes it's appropriate to say there is a co- Sometimes it's appropriate to say there is a coherent sequence, sometimes it's appropriate to say there is an invariant sequence, but it's always defined as there is, in the same way that dividing is defined as there is an intentional sequence. So when you want to replace that with something universal, that normally gives you a different notion outside the NSOP1 context. But in the NSOP1 context, they coincide. That's the cancel. Yeah. Okay, so assuming the existence axiom, so here I'm, this is something with This is something with John Johnson, Jan Han Kim, and myself, is that assuming existence should be bigger than that condition. This is equivalent to saying no type works over its own domain. And it's equivalent to saying that in every complete type of... As far as I know, every formula with a parameter, a finite parameter, just doesn't have four over that parameter. It's equivalent. It's equivalent. Yeah, and another way of saying it is that every complete type over A has a more than sequence over A in it. These turn out to all be the same. Yeah. In fact, we proved in our paper that they're all the same. Anyway, it's okay the way I said that. So assuming existence, taking Taking generic equals in net worthy sequence and k satisfies the axioms in the uncertainty one can play through. Overall sets. And I guess it's also unique. Is that sure? Yeah, yeah, it's unique section. It's canonical. Okay, so now one thing you might observe is that the existence axiom quantifies over all such sets, A. In Artem already asked the question: can I do it just for a single set? If I assume the existence axiom for A, Axiom for A. And actually, we don't know the means. So, remark if end FA, so like I'm looking at the non-forking relation where I have A as the fixed space, satisfies right hand, left extension. Left extension overhead. Then you can get the same conclusion just for int K over A. But it's hard to see how to get this. But this is what the argument gives. If you actually read our paper, we use existence over all sets to get left extension for forking. So this is the best. So, this is the best we can do locally. Well, what do you mean by synchronous? What is transitivity? Yeah, okay, forget transitivity for the time being. But I mean, one way of saying it is that you have A's, the base, and then the other sets can be models. So, I mean, that certainly is true. But, I mean, you can also just quantify over the sets where you have common dependence being defined. Anyway, there's a precise way of saying what I mean. So, anyway, there are a lot of questions that arise. So, here we have this hypothesis, which So, here we have this hypothesis, which is existence axiom. This is the setting in which we can do chem-dependence over arbitrary sets. Then there's a natural question: is that required? Can you prove that, say, if chem-dependence is defined over a set, then it must have been the case that you had existence? Now, the way I've defined things, that isn't even a well-posed question. That's a circular question, because I haven't defined chem dependence over a given set to be dividing with respect to non-forking Morley sequences. So, it doesn't even make sense to ask if that implies existence. So, what I want to do is I want to sort of axiomatize. So, what I want to do is, I want to sort of axiomatize what it is that it means for human dependence to exist over the site, and then ask what consequences that. But is it known that there's an NSOP1 theory that doesn't satisfy that? No, so it's a, let's say it's a conjecture that every NSOP1 theory satisfies the CSS axiom. Sorry, in the remark when you say same conclusion, what is the same conclusion? That all the axioms. That all the axioms, maybe with the exception of transitivity, this still matches, it's true. So you have the independence stand for Lascar strong types over A. You have Kim's Lemon for one-forking more sequences over A. Kim independence over A agrees with non-forking with respect to int K over A sequences. The whole theory works over A. Assuming that non-forking satisfies left and right condition over A. Such over Okay, so definition: let's just say game independence is defined over A. A if there is an ought m over a invariant relation n star over a. Now it's a binary relation satisfying the conditions. Of the Minnesota one placement. So, this is the first stab of the definition. And these axioms, the ones I listed, let's call them the strong axis. Yes. Prints are unique. So, this is the first definition, but this is kind of unwieldy. You're assuming everything. So, we want to pare this down to a minimal. So, we want to pare this down to a minimal set of axioms, which actually give you something you can work with. So, Kepler A over this set or over this circuit? Over just this set. So, I'm relativizing all the axioms. Okay, forget transitivity, I don't actually need it. But relativize all the axioms just to over the base set, eh? And then you ask for that. These are the strong axioms. These are the strong exacts. So they need A. Sorry? Naming A. Yeah, you could do it over the set and have it A names. Okay. So now let's define the weak axioms. So the weak axioms. So weak axioms for install A. For install n. So one is existence slash extension. Okay, so existence just says that A, A A for every A, and also that for every A, well let me say it this way. If A is independent with B over A, then for every C, there exists A prime. There exists a prime which has the same type over AB as A, such that A is independent over A with B C. A prime. A prime as the B. Good. Okay, so this is existence and extension, which is what you need to get more of the sequences to exist with respect to this notion. And then two is witnessing. Says that if A is not independent with B, then there exists some formula, Vx, of the type of A over AB, such that for every n star Merley sequence, BI, I less than omega. Bi, i less than omega with v0 more leaf over n. V0 equals b phi d i less than egg is inconsistent. And then there's one more. And three, I'm very, very, very willing to take suggestions on better names to this, because I didn't like this name. So I was calling it anti-witnessing. So what this says is that if So what is this guy? Anti-witnessing. Yeah. It's like witnessing, but the opposite. So if A is independent with B, then for every BX AB, which is in the type of A over AB, and for every BI, I less than omega. BI I listen omega, which is install 40 over egg with B0 speak because BI high less than omega is consistent. Okay. So this is like a very weak form of the independence theory, I think. And this is like, together, these are like kind of. Is like together these are like Kim's. Okay, so basically, what you're doing is you're just sort of saying you have Kim's loop for this notion. And it's non-trivial because you have more. Just inflect GM? Yeah, it follows. Why not? Yeah, okay. So, I mean, there are various ways of saying it. But the point is that, okay, so I want to leave these up for just a little bit. I'm right here. So, first theorem is that. Is that the weak axioms imply T is ASOP1 and little stars? Sorry? Or all sets homogenous? Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. So for all sides. Yeah, sorry. So for all sets, for all sets implies T is minus P1. And if T is minus of U1, then N star is canonical. So if it exists, let's say over a given set A, if N star A exists, It is unique. So it's a canonical relation, if there's any such. And this would be one unit overall sets, or for models, you already have. Over models is an equation. Yeah, over models is. But certainly if you have overall sets. Then it's camp defense. Yeah, it's over models and what can be different. Yeah, I mean, so I mean, you can say something very silly, like if you take. Something very silly, like if you take, if it exists over the skull and hole of a witness to SOP1. So if T is an open one, then even over the MT set, or is he? I mean, all over any set. But are you asking if... Yeah, does star even exist? No, I don't know. That's what it said. It's not E is NSOPN, then if it exists, if you want them. Yeah, but if those are the same over models, over models. Yeah, yeah, but if if you assume just the weak accidents over models, then you have Kim Summer for Kim and it's about the independence theorem then. Yeah, so you actually have to prove the independence theorem. But one thing I like about this is that this has the consequence that somehow you can see the whole theory of independence as a formal consequence of Kemsel. And that was like a feeling I had. That was like a feeling I had in working out much of this stuff, but now it's like a theorem. Like, you know, if you just have any relation which satisfies the basic principles, then actually you can get the whole theory. It can also give you the incomes theorem almost as a kind of formal consequence. Is there any explicit definition? Yeah, so yeah, so great. So that's going to be the next theorem. So now we have this definition, this abstract definition, and it's like, can we come up with some kind of concrete way of describing it? With some kind of concrete way of describing it, assuming it exists. So if it exists, then we can get something concrete. So that's the goal. Great. I want to make sure I can get to it. Yeah, I can see. I'm in the 1145, right? I ended up in 45. Okay, cool. So now I'm going to pivot and start talking about some kind of old school model thing. Talk about the fundamentals. So what? It's not old school? Okay, whatever. It's called stability. Now it's neo-stability. Yeah, okay, it's a new fundamental. Neofa. Neo. Yeah, we're doing the neo-fundamental order, I suppose. Okay, cool. So, um, I want to make sure I get these definitions ready. Okay, so suppose, so now we're doing stability theory. Yes, good. So, A is a set of parameters. J is the containing the set of m, to model over with t. And suppose I give you some p, which is a type over m. Okay, so there's this notion of the a quotient. There's this notion of the A quarter of P, which is the set of formulas that are referenced into. So maybe they have suppressed parameters from A and say there exists some M such that Vx M is not P. And if prime is some other model, Have some other model containing A. We say, oh, and Q is the type, say, in the same variable context over this different model. And we say P is equivalent to Q over A. That just means that the A closures are the same. So they represent exactly the same formulas. And if R is just the P that we took, but we restricted to A, so you take the type over A and you view the R is one of its extensions to a model. We say that P is an A bound of R if C O A So A is minimal with respect to just inclusion among all extensions of R to types over class. So I take R, which is a type over an arbitrary set. I look at various ways of extending it to models. Various ways of extending into models, and each one of those maybe represents some formulas that weren't present in R itself. So I want to choose one which is somehow minimal among, that represents the least possible number of formulas. And of course, it doesn't have to be a minimum. There might be incompatibilities there. So I'm not claiming that R is somehow unique, but B is somehow unique, but if it's minimal in this order, then it's about. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. So now I want to say for hearing you're saying meaning function, not least function. Minimal. Minimal. It doesn't have to be the bottom. I mean, there could be incomparable elements in these partial places. Okay, so. Think of this complex. Yeah, so, um, right. You know, it's like, it's like you'd like to take P to be an error of R, but maybe you can't take it to be an error, so you choose it to be as close to an error as possible. Okay, so here's the theorem. So suppose K is minus would be one, and K is defined over A. So you can take that to mean it satisfies the strong axioms, the weak axioms, it's equivalent, whatever. Then, the following are equivalent. So, one, two. One, two, two prime, three, three prime, four. So one of them is just independence. So A is an independent over in the sense of the relation satisfactories. Two says there exists a model, M, which contains A such that the type of The type of A over um M, sorry, is an A bound of its restriction to A and A B is in U independent over M is B, where this means the type of A over M B is finitely. means the type of A over M B is finitely satisfiable, NM, finite satisfiability, independence. And then the prime indicates that I could instead ask just for chemistry over. This was journalizes something. Yeah, yeah, I was about to say that. So in the pillars of the square. Let me get to that in just a second. So this is an existential statement saying there is a bound where I get independent status. And then the And then the other board. Three prime. So this says for every A bound, beta, the type of A over A, there exists a model containing A such that Such that, okay, beta and the type of A over M represents exactly the same formulas. And A is NU independent over NP. Or equivalently, this is the prime, A is n independent. So you should read these the same too. So you should read these as saying two. So notice the difference between two and three is the difference between existential and universal quantification. This says there is a bound where I can get independence, and this says for every bound I can get independence. So I can represent the same formulas and I get independence. And then the thing in brackets indicates a very weak kind of independence. And then that turns out to be equivalent with a very strong kind of independence. So it sort of ranges. And of course you could replace it with anything in between. So it ran four kind of independence. And then the fourth one is something that I don't. The fourth one is something that I don't want to go into too much detail, but many of you have heard me talk about generic stability independence. So I just wanted to mention something about that in this connection. Four will be A, these say GS independent programming, where GS independence is the generic stability independence that I talked about in the context of treeless theories. Sorry? Sorry? Is it clear that the bowels always exist? Yes. Because uh I mean there's orange limbo or something. What? So you can you can just do Zorn's limbo. Because just Zorn's limiting. You just go down. You look at the sexual quality, right? Yeah, but it's but it's true. I mean bounds exist, which I think you can prove by compact. Okay, so this, I mean, so there's a fact which I want There's a fact which I won't talk about in detail because there's certainly not time. But every type over a set in any theory has a global extension to a maximal generically stable partial type, which is somehow unique, and that means some kind of generic extension works in the context. And what's very interesting, just as a remark, is that, okay, we know that if chem independence exists over set, then this agrees with chem independence. And we also know that chem independence exists over set, then chem independence agrees. Candidate agrees with this. So, of course, it follows by baby logic that these things are equivalent to this, but that's an equivalence we don't know how to prove in general. And it's a very interesting question. Maybe there's a kind of general theorem about that. You know, a comment I also wanted to make about the provenance of this theorem is that if you just assume T is simple, then you don't need this additional hypothesis of int K existing over all three sets, it just exists and is not forking. And then the equivalence of one, two, and three is a. Of one, two, and three is a, say, without this version, just with the NDU version, is the theorem of Lesgar and Philip. And there the attempt was to try to find some description of working that made it look closer to the fundamental order in stable theories. Okay, so now in the very last moment, I wanted to mention one more comment. So there's a kind of general question, which is like, sort of, what is the Is the relationship in SOP1 theories between in k and in dash? Okay, so this is just a vague general question, but a sort of more precise one. So, this, let's call it the base monoticization conjecture. Okay, so I'm going to state some version. I think maybe you have to tweak it, but so you maybe want to say that assuming, well, I mean, it should be true all. Well, I mean, it should be true all the time. So, so A is 4 chem independent over A with B if and only if A is chem over C with B for all C which are contained in, I don't know, let's say B D D A B. Okay? So this is just saying, like, if you force base monotonicity, then you should get Entonicity, then you should get non-forking. Maybe you could write ACL through various different versions. Of course, chem independence needs to exist over C for this to make sense. And one last thing. Yep, I have one minute. Sorry? Can I parise easily? C complete A. Oh, yeah, thank you, thank you. Yes, good. So this one's not, this one's not especially deep, but I still wanted to mention it. So assume, so TS is P1, assume that NK exists over all sets. Then among all relationships, Um all relations sorry, strengthening NK satisfying base monotonicity and extension. There is a weakest one, and it is in def. Okay, so what this says is, so first off, there is one, and there's a weakness one, and that's unfortunate. So what this says is if you take chem independence, assume it exists over all sets, force it to have base monotonicity and extension, which you can do in a kind of direct way. But you can do it in a kind of direct way. You've seen this thing about chem independence in the context of Adler's work. So you can force chem independence to satisfy extension and base monotonicity, assuming chem dependence exists on all sets. That will give you four chemical dependence. So really the substance of the base monotonicity conjecture is that you don't need to force extension. You just need to force base monotonicity to get between kimonopendence and forking. So this goes some way towards clarifying the connection between forking and kimono. Working and kidnapping, but it's still very mysterious. And with that, I will stop. Questions? Yep. Can I, so suppose you don't assume the theory is MSOP1, and you define a relation by either condition two or condition three that you have under your board. Do you have a sense of how well, like, how? Of, like, how well, like, how general the theory can be for this together? So, I mean, one question you could ask is: what is the broadest class of theories in which there's some version of Kim's Lemma? Yeah. And for this, we know, okay, you have a Kim's Lemma in NSOP1, you have a Kim's Lemma in NTP2, and there are ways of putting NTP2 theories and NSOP1 theories together in some way. So, like a canonical example of an endosophy 1 theory is T-star VQ. So you have a parameterized family of equivalent relations. Family of recordance relations. So you have an object sort and a parameter sort, and if you choose a parameter, then you plug that into your distinguished ternary relation. That of course gives you a binary relation, and you ask if that's always a recordance relation. And as you vary the parameters, it's free. You can do exactly the same thing where you have a DLO. So you have a parameterized DLO. Okay? So that's not in SOP1 because it has a strict order property. It can still order. But it's also not NTP2 because you have all of this random forking coming from the parametrization. So that satisfies some version of K. Satisfies some version of Kim's Luma, and it certainly doesn't fit into either, you know, either. So, Alex Creckman and I had some, I mean, we have some notes, which maybe someday we'll become looking through about trying to understand sort of what is this category of theories cut out by the ultimate Kim's limma. And, okay, it seems to roughly correspond to the kinds of things that people in the in a tiki realm are thinking about, but we don't have a syntactic characterization when you get counseling. So, I think I would say. When you get canceled. So I think outside of the NCP2 and the NISPP1 context, finding syntactic conditions that would tell you when you have cancel out seems quite seems hard. I don't have a good conjecture for that. Yeah. I have a question about your expanding chart of definitions of genomics from the beginning. Yeah. If I remember right, in most known examples of NSOP1, you can go further and put like algebraic independence there. Is there any? Is there any counterexample of that, or maybe with bounded closure? What about like in fields? Not enough in fields. That's not one example of promotion. Okay, so that does not work. Okay. Yeah, I would have said, I would suspect that in fields it doesn't work, but it's always complex cases. I mean omega-3PAC fields, we need sort of independence at the level of the Galois group. Now independence of the level of the Galois group turns out. Now, independence of level of the Galois group turns out to be out of break independence in the Galois group, but I don't know that you see that from outbreak independence. Yeah, that sounds okay. That's a good question. But I wonder, okay, so then the follow-up question, if you can say something nice about the classic theories, or this is true. There's so many examples, but it happens, like these combinatorial examples, the ones I'm working with. I don't know. What kind of answer to the question? Maybe proving a space monotonistic conjecture or something. Oh, like that. Maybe. I don't know. It could be interesting. I mean, you could look at algebraic things if you want theories. Sure. I don't know. I don't really have sense. I think you said this aloud, but I just wanted to clarify. So the theorem about the weak axioms. So if you have a If you have an independence relation satisfying these weak axioms, then the theory's n is one. And if you satisfy the weak axioms over, say, then you get the strong axioms as a consequence of that. Okay. That's right. Over every set. And again, you can do it over every model and tell them over every concept. I assume that's what you meant by the whole theory as a consequence of Hume's land. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Any other questions?
