Canada. The travel was a nightmare, but we it was very much offline. So anyway, I will talk about something giant derivation, which is in size a bit separated from exponential fields. But some of the ideas that we show can be studied, it can be applied also. Can be applied also to study the case of a derivation on exponential fields, but I will take something at the end. So, first of all, what do we mean by generic? The word generic is used in many situations, descriptive set theory, but we are interested in the case. The case of remote theoretic mean. By the way, this is Jack Walker, we've used a pina third. What do we mean by generic? People usually mean by generic in model theory. You start with a theory phi, in some language L. You add you have an expansion P prime. And you ask when a certain m is generic. In this case, for instance, T could be a theory of fields, T prime could be a theory of derivation of fields. What would be a generic model? In a according, first of all, not to talk about First of all, to talk about the generic promotion, we assume that P, let's say, eliminates verticals. You can always assume it by passing the modization. So if necessary, we replace T with its modization. And then we say that people say that M is a generic model of T plus M, that depends. If something, if they don't ask. If we don't ask much, we simply ask that it's an existentially closed model of T prime. If we are a bit more vicious, we'll ask whether T prime is more than a companion of T prime or a model, a more completion of T prime. So the well-known Result in this framework is by Tida Shakidakis about the generic predicates. So I'll try maybe simply add a union some predicates t. T prime would be equal to t, so we don't ask anything about this predicate and in terms of the term. It turns out that if I would have a model companion, exactly when T eliminates the quantifier existing in 3D many. So there we have a full characterization of when a genetic predicate existed. So this is generous ideas, but the situation I'm describing. Situation I'm describing a trial with either union one or more unary predicates, delta one, delta two, delta k. And one can ask in a various situation, when does a model companion or about the completion exist? For instance, it would be interesting this situation, same situation as circidaki speedway, where we don't ask. Check it out. This t play where we don't ask anything about this new function. I don't have an answer. When does VCP prime have a model completion? Which field is a meet a generic function? Maybe some of you know so. If anybody knows, well, it can be an open problem. Necessary condition, again, is that the t eliminates the quantifier existing. The quantifier existence will be many, but this in China might not be sufficient. So, as an open problem, when does this at the prime have a model companion? Okay, this is a general situation, but I'm interested in the case of genitalization. So, T would be an Deviation. So T would be a red field expanding the field of at least zero. And prime will be add the union of some new unity functions. And then t prime, I will use a t director, we say that t Delta will say that the T union delta will apply our derivation. What does it mean? That we are additive and we obey the Leibniz rule. And we assume that in a statute language, at least theory needs amplifier. And another question is when Is when this theory has a model companion, model completion. So L here is just the language of rings or? No. Anything, anything, anything, anything. Okay, the prototype of this situation is when L is the language of feeds on the results plus times, and T is CF. A CF, or if you have more ambitious simplifies, and then as you know, this F0 is a remote companion of T delta. So when delta is one delivery, if I have a deliberation with P delta With B delta R. So if I, since I didn't ask for any, I didn't require a derivation commuter. So there is a name for differential fields where I have non-commuting derivations. Free derivations? You call them free operators and things like that. Yes, I know. That's why you ask me for. Ah, okay. That's Put this name. So I'm derivation non-commuting and see. With scanner remotes, I have a more general result about operators on a field, but in particular, and non-community derivations meet some other companion. But people have been studying this problem in much. much minimal situation where T is not algebraic close field, it could be real close field and then you have a theory t diatom have a model companion. I put a G for generic, which is a theory of a differentially close order field of a single or when T is an exceedant field or T is a large Large multi-complete fields, and so on. I will not try to give a complete story or account of who did what because it has much more important. Okay, so we know in many situations that many fields of fields have a genetic, a to metagenetic derivation. The result, I want to The result I want to talk about is when the theory T is what is called the algebraic boundary. So the language will be the language of heat and extra structure. T will be another theory expanding Expanding fields of characteristics with zero. And I say, we assume that P has elimination of 505, which we can always assume. So what does it mean that this theory is such a greatly bounded? The notion was introduced by Martin Dries many years ago. I forgot the deed, but it's another article. He gave a different definition. But we gave a different one, which is simpler. You say that your theory is like any bound and are complete for simplicity. If the generic closure in the sense of field is equal to algebraic closure in the sense of model theory over Theory over a basic set parameters. So you add so you have SL f of x union of fixed set is equal to and the very closure of x. So you need a fixed set because you might have a constant in red language, so you can. We include all the constants in the language that you have with it. We reach an original definition, but this was different, but which is more straightforward and its equivalent. It's a result that this theory automatically eliminates a quantifier exists infinity. So it was. So it was not clear like the beginning was not clear this part, but eventually it was proved. There is a nice proof of this part in a paper by Johnson and Ye, I think, yes. Johnson and Yeh. Okay. So that should mean you have an expansion on on the language? Arbitrary ex arbitrary language. Elimination of greater infinity? Under this assumption, you get a list of f so the now I think I can finish the talk because you know already the theorem algebraic bounded structures do have generic deviations in characteristic zero. Okay, so you can wonder if you have not And if T is algebraically bounded, then T delta G exists. So we have a generic variation. Anyway, there is a bit of a variant. I can ask I can require well there are two variants, okay. But there are two variants, okay. I wrote the t delta ma so t delta, let's say, non-commuting, so I don't ask anything about the derivations. So it's in I commodity, the derivation will not commute, but I could also ask that we do commute. So with V that T union letter E commuting Commuting derivation. So both the commuting case and the non-commuting case admit generic derivation. So you mean the non-consistency? Hm? Do you mean you just no, we mean that uh the classroom is essentially closed models of T delta is axiomatizable. Axiomatizable. So the theory Fi delta so these two theories have a model companion. See, sorry, I say but the existing theory of the model the existing model companion. In two for you can get In uh two for you can get uh also model completion if you are a bit more careful with uh your assumptions. So uh why would be interesting because algebraically bounded structures are very common among the tame structures studying model theory. Essentially all Essentially all the team structure, two fields, the one I know at least are algebraically bounded. Let's give some examples. Hello. An example of some algebraic argument structures. So, the Q feeds, for example, you can fake a Java cross feeds, react feeds, the addicts in all general practices. Okay. Let's say C, R, Q, P algebraically close to the value fields. In general, you can see the value field pseudo-finite fields. Um large, rather complete feet large in the sensor of a pop okay things uh this is uh copper value. Is already quite at least probably somebody in the audience will know some more. And the feeds of this recent example by Johnson and Geer again, cool excluding feed. Okay, it's uh Okay, this uh covers already quite a bit uh of uh space, but also a bunch of examples which are not so as already noticed that when you introduced the algebraic bundle structure, he noticed that you can take You can take NCWA field with zero, with arbitrary predicates on the value group and the resource. You can enrich the structure of Structure with arbitrary predicates by the group as you feed it with multiple bounded. So it's not a question of if a structure is stable or unstable or neat or whatever. It will be, you can add a very wide predicate for resonophyll that will stay algebraically bounded. Some other examples, which I don't know. The so-called open theories of topological fields essentially we were introduced by Panduisovi, but Francois also wrote about rabbin. Maybe. Also, take start with an algebraic debound and add algebraic predicate. Generic in the sense of Chakitaki speed. Like it will stay algebraically bounded. You can start with a field, add A field had several independent ordering and evaluation. This theory would have a model companion which would be algebraically bounded. So you can have a quite wide in a sense theories, but will be algorithmic about it. So plenty of examples. So, um how can I say that uh this theory uh G theoregenetic derivation exists but I didn't give you the actions. Good news is that actions are very easy to write down But very easy modulo one factor algebraically bounded take k algebraically bounded with a field we have a dimension function it's a It's a uh what is called the algebraic dimension beam. We associate to every x-definable set a natural number which uh have all the good properties of a dimension function. How is it defined? Well, in dimension x A dimensional X would be the maximum of a transcendence degree of A over K, where A varies in K star, where K star is a Moster model for K. So not non-K star, of course, in X star. So you go to a Moster model, look inside which the point of X. Which the point of x, in the interpretation of x in the universe, do a maximum of transcendence degree. This will be your dimension. Okay, with this notion, we say that x is large. I use again the word large, but it has nothing to do with this. If the dimension of x is as large as possible, and Okay, this is this is needed because now I can write these the axioms. So there are several set of axioms which are equivalent. I will give one on that sort of axiom. We call it y. Y for simplicity we consider only one derivation. So take x in k to the n times k to the n, definable, l definable, two parameters. And consider the projection of x onto the first n coordinates. If this If this is large, the action C, then you can find a point. There is a point A such that without A1AN, that A1, that AIN connects. So what does it mean? It means that equality is n equal 1. 1. x is the graph of some function. If the domain of this function is an infinite set, we will find a point such that delta A is equal to it. This will give a different case of this action. This is a first-order set of action because this dimension is definable in five minutes. You have a In families, you have a definable family, xi. The set of i, such as that, xi is large, will also be definable. So this aximum can be written as a first-order theory. The set of action will be first-order definable. And a possible way to axiomatize my model companion of t-da-la would be t-de-de-de-dee- Of T delta would be T delta union of the central oxygen. Once you have the set of actions, once you have the action, we prove that it is remote companies values. You can do as an exercise. Um is um the reason why it's easy to prove is that reactions were easy to treat. If you use a more complicated action one you will be in greater difficulty. This is for one derivation. For if we start the one derivation, we had m non-commuting derivation, which is a similar set of actions, but we can again exercise. Again, as an exercise, you can try to write down. You ask about this thing, and this thing will work. Much more difficult is a situation where you require communativity. Requiring commutativity is a lot more work. Interaction will be more complicated, substantially more complicated. Essentially, the non-commuting case is much, much more Non-commuting case is much, much easier. I don't know why people studied first recommuting case. I have two hypotheses. One is that we like to suffer. The other is that for commuting the derivation, you have a much richer uh geometry. There is a broader uh theory of uh um differential fields. Uh, we are differential feeds where I'm a commute in the ration of coaching and other people. You have a rather theorem on OCAT, which gives essentially the DCC for climber, differential feeds and so on, which you have in the communication you don't have in the non-communication. Communication. But so the algebra is much stronger, you have much more information, but the model field is much more difficult. That's at least my opinion. Okay, so I give okay, so this is a reaction. So let's see some properties of this theory. That's right, that's right. Assumption, so T is complete. That's a very collaborative. Okay, let's continue. And as a And as a linear amplifier, so we have here, I said before that T delta with community derivation and T delta with no community derivation have another companion. And the actions are the one I wrote before, but in the non-commuting case. In the non-commuting case. And what else? Well, okay, we can ask which property has risk theory, which property has the model risk theory. So the first one is you have a stronger form of elimination of quantifiers. We assume for simplicity, we assume that the delta i restricted to where DCL and zero is zero. So to avoid some complication, assume that on the DCI with zero, all the derivation at zero. Okay, under this additional assumption, you have also that this theory are complete. I don't want to rewrite every time if it's commuted or not commuted, because results are seen. So we put a question mark. Complete. You have a strong form of elimination of quantifiers, even alpha L formula. There exists a beta L formula. L formula such that modulo T delta G alpha of X is equivalent to delta of X delta X delta square of X so this one but another in the similar way in many relationship. So not only do you have a elimination of quantifiers because Elimination quantifiers, because this formula would be without quantifiers, but in a strong form, in the sense that the delta will only appear only in this form inside the former, you don't need to mix M with the function from the from L. Okay, using uh this part it's pretty easy to It's pretty easy to prove. I mean, here, again, as an exercise. This one is an exercise because I write it down first. If the peak is stable, then the model Companion will be stable. If it is a new NIP, also this one with the NIP, okay. These two are easy, but do it because maybe you will have some idea that could help to solve some problem which instead uh we don't know how to do so. Right? And uh this instead is difficult. This instead is difficult, but relatively speaking, if this is simple, then these theories are simple. Actually, more difficult. Okay, well, I don't want to spoil the exercises, but let's see how to do it, but I'm pretty sure you can find. I'm pretty sure you can find some ways to do it. Okay. Instead, if you have some good idea of how to do it, which doesn't require full-page proof, I will probably busy. Okay. I think. I see. Okay. What about omega stability, super stability, supersimplicity, and things like that? Okay. Suppose that, so when is on the stable so some guess stuff is good enough. It's come to cause the T omega stable, it ties T that is stable because I will show our categories output. Well, actually, you know that the category cycle. When we don't commute, your theory will not be on the stable if we stop. So, some idea when it should happen? Hello. First, you require that delta I commute. So either there is only one derivation, or if you have two or more, you have to require that to be two computers. And the second is that. MS cycle is like T has to be starting by the necessary condition. Suppose you have two infinite disjoint unionary sets. You can pick randomly for each choice of sequence and here and here and here and here. And here, and here, I'm here, and here, you can find a point, say that x is here, that x is here, that the square x is here, that the cube of x is here, and so on. So, you will have too many types to be overstable. Too many types of a BMD set, or of the parameters that you use to split your sets into. So, for sure, your theory must be stronger in my The magnet standard minimum implies plus commuting implies metal migration stable because of the initial quantifiers. So why commuting, you must require commutativity instead or if you want, why the algebra of the geometry prefer of commuting derivation is easier. Is easier. Reacher, if you want, when you commit one. Because consider the one odd generated by your derivation. So you say you compose your derivation arbitrarily, you get some function on your figure. If the derivation the derivation commute this monad will be simply L to the M. If without commute well let's say M I well L to the M. If without commute this will be the free monoidal time elevations. So um in both monarch in any case in in this monarch you put a partial order given by d V C P. Given by divisibility, to say that A is less or equal. When B, if exist C, such that A C equal, no, yes, A C equal B. So B can be obtained by A apply, no, C A myself, by A applying mode derivation to it. The big difference is that this monoid is a well A well uh oh well uh what is your well uh well hundred mundane orders yes a white partial order now it's a partial order so a white partial order what does it mean that it's well founded and you don't have infinite entity chains instead this one This one, the free monoid, is well funded, but we also have infinite anti-chains. And infinite anti-chains will work upon any kind of materiality. If you to an anti-chain, you can give an infinite anti-chain, it can easily be an infinite descending chain, descending chain of the differential primary ideas. So this is a So, this is a reason if you want that the algebra is less behaved, well-behaved in this case. And it's also a reason why this thing cannot be strongly cannot be stable. Because given an infinite chain, you can easily get too many types. Seeing that you can break super stability, for instance, for super simplicity. For instance, for supersimplicity. Here in an infinite D shape, you can find an infinite sequence of types which focus on the previous one. So if you want the very simple structure of this monoidal will not give the very big difference in behavior from the point of view of superstability. Point of view of super stability, super simplicity, of instability. Okay, that's okay. Of course, we think long. So let's have a quick so how how do you How do you prove this kind of result, of existence of a model companion? Okay, the main point is a well-known result about derivatives. And it is the following. We take K field. Field our calculator zero factor and take any transcendent spaces so with the number and take a big animal given the this Given these two things, you have a unique derivation k such that delta v equals so the algebraic closure, the macroid or physiometry given by algebraic closure, controls completely with the equation. In the same sense that In a sense that if you have linear functions, the prijority given by respond controls only your linear function in this sense. And this is essentially the only ingredient for algebra that you actually need for the proof. You don't need to know what the French idea is, you don't need to know To know on the machinery of differential algebra, because this is what you need. And the fact is, in some situations, you cannot use machinery differential algebra because if you have an extra language, it doesn't make much sense to consider ideas because your ideas you have to know anything about Years not to know anything about your extra language. But under the assumption that your field is isomatically bounded, this is around the information that you need. There are some open thoughts. Open problems that we have. So the first one is elimination in batch energy. I told me that it's better if I give some open problems, so I give our copy. There are many. I presented about generic derivation of algebraic boundary structure. Quite a lot of particular cases were already known. For instance, real-time field, it was already known, but it has another component. And since pure and silent fields, it was already known. Yeah is uh with uh topological theory is uh we've uh open uh what was the name of something. The popular theory of topological fields also uh were already known to have uh generic derivation. In ma in in uh many of the situations And many of the situations is also known that the theory you obtain will have a diminution in marginalization. There are a few techniques that can work, but I think this is open. I don't know in full generality. That's the one derivation. Have a elimination on images multiple t? Is modified. What are doing here? Is it true that every imaginary here is interdefinable with an imaginary here? This is, I was saying, it's known in many particular cases, but not in China. There are a few techniques that are used. One is based on It's under the assumption that T is simple. In a few cases, if T is simple, there is a proof that we say that T delta G will have a matrix merger. The other situation is the opposite when you have a good we have topology from T and if you have a If you have a sufficiently good behavior topological T, but this we will have elimination margins modular T in the topological case there are actually two different techniques to use the better framework one is based on proving that definable types are dense the other is based on proof on idea of Markov stress. Both can give you an answer, but Both can give you an answer, but both uh anyway, all these uh particular techniques will not work in general because your theory might not be simple and have no interesting topology. And then neither of these two mean filters will be more free, if you want, regretible the answer. So I said you might have uh have a guessed my conjecture is that the answer is. Is that the answer is yes, but it's a conjecture. So this was the first part I wanted to mention. The other question is types so that P begins. So let P be let M be freedom of your genetic degradation, let P of X be a type. Let's say one variable doesn't make much difference. And then you can consider this object, which will be the L type. Although of the one P will be type ray, we take of A, delta A, delta square A over temp. So it will be type in obligables in the original language L. Since we have a strong form of animation imagery or quantifiers, so we P and P delta will determine each other. This is a complete L type, and if you know this, you know completely this. And conversely, if you know this, you completely disapprove. So there are a few questions on uh what are the modific uh relationship between P and its uh P diet. And it's uh P dice. So P not the P number. Okay, so question. If P is definable, if only if, is it true that P is definable if only if P number is definable? Or does uh the pinability types uh move uh move uh back and forth uh between the two theories? False between the two theories. One actual is easy. I don't remember which one, but I don't actually know how to do it. So maybe it's false, but the big story. Probably suppose that Q extended P. So you have a bigger model. Let's say P is a global type, Q is the more global type. Okay, so you can ask the So you can ask that if P is a hair or a coherent of a no, opposite, if Q is a hair or a coherent P, is this equivalent to say that the lambda is a hair or a coherent P of Q here or coherent of T if only if this is a question in other Think of that here for air. So these two questions are related. I mean, if you can prove one, probably you can prove also the other two. So it's enough that probably it's enough that you solve one to solve all of them. Well, you have M elementary substruction M, you have a Q time Q and bit restriction P. And faster used to here cohere with transfer between you, these are I think an answer. I think an answer is yes, but I mean, we people know some country example already. So, if you know some countries out there, let me know, so I can speak, I can avoid to embarrass myself, but in this conjecture, in the paper. Okay. Okay, I wanted to finish to say something about the situation of exponential fields, since uh the topic of the conference is exponential fields. One minute. Okay, sorry. So what happens if your feed is an exponential feed so you want to add a generic derivation to it? Pair answer is you can very short. I like if And I give uh so I give a precise uh statement. Uh you can prove uh probably of something on China, but I give a precise statement. So let t be the expansion or minimal expansion of R with the restricted exponential function. N t that does not exist if you don't have any compatibility condition between your derivation and the exponential function, so simply ask a generic derivation, and your minimal structure have a bit of exponentiation, it's enough based on one, you cannot write the generic one. You cannot add the generic one. This question, I think, was asked me, but I'm not sure maybe Omar. So, okay, the answer is not in correct. The reason is that essentially, if you have a generic deviation, you can define in a uniform way when the function with the set x has algebraic dimension y. Have such a greater dimension one or two. So you can distinguish Russian number from everything else, which is impossible in a first-quander way. So I think I can stop here. Do we have some more questions? Oh, I have some questions. All right, so. Some questions. Alright, so in this theory, if you were to impose a restriction between the derivation and the exponential, the answer is completely different. So if you ask full compatibility in the sense that for every unit, not for every C-infinite zero-definable function, it obeys the chain rule. It's my work with Elliott. You will have it. And yet you will have a generic derivation. If you ask less and only that it's an e-derivation, the answer is sometimes you have, and sometimes I don't know, a situation where sometimes you have, where you do have a generic derivation that I know are true. One is one studied by the Françoise, that she mentioned yesterday, where you take the theory of When you take the theory of the real exponentiation. And the other one is the zebra field. The point is, you remember what I said, that algebraic closure controls the behavior of your derivation. The exponential field will be the exponential closure that controls your derivation. And in those two cases, this pre-geometry will have a Prigeometry would have a good behavior in the sense that it would give a dimensional function in the sense of an index, so you can make redo the work to prefer. No other questions? In that case, then you were just well um like so then if you start with the uh NIP theory and the model. In the case, it's a no yes. In general, I would have a public yes because the same proof should work. But out of, let's say public uh if you give me some time I can be sure, but uh out of uh let's think uh I think uh I mean um let's put this way if you you should be be able to prove uh elimination the strong form of elimination of identifiers. And once you have that NIP is automatic one-line proof more questions uh thank you Julio. Let's thank Content Julio again. We're a coffee break now and then we'll resume the temperature.
