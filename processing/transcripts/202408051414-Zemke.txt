logical algebra and so I'm gonna try to follow the format and I'll have a little bit of background and then I'll say a trick and then hopefully we'll get to actually see how the trick is used to prove something. I guess just I'll have some very basic background. So most of these linkmology theories we study will take as input a link, and then we get, as output, we get some module, which I'll write, we get a module over some ring. module over some ring. So let's say A is just going to be an algebra. And I'm going to make things easy and it's just going to be an algebra over the field of two elements. So this let's just say as a module. So like Higgard Flur invariants and many Kobano homology invariants, one way to think of them is just we have a module to be associated with the one. Okay typically this is like algebraically this is not really like the best Algebraically, this is not really like the best way to think about a link homology theory because for most algebraic operations, we need actually a little bit more information than just a module. And so you're sort of, this is usually not quite the right category to work in. This is not quite enough information. And typically what you actually get is an A infinity module or maybe like a projective module or a projective module. Maybe like a projective module or projective chain complex. So, really, what we actually did are actually A infinity modules. So, I'm saying A infinity module over some algebra. Okay, and so what does that mean? Well, a module is just, we have a multiplication map from A tensor M to M, and it's associative. An A infinity module is similar. And the infinity module is similar. Most of you have probably seen this, but I'm trying to make it as accessible as I can. So we have a collection of hats, mj plus 1, which go from the tensor product of j copies of a and one copy of m to m. And they satisfy an appropriate version of del squared equals zero. So I'll write it, I'll torture you by writing that down. Um let's see minus j plus one a one through um a j and oh sorry let's say i and j a j plus one through a j plus i through a n and then we stop over n n minus one a is just an algebra so then I just have the ways of multiplying two elements Several ways of multiplying two elements j, 2j plus 1. We want this to be 0, which looks for all inputs a1 through a. So it looks very complicated. It's a very useful algebraic structure. So for example, these ordinary modules are special cases of these where you just have most of the multiplications except m2 equal to 0. But typically we'll also have like m1, not even also have like m1 not equal to 0. So if you think about this for m1, you just get that m1 m composite m1 is 0. So these are just chain complexes. So they're chain complexes with this sort of complicated, with multiplications, these higher multiplications that are subject to some constraints or some A-infinity relation. And so this is a nice category to work with. I'll just kind of review some really good With, I'll just kind of review some really basic properties of A infinity modules. The first one is that if I'm given an A infinity module, then there exists another A infinity module, the homology module, which I'll write with this script H such that M is homotopy equivalent. M is homotopy equivalent to H as an A infinity module, and let's say H is isomorphic to the homology of M as a vector space. And actually, the homology of M also has a natural multiplication, M2, and this sort of enhanced one will have the same M2. But it might have some higher operations. Operations. Okay, and so this is typically falls under the guise of homological perturbation theory or homotopy transfer lemma. It's kind of a fun thing to look at, but it's not the trick I'm thinking about today. So if I'm given an A infinity module, I can always just take a tomology, but I might have to endow it with some more actions. Okay, so one sort of nice, so one definition I'll give is one really important definition. Could you say a little bit like why it wasn't enough just to have a module and a module in the nature? Yeah, that's right. Because you can't, the tensor products don't work out well, like in these mod unless your module is free or projective. Like if you want to tensor it with something, you can't just tensor the homology. You can't just tense sort of the homology. It will give you the wrong answer for many sort of natural operations. So the homology contains a lot of information, but it also is missing a lot of information for sort of natural operations that will be like connected sums or random tensor products you'd like to do. But there's sort of is like, there's a really, here's a definition that's sort of central to the talk, and it's covering the case when really. And it's covering the case when really we didn't have to add any extra information. So we say an A infinity module, M, is formal. So this is an A infinity module. We say this is formal if we can take all the operations. All the operations mj on this homology module, let's say mj, phrase it this way, if we can take all of these guys equal to zero on the homology, except mg. And right, so this is a case, so we say the infinity module is formal if this sort of homology module encodes. This sort of homology module encodes all the information of the original A infinity module. If you don't like A infinity modules, you can just pretend these are like chain complexes of modules. So this seems sort of complicated. How would you actually check this? But actually, we'll talk about a case where we can check this in a really natural way. Okay. So another question is. Sorry, sorry. I think I just close the branch. I think I just want a close branch. So we're assuming A is an algebra, just an algebra. Just an algebra, and I want it to be over a field. So like F adjoint, F2 something. Okay, so the last sort of homological algebra thing I want to torture you with, which I just want to sort of state, and one more sort of homological algebra torture, is that if I have a chain map between If I have a chain map between two A infinity modules, which let's say this is a chain map of A infinity modules. And let's say that the induced map on homology, so ignoring all these higher actions, is an isomorphism. So did you say it came out the way? So you said it chained up with a morphism? Yeah, you mean a morphism? Yeah, morphism, well, it chained up with the mean of our thing that satisfies the A-infinity morphism relation. So this, I'm not going to tell you what an A-infinity morphism is, because it's not that important. But if I have one which is an isomorphism on homology, so if I have one which induces, if I have a man. So if I have one which induces, if I have a map, I mean induces an isomorphism on homology, then actually f is invertible as an A infinity. So this is something that a little tool, this is not really the trick that I want to say, this is just a very basic principle of A infinity modules. But this is sort of why you might like to work with A infinity modules. Like to work with A-infinity modules as they have, they sort of localize naturally under what we call quasi-isomorphism. Okay. And by verbal, you mean that there's some inverse so that they're on topic to be identified. Yeah, as in the A infinity sets. So like composition of A infinity morphisms. So you have some category of A infinity morphism of A infinity modules, and if you have a map which induces nice morphism on homology, then it's invertible. Is a mom homology, then it's invertible as an even morphism. Upto homotopy. It's not like it's an optimum, it's A infinity homomotopy. A infinity homotopy, that's right. Just add A infinity to everything, and then it's. Okay, so now I want to tell you the trick, which is, I think, very helpful conceptually. It's probably not, I mean, in some very basic cases, it's just a classical fact. I don't. I don't know. It probably was discovered before anything that I did, so I don't know if I want to take credit for it, but it's a really useful fact. So here's the trick, Lemma, and then we're going to talk about how to apply this. So this is the trick. It's my attempt to follow the format of the talk. Okay, so let's say, suppose that M has an extra gradient. An extra grading. Okay? Extra grading. Let me call that an extra. I'm going to give this a name. I'm going to call this the algebraic grading. And suppose that actually this chain complex decomposes sort of, or this sorry, this A infinity module decomposes as a sort of chain complex in the classical sense of a chain complex of A modules. So let's suppose that I can just write it like this. Like this. Yeah, is that an example of A and M that like I should have in my mind if I'll see what it's like? Yeah, we'll have a lot of examples shortly. We're going to talk about some link floor complexes. So I guess you should think of these are going to be some link floor complexes that satisfy something like this. So suppose that I have sort of a chin complex. Sort of a chin complex of A modules in the classical sense. And so I want M sub I to be an honest A module. Okay? So this is like what you would sort of, if you took homological algebra one, this is like what you would call an A module, a chain complex of A module. These are just honest A modules, and I have some differential which decreases. Differential which decreases the grading. And then, so if the homology of M is supported in a single algebraic rating then M is formal. Formal. So I have this chain complex of A modules, and suppose that the homology of this chain complex is supported in just one of these spots. So it's just like a kernel modulo and image, then actually this chain complex, an A modules, is just homotopy equivalent as an A infinity module just to whatever homology is it maps for. So I'm going to give you an example. So, I'm going to give you an example of this sort of thing that we actually all secretly already know. Is there a root of this when A is not just an algebra, but a value? I mean, maybe. It's not. I don't actually, I didn't really think about that. I don't have any, I mean, it sort of is like. Of is like not the right spirit, I guess. I mean, the right spirit is like everything sort of vanishes for each of these. You might be able to extend it. The proof isn't very complicated, so there's probably something that could be said, but I didn't think too much of this. Each, sorry, each MI, so yeah, each of them are honest A modules. So let's do something about the It's the assumption that the higher multiplications are also homogeneous, so that. Oh yeah, so no higher, sorry, no higher multiplications. No higher. So we only have M1 and M2. So it's just a chain complex of eight modules like you would study in an algebraic class. Well, there's no one. Because you're saying it's just A1. Well, M1 goes. M1, okay. Okay, M1, which is the differential, and then the other. M1, which is the differential, and then you have an M2, which is the sort of internal modules. Yeah, it's a VG module. Yeah, it's a sort of chain complex of A modules in the sense that we have learned in like algebra one. But every module is a DG module. But it won't always have this sort of structure, like this. Yeah. It won't always have this sort of very nice algebraic rating. There are M2s or not? They're M2s, but they're just the internal ones. M2s, but they're just the internal ones. So these are just ordinary A modules. This is like chain complex in the most naive sense you could write down. The thing will actually have these appear. Each thing is a module. Is a module. Each M1 is a module map. Yeah. And the square of each, the composition of the cubed site is 3. That's right. This is chain complex in sort of the most elementary sense we could look at. Sense we could look at. It's like actually the thing you see in chapter one of Black Wall. We've come too accustomed to A infinity models, and we need to go back. Okay, so I'm just going to give you one example, which illustrates why this is sort of not that complicated. So, just an example that we know. So, example is like suppose, so I'll prove like one case of this where it One case of this where it's a little harder in general, but I'm going to prove the case where the homology is supported at m0, and you can probably recognize it from algebra 3 or something. So example, so suppose the homology is supported in N3, or sorry, sorry, in N3. Or sorry, sorry, in grading zero. So, with respect to this sort of algebraic grading, we have. Well, what that's telling us is that I have this chain complex. Okay, I'm looking at, I want to take the homology of this. So the homology is kind of just, well, the kernel of M0 is everything, like the kernel of M1 here is everything, and then I'm just going to quotient by the image. And then I'm just going to quotient by the image. I'm going to quotient by M1 of capital M1, that's like cosmology, and I have a surjection here. I'm going to call this epsilon. And so you observe that epsilon is a map from the sort of total complex to this quotient. This is a quasi-isomorphism, so it's invertible. Oh, it's invertible. But this is a quasi-isomorphism where I'm just equipping it with its A-module structure. So there's no higher actions. And this is like what we do in homological algebra. If you take a module and then you take a free resolution of it, for example, then that's exactly what they're saying: is that you have this chain complex of perhaps projective or free modules, and then they sort of And then they sort of, it's exact except at the final place where it sort of surjects might come up. So, this is something we like all actually know and have worked with frequently when we learn homological algebra. And this sort of trick is just a generalization. It just shows that, like, well, homology didn't have to be supported, and zero could be supported anymore. Okay? All right, any questions? Alright, any questions? Tell us why you want them to be folded. That's a good question. So it's going to come up. Yeah, they'll come up actually in the application. But I'll erase the trick, so hopefully. So why is this useful? Why would we ever consider thinking Why would we ever consider thinking about formality? Well, if I have a module which is formal, this is formal, then sort of the homology of A, so if I just take the homology and don't have any higher actions, this encodes all of and so let's say no higher actions. Of M. It encodes the entire sort of A infinity module structure up to homotopy equivalent. And so, in particular, you know that this, well, sort of going back to this thing we learned in algebra class, if I just have a module, I can always take a free resolution of that module, and it's a quasi-isomorphic to the module view. It's a chain complex with vanishing differential. Vanishing differential. So that actually just tells me that this module is homotopy equivalent to its homology to a free resolution of its homology. Okay, so if I want a free version of it, I can just take a free resolution. And maybe that hasn't answered your question, but in applications, it's typically easier to compute. To compute the homology, just as a graded vector space, or let's say a module, let's say the homology and now. So if I just compute the homology, say as an ordinary A module, that's often actually easier than computing the full A infinity module in question. This is just, and that's actually what's going to happen in the case of Link. In link the case of what we call homology. So it just reduces this question to a much easier problem: just compute homology. There might be constraints on homology that you can use to sort of actually just compute the homology. And then if you know, once you find the homology, well, you then can just, if you want a free version, you take free resolution, or you can just live with the homology as a module. Sort of encodes all the information. Okay, any other questions? questions? So this is the, that was the homolog, that concludes the homological algebra torture. We'll now okay so now we're going to talk about link floor homology and we're going to think about how is this trick actually used in some application. Hopefully we'll actually get to the application. It's a little bit of a gambit, like it's a little bit of um you know, because I actually now have I I sort of started with the proof and hopefully we can get to the hero. And hopefully, we can get to the hero by the end. Okay, so now we're going to, we want to sort of apply this perspective to link fluorhomology. Okay, so link fluorhomology. Okay, so I'm going to denote this CFL minus. So if I take, let's say, L is in S3, this is due to Ojba-Conzalbo. I'm going to sort of abandon the normal notation and just work with like sort of simple to write down notation. So there's a lot of things that people call CFL minus. So what I'm going to work with is a free chain complex. Free chain complex over, I'm going to give this ring a name. I'm going to call it R sub L. And it's just going to be a 2L variable polynomial ring. And L is the number of linked models. So if you take L equals one, you get not flirt models. If you take L equals one, you get not floor homology, but in general, you have these really nice modules called chain complexes. I could think of them as A infinity modules over this ring, which have only M1 and M2 non-trivial. Okay, and so it's very convenient in these modules to actually look at, this will come up in a little bit, if we look at, I'm going to find UI to be the product of Wi and Zi. So if I take the product of Wi and Zi, actually, And Zi actually, Ui becomes homotopic as an endomorphism to UJ for all I and J. So even though I have all of these different actions, in some sense, there's some relations between these actions on the level of homology. So if I take homology, kind of these products kind of have the same action on homology. Questions? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think you can just, the proof is pretty simple. I can tell you the proof later. I mean, maybe I should have been, I mean, I think I only use it in finite dimensions, but or at least finite dimensions, like locally, like in each, you have an extra grading time. I think the answer. I think the answer is yes. Okay, so what I want to think about are a special type of links, which are the L-space links, which are L-space links. And the way that these are defined is we say that L in S3 is an L-space link. If dean surgery on L is an L space for all sufficiently large framings. So lambda is like the tuple of L framings. And so as long as all of them are sufficiently large, I want this to be an L space, which i.e. Which, i.e. hf cat, let's say, actually, I guess it's going to be better to write hf minus for our purposes. S is isomorphic to a single copy of at the joint mu for all spincer structures. Okay, any so that's a okay, so this is one definition of, this is the definition of an L-space link. It's not the most helpful definition for our purposes, so we can reformulate this definition. So let me go back to this structure of length fluoromology. I guess I forgot to introduce some of the structures. Introduce some of the structure. So, this has a lot of structure in addition to being a module over this ring. It has a lot of gratings on it. This has a lot of gratings. And so, and so it has a Maslow grading. So, it has a Maslow grading. Which takes values in Z. So it has a Maslow grading, I denote it this way, and it also has an L-component Alexander grading. Okay? And so this takes values, it takes values in sort of a complicated set, this linking lattice, which is just the product from i equals 1 to L. That's the. Plus the linking number of L minus the ith components with the ith components divided by 2. So it takes values in sort of a complicated set. Okay. Now these actions of Wi and Z I have sort of very predictable Alexander gradings. So Ai So Ai of Zj is equal to the Kronecker delta delta Ij Aj, sorry, let's say Ai of Wj is equal to minus delta Ij. These are very predictable gener gradients. You'll note that the product UI preserves the Alexander gradient. Okay. So link floor homology has this nice grading structure on it. And that actually gives sort of a nice reformulation. This turns out this definition of an L-space link actually turns out to be equivalent to a somewhat easier to work with definition. It says that the homology It says that the homology of this link flirt module in Alexander grading S is isomorphic to FAJUNU for all Alexander grading S. So here, what I'm saying, the differential preserves, yes. Yes. And here, U is just acting by UI for any I. Right, so I said earlier that these UIs all have the same action on homology. So when I take homology, what you end up is with, you end up in every Alexander grading with a tower plus some torsion. And basically being an L-space link is equivalent to there being no torsion. There being no torsion. Any questions? And this goes by way of the large surgery theorem. This is kind of follows from what we call the large surgery theorem. Well, there's no algebraic grading in Hagrid floor homology. Like, we don't in general have. Like, we don't in general have this thing. That's just like the you mean in the trick in the sense of your trick? That's a good question. Good question. We'll get to it. Okay, so right, so that's a good question. But we're going to get to that part of the story. So it's true. Just for completeness, can you just say what the Massoff gradings of the C's and the W's are? Oh, yeah, sure. So GR, I'm using a sort of W grading. So Wi is minus 2, and then W of Ci is 0. So, Okay, so I'm gonna. So there's a so as motivation, there's a theorem of Ojwach and Zavo, which says that if k is an L space not if K is an L space naught, then Then, well, Cfk minus of K is a scalar complex. So let's just do an example. So this is like the 3-4 torus knot. So it would be W, Z squared, W squared, Z. This would be like for the T34 torus knot. T34 Taurus on. Right, so I have a free R module over R, sorry, F adjoined Wc. H dot is a generator over F adjoining WZ. And then I have this differential. And so in general, a steric complex is going to have this form. It's going to have a two-step algebraic grading, and the homology. The homology of a staircase complex is concentrated in the lowest level of the staircase. In the lowest level. So it's just in one grading. So in algebraic grading zero. So for staircase complexes, well, I can actually just invoke the trick, which is just like very basic homological algebra. Very basic homological algebra, and I see that a staircase complex is formal. That's a special case. I mean, here it's kind of trivial because it's just a two-step complex. So, staircase complexes are formal. I guess you could say that's by the trick, but it's just like a very easy observation. They're formal, so let's look at this example. So S is at this time. So the algebraic rating. So you're talking about the algebra rating? It's not a geometrically defined thing. So here I'm just saying this is algebraic rating 0, and this is algebraic rating 1. So like all these guys on the bottom. So, like, all these guys on the bottom row are in creating zero. It's artificial. There's not some geometric definition of it. I just observe that I can organize that this value. And then this would be. So this is S0 and this is S1. Like in the complex, you can just like define some poset or something and declare some lib what's V. Yeah, we just have it this way, and I just declare these to be 0 and these to be 1. It's not like given from a Higgard diagram. It's not like given from a Hager diagram. You know, some post hoc thing, I see the chain complex, I organize it like this, and I observe that, oh, we have S0. We have these levels, it has sort of organized itself into this sort of shape. And the homology is easy to see, it's concentrated in the lowest level. This is, sorry, Wi has rating minus 2. Has grading minus two? Oh, so the algebraic grading is not equal to the Maslov grading. I just like kind of conjure, I just observed that there's this extra grading to the compound. So it's not coming from the Maslov grading or the Alexander grading. It's just coming out of the ether. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so it's a different grading. Yeah, so staircase complexes are formal. Complexes are formal. Maybe just for time, I won't go through this example too much. But here, I'll just say to conjecture, and then I'll describe the proof of the conjecture in some cases. So a conjecture, I think, that is very natural is that L-space links have formal CFL dynamics. i.e., they're just sort of free resolutions of their homology. And you can see that that sort of generalizes what Augewa-Penzabo proved. Like, so this is sort of a natural generalization of Ojwa-Penzabo's theorem about L-space knots being sterled. And so this is true. I know this is true in several cases. So the first case is when, so this is, conjecture is true in several cases. In several cases, when, well, one, L equals one, that's always often solvo. Two, when L is algebraic, or more generally, I can say plumbed L-space links. So the plumbed links, plumbed L-space links. Thanks, Plum Dell Space. Thanks. And so this is work with Borojic, Abache Brojic, Fibi Liu, and myself. Okay, and then three, I can also prove this when L is equal to two. So two component links, and that's sort of work in progress with Darren, Chen, and And Hugo. Okay. So. Algebraic subset. Oh, wait, sorry, is that algebraic setting? Yeah, that's right, that's right. So for time, I can't give all the details, but that's due to Gorskian Mathy. So I want to say a little bit about what Gorsky and Emathy proved. Oh, so exactly. So the theorem. So Gorski and Nemathy show that, and I guess also Matt Hennon, when L is equal to 1, show that if L is algebraic, let's say L algebraic. Ray it implies that L is an L space. Okay, and also Gorsky and Emothy, they also wrote they also show something that's very useful for this purpose. They show that They show that, well, they show that the homology, they don't phrase it this way, but they show that the homology, CFL minus, is determined by suitable normalizations of the Alexander polynomial for For sub-links, ranging over all sub-links of all. So, this homology, they phrase it, if you're familiar with this, they phrase it in terms of what's called the H function of the link. But it turns out that that has equivalent information to just taking the homology as an R module. So, the homology, let's say, as an R L module. So, actually, like putting all of these together, this actually gives you an algorithm for computing the link floor homology of any algebraic link. Because all you do is you sort of compute the h function using Gorski and M of these techniques, and then that gives you the module. And then you can just take a free resolution. And this is actually not that hard to do. It's a little bit harder than the case of NOx. Bit harder than the case of not, but you can do it in a lot of cases, especially the case where you just have two commands. It's actually pretty complicated. For general L space links? I don't know. I mean, I don't have an example. Yeah, so unfortunately, I don't know. This is for general L space links. It's just open. I don't have a proof for general L space links. I don't know how to do that. But it might be true. It also. But it might be true, it also might be false. I don't see a strong reason why it would be true, but I also don't know. You mean it's like possible? You mean that it's determined by the H function is not known, or that the H function can be translated into the R module and equation? So this is true for any L space link. This is actually pretty easy to show because for an L space link, the link floor homology is either F or zero in every Alexander Maus log rating. Mouse log grading. And that will determine the, you know, that, you know, the module, the variables each have a predictable grading. So you kind of can figure out where they go as just an RL module pretty easily, just looking at the grading. The thing that's open is whether the L space links have formal CFL links. Does that make sense? People are like data. Sometimes this would be helpful if you want to take connected sounds and so on through components and stuff. Yeah. I mean the L equals 2 case is helpful because you can use this to compute some satellite operations in Hinger florology. You can bootstrap it to work for the linked surgery formula. So for L equals 2, that's useful because you could compute like, I mean a lot of these formulas are already known, but you can, you know, certain like maser pattern links are L-space links, then certain tabling, tabling. So, cabling, cabling, you know, cabling involves L spacing. So, you can actually do some stuff like this for L equals 2. I don't know what you would actually do with it for more components, but any other questions? Okay, so I have three minutes. I'll say a little bit. We haven't actually said how we use the trick. I might go two or three minutes over, but I think I can give some reason how this trick works. Okay, so. Okay, so I'm going to talk about this one, sort of very briefly. Okay, and hopefully I can say something fairly quickly. So algebraic links are what are called plumbed L-space links. So plumbed links, plumbed links. Font links. Well, what I'm going to do is I encode them with a graph, gamma. I think I can say this pretty quickly. So I take a tree, gamma. And there's two types of vertices of this tree. There's the weights. So there's the weighted vertices. And then there's the arrow vertices. So here I have two arrow vertices. So here I have two arrow vertices, and I'll say this is like two. I'll just put some random numbers down. Minus four. So I have this tree, it has vertices and arrows. And from such a tree, I get a link. And you get this by Dane surgery. Maybe the easiest way to describe it. I mean, you know, canonically you get it from a plumbing construction, but maybe dane surgery is easier to say in the Maybe daint surgery is easier to say in a minute. So, what I do is I just replace every vertex with an unnut, and every edge gets mapped to a class. Okay, so vertices are mapped to just little onna, and then for every edge, I just add a clasp between the two vertices. Okay, so okay, and then what I'm going to do is if I have a vertex, so I do, so let's see, so what we do is we do DAME surgery on the weighted vertices. And then the arrow vertices become L. Okay? So if I had a graph like this, what I would do is I would do N surgery on this component, and then that gives me Y, and then this guy would be L. Okay, I'll try to wrap. I'll try to wrap up pretty quickly. Okay, so this is given a plumbing tree, we get this link in a three-manifold. Every algebraic link actually can be expressed this way. I'll go over time, just two minutes. Any questions? Okay, so there's this theory. I'll describe it. I'll describe it. There's this theory called lattice anology. Okay, so this is due to, and this is for plumbed, three, plumbed manifolds, plumbed manifolds. And this is due to a number of people. This is due to Nemathi, Ojba, Stimship. Extension follow and this gives you a chain complex. So given a tree, let's say with no arrow vertices. So if DMA has no vertices, DMA has no arrow vertices. So then we just get this chain complex. Then we just get this chain complex called lattice homology. So lattice chain complex is a combinatorial chain complex built out of the weights and adjacencies in the graph. And this is just going to be a chain complex over as a joint U. And if you have more vertices, then there's a lattice length complex. And I'll write C F L m. Oh, sorry. Gamma. Oh, sorry, it's not equal. We have a link complex, which is, this is a mod, it's a gene complex of R modules. Let's say R L modules, where L is the number of link components, or of arrow vertices. Okay. And this is due to Ojbov Semchitzavo. Wh is one, and to Roche, Mu and myself when L is bigger than one. Okay, and so there's two sort of steps to the proof of the main theorem. The first is step one. Well, okay, so here's a theorem. So, this is sort of building on work I did and then work that I did with Work that I did with Brojik and Yu. Actually, this chain complex is homotopy equivalent as an A infinity module to the link floor complex, to the link floor complex of, let me write it this way, y gamma, L gamma. So as an A infinity module, So, as an A infinity module over this link RL. And the key point is that this link, this complex here, this CFL, this has a natural algebraic reading. This decomposes. Well, if you think about it, it really decomposes as a Q, but actually, As a Q, but actually, maybe just for simplicity, this has an algebraic rating. So it actually will decompose as a chain complex of RL modules. Sort of by construction, it actually is sort of a chain complex in this very classical sense where we just have a bunch of modules where this ordinary modules. It actually decomposes in a classical sense. This grating here is what we call the lattice grating. So this complex here sort of is actually like a cube. And if you sort of take the norm of the cube point, that gives you this lattice grading. And I'll just end. So if L is a plumbed L-space link, L-space link. Then the homology of this lattice complex is actually supported in a single key point. Since it has no torsion and basically just sort of one tower in the Hagerd floor, since there's only enough room for it to be supported in a single point. Supported in a single point. This implies that CFL minus is going over, right? That's that's that shrink or something. Negative definite, you know, button clicks, but that notes like that or text or one advertising. So it should just show up. Yeah, maybe if it isn't there's some parity thing. I mean, so one example of a non-formal, so it's actually very easy to construct non-formal modules. So for example, you have to be a little modules. So for example, you have to be a little careful, like um the negative two, three horse knot, the chain complex, I've got this way, is like W C, you'd be spring generator. And this is non-formal. If you sort of take homology and you look at it, this one will be non-formal. So like you, it's, yeah, maybe if they were separated by some, maybe if it was like only supported in Z gradings, that might be true. True. Yeah, so you have to compute. If you compute the homology of this and then compute the A infinity actions on homology using like homological perturbation lemma, you'll see there's a non-trivial one. What is that one on complex? That's like a staircase complex as well. But it's a negative staircase complex. Sorry. So the other ones were positive. The homology is sort of supported here. The homology is sort of supported in both gradings. If you take homology, you'll have sort of a tower here. You'll have sort of a tower here, and then you'll have a copy of that. M3, you'll have an M3, that's not trivial. Another way to see this is that a free resolution of F is like the box, the box complex. So the free resolution of this complex is just like, if you take homology, it's just the tower and the box, but these aren't homotopy equivalent. So you know that this one is formal because it's a free resolution. So, and these are easily seen to not be homotopy equivalent, so that's another way to see that this is not formal. Is it like fundamentally different to show the data also explained? Yeah, so the proof that I have been writing down with Diara and Hugo, yeah, you could try to induct it. Like, it sort of is an inductive proof, but what it just, you have to, like, it's more complicated than it sounds. Like, that proof actually just goes by a totally different route. We don't use the trick at all. We use like a Kismal duality trick, and we end up. And we end up, there's like an obstruction to it being formal, which is like some element of an X group that you compute. But like if you have more components, I just think the X group is non-trivial. So there's like some, we do some different, totally different arguments. But it actually does seem to be different if it's more than two components. The proof, it might still be true that L space links are all formal, but the proof we wrote down seems to not work as fascist. We don't really know why. Okay, thank you.
