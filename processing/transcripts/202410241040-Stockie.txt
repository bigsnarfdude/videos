Yeah, so what I'm going to talk about today is a little different. It seems, you know, it's not so much about the numerical methods. I'm going to have to use sort of standard numerical methods, but maybe talk about the application more to problems in biofluids. And I'll explain what I mean by mesoswimmers, but this is really a study of worm life. A study of worm-like microswimmers, but sorry, mesoswimmers. But what I did, whoops, sorry, I do want to acknowledge that this is based on the work of an MSc student of mine who wrote his thesis a number of years ago. And Saeed, this was mainly his work. But this is an outline of my talk, and I will talk briefly about a MERSed boundary method. A lot of you in the room are. A lot of you in the room are familiar with this, but just to give you an idea of more of how we solve the problem numerically. And I'll talk about four simulations applied to the motion of these worm-like swimmers. But I realize my talk is probably a little too short for the forty minutes, so if I have time I may say something quickly about jellyfish at the end. Jellyfish at the end, since I have another student who's done some recent work there that kind of pushes things up to a slightly higher Reynolds number, and we have some interesting results there as well. So in terms of background, there has been a great deal of work done at many different length scales and different Reynolds numbers. So there's been a great deal of work on Great deal of work on micro swimmers at microscopic scales where the Stokes equations at zero Reynolds number are a very reasonable approximation. And these are organisms like spermatozoa with flagella, algae, and many bacteria that have developed specialized ways of moving based on the fact that they're moving around in a Stokes flow. A Stokes flow. And then at much higher Reynolds numbers, this term macro swimmers is very well known in motions of organisms like larger jellyfish, eels, and fish like tuna or even things as large as whales, where Reynolds numbers are much larger. Turbulence is important, and you must solve Navier-Stokes equations. And there's even been a lot of work at simulating or at designing man-made swimming devices that operate at the nanoscale. These things like bimetallic rods that have this sort of structure. They're built of two materials that at the nanoscale, they can actually engineer certain types of swimming motions for these. Motions for these, you know, artificial swimmers or helical nanomotors and things like this. But here you're in the realm of molecular dynamics, and there's no fluid mechanics to solve. These people are doing this at the molecular scale. But there's a gap. And this gap involves sort of swimmers that are sort of, this is not a precise range, but just This is not a precise range, but just roughly between, say, Reynolds number 10 to the minus 2 to 10 to the 2, or something like that. Even Reynolds numbers up to 1,000, let's say. That's at intermediate Reynolds numbers where both inertia and where you need to solve Navier-Stokes equations, but inertia doesn't dominate. Inertia doesn't dominate. So you have both viscous and inertial effects acting. And the type of organisms there are sort of at the lower end is paramecia. Sort of in the you know in the middle there are small jellyfish. This sea gooseberry is an example. And nematodes have a very wide range of length scales. You have very, very small ones on the order of Very small ones on the order of fractions of a millimeter, and they can be as long as almost a centimeter. So, this is this is the sort of organism, worm-like swimmers that generate undulations to swim. Those are the ones I'm going to focus on today. And this just gives a summary of previous work with some, I would say, important references. A lot of these are more review papers like Lauga and Powers that review the literature. That review the literature on low Reynolds number swimmers. There's also a very nice review article here by Al Getty et al. that does an in-depth review of active suspensions with active swimmers at lower Reynolds number. Sort of macroscopic swimmers, there's been tons of work. I couldn't even think of a review paper that's reasonable for all of the work that's been done. For all of the work that's been done here. But many, many simulations using the full Navier-Stokes equations, but at the macro scale are basically looking at one or two swimmers, not large numbers of these macro swimmers. So this mesoscale gap that I mentioned is not just something I made up. You know, people have been recognizing that there is this sort of intermediate. Is this sort of intermediate Reynolds number regime that's often referred to as inertial swimming, where the effects of inertia and viscosity are sort of comparable and has been relatively under-reported in the literature. So there is work to be done here. And a very nice paper by Daphne Plotza in Soft Matter that recently appeared has. Has sort of reiterated this: that especially the collective behavior of suspensions of large numbers of these mesoscale organisms has been largely unexplored. And she has a nice picture where she sort of talks about these. So I'm going to focus on the sort of nematode-type worms that extend over Reynolds numbers roughly here, and small jellyfish, which are also, you know. Fish, which are also, you know, not at the high end here, but you know, somewhere around somewhere around here in terms of Reynolds number. So our focus here is on simulating swimmer dynamics at these intermediate Reynolds numbers where viscous and inertial effects are comparable. And we kind of created this term meso-swimmers between micro and macro. Micro and macro. We hadn't really seen that in the literature. And we're motivated by studying effects like using these inertial effects to alter swimming direction, looking at aspects related to swimming performance. I won't get into that too much today. We've only just started on this. But we're interested in looking at aspects, say, related to feeding efficiency. Feeding efficiency, where both viscous and inertial effects feed into this. It's known that these mesoswimmers have different, you know, they have different behavior when it comes to predator and prey dynamics. And Klotza, in particular, points to the importance of uncovering, say, possibly new flocking states that hadn't really been recognized before. Been recognized before, or non-equilibrium phase transitions in active matter. And although it seems we were the first to sort of coin this term mesoswimmer, this work is actually not published yet. And so the first time I've seen this term in the actual literature is this paper by Hubert et al. in Physical Review Letters. So, you know, it's actually becoming a term, Mesoswimmers, although you mostly have heard of micro and macro swimmers. So I'm going to focus. I'm going to focus on these worm-like mesoswomers that move with an undulatory motion. They generate these sort of sinusoidal-like variations along their length. At intermediate Reynolds numbers with no turbulence. I'm not trying to simulate turbulence here. And focusing in on the hydrodynamic interactions between multiple swimmers, this undulatory mode of propulsion, and of propulsion and taking advantage at least in the case of our worm-like swimmers of scalable numerical algorithms that are that are potentially capable of simulating hundreds or thousands of swimmers. We're still at the lower end there, but the idea is to be able to simulate more dense suspensions or larger large suspensions. Or larger, larger fluid domains. The interesting thing about nematodes that I wasn't aware of until I looked into it a bit further is there's estimates that there's up to 25,000 species, different species of these particular worms. And I pulled this, I tried to figure out where I found that number, and I can't seem to, maybe on Wikipedia, but I can't get access. Maybe on Wikipedia, but I can't get access to Wikipedia in China, it seems. So I read, I believe on Wikipedia, that they actually make up 80% of all animals on the planet, marine and in the soil. They actually live in soil, freshwater, and the ocean. So I don't know how reliable that is. I'd be happy to be proven wrong on that, but they're a huge amount of the biomass on the planet, though we don't really see them because they're relatively small. Because they're relatively small organisms. So I would say nematodes are important to actually simulate. So there we go. Our aims here are to reproduce qualitative behaviors. I have no benchmarks that I can compare to yet. But studying, this is a picture of some simulations by Young, Marceau, and Gomper, where you see three different types of behavior that I'm going to focus in on. Behavior that I'm going to focus in on, which is single swimmers swimming by themselves. You get pairwise interactions in areas like here, and then you get sort of aggregation of many swimmers together. So I sort of want to look at all three of those and to also develop quantitative measures of this aggregation behavior when they move from single swimmers to pairwise. Swimmers to pairwise interactions and then actually create the clumps. How do we actually measure that? And this idea in suspensions of active matter to observe emergent behavior without specifically imposing an aggregation behavior. What is it about hydrodynamics that can lead to this type of emergent behaviour of aggregation and things like this? That's what we're aiming to do. So that's what we're aiming to do. So, I'll talk very briefly next about the immersed boundary method, how we're implementing this in a simple immersed boundary approach, and the numerical methods we'll use. The immersed boundary is an Eulerian, oops, sorry, Eulerian-Lagrangian method, where the fluid domain is, we're just looking at a very simple square box with periodic boundary conditions to emulate. Boundary conditions to emulate a small region, perhaps a much larger suspension that has some sort of roughly periodic structure in it. The swimmers themselves, I'm going to represent as curves, gamma sub i, where i runs from 1 to n s. And each curve swimmer is just a curved segment in 2b. So we can look at a single. So, we can look at a single isolated swimmer, gamma. Well, okay, it's a periodic domain. So, these are, you know, a periodic array of swimmers that are far separated from each other, and the hydrodynamic interactions are minimal. Or we can look at multiple swimmers that are more closely spaced, and there's Ns of these spread throughout the fluid. And the advantage of this simple kind of description. Kind of description is our structured grids are very simple. We can simply look at equally spaced grids for the fluid and the fibers. The immersed boundary equations are based on the incompressible Navy and Stokes equations, which are highlighted here, governing the fluid mechanics. Each swimmer is generating a singular fluid force that emulates. Force that emulates what the effect of that swimmer is on the surrounding fluid, and that comes through this elastic force density function, F sub I. And it's spread to the surrounding fluid through this convolution with a delta function. Okay, so this is the standard immersed boundary approach. And the no-slip condition on the Condition on the swimmer itself, between the swimmer and the fluid, is taken into account by the fact that the speed of the swimmer has to be the speed of the fluid at the same location, which you can conveniently also write as a convolution of the fluid velocity with a delta function. So you'll notice that there's this equation for the fiber motion, there's Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid, but the interaction, the fluid structure interactions are The fluid structure interactions are mediated by these delta functions. So, a smooth version of that plays a dual role in both spreading the forces onto the fluid and interpolating the velocities onto the swimmer locations. And that leads to a simple and efficient numerical method known as the immersed boundary method. The one piece that I haven't The one piece that I haven't talked about is the force density function that each swimmer is imposing on the fluid. And for a simple worm-like swimmer, we're going to approximate this with a sum of two force contributions. One is a stretching and compression-resistant force that is like a nonlinear spring force that brings this back to a target length of L. Length of L, little L sub S for each swimmer. And then there's a bending resistant force that tends to push this swimmer back to a target shape that's described by this X tilde. And this is where the undulatory motion comes in. We've taken this from a paper by Sarah Olson and Lisa Fauci, where this is a simple, simple, you know. Simple, you know, uniformly spaced along the swimmer direction, but then it has some sort of a periodic in time and space so that you can have these undulatory type motions. So there's this amplitude parameter little a that I want to point out. There's a wave number k and there's a frequency of oscillation omega. Of oscillation omega. So this omega, k, and a will show up a little bit later. Those are the undulatory swimming parameters. So the algorithm we're going to use to solve these immersed boundary equations are on this single slide here. This is a method that a PhD student of mine developed as part of his thesis back in 2015, and it's based on a pseudocompressibility method of Guerrilla. Compressibility method of Germond and Minev that reduces the Navier-Stokes solve to a sequence of tri-diagonal linear systems. We use parallel domain decomposition, exploiting the rectangular geometry to compute the immersed boundary data using GO cells. So this is just kind of a picture of that. I have little sub-domains that have this little Little region of ghost cells, and I use those to compute to transfer information between neighboring subcells of the fluid domain. We've tested this extensively on a variety of 2D and 3D problems, convergence studies and everything else. I won't present those here. But the interesting thing about this method is that we obtain near-optimal efficiencies. So, with this parallel efficiency measure on P processors, what we actually see is compared with an FFT type solution, our German Minev scheme, that's this GM guy, has a parallel efficiency of close to one. So it's quite efficient. You know, we're only implementing this in 2D examples right now, so this is not so impressive. But the idea is that this could actually be used to simulate 3D. Could actually be used to simulate 3D suspensions. And you can hope for fairly efficient 3D simulations here. And this also shows the time of the FFT versus the German-Minav scheme. You get similar behavior, but this is improvement over an FFT type solver. We're quite happy with this. I'd like to show you some results with this numerical. You, some results with this numerical method now. The first thing we did, well, okay, the first thing we did was look at an idealized periodic sheet. So, you know, this, because this is a periodic domain, this is an infinite sheet that extends on. But there are some results, analytical and other numerics, that we can compare directly to. So So, defining Reynolds number in terms of this swimmer time frequency and wave number, we can actually compare to other results. There's some asymptotic results of Tuck back in 1968 where the swimming speed versus this swimming-based frequency to wave number ratio. To wave number ratio, you can write down an asymptotic expansion for that in terms of the Reynolds number. So we can compare to this asymptotic result. And there's also some immersed boundary simulations, you know, fairly old now, but it does give us a benchmark to compare to. And these are the physical parameters we looked at. Our domain size is relatively small, two millimeters square. Square and these parameters are chosen to compare to the results in Fauci and Peskin. These are the results that they use there for various swimming amplitudes. So the periodic sheet swims to the left as expected. This is a trace of the midpoint of that swimming sheet. We just sort of mark that point and trace that as a function of time in the. Of time in the periodic domain here. This is a subset, and you can see it's moving quite slowly, right? So this goes from 0.0975 to 0.1, so it's quite small region, but you can see how this moves consistently to the left. And the swimming speed as a function of the amplitude. So this is this ratio of u over the The frequency to wave number ratio as a function of swimming amplitude, our results behave very much like Fauci's. So Fauci's are the red points, ours are the blue squares, and like their results, we are consistent up to Tuck's asymptotic formula to this point here, and then there's this little bit of deviation here. So this is. So, this is consistent, I would say, with both the asymptotics and the numerics. So, based on this, we went on and extended this to the single swimmer case. Here are the parameters that we're using. And we looked in this case at varying the beat frequency. So, we chose a fixed amplitude that was about a tenth of the length of the swimmer, so small amplitude, but then. So small amplitude, but then we varied the beat frequency to obtain values in this Reynolds number range. And we observe qualitative agreement. There's no benchmarks that we can directly compare to. But we observe qualitative agreement with experiments and other simulations that at higher Reynolds number, the swimmer is shedding alternating vortices, which assists with the swimming, and the amplitude of the tail oscillation. Amplitude of the tail oscillations, it turns out, increases with Reynolds number. And I give you a picture of that for the smaller Reynolds numbers. Here, here are pictures of, oh my gosh, what are these contours of? I'm actually trying to remember what those are. Could be vorticity, but I'm not entirely sure. Okay, sorry about that. But we're looking at the swimming period, which is related. Swimming period, which is related to the frequency of period over four, over two, and so on, and in time. And you can see that as this Reynolds number increases, the magnitude of the tail oscillations goes up quite a bit. So, this is the head, and this is the tail. Okay, and this is observed in both. In both experiments and in other numerical simulations. And we also looked at this effect of the increase in swimming speed with the Reynolds number. And there's an interesting little blip at much lower Reynolds numbers. So there's this sort of nice smooth variation here, but there's this little blip that I've zoomed in on here. And this has actually been addressed in the literature. I've just shown one reference here where. Reference here where they argue that for larger Reynolds number, the forward motion is driven by the momentum in the wake, these vortices that are trailing off the tail end. But for smaller Reynolds number, it's viscous forces that are dominating the thrust production. And so these results, I mean, we have no one else that we can really compare this figure to, but it seems to be a problem. To, but it seems to be consistent that there's this transition from very small Reynolds numbers to large Reynolds numbers, and there's some difference in the way that these swimmers are propelling themselves at lower Reynolds number. So the third example we looked at was pairwise interactions, and Olson and Fauci and many others have observed that at least in the sort. At least in the sort of Stokesian limit, swimmers synchronize or phase lock when they're initialized with this phase shift of pi over 2. If we do the same thing, looking at them sort of undulating out of phase, they start out out of phase, but as you progress through, they eventually shift relative to each other to lock phases, so they're swimming together. Phases, so they're swimming together. This is something we observe in our pairwise swimmer simulations. But at higher Reynolds numbers, this synchronization can fail because of hydrodynamic forces that cause the swimmers to repel. So it doesn't happen in all cases, but it can happen that they start to look like they're going to phase lock, but then they move away from each other. So this is something that... So, this is something that seems to be a higher Reynolds number effect. And so, what happens is that nearby swimmers tend to attract each other as long as the Reynolds number is small. Here's a picture of the sort of distance as multiples of the grid spacing, little H, between these are initially equally spaced along their length, but then you can see where the head and the tail. But then you can see where the head and the tail distance reduces over time. There's, you know, a little more spacing between the tail and the head, but they're synchronizing at the head with a little spread along the tail. This is consistent with other simulations that we've seen, in particular those of Olson and Fauci. Now we're going to the case more realistic of suspensions of many swimmers. Swimmers, and we're going to initialize with a certain number of swimmers that have a random location and orientation relative to each other. And otherwise, the parameters are the same as the previous case. But what we tried to come up with was some way of measuring the aggregation intensity, let me say, the degree of aggregation of swimmers in a suspension. And it turns out there is something like this in the Something like this in the in the, well, it's more general in the suspension literature, but it's been applied a lot in the study of wood pulp fiber suspensions. And this is just one example, this paper by Schmidt et al., where there's this pair distribution function, g of r, which is an ensemble average of this. Spacing between particles r minus rij, but using a delta function to actually form this pair distribution function. And initially, in sort of randomly spaced fibers, we don't really see much aggregation intensity according to this pair distribution. Pair distribution function. But you'll see on the next slide that as we let these guys undulate and swim around, there are some of these guys that assemble together into these little aggregates. That is actually observed in this pair distribution function, where we start to see at lower separations peaks in the pair distribution function. So I mean this is these peaks are obvious markers of aggregation and the larger peaks represent a more intense aggregation of a number of these pairs. At higher Reynolds numbers what happens is aggregation happens much more rapidly but then they tend to separate out a little bit afterwards and so the the pair distribution function tends to level out a little bit. Tends to level out a little bit. Okay? So in this case, at higher Reynolds number, the aggregation is more rapid, but also transient and less intense than it was in the previous case. All right. So this is what I wanted to say about undulatory microswimmers, just to give you some idea of what we've done. We've been able to validate our two-dimensional results on undulatory swimmers. Dimensional results on undulatory swimmers using other numerical results in the simple asymptotic formula of tux. We observe synchronization and phase locking, enhanced swimming speeds, different attraction and repulsion behavior, and these alignment and aggregation effects that seem to be representative of real flocking in undulatory swimmers. Undulatory swimmer suspensions, even at relatively small Reynolds number. So the simulations are fast, you know, practically on the order of minutes for even 64 swimmers. So we're hopeful we could extend this to three dimensions. But I think one of the most helpful things here, maybe, for people looking at these Meso swimmer suspensions, is this pair distribution function that I think is coming from the pulp fiber literature, but is actually useful for these active suspensions in terms. Active suspensions in terms of measuring the aggregation intensity. In terms of what we're doing, so far our observations are mainly qualitative, so more direct comparisons with experiments are needed. One thing that people observe in experiments is that wall interactions actually cause interesting dynamics of these micro- and meso-swimmers. So we'd like to look at that. So, we'd like to look at that. So far, we've ignored that. There are limitations to our 2D suspensions, of course, because our swimmers are not worms, they're infinite sheets. So, there's obviously 3D effects that we're missing here. And 3D simulations are really needed. So, I wasn't able to embed a video before this talk, but if you look at videos of nematodes swimming, you'll see they're turning in 3D. They actually have to. Turning in 3D, they actually have to wind on top of each other to turn around. And we can't simulate that in two-dimensions, that effect. So we like to look at three-dimensional effects like this. So do I have five minutes to talk about jellyfish? Yeah, so I do want to say something quickly about jellyfish, which is the work of another MSc student that graduated more recently, Mahdi Salezadeh. I missed the D in his name. It should be Zadeh. A D in his name should be Zade. We looked at the swimming dynamics of smaller jellyfish that are at the upper end of the Mesoswimmer range. So sorry, so this, are these actually meso-swimmers? I'm not sure, but I'm going to include them in my MesoSwimmer talk. The swimming here is driven by jetting behavior where the jellyfish contract their bell and generate a jet of fluid that pushes them forward and then they Fluid that pushes them forward, and then they contract and swim in this way. It is very different from undulatory swimmers. We designed a simple immers boundary model for the bell that consists of three different kinds of forces. One is points linked by springs that again try to maintain the bell of the jellyfish at a constant length. We're ignoring the tentacles. They also tend to maintain a certain shape, and so we've got here some bending-resistant forces for each triplet of points. We have forces that resist bending. And then the swimming muscles we emulate by a pair of time-dependent springs that contract at a certain frequency. So there's three sets of these forces. Those are implement. Okay, so I'm not writing them down, but. Okay, so I'm not writing them down, but trust me, we've done that in a reasonable way in the immersed boundary framework. And what we see are sort of these are time snapshots at the same time for swimmers moving in more viscous fluids with the viscosity increasing as shown here, the viscosity mu. And each of these, it's not so clear here, but you can see there is. Not so clear here, but you can see there is a wake structure that varies depending on the Reynolds number. And this is consistent with other simulations of jellyfish at these Reynolds numbers. But just to give you a sense of what we're doing, what we were especially interested in here is studying feeding dynamics. And so in order to do this, Mahdi put in, you know, adding tracer particles, simulating the capture passive praise. The capture of passive prey like algae or plankton that are not swimming so quickly. And so, this jellyfish swimming through, you can see they're actually because of the vortices that are generated at the edges of the bell, they're actually able to entrain food particles inside the bell. When they jet, these particles here then get expelled, but there are some over several swimming cycles that actually get entrained in the bell. That actually gets entrained in the bell and would then presumably be eaten by the jellyfish. The mouth is sitting somewhere up here near the front of the bell. So we're not simulating eating yet, but you'd imagine that we could look at the concentration of food particles inside the bell and then say something about the feeding efficiency of jellyfish swimming in various modes. And here's another example of, say, a more denser collection. Of, say, a more denser collection of food that's sort of maybe, well, you know, Makti looked at different distributions of food particles and how those might be entrained at different speeds and different frequencies of swimming. So just to give you some idea. But what we found was really interesting, there were some results on scaling of aquatic locomotion by these three authors in These three authors in a relatively recent article in Nature Physics. And what they did was they looked at undulatory swimmers, so back to worms. They derived a swimming number. And this swimming number relates sort of viscosity to the frequency, amplitude, and length of these swimmers over a wide range of marine organisms. Well, sorry. Well, sorry, mammals and marine organisms. And they assembled data over a huge range of Reynolds numbers and observed that most of these undulatory swimmers obey a scaling law between Reynolds number and swimming number that either has a power, well, most of them follow a Reynolds number proportional to swimming number. So these are turbulent flows, but then at the lower end of flows but then at the lower end of the scale there was a four-thirds in the laminar flow regime and Mhakti did these simulations with the jellyfish added them to this figure and found that our jellyfish are sitting down here at the linear laminar scale and so the question we haven't answered yet is why this is just interesting but we'd like to investigate this a little bit more carefully and perhaps redo their derivation of this swimming number Their derivation of this swimming number for, remember, jellyfish are not undulatory swimmers, they're these jetting swimmers. So, what is the equivalent? Maybe there's a different swimming number we need to use for jetting type dynamics. So, that's where we ended up. And I'll just end here. I can share references with anyone who might be interested, but I'm happy to take questions.
