It's a pleasure to have Dr. Kinjin Kong from Los Alamos National Lab to give this keynote talk in the morning. His title is Unraveling the Effects of Petability, Viscous, Inertial, and Interfacial Tension Forces in Multiphase Flow Using High Performance Poor Scale Lattice Boltzpan Simulations. So I had a pleasure to talk to Dr. Kang when we just started. Kang, when we just started working on the inertial flow model. So, today we have almost half a day talk about that is Boltzmann simulation. So, I had mentioned to him that we'll try to look at applications beyond PoreScale also. Okay, so floor is all yours, Dr. Kang, and you have like 50 minutes talk and then five, six minutes QA. Okay. Thank you, Professor Tayaki. Thank you, Professor Teagi, for the introduction. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. It is my great honor to give this presentation. I would like to thank the organizing committee for this opportunity. It is a pity that I cannot speak to you in person this time. Nowadays, it is very hard for me to get DOE approval for foreign travel. Hopefully, I can meet all of you in the near future. Today, I will be talking about the high-performance pulse-scale lattice policy simulation of multiphase flow in pulse media, trying to unravel the effects of wettability, viscous inertia, and the surface tension forces for multiphase flow in geological media. I would like to thank my colleague collaborators, Dr. Yu Chen, a former postdoc who is now in Southern University of Science and Technology in China. In China, my colleague Harry Wesvanathan at LANO, and the professor Alberta Valuki from the University of Inoue at Bana Champen. I would also acknowledge LANOS LDRD program for provide funding support and the LANOS Institutional Computing Program for providing computational resources. Okay. So, this is the outline of my talk today. After the introduction, I will briefly go over numerical methods and validations. Then, I'll talk about one example of supercoating CO2 displacing water in a heterogeneous micro-model, focusing on inertia effects. So, I spend most of the time on multi-phase flow through a Bantham or sandstone, including both strain energy. Including both strain energy and inhibition simulations. Then I'll draw some conclusions. So, we know multi-phase flow impulse media is pervasive in energy and environmental systems. Examples include development of petroleum reservoirs and the geologic storage of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, as well as polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Polymer electrolyte fuel cells, we can see actually water gas flow, two-phase flow in the electrodes. So a better understanding of this phenomena is critical for managing improved production of Earth's energy resources, safe disposal of energy-related waste, and improved performance and the durability of engineered energy systems. But this problem is very challenging. This problem is very challenging for either theoretical analysis, experimental study, and neuronic modeling because it often couples with multiple other processes and interacts with complex morphology of natural and man-made pulse media over multiple lengths and time scales. As an example, here the schematic shows hydraulic Hydraulic fracturing for natural gas production or shale gas production. We can see the processes include dissorption at the Lando scale all the way up to the multi-phase flow in microscopic fracture or production wells spanning like 12 orders of magnitude. So there are two types of numeric models for multi-phase flow in impulse media. One is continuum models, which depend on averaging system properties. Also, because of the averages, they lost detailed information, then they also depend on empirical relationships such as probability and the porosity, etc. So, again, because they do not resolve poor-scale. Without poor scale heterogeneities, they cannot capture poor level phenomena or morphological effects, but they are computationally efficient. The other type of models is poor-scale models. They fully resolve post-structures and they directly solve governing equations at the pole-scale. So they can reveal underlying flow physics and can provide physics-based constitutive relationships for continuum models. Relationships for continuum models, but understandably, they are computationally expensive. Recently, the Portuguese direct pneumatic simulation is becoming increasingly popular because of the advance in X-ray tomographic imaging techniques that can provide high-resolution post-structures for numeric simulations and the advancement. And the advancement in many core processor supercomputers that enable poor-scale simulation over relatively large domain, allowing direct comparison between poor-scale simulations and experiments. Among different post-scale models, the Nasboltman method now is widely used because of its some unique features. In the Nasboltman method, the loose Burzon method, the low slip velocity condition at the solid surface can be realized simply using the bunk's back condition of the distribution function. Therefore, it is easy to handle complex geometry for the Latz-Boltzmann method. Also, for the two-face flow, the Latz-Boltzmann method offers a diffuse interface model, which means there is no singularity for the moving contact line problems. For the moving contact line problems. In addition, there is no need to track fluid-fluid interface and the formation and the movement of the interface is automatic. This is an example of Natsburg simulation of liquid vapor boiling. We can see the bubble nucleation, growth, detachment, and the coalescence are all captured. Lessons are all captured automatically. Also, because of the explicit time stepping and locality offered by a kinetic model, the NASA Rotom method is ideally suitable for parallel computing and for modern high-performance computing. The figure on the right shows a strong scaling of our large sports. A strong scaling of our Latvozman simulation on actually up to tens of thousands of CPU processor cores. So we all know to properly or correctly simulate a physical system, we do match the dimensionless numbers between the physical and the other systems for multi-phase flow in person media. The main dimension The main dimensionless parameters include like a cardiac angle, viscosity ratio, and the density ratio, which are related to material properties, and the capillary number, resonance number, which are related to both material properties and flow conditions. It is very, I mean, as these dimensions parameters control the system behaviors, there are many studies. There are many studies investigating the effects. However, in most of these studies, reload number is not matched. The reason is that it is very challenging to match both the capillary number and the reload number. Match both numbers means matching the on a sourge number. So a small on a sourge number or a large relative number means small viscosity to surface tension region. Or viscosity to surface tension ratio, which may lead to numeric instability for many numeric methods, or means a very large characteristic length, which means high resolution or fine grid and hence high computational cost. So in practice, a much lower reload number or a much higher announcement number is often used, which means the inertial Which means the inertial force is negligible compared to the viscous force. This may sound reasonable as the reloss number based on the average bulk velocity is usually not high for flow impulse media. But recent study has found that for a supercritical borne system, the inertial effects are not negligible. Not negligible because the local reloss number can be much higher than the bulk reloss number. One example is the highest jumps, the sudden jumps of the fluid interface accompanied by fluid redistribution and the transient pressure response. In addition, it is found that the time scales of highest jumps are independent of the injection velocity and dependent only on the fluid properties. On the fluid properties. So, to properly simulate multiphase flow physics, it is necessary to match both the capillary lumber and the result lumber. This requires advanced multi-phase model, enabling accurate modeling for small viscosity to surface tension ratio, and highly optimized code for modern supercomputers. For modern supercomputers, rendering high-resolution simulations of real rock systems are affordable. And we have developed such a state-of-the-art first-scale approach based on the Las Borzo method. So the Las Borzo method was originally derived from simplified models with basic conservation nodes. However, it was shown. However, it was shown later that the Las Boltzmann equation can be derived from the continuous Boltzmann equation for gas flow by proper discretization in time, space, and velocity space. Also, the hydrodynamic equations can be recovered from the Latin-Boltzmann equation using a multi-scale expansion technique with the fluid density and velocity given by the moments of distribution function. Of distribution functions. So, for multi-phase flow, multiple sets of distribution functions are used, each tracking one fluid phase, like red and blue. For the commonly used color gradient multi-phase model, here omega 1, 2, and 3 are used to account for viscous effects, surface tension effects, and the separation of different fluids respectively. The interfacial tension is given by this equation where sigma is the surface tension coefficient, kappa is the local curvature of the interface, and phi is the other parameter. So the original color grid model has some drawbacks, such as high density to surface, high density, sorry, high viscosity. Sorry, high viscosity to surface attention ratio, which is not ideal for, I mean, high reality lumber simulation. And the artificial film caused by fictious density weighting model. There are some developments in the literature. One is a geometrical weighting model, which bends the fluid interface to desire the contact angle at the three-phase contact line. This model eliminates the artificial fluid. Eliminates the artificial film, but it's not accurate for contact angle further away from 90 degrees. And another improvement is continuum surface force model. It directly computes the interface curvature to obtain the forcing term. So it greatly reduces spurious velocity as a fluid fluid. Spirit's velocity at the fluid-fluid interface. It has been shown that the combination of the above two models has a great advantage in a 2D simulation. In this study, we further extended the method to three-dimensional space within the MRT framework and employed GPU acceleration. And we tested our models in some simple systems. Here is a stationary drop-down test. Stationary droplet test without a solid wall. This table is busy, but we can see the top, sorry, the bottom two methods have similar accuracy as other methods, but smaller spurious velocity for these two columns highlighted. In addition, the MRT method has much better convergence. Has much better convergence. So this method is the best in this test. So we further test the stationary chocolate with solid walls. We can see the method combining geometric model and continuous surface force model predicts the correct contact angle in the entire range. Or in the entire range, as shown in the black solid and dashed lines. And also, this model needs to spirit velocity one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of other approaches. Then I'll be talking about supercritic CO2 displacement water in a heterogeneous micro model. So this figure shows the geometry. We carry out two 3D simulations. In the first simulation, only capillary number is matched with that of the experiment, but a lower zero number is used, which means the inertial effects are not fully considered. In the second simulation, both capillary number and reload number are matched, which means the on a social number. Are matched, which means the onesological number is also matched, and the full inertial effects are considered. We can see the elevations of the displacement process. I mean, at a glance, we can see the difference clearly. Let's look into the distribution, the final distribution in more detail. We can say both simulations reproduced major flow pathways. produced major flow pathways observed in the experiments as highlighted by the red ellipse ellipses. However, the simulation with only the capillary number matched failed to reproduce some flow pathways as highlighted by the white ellipses, so resulting in underestimated CO2 saturation. But the simulation But the simulation with full inertial effects compares well with the experimental data on both displacement patterns and the final CO2 saturation, even with some of the details of the very fine fingering or flow pathways. So then I'll focus on multi-phase flow through Pansemer Sandstone. This is a rock sample. The size is quite large, and the resolution is rather high, thanks to Professor Williamschild from Oregon State University. And in the simulation, the whole height of the sample is used with some actually additional layers added for boundary treatment. And in the cross-section, we use the sub- section we use the we use the subsection of the whole sample. The flow is in the direction perpendicular to the screen. For boundary conditions, constant velocity boundary condition is enforced at the inlet and the convective condition is applied at the outlet. Here are some parameters using the simulation. For this drainage, which is water Which is water and the supercritical CO2 systems. So the risk gas ratio between supercooling CO2 between water and supercooling CO2 is about 38. And we used two capillary numbers and four contact angles and four anesthetic numbers resulting in total like 32 simulations. 32 simulations. One word on computational performance. We use like MPI open ACC slash OpenMP hybrid programming model. So our code is very portable and scalable. For one such simulation, it takes our code 22 hours to reach the breakthrough point using 20 way 100. 20way 100 GPUs. These animations show the simulated displacement process for the fixed capillary number and on a soldier number, but increasing contact angle from the top to bottom. And this figure shows the invading phase or CO2 saturation as a As a function of distance from the inlet. From both the animation and the figures, we can see that the CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle. By the way, the simulation stops at the breaking through point. And we And we also plotted results for other ones numbers. We can see CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle for all the onosoj numbers considered. This can be explained with the help of this figure, which shows the CO2 saturation as a function of capillary lumber derived from. Lumber derived from micromodel experiments of supercritic CO2 displacing water. We can see that at small capillary lumber, CO2 saturation decreases as the capillary lumber increases. It reaches a minimum and increases with the capillary lumber. The minimum corresponds to the crossover from capillary fingering to viscous fingering. viscous frame rate. So look in our study, the content angle is not included, let me see, is not included in the definition of capillary lumber. So while the capillary number is fixed in our simulation, the effective capillary number increases as the content angle increases. Since the capillary number is low, Capital number is low. In this case, our simulation result is consistent with the figure before the crossover. That is, the saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle, which results in the increase of effective capillary number. So, how about the simulations with a higher capillary lumber where the trend changes as Where the trend changes as this one. So, here, indeed, at the higher capillary number, the case with the largest cone angle has the highest CO2 saturation. And again, this holds for all the unassogy numbers considered. So, which means the unassogy number does not change the qualitative effect of the wettability, which means the existence that Which means the existing studies on in the literature on the effect of vocabulary lumber without accounting for the full inertial effects are still valid. That's some good news. But I would say that's qualitatively effective number does not change the qualitative effect of the wetability, but it does change the quantitative effect, does have. Quantitative effect, does have a quantitative effect, as we can see from this from the inertial effect. These animations show the simulation results for the fixed capillary number and the contact angle, but the increasing analogy number from top to bottom. We can see from both the elements. From both the animation and this figure on the right, the CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of an associate number. Also, we can see the red curve, which corresponds to the strongest inertial effects, is further away from other three curves, which are close to each other. That means the change of saturation with the With an associate number is non-linear, which means the inertial effects exhibit threshold behavior. To further illustrate this, we subtracted the fluid phase of the case of on-surgeon number two from that of on-source number one and plotted the resulting fluid phase. Resulting fluid phase. Pores invaded by CO2 found exclusively in the case of anosology number one are shown in red, and those found exclusively in case of anatomy number two are shown in blue. So we can see more red pores than blue pores, which means more CO2 flow pathways developed in on the source number one than in on the source number two. Than on a source number two. Also, so this means the inertial effects increase the chance of invading otherwise impenetrable pores when inertial effects are negligible, resulting in larger long-waiting phase saturation. Or just one reminder: the on association number one to four is increasing. Now, all association number one is the smallest, means the inertial. The smallest means the inertial effects is largest. We can see a similar phenomena, like that means more red poles than blue poles in figure B and C. In addition, we can see red poles decrease from A to C, which means the change of innovation patterns between anatology number one and our analogy number two is most. And so number two is more significant than that between OH2 and OH3, and that between OH3 and OH4. This means the threshold behavior just mentioned on previous slide. These figures show the CO2 saturation as a function of D. As a function of distance from the inlet at different contact angles and analog numbers, we can say CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of analogy number for all the contact angles considered. And at the higher capillary number, the CO2 saturation also decreases with the increase. Also, it decreases with the increase of anesthogy number for all the contact angles considered. This means the inertial effects are persistent, independent of the capillary lumber and the contact angle. I mean, I mentioned its independency on the injected fluid in the introduction, which is confirmed here because the inertial effects are independent of the capillary lumber. Are independent of the capital number. This elevation shows the effects of both sweatability and inertial force. With the increase of the anisogee lumber, the saturation decreases vertically, you can see. With the since this capillary, in this case, the capillary lumber. In this case, the capillary number is small. With the increase of contact angle, the saturation also decreases because the increase of contact angle leads to increase of capillary number. So this leads to the smallest saturation in the bottom right figure, as we can see clearly from the elevations. Then we Then we switched the gear to like impubition simulation. For impubation, for the same system, we studied oil and water because this is relevant to like oil production. The drainage, of course, is related to the CO2 storage. Here we only consider one capillary number, the higher capillary number, and two kind of angles. The two canon angles and three on a social numbers result in six total simulations. We can see the water saturation or the invading phase water saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle for all the unsuch numbers considered. We can see the red curve is always on top. Is on top most of the time, at least, which components the red curve is corresponding to counter angle 100 and the black curve is 150. So which means the more neutral wettability, like 100 degree kind of angle, results in higher invading phase saturation. The reason is the capillary. reason is the capillary force plays a less important role in this case also in this case i mean more neutral wettability case the port to pole variation of capillary force is also smaller than that in the case of stronger wettability this may result in less trapping of the long waiting phase which means the higher saturation of the invading phase Saturation of the invading phase. And then now we plot the saturation for different allasology numbers. We can see the difference is very small. So basically, the inertial effect is not significant in the MBP for the MBP considered in this study. I think one explanation is that we can see the saturation. We can see the saturation is high throughout the system except near the outlet, which means most flow pathways have been developed and an additional inertial force will not help develop new flow pathways. So, of course, this is just one rock sample of the limited number of, I mean, Limited number of, I mean, flow conditions and the results cannot simply generate it at this case. Like MPB is not significant in or sorry, the inertial effects are not significant in impression. This cannot be generalized yet, only in the case we studied here, which is limited. Here, which is limited. And this figure shows to this figure shows to total invading phase saturation at the breakthrough for all the cases. You can see 32 training cases at the lower capillary lumber and higher capillary lumber, and six immigration cases. Let's recap. As a lower capillary number, Like at the lower capillary number, the CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle and the trend changes as a higher capillary number. And the CO2 saturation decreases with the increase of answer number, we can say vertically at each contact angle. And this is true for all the contact angles. For all the contact angles considered, and for both capillary numbers, which means the inertial effects are persistent. And for imbibation, we can see the water saturation decreases with the increase of contact angle for the olosogy numbers considered. And vertically, the water saturation changes very slightly. Changes very slightly with the onesogene number, which means the inertial effects are not significant in imbibation in this study. So here are some conclusions. So the continuum surface force-based counter-gradient model combined with the geometrical weighting model significantly reduces spurious velocity. Velocity and the efficient implementation of the advanced aspiration model and GPUs has enabled a high-resolution post-scale simulation of multi-phase flow over a large domain. And the inertial effects are significant for training in the supercritical RAM system for all continental angles and capillary numbers considered. And the inertial. And the inertial effects exhibit threshold behavior. But the inertial effects are not significant for MBBC in the water-oil system considered in this study. And wettabilities play an important role in fluid saturation at a breakthrough point for both systems. Its role is like that of capillary lumber in this study. But the study are more rock samples. But the study on more rock samples and the post structures is needed and actually is ongoing. So, thank you for your attention. I would like to take any questions. Oh, there's plenty of time for that. Well, thank you. Thank you, Dr. Kang. That was a very nice presentation. Thank you. So, floor is open for questions. Audience on Zoom can either unmute. Audience on Zoom can either unmute themselves, raise their hands, or type the question in the chat box. And I'll start taking questions from the folks that represent in the room. Okay. Hi, really interesting. This is Charles Menevo. I was just curious, and this is a question really more relevant to single phase, whether the inertial effects you describe, are they relevant to having to include a Forschimber? To having to include a Forsheimer-type term in continuum descriptions of these models. In other words, if you describe these phenomena with continuum Darcy-Forschheimer type equations, does it mean that you would like to include a Forsheimer term in the expressions? That's a very question. I don't know if there's any analog to this, but here the inertial effects in a two-phase flow context is caused by the context is caused by the interface phenomena because of the viscosity contrast of the two fluids. For the single phase flow in the Tarsi scale model, that forcing term, I don't know the magnetism is similar, but that's a that's a that's a good question and uh we can certainly look into that. looking into that and and again as i mentioned like in the two-phase flow the hands jumps are independent of the to some extent to a large extent independent of flow conditions and kind of determined by the properties material properties like both fluid properties and also the geometry because we have a characteristic lens there so that's why we Lengths there, so that's why we can right now we cannot generalize the results to, I mean, especially the EPP case to other samples because then the inertial effects may be stronger in other geometries. I'm hoping I probably didn't answer fully your question, Professor Manuel. It's nice to see you virtually at least. Yeah, here's another question here. I saw you had one slide where you had some, I guess, experimental comparisons to the model. I was just curious if you're able to do, you know, modify the experiments to, I guess, look at some of the other. Do you have more than one experimental case? Let's see. Oh, you mean like You mean like uh the yeah, this slide This one, right? That's I think yeah, mostly this experiment on micro models and uh yeah and this one is from these are This is a lot of one-to-one comparison. Actually, this figure is derived for this relationship between saturation and capillary number. We use that to explain our relationship between saturation and contact angle because based on this definition, the contact angle, changing contact angle also changes the effective capillary number. So I don't think there are any other experiments. I don't know which one you are referring to. I don't know which one you are referring to. No, I missed this slide the first time. So, yeah, this helps. Okay, that's fine. Thank you. I think you explained the Haines jump in the multi-phase. Okay, that's pretty unique for that. And even in the part where we're talking about this pore geometry, that plays a crucial role. I think even in your summaries, you're talking about its fluid properties, but to me, But to me, I think it's the path geometry plays far more important role than just the fluid properties. Would you agree? Where you say that you mentioned that in responding to Professor Menevi's questions, it's that yet the geometry of the pore scale matters. But when I was looking at it, it seems like, okay, yes, it's the non-wetting to the wetting fluid phase. But man, where exactly were the small pore throats to the large pore throats along the fluid? Poor throats along a flow path that matters much more in my conceptual understanding. Could you make a comment on that where you were summarizing these Haines jump-related inertial effects? Yeah, I fully agree with you. I mean, certainly the port geometry plays an important role. For example, as we discussed like a solid number, not only the fluid property here, you can still see slides. Here. You can still see the slides, right? Also, the surface tension here under the characteristic lengths. I can imagine this varies, I mean, from pole to pore, especially if we have like a heterogeneity in the pore size, then this plays a very important role as to which is more important. I cannot say. I mean, for example, if there is no viscosity contrast in the fluids, then probably you cannot see too much science jumps. Too much science jumps. That's my understanding. I think both are important, both material properties and the post structure. And again, actually, I emphasized that we should not generalize the imbibation study here because we have done some preliminary study on another geometry and we see strong inertial effects for MPPG, but we haven't had a chance to have. Haven't had a chance to have time to summarize the results yet, but hopefully we'll present it in another occasion, the near future. Okay, so this understanding of your D has a different length scale, so it makes sense now. Okay. Another question? Just a kind of follow-up comments from what Professor Charles was saying is: there will be, like, I'm giving a talk on single-phase inertial flows. So what you're So, what your intuition is absolutely spot on. There will be a four-scharmer term that comes out of just by averaging the Lattice-Boltzmann results. So, you can't get away from it at all. That is a very good expression. The another follow-up question I have, Kirjunis, is where your injection velocities, you're considering these supercritical CO2 injection cases, right? These are going to be very large numbers, right? Like from all. Large numbers, right? Like, from all these numbers that I'm hearing from and reading from the reports. Like, is your Reynolds numbers, even if you're on your particle diameter, kind of representative of the target rates of supercritical injections that they are talking about? How did you come up with these Reynolds numbers? Like, that's my first question. Let me put it this way. Actually, since this is a poor-scale simulation, we can see the system. Simulation: you can see the system is just like a centimeters scale, and we actually use the numbers to match the experiments. Like either the Michael Model experiments and this rock sample, this Ben Samer sandstone experiments. Oh, yeah, this this this we also actually matched the experimental conditions. I don't know if that's a question, previous one. The question previous one answered asked. So, anyway, so the reload number we try to match the both numbers, these experiment conditions will try to match with the experiments. So, this as to how the list is to field operation, this is not clear because that's a totally different story at the field scale. Yeah, you're Spartan. I think we are very far away from that. That's exactly my. That's exactly my I get criticized for because our numbers are not even that close either. But certainly, this can reveal some actually underlying flow physics, which is important. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There were questions like, I don't know, this is not directly related to the presentation on Portscale, but over the discussions over dinners and all, just in general, capabilities of Lattice Bowls, man, would you be able to? Lattice Boltzmann, would you be able to kind of take some questions on current state-of-the-art multi-phase Lattice Boltzmann methods for general flows, like turbulent flows rather than poor scale flows? Do you have some comments for those? Yeah, yeah. So actually, we recently had a review paper in yeah, but that's mostly our But that's mostly on pour medium. And then you mentioned like turbulent flow. So actually, the single phase version of our current code implemented in GPU can handle very large systems, which means actually if we keep the fluid properties the same, we can submit a very large system. The characteristic length can be very large. Can be very large, which allows us to simulate the very high relative number. So it's possible to simulate the kind of turbulent flow for some simple systems, like channel or channel flow or without complex geometry. That's one. But in general, the Last Project method, in my understanding, doesn't shine in like a high-risk number or total. A high-resolum or turbulent flow simulation, but or maybe because that's not my main focus at this point. So, my understanding is that it really has some advantage in simulating like a porcelain phenomena in porous materials because of its advantage, it handles complex geometries. And also, it can easily take into account other Easily taking into account other physics or chemical processes like chemical reaction and changing, and we coupled with evolution of the pore structures and coupled with heat transfer, mass transfer, etc. And actually, as I mentioned, Professor Chen, Ni Chen, will be talking about this later and he has worked with me extensively in the past year. Me extensively in the past year when he was at Los Alamos. So let's see, any other aspects? You know, one more, one more was on the multi-component systems, especially with your supercritical CO2, when it gets, goes from, let's say, pure supercritical phase to dissolved in that sebrine. When you are doing these multi-component, multi-phase systems, we were facing. We were facing some, especially with the boundary conditions issues. Are there some tricks to these boundary conditions for these convective boundary conditions of MCMP Lettis-Boltzmann methods? Just because we are facing these issues in my research group. Have you heard about anything like that? Yeah, exactly. I mean, for the especially for the multi-phase or multi-component system, the boundary condition can be very tricky. Yes. Yeah. And yeah, can be here, we don't have much components, we just like multiphys flow. Still, we tested different outer boundary conditions, like a pressure gradient, and then we actually found out like this convective boundary condition is most suitable in this case. And also, you know, we have this when breakthrough happens, there will be pressure jump or capital. Pressure jump or capillary effect, end effect, something like that, which is very tricky to handle in the numeric simulation. So it's kind of like art in that sense. I would like to talk more, I mean, in detail, if you're interested in the future offline. Yeah, we'll catch on one on one offline. Well, let's thank Professor Kang. Exciting talk. Learned a lot from your simulations. From your simulations. And thank you for an honest assessment of LBM also on the things that it doesn't work so well. And we have a few times, a few minutes, actually 10 minutes break between this talk and our next speaker. So let's just wait on Zoom and thank Professor Kang again. Thanks, Kenjin. Thank you, Professor Tangi. Thank you, everyone, for your attention.
