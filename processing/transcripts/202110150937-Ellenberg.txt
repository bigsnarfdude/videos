Close with a talk with no theorems. As Jenny said, this is just a question coming from some stuff I was working on, a joint project with Mark Schusterman. And then maybe I'm sort of hoping like somebody here, I want to sort of kind of kindle some interest in this problem. Maybe I should slightly apologize to Jenny and Jeremy, who I have talked about this problem with before. And I just want to open it up for the whole. I just want to open it up for the whole room of people with expertise in this subject. So, Jenny and Jeremy, I'm not ignoring the advice you guys have already given me about this problem. I just haven't solved it yet. So, okay. So, let's start with the kind of the number theoretic origin of the questions I want to ask. So, the Legendre symbol is a fundamental thing that number theorists think about. It starts when we study quadratic reciprocity, just I have two primes, P and Q, and I write down this symbol. And I write down this symbol to track whether p is a prime when reduced mod q. So this symbol is taken to be one if p is a square modulo q, negative one otherwise. And of course, I guess if p equals q, we got to do something that's sort of different from just being a perfect square in the usual sense. So we say it's zero. But for this talk, we're going to basically enforce that these symbols are never zero by making everything co-prime to everything else. And more generally, if A and B are co-prime. If A and B are co-prime and square free, so they're square free integers which are co-prime to each other, so each one is a product of distinct primes, and these p's and q's are never the same, then we just define, I guess sometimes this is called a Jacobi symbol, A over B just to be the product, we sort of extend by bilinearity, the product over all i and j of the Legendre symbol Pi over Qi. But it's still, it's still either one or negative one. One or negative one. It's just a sign that keeps track of which things are squares, much mod, which other things. And so a basic principle when we study this kind of arithmetic function is that they should be equidistributed on whatever their range is. So if their values are plus or minus one, they should be one half the time and negative one half the time, at least asymptotically. So what would do we mean by that to make that a little more precise? We can say, let's try. Let's try to average these functions as a and b travel in some range. So our range is going to be a goes up to m and b goes up to capital N, and they're both always as always co-prime and square free. And the number of things we're counting, so the sum of one is, well, you know, it's some constant. We're not going to worry about constants today, times capital N times capital N. And what we want to be true, and what in fact is true, is that if we sum this Legendre symbol, if you sum something that's one. Gendre symbol: if you sum something that's one about half the time and negative one about half the time, you should get something that's about zero. And we sort of operationalize that by saying that this sum should be sort of little o of mn. It should be small compared to the number of things we are counting. The average should go to zero. But of course, that being true, we can be more greedy and ask, well, how big is this sum? How quickly does it go to zero as a function of capital M and capital N? So that's a genre of questions in number theory that applies to. Of questions in number theory that applies to all kinds of arithmetic functions and all kinds of averages. And I'm not going to say so much about it, except that I got interested in this because Mark was asking about it in relation to questions about moments of special values of L functions, where this kind of average and really getting some fine control over it arises a lot. And well, as one does, we started talking about, and this is in the spirit of other papers that Mark and I have written, what would this question look like if we ask it? question look like if we ask it instead of over z integers over the field of, well, over the ring of polynomials in one variable over a finite field, which as we know is in many ways very analogous to Z, in some ways yes, in some ways no. And it turns out that there's a very nice formula for this Legendre, a Jacobi symbol of two polynomials, right? So now instead of an integer, I have a polynomial over a finite field. A polynomial over a finite field. I still want it to be square free. I still want f and g to be co-prime. And now this Jacobi symbol can be expressed in terms of the resultant of f and g. This is one of these classical pieces of algebra from the 19th century that I don't know if like people think about that much anymore, but you guys probably know the discriminant of a polynomial is this sort of magical polynomial in the coefficients that vanishes if and only if the polynomial has a double root. Well, the resultant is kind of like that for two polynomials. Resultant is kind of like that for two polynomials. It's something that vanishes just when f and g have a root in common. And because I've enforced that f and g are co-prime, I've cooked this so that this is not never going to be zero. So this resultant is going to be some element of FQ, which is not zero. And then by raising it to the q minus one over two, that's just my way of saying that I get something which is one if this resultant is a square and negative. A square and negative one if there's a resultant is not a square. So we can now ask the same question or the analog of the same question. So, question, what is the sum of this symbol, this plus or minus one over, and now, you know, we don't have inequalities, right? We can't sum up to capital N, but the analog for polynomials is just to sum all polynomials of a given degree. Basically, the sort of Q to the degree is the sort of analog for polynomials. Is the sort of analog for polynomials of the normal absolute value on integers? So we're going to look over degree m polynomials f, degree n polynomials g, as always, they're co-prime to each other and they're square free. And we're just going to sum this symbol, which is plus or minus one, and hopefully get something that is close to zero. But what's the advantage of doing it this way? It's because this question phrased this way can be interpreted. Can be interpreted geometrically. It can be interpreted as a question about points over a finite field on a certain moduli space, which I'm going to describe to you in a minute. And now there's this kind of well-trodden path that a lot of people have worked on, where to answer some kind of arithmetic statistics question like this over function fields, you turn it into a question about About FQ rational points on some moduli space. And then you kind of bring out the Groten-Decamer and say, if I can prove something about the et al cohomology of this moduli space, I can use the Groton-Declass fixed point formula and conclude something about its FQ rational points. And ideally, and this is one of the situations, the moduli space is one that you can interpret over the complex numbers and thus can bring to bear the tools of topology. So we sort of have moved ourselves into a domain where the real governing question is. Into a domain where the real governing question is: what is the cohomology of a certain moduli space that we can describe topologically? And then hopefully, you can get some purchase on a problem that we don't really have purchase on purely from number theory. Okay, so this is where we are now, because I don't actually know how to do this problem, and I'm going to ask you guys about it. So, to set this up, I want to do, oh, and actually, this. I want to do, oh, and actually, this should be MN. So I want to take, I always thought this was called the colored braid group, but apparently the colored braid group is the pure braid group. And this one is called the mixed braid group, where there's like just a small set of colors of strands. So the mixed braid group of type MN is just, you take braids with M red strands and N blue strands, and you remember. And you remember which ones are red and which ones are blue. So maybe I should write this. I mean, one way to write this is that you have the braid group on M plus N. It goes to the symmetric group on N plus N. The kernel is the pure braid group, M plus N. And then this is just the pre-image of SM cross SN. So it's in between the braid group and the pure braid group. And the pure break group. And for those following along, you might think of this as: remember, I had a polynomial of degree m and another polynomial of degree n. And this is kind of in the spirit of what Benson told us about how brave groups are sort of configured. Okay, so you lost the last bit of your thing that froze. Yeah. Uh-oh, okay. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Jenny is saying that your picture, like all the blue should be on the left and all the blue or should start and end on the left. Raise you wanna. Yes, that's true. Oh yeah, this picture is terrible. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. Okay, yeah, sorry. This is an utterly wrong picture. Is an utterly wrong picture. Um, it completely fails to convey the point that I wanted to make. Okay, look, guys, I can braid in real time. Okay, now it's in the group. Okay, I get that's it. Jenny solved the problem, it's done. No, obviously, okay. That's what, that's the one I was confused about. No, okay. Um, okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. So, was there anything? What did I say when I was cut off? Just that this Bray group is the pre-image of SM cross SN. It sits in between the Bray group and the pure group. And we are going to be studying a certain index to subgroup of this group. Okay, so there's. Uh oh. The map to Sn, right? The sine. And here we have two maps to symmetric groups. So we have two maps to Z mod 2Z, but those are not the maps that we're interested in. So there's so the map that we're interested in is slightly more subtle. There's one more map. Okay, this is the last Star Wars picture. Sorry. And it's the one that kind of looks like this. It really only cares about whether red crosses blue. It doesn't care about where red crosses red. That kind of a braid goes to zero. It doesn't care when blue crosses blue, but it cares where red crosses blue. And I want to emphasize though, that you don't have just like this picture with a red and a blue because the red has to end, if the red started on the left, it has to end up on the left. And if the blue started on the right, it has to end up on the right. Blue started on the right, it has to end up on the right. That's Jenny's theorem, as Jenny pointed out. Um, so basically, these crossings always have to happen an even number of time, and so this goes to one. So, in particular, this is a homomorphism from this mixed grade group to Z mod 2Z, which does not trivialized on the pure grade group. It's not, it's not, it doesn't have anything to do with the SN. It's sort of something a little bit deeper and thus hopefully more interesting. So, this one does not, it's not trivial on the pure grade, it doesn't factor through the pure. Trivial on the pure, I said doesn't factor through the pure break group, I meant doesn't factor through SN. It's not trivial on the pure break group because this is of this here is a pure brain that goes to the non-trivial element of Z mod TZ. Okay, so ready? Now we can ask a question. And this is the question I'm proposing to you guys. So let's take a homomorphism from the mixed Bray group on Mn to plus or minus one. And I want to think of that as just a one-dimensional representation of the Bray group. I want to think of it as coefficients with which. Of the break group, I want to think of it as coefficients with which to take homology. So, um, but if you like, you can think of this as a question about an index to subgroup of the brave group. I'm just going to phrase it this way because I like it a little bit better. And of course, there are the sort of the homomorphisms I already told you about, the factor through the map to Sm plus N, those we understand. So I'm not really asking about those. You could, but we know the answers there. I'm more interested in these kind of slightly exotic homomorphisms to Z mod 2Z. So that's the interesting case for us. And then we simply say, what can we say? And then we simply say, what can we say about the cohomology, the HI of the mixed grade group with these coefficients as M and N go to infinity? And this, you know, this phi, like this, this thing I just described over here, this is kind of, it doesn't depend on M and N, right? It's sort of clear like what you mean for any M and N. You can think of it as the same representation as M and N grow. So just to sort of bring this So, just to sort of bring this back to, I said this was about studying some moduli space. This is really what's going on: we're studying the space of pairs of co-prime square pre-polynomials of degree m and n. And I'm adjoining a square root of the resultant. I'm taking that double cover and studying its cohomology. And so, what can we say? Well, the way we study these things, or one way is just to. way we study these things or one way is just to i said this has something to do with um on a talco homology counting points on a space so we can actually do these counts on a computer and this is so just based on these computations this is sort of what we think happens um i certainly think and this is i think this is probably actually pretty directly provable uh that there's a stable range which i think goes up to about n over 2 where this cohomology is actually zero like again with these non-trivial coefficients the cohomology is zero These non-trivial coefficients, the cohomology is zero. And if you're familiar with this sort of more standard thing where you take the cohomology of the regular old Bray group with coefficients in the one-dimensional representation coming for the sine rep, that's very natural. It's sort of like that. But I think something else is going on. It looks like there is a secondary class. This phenomenon of secondary stability, which many people, including Jenny and Jeremy, have studied in this room, or Jeremy might be gone. But it looks like there's some kind of behavior where there's a Like, there's some kind of behavior where there's a secondary class at NFR2, and maybe it's there for some of the fee and not for others. I'm not quite sure. So, you would have some kind of identification of the HI for BMN and then HI plus one, where you add two to M and two to N. So, kind of a slope one half kind of a vibe. And by the way, I'll comment that for me, it seems more natural to think of M and N as being the same. Mark says that for the analytic number theorist, the most interesting case. Number theorists, the most interesting cases where one size is about half the other, and I would be super interested to know if that's extra interesting from the topological point of view as well. Often, what's interesting on one side is interesting on the other. So I'll just comment, I'm sort of finishing up here. In terms of the size of the stable range, in terms of the zeros, I think that is probably not going to beat in the end what you can get from analytic number theory. Analytic number theories are really good at what they do. Analytic number theories are really good at what they do, you guys. I've learned this the hard way that you sort of try to prove these things about function fields using topology. And if it's the kind of problem on which analytic number theory has purchased, it's pretty hard to beat the bounds that they get because those techniques are pretty good. But I think that if this secondary phenomenon can be understood, assuming it's really there, it seems that that will capture a phenomenon that the sort of standard analytic number theory methods don't see. And I think that would be pretty interesting. Pretty interesting, even in the function field case, to sort of prove something and then to see if that phenomenon, whatever the secondary stability gives you, seems to be at least experimentally present in the number field case. And by now, there's like a lot of work, like stuff that I've done, and me and Benson and Tom and many, many other people in sort of applications of these topological methods to questions in number theory. But I think they're really have so far been all about the sort of traditional stable. The sort of traditional stable range, and I think it would be very cool to sort of see an application. I mean, you guys have moved on, that's a gold app for you. I mean, it would be very cool to sort of see the newer side of what's happening in homological stability on the topological side. And this seems to me a pretty simple example. It's like pretty concrete. And I'm hoping that the kind of people who are here can just kind of help me grind this out and sort of like work out what the answers are and sort of start to see what the arithmetic applications are. And finally, I'll just close by saying that. And finally, I'll just close by saying that I can't help wondering, Benson and I have always talked about this profusion of post-FI categories. And Benson's always like, but what's the space? What's the interesting space? So it's just possible that this is a case where it's useful to think about sort of FI cross-fi, where you have like two different finite sets, the sets of this polynomial and the set of that polynomial. But I haven't sort of thought it through too carefully exactly what FI cross FI module is relevant. Okay, so I've talked about. Relevant okay, so I've talked for about 20 minutes, and uh, Jenny was good enough to thank the staff at Burr's, but uh, you know, also the organizers of this conference have put together an incredible thing. So let me thank them. And I included a picture of the organizers. Sorry, there's one more, but there they are. Hard at work. So thank you to everybody who put together this great conference. I really enjoyed it. And if you know the answer to this question or can figure it out, please let me know. Thanks, everybody. Let's thank Jordan. And let's open up to questions. So, if you have a question or can solve Jordan's question, please. I have a question. I don't know the answer to your question, but If you allow red strands to come together, if you take the slightly degenerate case, where you have red strands and blue strand, you drop, so it's configurations of, let's say, blue points and red points, which have to stay distinct, but the blue can come together and the red can come together. That's like space of rational maps. And what's his name? Wrote this paper, Topology of Rational. Wrote this paper, Topology of Rational Functions, you know, Graham Siegel. And so we know a lot about that and many variations that Melanie Wood and Jesse Wilson and I worked on, et cetera. Do those have application? So we've already done all the hard work in the topology. Do they have applications in the so maybe let me say something that in this context is maybe not surprising that Mark always warns me, like, don't forget to make everything square free because otherwise it's easy. So there's something that's easy to do. If you, in other words, like, That's easy to do if you, in other words, like letting the reds come together and letting the blues come together is like saying I require that f and g be co-prime, but I don't require that they be square free anymore. Yes. And I forgot why, but that makes it easier on the number theory side. So, I mean, it's eliminating. So, but I mean, as it happens a lot, right? That the difficulty in the topology kind of tracks the difficulty in the number theory. And if you try to sort of cheat by switching to an easier topology problem, you've accidentally switched to an easier number theory problem. Easier number theory problem. Although this problem in topology is just, it's the space of rational maps from like P1 to P1. So it's not so, you know, Siegel's theorem is a non-trivial theorem. Anyway, yeah, I don't know. But I mean, I wonder, Benson, do you know, like, if I asked like Joan or somebody, this homomorphism from B M N, it must be a classical thing that people write about, but I don't know what it's called or anything. Like, is it a, do you? Anything? Like, is it a do you? It's super cool. I've never seen it. It's very natural. Jordan, has anybody seen it? Maybe I could make a point. So this is an example of what in the paper that Natalie and I were, we called an abelian coefficient system in the sense that it's a coefficient system that factors through an abelian group, namely plus or minus one in this case. And we proved that whenever you or whenever our machine applies, which is roughly whenever you have homological stability, you also Whenever you have homological stability, you also have it with any abelief coefficient. So I automatically, I mean, I think it just follows from what we said in that paper that it has stability, and the stable homology is computed by the appropriate two-fold covering space of the double loop space that computes the stable homology. So I think that proves stability of slope one-half and the vanishing stable because that's true for loops to, or if it doesn't prove it, it tells, I mean, it's going to give you the. Doesn't prove that it tells. I mean, it's going to give you the answer. It might not be the answer. No, but I do think that, yes, it's going to be zero. It's going to be an accident. It's going to be like the sort of single braid group with its sign representation. So that, that, I, I totally believe that, but thank you for that. I think it just follows. I mean, I think we don't do this two colored version there, but I mean, you could. I, yeah, I would tend to agree. But the secondary business needs a little more thought. This is the part I really need your guys' help with. Helpful. I mean, your paper with Peter, do you do with abelian coefficient systems? No, yeah. So, what you probably want to do would be to, so I guess you guys, Sander, Oscar, and Soren, have this general machine where you take in coefficients with some vanishing Tor groups. And then, like, whatever is true with untwisted coefficients is true. With twisted coefficients, and then, like Peter, Dan Peterson, and I proved for polynomial coefficients, you have the vanishing Tor groups, so then you can apply their machine that says whatever secondary stability you have with untwisted coefficients, you have with twisted coefficients. So, someone could just polynomial coefficients is very orthogonal to this sort of abelian. Yeah, or can you make sense of the Tor groups for abelian coefficients? Sense of the Tor groups for abelian coefficients? I think that's not the right point of view for this. Abelian coefficients, it's like it's the same representation. You're always at you're always acting on a line by plus or minus one. It's not growing with the cardinality or anything. It's sort of orthogonal. So, if I understand right, is polynomial coefficients sort of analogous to the thing where I mark some fixed finite size set of strands, and I'm sort of like there's Strands, and I'm sort of like there's rather than grouping them into two colors, it's sort of like S n, S, you know, S n minus K inside S N or something like that. Like that kind of that would be an example, yeah. Right. And that's also much easier on the number theory side, by the way. That kind of question is like, you know, this is in like Benson, this is in our paper with Tom, like, you know, you count polynomials with like a fixed set of roots or something. And that's. Actually, I'm just looking at the notes I was taking from your talk, and I think what I said is true, but it's not about this M equals M case. It's about stabilizing both of them, as it were, independently. Well, that's what I really want, by the way. I mean, I should say I sort of wrote because I didn't, I haven't done very many computations with, I just did a bunch of computations with m equals n, but I think the real question definitely wants m and n to move. Question definitely wants m and n to move independently, and as and indeed, Mark says that he's most interested in the case where m is about half n, or equivalently, n is about half m, not in the case where they're equal. So I think, yeah. Let's see. This is a non-math question. Which Mark were you talking to about your number theory stuff? Oh, sorry. So, Mark Schusterman, his name's at the top. He was a postdoc of mine here at Wisconsin, and now he is at Weissman Institute. He does lots of And he does lots of wonderful papers with Will Samin, by the way. If you want to see sort of on the number theory side, what are like the sort of frontiers of like geometry applied to number theory over function fields, Schusterman's papers with Saman are fantastic. His papers with me are just okay. Is it possible to say what this number theoretic phenomenon is that this secondary stability would correspond to? Is this not non-square cancellation or something? It would basically be so. Sorry, I'm sort of quoting Mark here. Sorry, but like, I mean, I think the idea is that the methods he knows will give you some upper bound. It'll say like it cancels at least this much, right? I mean, so if you sort of do these kinds of sums, you expect a certain amount of cancellation. But it's very rare that you're able to sort of prove. That you're able to sort of prove that cancellation is sharp. Like, so, for instance, if you have sort of some of an arithmetic function and you're like, oh, I prove it as square root cancellation, like the size is like n to the one half or something, it would be unusual for you to be able to say, oh, there's an actual term of size n to the one half that's actually provably there, like a lower bound for how much you're off. I think that's pretty uncommon. And so, I think it would be that kind of that it would be that kind of thing. Like, I don't know if this is a bad metaphor. I don't know if this is a bad metaphor or not, but you know how, like, in like prime races, where they're like, you can sort of there's sort of something, you know, one mod four, three mod four, and it's equidistributed, but then you can actually sort of provably like lower bound some kind of inequity or something like that. Like maybe it would be that kind of vibe. But yeah, so that I think that would be that it would be sort of instead of just an upper bound on how small this sum is, some actual lower bound with a, that's what sort of a secondary term would give you. Okay, thank you. Would give you, but yeah, sorry, I should have gone back and like reminded myself what his original question was about moments of L functions. It's kind of like you know, people who like double dirichlay series and stuff like think about this kind of thing all the time. And it comes up if you were like averaging the moments of a bunch of different quadratic L functions or something like this. But really, I just think this is like a very, very natural kind of braid groups 101. Kind of braid groups 101 kind of question that I don't think we know the answer to. And I think somehow is like, I always like the problems that are like beyond the kind of thing we know how to do, but like just one step. I feel like this is really only sort of like one step past what we already know about break groups and their pomology. So are there any more questions in the live, you know, the live room? Live room. So, yeah, so I don't know if Jenny or I are moderating now. Jeremy had to leave for his flight, but are there any more questions on Zoom?
