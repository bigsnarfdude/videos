The organizers, Miraslav and Agnishka, for the kind invitation. I'm so happy to present my work here and meet old friends and new friends online. Okay, for me, it's a new experience. Okay, it's a joint work with Professor Ming Wen Fei from Anhui University and Xiaoming Wang from Seoul University of Science and Technology. And the technology. Today I'm talking about the coupling of flows and transport infrazo and those in possibilities, which is ubiquitous in natural science and engineering. When interested, they can refer to the treatise of Nude and Benjin in 1999. I draw a very simple picture. Draw a very simple picture, try to describe the phenomena. Okay, for flows at relative small Reynolds number, it's well accepted that the Stokes system is a valid governing system for the free zone. On the other hand, Dancy equation or Brickman equation, which retains the risk cost term, is the extensive used governing law in the past media. In the parsimedia, the coupling of the two systems at the interface is non-trivial here or here. The coupling of two systems. I still see your title slide. I cannot see the slide you're currently talking about. Oh. Can you see the title? No. Can you see the picture? Can you see the picture here? No, no, no picture. Maybe. No picture, maybe I think I know I know the reason. I mean, I should not use the full screen here. Now I see the background slide with the picture. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, here's a simple picture. I just mentioned. Simple picture I just mentioned here. Okay, it's freezone and pulse media, and there is a physical interface between the freezer and the pulse media. Okay. And usually, how to drive the wearpotness of the system, it depends on how to expose the physical boundary condition here. I mean the interface. I mean the interface. Its very natural boundary condition is the continuity of the normal velocity, which is required from the conservation of mass. But the other interface boundary condition here needed for the well-ponace of the system is less obvious. In fact, I will introduce later. Can you see the new picture here? Yes, perfect. Okay, perfect. Okay, perfect. Here is another picture which describes the interaction of flows in coastal quifer. This system is a little bit complicated. I try to enlarge it. Okay. Because of the time constraint, I will only explain the part I'm concerned here. This is a hill or a small mountain. Inside, there are some water. There are some water which can be thinked as a free zone here. That means the flow can be described by stock systems. At this part, there is a conduit. The flow here satisfies the Brickman or Dancy system, which depends what you will use later. During the two parts, there is a curved interface, which should be given some boundary condition to Even some boundary condition to derive the weaponness of the coupling system. This part is what I'm going to talk about. Okay. Let's set up the geometry. The domain for simplicity, I used minus one times minus one and I use UCPC as a solution of Stokes equations and in omega And in omega c omega c is this part, okay. And um pm is the solution of Breakman equations in omega m for simplicity on the lateral boundary, we assume the solution is product here because we mainly pay attention on the interface boundary condition. Here are the governing equations. The stokes system in omega C takes the form E omega C takes the form as follows. UC is a velocity field, Pc is a pressure, Tu C P C means the stress tensor, and Mu C is the viscosity. And I will take one here for simplicity. And as I said, this is the domain and periodically in x direction. Fc is a given function. The Britishman system in Parson media omega m takes form as follows. Um is also the velocity field, Pm is a pressure, mu m is a constant, and TUMPM is a little bit different from Tu C P C because of this term, which is still stress tensor. K means the Dash number denotes. The Dash number denotes the permeability of the flows. In fact, the Bretman C term also have other forms because of the different parameters. For example, if you use the permeability big pi here, according to the common coincident experienced formula, you can react the system with these parameters. With these parameters, I assume a constant expression ug here. For example, if g is equal to c, which means u c is a solution of stocks systems. As I mentioned before, the physical boundary condition here have more choice. We choose this. This the first interface bound condition means a continuity of velocity, the second interface boundary condition means the continuity of normal component of stress transfer, which means the balance of force. I only remark that the Brickman model can be thinked as an extension of Darcy number dashing dashing model and it is usually used to Usually used to account for the high parsity of pars media. There are some related works. Daoji Hen and Xiang Mei Wang study the convergence of the nonlinear Dicey Brickman system to Darcy equation in the vanishing Darcy number limit. In this paper, it is involved with the initial boundary layer. Jim Keller, Kai-Men, and Xiaoming Wang studied the asymptotic. The asymptotic behavior of the infinity Darcy-Pranton number, Darcy-Brickman-Bosnitsky system for convection in pulse media, and small Brickman-Darcy number. Alec, McLaik, Masmudi, Edouard Fierce, and Yong Lui Jing Aiyao also worked on the flows in post-media via homogenization theory. I will skip the detail here. Liu Ha Pen and Fei Ming Huang and Zheng Wang prove the one-dimensional isotropic flow converges to the Poisson median equation, and the momentum is formulated by Darcy laws at time goes to infinity. Chen, Gunsberg, Hua and Wang studied the asymptotic analysis of stock's diasy syndrome with BG interface boundary condition and other different interface boundary conditions. Interface boundary conditions. And this class here deal with mathematical and numerical models. And I also found Lei Chen Yok York paid attention to the coupled, also coupled Stokes Darcy systems. And Ben Blatt, Aaron Seoul and Jin Shui Yin and his collaborators also worked on the related Worked on the related problem in person media. In my work, we pay attention to the constant of the proportionality in the BGSG conditions, which is proposed by Beaver Joseph in 1971. Later, Selfman and Jones revised it as the so-called BGSD conditions. I skip the details. I skip the detail and just to show you what it is as yes. In fact, it's exactly the Navier slip boundary condition proposed by Navier almost 300 years ago. In fact, there is a controversial in terms of the dependence condition on the local geometry in BGSG interface boundary conditions. Most researchers believe that. Most researchers believe that the constant of proportionality in BGSG must be a true constant. In the sense that it is independent of location on the interface, at least in the case of flight interface, as was investigated by Beaver Joseph in their original work. It is also supported by mathematical derivation via homogenization. via homogenization by Jacob McClake also for a flight interface however for a curved interface duba dubus sorry I'm not sure my pronunciation correct argued also via homogenization theory albeit no redress theory that the concept of proportionality is a BGS Proportionality in the BDSG interface condition should depend on the local geometry. Therefore, our concern here is to investigate the role of curvature on the asymptotic behavior near the interface and provide a clear answer to the dependence on the local geometry. But our answer is at the leading order. At the leading order, it is independent of the curvature. Of course, we also prove when the Dutch number k vanishes the limit of Stokes breaking message term in the bounded domain with a curved interface boundary condition. Of course, the limit satisfies the Stokes-Dancy equations. It's very simple to see. The main difficulty lies the detailed boundary layer analysis in the boundary interface, curved interface. I list some reference related to the boundary system in the COVID domain. I will skip the details about the reference because of time. Here is my result. We assume the approximate solution of U can be written into the two parts. This is the outer solution, which is the solution of the limit, and this part is the solution of the boundary layer characters. Eta equal to dx or k means the fast away. k means the faster variable. dx is the distance between x and the curved interface here. The leading order systems, because the stock system is independent of cache, so in a simple words, there are no boundary conditions for the stocks. Boundary condition for the Stokes equation, which means the correctors, the solution of the boundary layer correctors for the Stokes equation is also zero. It's easy to derive this. And the leading order of the auto solution of about Stokes equation satisfies the exact same equation as the original one. Okay, the only Okay, the only point I should mention is that at the interface, as the boundary condition seems very simple, but it's complicated to derive because of the interface boundary condition and the detailed analysis of the boundary layer character of breaking my equations. Breaking my equations. Okay, here is the solution of limit of Brickman equations. It's easy to see. The first order and the second order of the velocity field is zero, but the leading order satisfies the equation as this. It's exact Dashi equation. uh dash equation uh dash law also the boundary this boundary uh this one this uh this boundary condition is uh complicated to derive from the interface boundary condition and the boundary layer of the the solution of boundary layer corrector to break my equations um sorry Sorry, because of time, I skew the details, so I only show you the result, the leading order. The zero order, the first order of the velocity and the zero order of the pressure is zero, but the second order of the velocity satisfies the equation as this. And the third equation sets the equation third term satisfies the equation as this. Satisfy the equation as this, and we can solve the every systems and prove the existence, uniqueness, and the decay properties. Then we can define the approximate solution as the following. This is the approximate solution for the stock situation, and this is equation and this is the approximate solution for the Beikman systems and we can rewrite the equation of approximate solutions as this and here is the error terms now that's our main concern we can see that the approximate solution satisfies the BGSG condition with some errors Condition with some errors. And this is a constant of proportionality. It's one over kappa square, which means it's independent of the curvature kappa here. And in this term, in the high-order terms, kappa appear, but it doesn't affect the leading order here. Then we can rewrite the equation of error solutions. And according to the energy estimate and detail analysis, we can prove the main result here. We can prove the convergence between the accurate solution and the approximate solution. Approximate solution with the commercial rate as is. Moreover, we can also see the accurate solution of Stokes Breakman satisfies the BGSG boundary condition here in the sense of H minus one half, a little bit awake here. So that's our conclusions. So that's our conclusions. When kappa goes to zero, the limiting system is Dox-Darcy model. The curvature effect of the boundary does not appear in the leading profiles of the boundary layers. And this technique can be applied to three-dimensional curved domain. And okay, I will stop here. It's about further work. About further work, and thank you.
