Thank you, Project, for the introduction. I also would like to thank organizers Peter, Haroshi, and Todd for the invitation, for organizing this conference and workshop. Today I'm going to talk about something slightly different from the topics, but the method involved actually quite similar to. Quite similar to some interface problems, particularly for time locations and stable problems. So the topic will be on the classification of Euler equation in two Ds. And this is joint work with This is John Ngo, who is Wan Shu from UKSA. He is my post-house there. And also Professor Chuen Jing Xie from Shanghai Chowtong University. Okay, so for Euler's equations in 2D, it's this simple looking equation. An equation which is first order, but this V is the vector. It represents the velocity field of certain fluid, particularly some ideal fluid. So the fluid has no viscosity and incompressible. And the incompressibility is also reflected by the Is also reflected by the divergence-free equation for this vector field. We are concerned about the three typical spatial domains. One is the whole space, whole plane, R2. Another one is the half space, half plane, and also street. And also, strip or final strip. In the last two cases, when the domain has a boundary, we assume these slip boundary conditions. So the vector field in the boundary is parting along this boundary. So it's zero in the normal direction. Motivation. So we recall the sleep under condition. In this equation, there's a key, which is usually the pressure of the field. We are concerned about the static case. The full Euler equation depends on time. So it means this velocity field changes in times. Changes in times. But for steady one, the time dependence is gone, so there's no time in the equation. There are some typical steady flows. So, one is the shear flows. So, the vector field is only pointing in one direction. in the x1 direction so the x2 the component of the vector field is zero and this vector field depends on x2 so different height the velocity point into the x1 direction could be different and in this case the pressure is In this case, the pressure is constant. So, the streamline which the vector field flows is just straight aligns. Another special case is the circular flow. So, the vector field is just rotation. Um the vector field in the radial direction is zero. I mean you think about the polar coordinate. So only in the circular direction, the vector field is now zero. In the radial direction is zero. So you can write in this spatial form where VR is only depending on the radius. This x is the tangential is the tangential direction of the circles. Well, there is actually close relationship between Euler equation and the semi-linear equation we are very familiar with, particularly for the steady case. So, if we have a semi-linear equation, mark plus u equals f prime u. F prime u in the two-dimensional case, then we can construct vector field d, which is the gradient of u, but you rotate by anti-degree. Then the potential or the pressure can be chosen by Fu minus one half. One half of the gradient u squared. So you have a seminar equation, then you automatically have a vector field for satisfying all your equations. It's also true in the opposite way if the fake field has a Has a good property. Say if it has a kind of stream function. This doesn't always exist, but if it exists, indeed, this stream function is the U solving for the certain Sermonian equation. So, they a lot of research recently on the Euler equation, steady Euler equation, particularly regarding the symmetry of the flow or rigidity of the flow. There are some very Nice result, which motivates our research by Hamel and then Adios Fini. They show that in 2017, if the velocity has no stagnation point up to the boundary and in a street. Then it must be shearful, means they flow only in one direction. And later, they show that in the whole plane, if the again there's no stagnation point, there's no field has no zero point. Then Then it has to be shearful. And this result also generates to like a circular flow situation. So if the domain is annulus regime or the disk or the complement of disk or puncture disk, you know, puncture the plane, which has the Which has the radio symmetry under certain conditions, particularly if there's a boundary case, the boundary has a slip only condition, they show that the flow must be soaked. So basically, under certain conditions, the flow has the symmetry of the domain. Of the domain, this type of result. And here, of course, there's a condition which says that there's no stagnation point, which is essential. Later, 2023, resources showed kind of overdetermined. Overdetermined elliptical problem, but in the setting of oil flow. So if there is a oil flow which has compact support and the support is annular switching and then this flow must be circular. So in the In the sense of elliptic problems, it's kind of an over-determined boundary condition, and this region has to be really circular angles. Also, if you suppose the vorticity for this flow, which is defined by By this developed this formula, which basically describes how this flow, you know, go around. If this vorticity is non-negative and has come back support, then the vorticity must be. Vorticity must be pretty symmetric up to translation, and the flow is then a circular flow. So, that's about rigidity. Another related problem is the stability of circular oil flow around this typical. This typical or spatial, or actually, spatial flows. So, one type of shear flow is called a coiled flow, which you can actually have a spatial formula for x1 direction and velocity. Direction velocity. So, say in the simplicity, just write x2, which is changing sign in this interval from minus one to one. So, it means the flow goes in two different direction above the axis or below the axis, and it's a zero flow on the axis, x-axis. So, So, the stability concern if there exists a steady oil flow which is close to this quite flow in the sense of certain topology. So, Ling and Zhen, they show that in the sense of I should S, the slope of space sense, if S is sense if s is uh small big uh smaller than three over two so in certain senses the topology is a weak topology and they exist non-shear flow which is close to the point flow the spatial shear flow but if the topology is even stronger so as is bigger than So S is bigger than two-thirds, I'm sorry, three over two. Then there is a state flow, which is there's no state flow, which is not shear flow. Indeed, there's a stronger result. You can even have allow the flow to be traveling wave solutions. So the velocity depends on time. Depends on time t, but in the spatial form, right? It's kind of traveling pattern of the vector field. There's no such flow other than the shear flow. So the understanding is the symmetry of the flow. About another special flow called the Komogrov flow. Commogroph flow, which is given by sine x2, zero. So, this is special shear flow. And if you consider the solute, the flow is also periodic in the X1 direction. So, there's a period in X1, and then period is. And the impiety is very important. So, if the period is 2π, they are non-shiftful in a very small neighborhood of this comogorofu. But if the period is not 2π, or it's an integer multiplication, then there's no shear flu. No shareflow. There is no non-share flow, which is close to the Komogorofu. Then for the another type of flow called the Percenta flow, which are there's a spatial flow in fluid equations for Euler equation. Equations for Euler equations in particular, which the typical is given by the formula x2 squared. So this flow is positive in the same direction and it has a kind of stagnation point in the middle. So you can write formula x2 swift. X2 swift. So for this personal flow, there is a stability, means there is no existence of non-share flow. So small perturbation, there must be shear fluid. So this kind of topic, stability, is interesting for fluidity equations. So in our work, So, in our work, we are motivated by the Joyce conjecture in all dimensions, and basically also by this bi-stable interface type problem. Reaction diffusion equation. So, the choice conjecture was part Hard topic in the last 30 years. For two dimensions, indeed, it says that if the solution is mounting in one direction for this, you know, semi-linear equation, unknown equations, mount in one direction, then the solution must be one dimensional. So only depending on one value. So, only keeping the one variable, and then of course, there's a lot of work in this direction, including you know, the three dimensions in Brosia and Cabre showed the four conjectures and higher dimensions up to eight. Sabine showed that the conjecture is true, and the certain limited conditions and the photometry is bigger than. And if a dimension is bigger than weight to nine, there's country examples for this feature's conjecture. But let's look at two dimensions. Focus on two dimensions. And if we consider the corresponding oil flow, that means you find the gradient of the solution. Of the solution and use its rotation at 90 degrees clockwise, you get a vector field. This vector field satisfy Euler equation with the right pressure function. So, the DeGeorge conjecture in terms of Euler equation basically says that if That if the angle of flow, which is defined, you just say you have the vector field, right? You normalize into the unit vector. And if it's not zero, then it's a vector on S1, right? So we take all this such a direction angle on S1. That's what we call the set of flow angles. Of flow angles, so just simple definition of takes. So, if the flow angle, the set is contained upper semi-circle, then the flow must be shearful. That's the Euler equation counterpart or interpretation of the Dejaus conjecture. Of the detox conjecture in two dimensions. Because if it's in a semi-second, basically it says that the solution u in the one direction is positive. This directional directive is positive. So now our question is that how about some No, some classification result based on the flow angle, the set of flow angle. That's all our recent result. So let me state the result. So for the case of the whole space, whole plane, if the angle of flow is A flow is not the whole circle. So it means this one direction, one angle, the flow does not point in that direction. Then the vector field must be shearful. So they only point in one direction. So that's so. If the flow is not a shift, then it has to Has to point in every direction of SO. Okay, so I will explain it in the photo later. Well, the idea to prove such result is to build the connection of the stream curve or stream line. Streamline of the Euler flow, the vector field, and find the so-called total curvature, the geometric quantity, and we call it total curvature and how and the relationships and this is actually the The idea of an kind of equations in a lot of applications to discharge conjecture. So we want to study in discharge conjecture. We want to study the level set. And then if it's not flat, the level set is not hyperplane, and there's a curvature. So the relation between curvature and the Curvature and the solution. The semi-solved solution is very important. So, the curvature we are using now is this kind of form. You take the direction and derivative of this normalized vector. Normalize the vector field, the angle, you can say the angle, right? And then, which is kind of twofold, then you can say the length of this differentiation. So, this will actually connect the label set with the With the curvature. So if V is the vector field, that's a full. If this V is coming from the Anakh equation or related Seminary equation. So that's basically the So that's basically related to the curvature of the labor site or labor surface. So that's what we call this quantity is the curvature related to the oil. Yeah, you are already out of the sorry, you are already out. Sorry, you are already out of time. Oh, yeah. Okay, sorry. All right, let me go quick. So, the total curvature, as I said, is the total integral of this quantity. I just explained. So, one important problem we prove that if the total curvature is fine, which is true and certain. Which is true under certain limited conditions, then the curvature in every direction of the angle will be the same. Does not depend on the angle. So that means if the total curvature is finite, then the either The either is this whole circle, or they are just shareful, only point one direction. So anyway, we also show some counterpart in strip and the half space. Because the half space involves the boundary term. So it gets a little more complicated. They have another case. They have another case of flow we call it the type 3 flow. So that means the set of angle could be semi-circular. And there are examples of such type 3 oil flow. And with this method, we can also show some stability. Some stability result. So basically, we show that and a certain topology for the strip, infinite non-strip, they if the share flow, the second order. The second order derivative does not vanish at every zero point and they must be stable. It means small perturbation must be shearful. All right, I'll stop here. Thank you. Thank you. All right, are there questions in the audience or online? Are there examples in 3D of a flow that omits at least one direction, but it's not sure? For the 3D, it's much more complicated. Of course, for the Judge conjecture, it's still two, but for oil fluor, the relation between oil. The relation between overflow and the semi-mini equation is not very clear and isn't good for special cases. Do you know of any special solutions? Yeah, many solutions. Did you have a question? It's a very nice talk, and so this correspondence between this 2D semi-linear electric rate equation and Euler flow has been known for quite a while. Yeah, actually this is known for quite a while. Indeed, Hamel and Masvadovich. Um, Masuadivini, they showed this symmetry of the Euler flow actually using the symmetry of semi-linear equations. Now, I think, of course, one important thing is to find out the semi-linear equation with certain regularity because the regularity is usually a big problem. But if the If there's no stagnation point, then this regularity is much better for corresponding seminar equations. But if there is a stagnation point, the gradient of the solution vanishes, then it's much more complicated. So these are local you call it stability results, but they are really local rigidity or you know showing that the steady state is isolated, right? That there is no other steady state nearby other than shear flow, for example. Exactly, yeah, yeah, because the global stability is much is a very Stability is much very difficult. It's actually there is no usually there's no global stability. But in the case when you do have the local result, is there some linearization, non-degeneracy? No, no. So this is really non-linear stability or in stability. It's not just linearization. So it's not known whether there is a non- Whether there is a non-degeneracy at the same time? It really depends on flow. Yeah, even for the shear flow, they are different for like a Komogolov flow, coat flow, Procellana flow. They are different. So for some case, they are known result. And like, for example, there's a result for Poseville. Which depending very much on the exact formula of the percent of this X2 squared, for example. So our results basically show the more general percent of more general shearful than we're positive. Any other question? No, let's thank this to go again. And so now we have a copy.
