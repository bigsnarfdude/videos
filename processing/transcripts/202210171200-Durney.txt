So matter biology and the role of companion subsidiary cells and he has been modeling a behavior. So please go ahead. All right, so I'd like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to speak with you today. Today I'm going to talk about the Sorry, my browser, my slideshow just died. I don't have any access to it. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry, I don't, my slides aren't changing at all. I don't have anything. Could you send us the file quickly so that we show it from a different computer? I may just have got it back. And if okay, we'll try now. Let's see, share screen. Okay, so thanks for the opportunity to speak. I'm going to talk about the mechanical advantage, this idea that's been in the literature about grass stomatal cells, and I'm going to explore it through a computational model. Okay, so stomata are these tiny adjustable pores that are present on the leaves of plants. They open to allow for carbon dioxide into the plant. Dioxide into the plant and for water, vapor, and oxygen out of the plant. Stomata come in a range of configurations and morphologies, but they all have at least two guard cells or have two guard cells, which are depicted here in green. But then some other of the configurations also have subsidiary cells, which are in yellow. So notice the wide array of configurations we have here from two subsidiary cells up to many. Up to many. The stomatal complex lies within the epidermal cells, which also show a variety of morphologies. So the two stomata that I'd like to focus on for this talk are those here that are depicted by just having two kidney-shaped guard cells, and they lie within pavement cells. And this is your common stomata that's present in Arabidopsis and Vichia faba. The biomechanics of this type of guard cell complex. This type of guard cell complex has been well characterized in the lyncher. Less studied, however, is the graminoid or rastomata, which is characterized by guard cells having these two dumbbell ends and connected by a thin rod region. It also has subsidiary cells that flank the two guard cells and are oriented in the same direction as the guard cells. So, this idea of the mechanical advantage has been in the Of the mechanical advantage has been in the literature since I think around 1973, but I really attribute it to this 2007 plant physiology paper from Franks and Parquis. So I'm going to describe their experimental results because that's the nature of what I want to discuss with you today and the work that I still have ongoing. So on both of these graphs here, we have guard cell pressure on the x-axis and the stomatal aperture. So that's when the pore opens, measuring across the opens measuring across the width of the open pore. Somato aperture microns on the y-axis. The experimenters conducted two experiments, each on the kidney-shaped cell and also on the grass cell as well. Those two experiments are thus. They fix the surrounding epidermal cells at either a zero pressure or an arbitrary maximum pressure. Notice in the kidney-shaped guard cells, there's virtually no difference. Guard cells, there's virtually no difference between those two experimental scenarios. So, where they are increasing guard cell pressure, that pore reliably opens at approximately the same rate and reaches the same maximum aperture. Compare that with this wheat stabata, where they've now fixed, they say epidermal pressure, but I believe they mean subsidiary cell pressure. Whenever the subsidiary cell pressure is at a maximum, Subseri cell pressure is at a maximum, that guard cell stomatal complex fails to open at the low pressure range, which was not seen for the kidney-shaped stomata. Then, as guard cell pressure continues to increase, the pore only opens slightly and there's a dramatic decrease from the case where the epidermal pressure is at zero, or for aggressive cells, the subsidiary cell pressure. So, this raises a few questions because So, this raises a few questions because their experiments were done under target conditions, which is high humidity. So, at a very high humidity scenario, you would expect all cells to have maximum turger pressure, but yet under those, the pore still opens. So, this contradicts what they say, the mechanical advantage. So if I go back again, I didn't really highlight the mechanical advantage too much. What they mean is whenever all cells, the guard cells and subsidiary cells, are adding maximum pressure, the subsidiary. Pressure, the subsidiary cells win. It decreases the aperture opening. And so, under those target conditions, it contradicts that mechanical advantage. And so, the authors suggest this idea of an osmotic seesaw. What they mean by that is whenever you want the pore closed, you have all these potassium ions in the subsidiary cells, which are forcing the turger pressure in the subsidiaries high. High. Oh. Okay. High. And the guard cell pressure is low. Then, if you want to open, you will then pour those potassium ions into the guard cells, which decreases the subsidiary cell pressure and increasing the guard cell pressure, which is allowing this stomato complex to open. Some other questions I have with this work are that there's an arbitrary maximum pressure used and zero pressure used. So in the zero pressure case, So, in the zero pressure case, did they plasmolize the cells? How did they actually fix it at zero? And what are still the mechanical interactions between guard and subsidiary cells in that case? Likewise, for the maximum pressure, how high did they have to pump the subsidiary cells to actually see that decrease? And lastly, a point that confuses me about that work is that, as I said last slide, the interchange epidermal and subsidiary cell pressure for grastomata. Pressure for grass to moda, which leads to some confusion at that. So I wanted to explore this through a finite element model, which I use more for mechanics to do. So my colleague at the University of Sheffield, Matt Wilson, grew barley plants forming and produced some image stacks. I then take his image stacks into morphodynamics, where I'm able to segment and create a surface mesh of the garden subsidiary cells for the fullest to model complex. Fullista model complex and the um this looks squashed and then I'm able to set the material parameters and simulate that complex so my aspect ratio seems to be off on this computer this is not what it looks like it should be wider you can tell from the title here as well um so anyway if this were correct you could see that between this live image Between this live image, it doesn't play either. I'm sorry, um, that the cells do look like the live image, but neither of them happen to be playing at the moment. But that would at least have given you an idea that they qualitatively agree. So let's get into more of the quantitative aspect of this, where I've now done guard cell pressure on the x-axis, and on the y-axis, I have core area in micron squared, where I'm leveraging the power of morphodynamics that I've now gone from beyond just a 2D. I've now gone from beyond just a 2D measure of pore aperture and I'm quantifying the entire pore area. So, in the case where I have a minimum sub-serie cell pressure in blue, the maximum sub-seri cell pressure in orange, and the osmotic seesaw in green, you can see the differences between the two. And I recapitulate a few of the results from that experimental work. Namely, when the subserice cell pressure is at a maximum, I see delayed opening, so it doesn't reach a very open area, the lower pressure. Very open area at the lower pressure range, and I do have a decrease in poor area over the minimum substeria case or the osmotic seesaw. We also see that in the authors and Franks and Farquhal work how that osmotic seesaw can actually play out. So we see that we can go from a very closed stoma to a more open stoma, and we increase the rate of transition between the two. So I provide some loose agreement with their results. Agreement with their results, but quantitatively, it's not as pronounced. They saw a much more dramatic decrease in the pore area, and I don't have that same quite of non-opening at the lower pressure range. So, if we look at some still images between those, there's also differential pressures that are achieved here. So, in the minimum subsidiary cell pressure case on the left and maximal on the right. On the left and maximal on the right. If we looked at the two closed, which is the left panel in each, we can see that the maximum sub-series cell pressure of 0.6. If I go any higher, the two guard cells are actually going to get pushed into each other. This is something that just isn't seen in the actual biological system. Meanwhile, to open these pores, I have to achieve a guard cell pressure of about five megapascals in both of those cases. So there's this idea of a differential pressure that's This idea of a differential pressure that's happening between subsidiary cells and guard cells that I can't quite make sense of in light of that osmotic seesaw. And so a few takeaways that I want to give you with this is that the model qualitatively agrees with the osmotic seesaw, but quantitatively they aren't as pronounced as the Franks and Bark ball work. Next, the osmotic seesaw increases the rate of opening and makes the stoma more efficient. However, the key discussion points here. To key discussion points here: that the guard cells in the mechanical model can overcome the maximal subseri cell pressure and are open. This contrasts with the experimental work where they saw more or less the opposite. Next, there's the idea of subsidiary cell pressures can only achieve one megapascal, whereas scarred cells are five megapascal. So, if we're looking at an exchange of ions between the two, I would expect those to have something more similar pressure between the two. And so, I'll leave you with. Between the two. And so I'll leave you with this thought. I find that in my reading, somatolipter is focused on opening of the guard cells, but I find the value in the subsetory cells is actually enclosing and that it only takes a small amount of turger pressure to fully close the stomata. So if we were in a drought or in a drought and there wasn't very much water for the plant, it would want to close all the stomata so that it can retain any water it has. And what this work is showing is that it would only take a little bit of Is showing that it would only take a little bit of water to increase the target pressure to fully close those stone line. With that, I would like to thank you for your attention. And my collaborators on this work from the University of Sheffield is Matt, Shawnee, Jodi, Andy Fleming, and Julie Gray, and at the John Innes Center, Richard Smith and Richard Morris. Do we have time for questions? We have time for questions. I don't see any in the audience yet. Angela has a question. Sorry, I pushed the wrong button there. Thanks a lot for your talk. So I was just wondering if you'd taken a look at the work from grasses from Michael Rasig, because he makes that same conclusion that you do: that these subsidiary cells are for closing, and it's quite Closing. And it's quite, you could, you know, I think you could nicely compare his physiology results where, you know, he uses the LICOR, you know, with your with your pressure measurements and also the genetics, you know, because you could sort of model the different mutants that he's got where he changes the fate of these cells. So that sounds really exciting. Yeah, thanks. I'm familiar with his work, but it's, I came across it when I first started the project. And so now I'm reopening. Um, and so now I'm reopening this mechanical advantage. So I should reread his with the with the new mind that I have about it to see how it lines up with what I'm finding here. I think it's good. Okay, more questions? Yeah, I had a question. Uh, you talked, you compared the turger pressure in the subsidiary cell. You estimated it at one megapascal versus turger pressure in the Versus certain pressure in the guard cells is five megapascals. Yes. And you expressed concern because you thought they'd need to be similar if there was this osmotic feasta effect. That's correct. Wouldn't that depend upon the relative volume of the two scouts? And do you know what that is? Yeah, so yeah, the volume of it, that is something that's the I have yet to do the back of the envelope calculation for that, which is something that I want to do next and following this up. Do next and following this up. The relative volume is a, I wouldn't say murky, but the issue with those dumbbell guard cells, the rod region is quite thick, so you really just have the volume in the two bulbous ends. And so I would need to do a cross-section longitudinally down to find out a better estimation than what, because morphodynamics can give you the volume, but it doesn't account for how thick the cell wall is throughout the guard cell. Throughout the garage settlement. Okay. Thank you. But probably you know, I'm not a specialist of spectomata, but I understood when you are outside, I mean, the condition of evaporation, they're changing all the time. They're really very. And so I understood that the crucial point. The crucial point for efficiency of stomata, I mean, not losing too much water and being able to have a high photosynthesis, but to not being closing very fast. And so, when you, for example, light goes down because there is some anyhow, any reason, goes down, then you want to close the stomata fast enough so don't you don't wait, wait, lose water without any need. So, is this, is there something? So, is there something here that you can argue that it will snap more efficiently or more rapidly, actually? Yeah, I think that was kind of my takeaway from the sub-serial cell pressure that you only need to. So, I went to the extreme of if we were in a drought and you would want to preserve all water in the plant, the same thing would happen as you are saying now, where I get the range in the mechanical model of sub-serious cell pressure only ranges between 0.2 and 0.6. I was mentioning like. I was mentioning like clouds just passing by, the cloud. So within a second, you have less light and then it's back. And the phototensity disease is very fast, so it goes, it changes almost immediately, but the stomat lags after that. And so how can we, do you know about this? And is your model able to explain that? I mean, I think it could. I haven't pushed it to do any sort of hysteresis, but when it transitions between the two, if that's what you're looking for. Between the two, if that's what you're looking for. But I would say, if you're just asking more of a binary question, cloud covers sun, does stomata close fast? I would say yes. And that's because you only need a little bit of pressure in the subseriary cells to fully close the stoma, whereas you need more pressure in the guard cells to open it. But doing like a repetitive model of transition between the two with a little bit of feedback, you may be able to see a little lag where it can account for the fact of, is it even transient? Of is it a transient cloud or is it nighttime? Okay, all right. There is time for one last question. Not okay, you want to? Oh, sorry, sorry, you um if I could ask what you're saying, like um um what are your kind of like boundary conditions uh for that's a great question. So I kind of flew past this, but I briefly mentioned that the grass. But I briefly mentioned that the grass stoma lie, or maybe I didn't say it explicitly, but the pictures of it, it had the epidermal cells tile in a sense, and then the grass guard cells lie in files in there. And so I have hard boundary conditions on the outside of the subsidiary cells where they're fixed, so it can't expand at all. That's also motivated by the closed and open images that I have from the collaborators that. The collaborators that the width of the entire complex is unchanged during the opening and closing process. Cool. Thank you very much. All right. Thanks a lot, Clinton. We move to our final speaker for this morning/slash early evening session in Europe. I think I don't need to elaborate too much regarding the introduction of Enrico Coer. He's one of the giant in. Is one of the giants in the field. Maybe I would like to.
