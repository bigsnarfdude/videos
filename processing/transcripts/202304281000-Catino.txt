Okay, so our next speaker is Giovanni Giovanni Catino from Milan. Talk about two BGD results for stable minimum type centers. Thank you very much. So first of all, of course, I want to thank the organizer for the invitation here. It's beautiful place. This is my third time here, but the first time was very many years ago, so Many years ago, so follows another. So I will talk about stable minimal address surfaces mainly, mostly in RN. So very classical topic, I think the most classical topic in geometrical analysis I would say. And so and mainly about one original result, actually I mean the dictators result is the name of the paper that we used in the archive last November, I think. So September, I think. So, but maybe I will talk about one original superclassic topic. So, this is the outline. So, I will start with the brief introduction. So, I will record you the classical band stack problem. So, for surfaces banner free, denser theorem, based back to anti-sense. And then I will present you the story about. Story about the best and probably in higher dimensions, or the well-known story, and the problem was completely solved. And again, I mean, for graphs, minimal graphs, in our end. And then I will state the problem which I'm interested about, which is the stable vector problem. So generalization of this problem. So generalization is this set. So the classical vector problem, you're looking to minimal graphs or area minimizing. Minimizing sets, let's say, non-regular. So, global minimum or the other functional. So, the stable basic problem, we are just looking to local minimum to those functions, just stable. And so, I will present you, I mean, I would say the only result was present in the past years about this problem, so the rigidity of stable minimum perceptions. Anyway, perceptions. And I mean, it's not the only result, but it's the only technique. I mean, the ideas that you have developed in this paper, I mean, were a bit generalized later, but more or less, this was the only result concerning stereo minimum services with high dimensions. With that, I will present you a proof that we gave a new proof actually, so we gave second, we arrived second this problem. Second, we arrive second problem. So, a new proof concerning the rigidity of stable three hypersurfaces now. And the technique that we implemented actually allowed us to prove another rigid result that I want to present you because it's very related to quasi-instematic. So, you will see a quasi-insteametric appearing at some point. And this is the problem of. Some point, and this is the problem of the critical matrix of a natural functional, which is the electronormal discount curvature, which is the easiest quadratic curvature functional you can call to start. And okay, and if time permitting, I will present you to the second result. I think I will accurately. Okay, so surfaces, so minimal surfaces, so definition of minimal surface is a critical point of the function. So the complex. Are a functional, so they compete supported variations. And you can say, okay, surface is minimal if and only if it has zero mean curvature, or you can say it is minimal if and only if it's locally a graph of a function that satisfies the equation for PDE for minimal service equation. That is for the minimal service equation. And okay, so of course now Okay, so of course now there are plenty of examples of minimal surfaces, just like you could here and some ten. So you have the plane, so the slide, and then you have other topologies, you have catenoids and so on. And of course you can see from all this picture, apart from the slide, for all this picture you don't have a global graph, so you don't have a graph, okay, or function. And actually this is not just really a theorem, it's a famous basic. Which is really a theorem, it's a famous Best Ethereum for surfaces. So, the only entire minimal graph, two-dimensional in L3, is only the P. So, this is very famous, and this is 1914. So, this is the classical, so this is the PD statement. So, if you have an entire solution, so the final two solution of the minimum surface equation, then it must be a fine. So, previously, if I say geometrically, any entire Geometrically, any time even graph in a tree, it's a factor. It's a paper. So, and actually, so his proof was really a PD proof, so classical UV type proof. So, it's really a UV type that does this kind of writer. But it was just nine-dimensional. Of course, people try to push at this proof in a dimensional. So, of course, now you can ask what the So of course now you can ask what about the higher dimension about this column? So about entire minimal graphs in RN, hyper surfaces. And so is it true that any entire minimal graph in our n plus one is a necessary plane? So of course I think you know the answer, but so this problem was completely solved. Actually, so this This piece of mathematics started actually, so geometric measure theory and all this stuff. And so, as you may know, I think the problem was completely solved in the sense that in dimension two, Fleming gave another proof of the result in completely different settings, so much more general setting about setting words. And then the Georgie group theory in dimension three, and then Army in dimension four, and finally Simos group produced the double. Finally, design was proof that it used to be double potential and less elegant design. So, and okay, as I was saying, the proof is not based on PD's proof, it's really a geometric measure to improve down and take the right cone and classify cone. It's really huge piece of mathematical. And of course, And of course, so this dimension is sharp, so actually some years later, one year later, compared to Georgia, just to construct the entire minima graph, eight-dimensional entire minima graph, which is automatic. So here the picture is called focus. You know that the only entire minima graph, um n dimensional, I prefer just the t dimensions. And the the zero level set of the graph is not the signal scale or something like that. Is the signs code or something? Okay, so to remarks, very easy to remark. So actually, a minimal graph is not only a minimal, so not only medium is not only a critical point, but actually it's not a minimizing. So it's a global minimum. This is a very well-known factor. And so in general, this is not true. I mean, it's a bit similar. And so it is natural now to. So, it is natural now to consider local minimums, so produce this notion of stability. So, particularly imagine are stable, so I implied stability, which means the second variation of the other function is a negative complexion. And so, of course, now there is another question. So, what about since R minimizing actually area minimizing were put to be rigid? So, since R minimizing are classified are rigid, what about still some discritical dimension? What about local? I mentioned what about locker minimizer or stable minimizer surfaces. You can call it stable mass of lockers. Is it true that a complete orientable mass is a stable minimizer surface? Of course, we know that it cannot be true in the other dimensional dimensions and Lagendary put at 8. Actually, the critical dimension will be 7 as in short. Short of this will not be true with dimension higher from the set. So, okay, so this is the problem. And so, what about what are the results now? So, in dimension two, so for surfaces, actually the answer is yes. So, the only stable, orientable, complete mass stable minimum surfaces are all. Mass stainable minimal episodes are called in the planes. And this was proved more or less in the same years. I mean, you see the different years here, more or less in the same period, by Local Man Pank, Fisher Computer Shane, and Over Hello. And okay, I mentioned two. Proof is quite difficult, I would say. And so, what about high dimension, as I was saying? So, I mentioned over eight. Over eight, so higher equal to eight, it must be false because you have entire minimal graphs which are R minimizing, so global minimal, in particular local state. Actually, you can not only construct a minimal graph over the Simon's cone, but actually you can desingularize the Simon's cone, construct an area minimizing seven-dimensional hypersurface. So, this was done by Havel Sein in this paper. So, actually, there exists This is dimension seven, for instance, you can construct a narrow minimizing, which is not a graph, narrow minimizing. Of course, this cannot be a graph because of the PHTF. So this problem can be true. So the answer could be yes, till dimension 6. This is a big problem. Okay, so what about higher dimensions? So dimension entry could be 2. So as I was saying, the Them to. So, as I won't say, the main result in this topic, I would say more or less the only technique available and we should admit was this one during this famous paper of Jean-Sa-Mill, where they proved that in dimension five, and that's a simple dimension, you have a stable minimal-oriented immense minimal surfaces. And you assume this condition, so This condition, so the gradient volume growth from above, but actually you will have from below also because of the magnetic. This is not the problem, no. So, if you assume that the volume of both are the same as Rn, then actually the surface has to be, the average surface has to be. So, and then these kind of results generalize that there were other results setting maybe not in a red, but some Not in a red, but some possible space. But I would say this is the main result. And actually, of course, you have this strong condition. I would say some words about this condition. Actually, I want to give you three slides proof, complete proof of these things. After this proof, I think your knowledge about Mimason will be at least as my knowledge, more or less. So, actually, because really it's the only Really, it's the only about this problem of rigidity or stableness. So, but they want to give you the proof because it's very fascinating. And so the point is that in dimension, sorry, this is the theorem, sorry, in dimension three, so 2021, I think August 2021, Childo Sheli proved actually that you just have planes, so hyperplanes. Hyperplanes. So, three-dimensional stable mini microscopic just hyperplane, dimension three. So, and last November, as I was saying, that we actually gave a different point of this result as true, I mean, or the dimension. Yes, so without any assumption. So, three-dimensional, minimal at the stable, minimal at the surfaces are at the plane. And this should be true till dimension six. Till dimension six should not okay, and so this is the theorem, and I want so most of the talk I would explain you this new proof. So I will give you more or less of the steps of our new proof of this thesis. And okay, so so again, these are the data. So you have a minimal hypersurface. Hypersurface Rn, let's say of dimension n. So spinal means the power is zero. N is stable. Okay, stable means, okay, the second variation is not negative, you are a functional, but analytically it means this. So you have that A is the second fundamental score. And actually, it's the straceless second phonetic problem because the link collision is zero. So, and the stable conditions, it's a control at infinity on the second phenomenon. So, you can say it this way. So, it means that for every smooth catalog function, p squared, the eponym of the second phenomenon times p squared is controlled by the greater function. So this is a controlling finity, a very weak controlling fit on this component. Because if you take the standard type of function, like one and zero, this gives you one over r square on balls, but here you have the volume of the balls. But you see immediately, I mean, that of course this is not trivial to prove that if you have equilibrium volume growth in dimension larger equal than three to prove that On larger equal than three to prove that this must be C. Just assuming a pure. So you have to push really this condition in such a way. But you can push it because a minimum serves in a separate fundamental force satisfies a PD. Use the PD and you push this condition. I will show you the proof. It's very classic, I can say. Okay. And okay, equivalently, of course, you can write this as a condition. So, stability is equivalent to saying that the acropolat is the plastic. The acopiper is the Laplacian plus this normal separate. The normal needs of my Laplacians will be already the trace of the action, plus the trace of the issue. Okay, so our idea can be summarized in one line. Can be summarized in one line. So, we will use instead of using assuming a volume at volume growth conditions, actually, we will prove a weighted volume condition, so combination 3, and by using a suitable conformal deformation of the metric. And then, once you have this weight and volume control, you have to once you're right there, So once you arrive there, you have to extend the estimates of Schenzang Lija that I will show you to this weighted setting. So you have to weight these estimates in some sense and then prove the result. So really the key point is to arrive at this weighted polypography. And of course we were inspired by this paper and by a paper of Israel Copri, where she introduced this conformal deformation and she used it just in dimension two to do some sampling. And by a paper of Everett. And by paper of Evelyn Roswell, which was about CMC upper services. So, as I was saying, I would like to give you the full proof of this theorem. You will see dimension 5, it will appear. We will see how you will need this condition. Okay, this is super classic. Okay, so. Okay, so this is the setting. So you start from this condition here on the second phonometer form and you want to push it. And how you push it? I mean this is super classical. When you have a stable solution to a PD, you have to find good test function in order to test this. So this is your condition. So this stability is this thing. So the only point from the PD point of view is you have to find good test function, good file, in order to improve. Good five. In order to improve this condition, what you want to prove? That is a plane. So A is equal to zero. So you have to prove that A is zero. That's it. Okay, so the idea of Shane's annihilation was to, of course, you have with the power of the psychophonometer form. So you test this with this, you get this control. So you are hiring up here this, but also at some point. This, but also at some point, you want to increase this term here in order to use the volume growth summary. So, you want to increase this, but to do this, you have to increase this one. So, to increase this one, you have to multiply, you integrate. But of course, you have to pay the price, which is the supply here. But now, this guy is controlled by the PDE satisfied by the second electrophone, which is true on every minimum of the surfaces. The surface, so this is a well-known sign of severeity. So, in every dimension, the second phenomenon force satisfied this field. It is meaningful. Yeah. And so, to control this term, you use this equation. So, you multiply this equation by the correct factor that you Correct factor that you there is only one factor you can put here, and then you can estimate this from here. So let's go. So, okay, so how you put this formula is very easy. It's immediate form, I would say. You are in a range, so the second fundamental form is trace-free, it's minimal, but it's a codacy tensor. And you also satisfy this first order P D and you take the divergence of this first order P D and you get the Laplacian of A. Then you multiply by A and get this color equation space. Get this color definition to line two. Okay, but now you want to control this guy to do properly and sharper, sharp in a sharper way. So this guy is always larger than this guy with constant one. This is when no cut to constant. But if you want to be as sharper as possible, so you don't say that this guy is larger than this guy with constant one, but actually since A satisfy our first order P D, you have this improved catalog estimates point wise. Cato estimates pointwise. So this term actually is larger than this one with a constant which is not one but larger than one. So the sharpest one is this one. Actually in dimension n you have these estimates and so you get this estimate here from this immediately. And so you see now you can control this guy which is this how you do it you multiply this by the correct power wave you integrate it so so you get these estimates so the So, you get these estimates, so the guy you want to control. And now, so you have control you see with this guy, you control it exactly with respect to the guy that you have here in the higher power. So, now it's a matter of constants, because you are controlling, if you go back, you want to control, so you are controlling this guy, you want to control the DC zero with this guy, and now this guy is controlled again by this guy. So, it's a matter of constant, and here the dimension comes up. The dimension and the power that you can take. Power you can take. So at the end, you arrive to here with that this coefficient. This coefficient has to be positive. So you cannot take every Q. There is a young inequality in the middle here, but people don't change to, but it's pretty basic. So now if you write Q as P minus 4 over 2, just to have something which is nicer, now you see that this is because it's just if P is between 4 and this number. And so you get this idea. And so you get this estimate. At the end, for every p in this interval, you push this estimate, you see, to the power p here. And now just holder inequality here gives you this. So really, you push the... So this estimate actually is to with p and p here with p in this integral. That's the theorem of sham. And you see in dimension, so okay. Smooth. It's very So you know this is true with p equals 2 and you also know it's true for p between 4 and this. Yeah, and actually you know also in between, in fact shall we use that this one with p equal to 3. So the correct p is almost n, so the dimension of the at the surface, the one-to-one normals. In this case you have to use n plus something, I think, if I remember well. And yeah, so we arrive to this, so in particular So we arrive to this. So in particular, you see P, you can take P, if the dimension is at most 5, you can take P5 plus something. Some small delta, such that this is P is size integral. And now what you do, so once you are here, it's very easy. You take basic catalog function, 1 like this and 0, and both. So it's 1 in Br, it's 0 in B2R, and then use this and use this in the standard catalog. Use this in the standard catalyst, depending on the distance of H2G. You get these estimates with phi plus delta, but this goes down like one over r. So at the power of phi plus delta, you gain one over r to the power of phi plus delta times the volume of beta. And now here comes the assumption. So you want this to be zero. So you for this proof you have to assume that the volume grows at most like five plus something. I stated like five, but you can. I stated like phi, but you can assume phi plus r. So in particular, if you have a Clideon volume growth like Rn, so the term for every n-dimensional stable at the surface take R going to feed, you'll get the AS to be zero, so you get to clear an account. Okay, is it clear? Green, this is the truth. Okay. Okay, so the reason it doesn't work in my The reason it doesn't work in high dimension is with the bound on P you have. Yeah. But in any case, not only this, I mean, even if you in many cases you have to assume a volume growth condition, which is a very stop condition. But in dimension six, they take P between five and six, but you need to be bigger than six for this possible. Dimension six, this proof doesn't work. But there's still room to take P larger than five. You just can't. Five but not till six. Exactly. It doesn't work. Six doesn't work. Actually, there is another complicated paper, I would say, I mean, difficult to read by Shane and Simon. And they managed to improve these things in dimension six, but just for embedded stable minimum hypothesis. But it's very difficult to read, and still they have a volume blow assumption. So still with assumptions. Yeah, and this is difficult to read. So this is very easy to read. This is very easy to read. Actually, it's beautiful. As I was saying, the assumption of volume growth actually fights against the actual data because you know when you have Gauss equation, so the Ricci curvature of your metric actually is negative, it's not positive. Because it's in a way the Ricci curvature of your metric is minus k squared. So, also this is kind of so according this. So, according this is A times A as a matrix. So, actually, this is less frequent than C. This is true on every minimal circle. So, and you know, okay, volume growth condition, I mean, talks with the Bishop Ramos, so negative Richie code. So, you are really fighting, so you are really constraining your manifold to be rich flat in some sense. Of course, I mean, it's not true that minimal value. Because I mean it's not true that the minimal met I mean there is this minimal at the service in this volume growth, the filter volume growth, but here they are stable, so we have to show this collection. Okay, so okay, so what about our proof? So these are the steps of our proof. So the first step is so we now I will stay in dimension three enough for okay for most of the talk. So three dimensional stable minimum So, three-dimensional, stable, minimal level surface enough. Okay, the idea. So, we don't want to assume any volume control. So, the idea. Exactly. So, what we prove, and I will show you the proof, it's a reason, by using the conformal metric defined by Fisha Po Green, we managed to prove that actually in dimension three, you can prove that a conformal metric to the original metric. The original metric has some non-negative rich curvature in some sense. So, actually, you have two FG non-negative rich curvature. So, this is the two-bar pre-emergy rich tensor related to this F that I am to write you, but it's related to the stability conditions, which is explicit. So, there exists an F, I would say, so I can a conformal metric such that the two F battery emerges, so the two battery emerges an active. So again you have this m equal to 2, which is a nice mean for talks, but we are in dimension 3 here. Okay, so these are very good new means. You have some sense of weighted non-negative curvature, which is always good if you want to control volumes. So this is easy to prove. But the second step you have to prove that you use volume comparison, you have to prove that the metric is complete. Is complete. So the point is that this metric could be not complete. In fact, actually, if we put that in dimension three, still again, the metric is complete. And since it is complete, you have no negative weighted reaching curvature, you have weighted volume control, like plastic results. So the conformal metric has weighted Euclidean volume growth. So the integral of E to the So the integral of e to the minus f on the geodecibo of this performance metric grows at most like r to the power n plus this n here, which is the fifth dimension. So you have this we control, but you see here you have a file which is good for the proof that we have seen before. This file you had this five plus delta there somewhere. But this is a weighted so you not control JSC balls, you're controlling JSC balls of G tilde. The control is both object, so for conformal metric, waiting is that sort of having that kind of additional factor, like it's super easy to require. How do you get this factor squared with your ascribed position? Which factor, sorry, the way to call it here. Yeah. This is a theorem. So if you have n bacriemally non-negative, n, I mean it's this constant here for you m, n by n. Yeah, so three is the dimension n of your manifold, and this is plus this n. It's like that. How did you choose that? Yeah, we didn't choose it. Fisher Cobey did it in the 80s. But she didn't realize, I mean, the point is that step one is that what Ola mention or missing? Step one, I will show you the book. Okay, sorry, step four, I will show you. Okay, sorry, step for I will show you the thing and where things get worse in higher dimensions. As I was saying, at the end of the talk, you will know almost what I know about this problem, VG. So you can start working with my step four, and actually not only, the techniques around were very few. So the paper I showed you before and the paper on Chadouchouli, which is still a good, very, very clever choice of a Very, very clever choose of a test function here. Or less. For this problem, of course, not for minimal surfaces in general, for regularity programs also. It's talking about this rigidity problem, stable meat. So, of course, so once you have this control, you but you have a control on weighted balls, so you have to weight the estimates that we're receiving both. So, you have to weight these estimates with the power e to the minus f to some power. F to some power, you have to weigh these estimates, you have to push these estimates like they did with the PD, and then you get the result because of this. Okay, so what is F and what is this conformal factor? Actually, this comes very naturally by the stability condition. So, the stability condition, so the non-negativity of the non-positivity of this operator, implies that you have actually a solution, a positive solution this PD. So, you have a positive solution. So you have a positive solution of this. So this is very classic, it's very general. So this is the candidate that you use to deform the metric conformance. So you use this function U here, which comes from the stability. This was used by Fischer Croby first in dimension two diagrams. And okay, so you take power, power of this function, u to the power 2k, and you take this conformal deformation element. So g is the original stable minimal surface of the metric of the conformal deformation. Now it's a computation and some estimates. So actually you can prove in every dimension. So f will be k n minus 2 log u. This is our f and I mean And you have no choice when you take this, it must be this, if you want the n backriam. And so, this is the estimate that you get. So, this one over this bachelor-mary, which tensor of this conformal matrix satisfies this estimate. So, it says you worked in dimension two. So, the trace of so A squared is going to be scalar curvature B. Yes, minus a scalar. Right, so it's the choice, it's likely to solve the Nier Mabe equation. Solving the Yamabi equation truly, you're trying to choose a new metric of non-negatives, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very related, of course, to the second dimension to exactly. Yeah, so and in particular, now you see here the first point where we need the 3 to D, so n equal to 3. So it will be better if you have this constant here positive, because when this is negative, then you put it on the other side, you're saying that the background is more. Side, you're saying that the back reaming is more positive, so you have more estimates. And it will be better, of course, to have here positive or negative, because if you, I mean, if you actually reach it and from below by negative constant, you will have no control of volumes. You have exponential control, maybe, but actually, you don't know almost anything about this guy at infinity. This is the real problem of this problem. So, you have this control at infinity, but point-wise, you don't have control, okay. It's really bad. It's really bad. But in dimension three, this case does the job. So here you have zero, negative, and here you have positive number one over two. That's it. So when you realize this, I mean, most of you will prove the theory. Once you realize this. Once you, I mean, you have to prove the completeness also, which is a bit technical, but so, okay, so here is the proof. So okay, so here is the proof is super classic. So it's just a conformal deformation. You compute everything. I will skip some steps. So this is the formula for conformal deformation of method of the rich intensive in general. And now you, and this is the formula for the action, conformal deformation of the action. You plug it in and you get this. And here I use, of course, the equation here. So you satisfy this TD. It's very powerful. And this gives you this gain here. You have this gain here, which is very. Game here, you have this game here, which is very good. And okay, now this guy controls a bit, this guy here by Koshi Schwartz. So you use it and use the minimal equation here. Actually, so reach is bounded from below always on every minimal percentage by the constant and the second minus a constant, the the norm of the square norm of A. But actually you you want to do something C sharper, so actually C C trace free, it's not one, it's constant A but it's A minus one, okay? One, this constantly, but it's M and so you get you plugging in and you get this. So it's very immediate. But okay, this metric would be complete because on you two, you two, you don't have any control, let you feel. It's really completely. So, so dimension three, now we choose k equal to two over three. This is the maybe the perfect. Maybe the perfect choice, I don't know. What we did, and we proved that this metric is complete. I mean, if the talk would be one hour, I will give you the proof of. So this second variation, so it's a weighted second variation formula for geodesic. And it's not our idea, it was already around in the 80s by Fischer Cookie, and after also. And after also Shang Zhu in other contexts and so on. This is not our idea. And okay, so you have a complete conformal method which is complete and there's two non-negative bacteria management. So you have weighted visual problem. That's almost classical. So people get worked on this problem very well. So it's a corollary. You have a control on G tilde, geodesic. Control on G tilde geodesic balls, but weighted. So weighted with G tilde is minus F, which will be U to some power. So if you now change this is in G tilde, you change everything in G, not the ball, of course. You change everything in G, so it's a control on U to some power. The power is whatever G. And so the corollary is that this grows at most like C to the so this is the control that you get at infinity on conformal balls and wait. Seems a bit technical, but this is what you get at this point. And once you arrive to this, now what you would do? I mean, if you would know the proof of change time, now what you would do? They will need the control ATV drop balls. Now we have weighted control on G tilde, so we will not use a catalog function on the distance, but a cutoff function on R tilde. You can do it. You can do it. So, in order to have cutoffs defined on G field aborts, but in order to do this, at some point you have to put some power of view here in order to match with this control here. So, the trick is to put power of view here and play. And the Simon's equation, and so on. And so, actually, so this was Simon's estimate. So, we want to put the power of U here and you can do it. That's the last step. So, actually. So, actually, this estimates also you can put this power. So, it's minus two is because it's a good one, this delta is just too has to be small. And I put this minus two over three because it will be nicer at the end. Confused over one point. So, you chose a different power of the conformal factor from the one that you would use if you'd solve the Yamabi equation. Yeah. And you're still going to get positive scale of the future. Scalar curvature. Obviously, no, you don't have positive scalar curvature. You have two non-negative Richie curvature, two n by three ammonia Richie curvature. You don't have positive curvature. But you have a control of Richie, which is better. Yeah. Weighted. Weighted control. In high dimension, you need this. You cannot do just controlling the sky condition. It's impossible. Actually, Chadu Chali managed to do this, but because they use a Do to do this, but because they use another completely different approach with the range function and level sets, and on the level sets, it's 2D, so the level sets is 2d, so it could scale coverage, it's okay. But in our context, it really to use bridge. Maybe Riemann would have an action, I don't know, section, I don't know, don't know what the problem is. And okay, so I mean, the idea is really, I mean, I don't want to worry you about this, but it's really I mean, I don't want to worry you about this, but it's really like before. So, we proved this before. I give you the proof of this. This is before holder. So, for every p in this interval, we add this. And now you choose psi to be a power of u, too. U, it's this function, which is a conformal factor. And you, I mean, it's not immediate, you have to work a bit, you have to use again Simon's identity, Simon's frequency, the equation, and so on, but it's standard, I would say. And you prove this. Why do you want this? Now we can. Why do you want this? Now we can finish the proof. So this is the proof. So now we know that this guy is controlled at infinity. The power of u to the power of 4 over 3 is closed at most like r to the power of 5. So you go back in the proof. So this is how we did the proof function. And so you want to. Now the test function must be a function of the distance of g tilde distance, the distance of your conformal metric which is complete. Is complete. Compass support, so it's a nice function with compass support, but on G tilde balls, and use this, and so we use the previous estimates that we proved. And you plug in, you change G in G tilde here, then you gain this guy here, just computation when you have this norm. And this is done exactly in order to have here 4 over 3, which is the gut the so we had a control on this because of the two non-negative but we have condition and the metrics complete. Condition and the metrics complete. So, but here now this goes at most like r to the power five, and you we put it here this little depth in order to have so this is the proof. So, it's a few words you can say it's a weighted version of Shane, Samoa. This conformat, okay. So, any question? I mean, of course, you would like to. Question, I mean, of course, you would like to say what about dimension four? What's going wrong? All the three steps, actually. You don't have non-negative battery average curvature with it. Or you can have it, but with negative dimension, negative uh fake dimension. Bad maybe. You don't have completeness completeness, it's fades. Bigness, it's faint. And also, these estimates you have. I mean, maybe this estimate you can do some kind of weighted estimate. You don't know how to use it. We don't know. I mean, we are working, of course, on it. There is something. I mean, it's not empty, dimension four. There is something. You have some information, extra information. And we are working on it. And okay, so this is, as Christopher was saying, this maybe is not a problem for if you have a permanent position, it's okay. If you have a permanent position, it's okay. As you have seen, I mean, you can do it. Once you have one idea, you can do it. So, the critical dimension should be six. It's not maybe it's not three dimension six. Could be, it could be that it's dimension six, something is okay. This is just a remark about Chodo Schlipp proof. Okay. Oh, okay. And so, okay, we skip this. Sorry, we skip this. Sorry. So, our approach is completely different. And actually, I would just few words. The quasi-anesymatic will appear. I want to show you. Sorry, I was a bit. So, the problem is this, completely different problem. We were studying this with Paul and Ario some years ago. So, the easiest quadratic curvature function is the cryptonomal scalar curvature. You take variation, you get this very nice equation. Variation, you get this very nice equation. So, I'm thinking about non-compact many for variation with no couple support. Okay, so global variation, no volume restriction, and no normalization and so on. So, I'm thinking about non-compact manifolding. So, this is the equation, very nice. You see, this is come, I mean, you can realize this static equation like the static where the potential is the scalar curves, so it's very rigid. But it's non-linear, it's unseen, it's a round. So, these are the equations of critical metrics. So these are the equations of critical metrics and you want to find examples, critical metrics and maybe several results. So of course you have zero scalar scalar zero scalar fate metrics and critical metrics. Of course a global minimum, but maybe there are other. Actually we don't know. So this problem is completely open. So there are no examples of non-trivial critical metrics. In dimension 4 is very special. You have uninstead metrics. But for instance dimension 5 But for instance, dimensional five, there are no examples except for scalar flat metrics. This is another problem that you think. So existence already did. So this is just a list of results. But the point is that, sorry, I don't have time, but actually we managed to push really this result by using this technique, this conformal technique. And so we proved that actually a natural assumption, so there are no, so it's very complicated, it's probably not a very important thing. So it's very complicated, it's probably not finite energy, so we assume that the energy is finite. So actually, we prove that the only critical matrix with finite energy in dimensional equal than 10 are just as color flex, so a cloud of mean. And I should think about n contact or non-compact. Non-compact. Compact is pretty good. And this is the trick. So this is the problem. The finite energy. The finite energy, so you have almost not harmonic, it's dimensional energy equal to that five, it's superharmonic. So, by Yau classical integral electrical harmonic function, you get that actually there are zero, if you have finite energy, so you have to use finite energy. It's a finite energy net p, then it must be zero or negative. And then this is a conformal factor. And if you do the computation here, you don't have estimates on the n background, but actually it's equal to zero with this choice. So, really, you have a quasi-Einstein metric here. Very nice. Very nice. Dimension 10, you have a rich state, this rich isolum. Dimension 10. And okay, and so you have to prove that it's complete. Not easy, but you can do it. And it's still also here, you need the dimensional algebra equal to 10. You want dimensional 10 to have this positive. Now it's the story, it's different. We don't have stability of things like that, so it's completely different. But we use some point-wise action on this colour curvature of this new metric, and we. Curvature of this new metric, and we get estimates on this. So, sorry, skip this part. And so, I thank you. Thank you very much.
