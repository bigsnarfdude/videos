Two different complexity measures for some squares groups and connection between them. And during this talk we'll see the strong duality theorem also that was mentioned earlier today in a slightly different clause. So let's start. So what's our setup is basically given any set of polynomial constraints. Of polynomial constraints of degree at most k that are in variables. So basically in literals, we have positive literals and then negative literals. And the idea, of course, is that the literals they run over 0, 1 assignments and these get the opposite values. And accordingly, we do. Accordingly, we define the or denote by this I and the ideal generated by those Boolean axioms that basically force the assignments to be 0, 1 and have the opposite values. Okay, so what's a sample proof? We've seen it already. But so a proof of non-negativity of some polynomial R from Q is Q is a sums of squares, the inequality constraints lifted by sums of squares plus the equality constraints lifted by any polynomials. And I'm hiding here the Boolean axioms, the model of the Boolean ideal. Okay. So and a refutation is a proof of minus minus one and the two complex dimensions we're interested here is are the the degree degree of the proof it's the maximum degree of non-summons and I I guess I should say the maximum degree of summons and the the formula that we are or the polynomial that we are proving. Or the polynomial that we are proving because yeah, because with the definition we could prove uh high degree polynomials in low degree without that addition. And the monomial size, I want to count the monomials in a, what I call an explicit representation. So if I write this, actually I say these S0s and SI's as some sort of S zeros and S i's as sums of squares, I count the monomials inside squares and then the monomials in the dj's. Okay, and to fix some notation, we write that q proves in degree D that p is bigger or equal than q if we have a proof of non-negativity of p minus q. I want to point out first that this is a pre-order. Pre-order. That's a reflexive and transitive relation. And that's a way I want to think of this in the duality theorem, which is the next thing. So what's the duality? The duality between provable lower bounds and pseudo-expectation values. So pseudo-expectation is just a Expectation is just a degree D pseudo expectation is any linear functional from all the polynomials of degree at most d that well this is to normalize basically and to force E to not to be trivial trivial functional and then I want E to respect this order okay Okay. So that's equivalent to the standard, maybe the m more usual definition. And the strong duality theorem is as follows. So we get this for even degree. For any polynomial, we can prove that the supremum of the provable lower bounds is the same as the infimum of the The same as the infimum of the obtainable pseudo-expectation values for that p. And moreover, if this is non-empty, there's actually a pseudo-expectation that attains this value. And how to prove this? So, okay, so one way to prove this is going to the STP, translating both of these to To SDPs, and then applying the strong duality for SDPs. But that's a bit it's like fishing with dynamite in my because basically you you use way too strong uh tools and then you're left with you know something that you don't You know, something that you don't really have a good grab on. So, really, what's important in this Goethe theorem is just this lemma, that actually we can prove in degrees 2D, for any polynomial in degree 2D, we have a provable lateral boundary. Okay, and then the duality theorem follows from a, I write here, general duality for pre-ordered vector spaces with order units. For pre-ordered vector space with order units. So I'm gonna explain what this is. So here, say a pre-order on the vector space of all polynomials of degree 2d. This says that the constant polynomial 1 is so-called ordered unit on this space. So that means that there's a for any polynomial, there's some positive multiple that's above it. And for any vector space with this kind of a uh properties, that you have some some element uh any pre-ordered vector space that you have some element that's some positive multiple is above or every every element has has some positive multiple above it and you can prove a similar kind of duality theorem like a bottom bottom-up uh Bottom up. Basically, what you start with is, assuming that you don't have a contradiction, you start with just an identity, mapping from positive polynomials to reals. This is a linear functional that respects this pre-order, and you can build that the whole whole The whole whole uh Linux functional for the whole space. Uh just put some up uh by an argument that's uh if you know Hahn-Banach's theorem, that's a basically the similar kind of argument. But yes but this proof in s in in my view is is very much on the on the level of the statement. On the level of the statement. So let's say why I why I kind of liked it. Okay, so now to the main contribution here, which is the trade-off theorem. So this is so we show how to transform basically a refutation of some monomial size. Of some monomial size. Or or basically transform a small refutation to a refutation of small degree. And here's the the the actual constants that we get here. So as you can see this is this is really analogous to the size width rate-off for resolution and Trade-off for resolution and size degree with trade-off for polynomial couples. Okay. And of course, the corollary here is that for a strong enough okay, so this would change. Okay, yeah. Corollary is that for strong enough degrading lower bounds, we get such lower bounds on the number of monomials. Okay. So, yes. So, here's just a reminder of that. Basically, that Related works. So there's this first one that translated a short resolution refutations to small degree polymer type refutations, and then building on over this a trade-off results for polymer calculus and resolution. Okay. So what's what's our proo proof strategy? Of course this is a this is common to all of these related works. So we want to show, this is one way to show them. Basically we want to show that the following kind of lemma. So if there's a reputation of Q with at most S many monopoly At most, as many monomials, explicit monomials of degree at least d. Then we can transform this to a reputation of degree some constant times d plus n over d log s plus the degree of the original constraints. And after we have this, just choosing suitable d D, we can get the full error. Okay, so the proof sketch would go for the lemma as follows. So we'd find a popular literal among the quad monomials, set it to 0 and 1 to obtain refutations of these restricted sets of constraints. With the choice we can inductively get a decrease 2d prime for an appropriate d and minus 2 and 2d prime for refutations for q these restricted. And then combine these refutations to a refutation of the original q. Of the original Q. And this is the step I'm going to concentrate on because this is the step that's that's that will that's where the proof differs from basically from the other numbers. So how to how to prove this? And the problem is that is is in the is in some of what's being static then. Some of course being static, that makes some problems. But the basic idea is the following. So, first of all, given a degree 2d minus 2 perfectation of this restricted set, we want to first basically change this restriction into an addition of another axiom. But there's a problem here, so but I'll But there's a problem here, so but I'll I'll come back to it. There, from this assumption, we'll get that for any pseudo expectation for the original Q, actually the value that the literal L gets should be strictly positive. And because we can attain the infimum, we know that the infimum of the pseudo expectation values is actually. The absurd expectation values is actually strictly positive. Okay? And then from the duality, we get that the supremum of the proverbial lower balances is strictly positive. And so we get that we can actually prove in degree 2d minus 2 that the literal is greater or equal than some strictly positive epsilon. Okay? And similarly on the other side, we can get this. We can get this, we can prove that the literal L is at most some one minus some strictly positive delta. Okay? And then we can combine these by basically multiplying this with the square of the the the dual of this this literal and yeah you get a uh reputation. you get a uh refutation of of the original Q. But here's the the problem man. The problem is is simply simply that when we do this restriction, this degree of these axioms can drop dramatically. And so the nice simulation, because of course we have that we have that this restriction is is equal to model of the model of the ideal to some Q plus some term times the L. Okay? But now if we just simulate this by basically multiplying this term by w whatever was was uh lifting this in there in the original group. We are in a in NNN because we can really go above there. We can really go above the degree. So, of course, the solution to this is to restrict the lists of these restrictions so that their degree does not go over basically 2d minus the degree of q. But this must be But this must be carried down somehow through the whole of the induction. So we have must carry some kind of a object that codes this information down the whole induction. And following is one way to do it. It's a bit of an overkill, but it's a neat one. So we call any We call any function from the constraints to natural numbers a cutoff function if we have the that it it gives a value for the constraints that's bigger than the than the degree of the constraint and we define these SOS proofs of degree to the model of the cutoff function to be so that this this this These lifts of the constraints are their degree is constrained by this cutoff function, basically. And then what we want to do is carry along this induction all the way to the bottom cutoff function for the Q so that we never introduce a lift that with cost drop. That would cause troubles here. And basically, this general view on the duality theorem allows us to quite easily see that, okay, we can actually prove this duality theorem, strong duality theorem, even with this more restricted notion of a proof. Or make this notion of a proof and the corresponding Corresponding corresponding pseudo expectations. And of course, here pseudo expectations are again just Rina functionals that respect this pre-order. Okay, and now, well, yes, updated proofs gets we just uh want to obtain proofs that are often proves that that of degree 2D minus 2 and 2d model of the cutoff function and then combine these to a refutation of Q model of degree 2d model of the cutoff function. And now this step, you know, there's no no problem because you are you are not There cannot be two lists of two large degree basically here. And everything goes nice to true. So what about the positive Stellensage proofs? Unfortunately, we get only this kind of a theorem for what we call positive Stellensage proofs of bounded product with. Product with. So, of course, in positive stellen-such proof, you are allowed to multiply the inequality constraints together and then lift them by a square. And we call it a basically a proof is a product with W if you multiply at most W many of these constraints together. And of course, then you get the similar kind of a Kind of a similar kind of fade trade-off, but here you have a dependence also on this W, which is, of course, a quite serious problem with if you have many, basically many inevitable. many um inequality constraints in your in your formula. So app applications of course are the the examples from the literature that have need large degree to refute in some squares. So we get a exponential monomial that's lower bounds for knapsack and for And for exciting formulas, and for random sparse KCNFs, also. So lastly, I want to tell about a few open problems. So whether the question is whether this trade-off is optimal. So whether they say, and especially if it's optimal for small reputations, so whether they say polynomial size reputation. So there's a polynomial size refutations that need basically the maximum degree to refute. Basically the trade-off gives this degree for full-size transitations, but whether this is needed. So this is known for resolution and Resolution and polynomial tattoos, and it's versions of the ordering principle. But for SOS, Aaron has shown that actually SOS can refute the ordering principle in degree that's basically the fourth root of the number of variables. And another question is, of course, about the how these how these two measures like about whether this trade-off is in some sense true trade-off. So whether one can whether this This because in this proof, of course, when you transform this small refutation to a small degree of refutation, the size goes up, but whether that is necessary. So whether one can minimize both of these measures at the same time. And the last one is: can we make this trade-off hold for general possibilities? Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Questions? Can you move one slide back? Yes. So in your first question, can we ask, for example, small means predominantly? Yes, yes. And degree means constant degree. Super constant degree. Can or whatever is it? Just better put it, whatever is it be a fair specification Do there exist polynomial size soft circulation that we won't have what there is or is it trivial for some reasons? I don't know but because well what we want is is the score of course if you offer a Why uh if you for example put uh replace clear or document by uh force or something like that, why would it be any better by force? Or worse, except that it's coming from a sussle ending that's something you may be a very best flower bunch for the for a small process. Yeah, very normal size, pretty normal size source. One. It's a super constant of aren't we? Super constant? Sorry. So what's the ordering principle? Well, super constants, they're all very simple order super constants. So I believe it uh so if if you see the ordinary principle on m element, so that's n squared. On n elements. So that's n squared variables. In my talk tomorrow afternoon, I'll describe an SOS proof of degree square root of n log n or stuff. I believe that that should be tight. And I'm still ironing out hackers with time. You will talk about all the events. No, yeah, I'm talking about the events. I'll talk about your adventure.
