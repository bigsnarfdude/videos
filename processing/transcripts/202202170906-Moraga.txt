I can end what what can we do this day? So today I'm going to give you some background about techniques that we are interested in in the lab and really enjoying the meeting so far. It's not easy to find people interested in signaling these days. It's really good to see such a nice work presented. And I think a common question that we have with many other people that have presenting is how cells can send many different environmental cues and produce And produce functional diversity and specificity. And we try to address this question using our favorite family of cytokines, or ligands, which are cytokines. We was mentioned in the previous presentation, more than 50 cytokines out there. And cells can sense the cytokines that are present in the medium, they can interpret them and they can produce the adequate response. And this allows cytokines to control pretty much every physiological Every physiological process, but they are critical in controlling communication between immune cells and defining immune responses. So, we are very interested in the lab to try to understand how cytokines can do that. And the methodology that we use in the lab is we try to use protein engineering and quantitative signaling analysis to try to understand and manipulate cytokines responses. So, although cytokines, there were a couple of talks in the previous day. A couple of talks in the previous day talking about cytokine, and I thought that would be a good idea to describe a little bit better how cytokines engage with the receptor and they initiate signaling. So, normally, the general mechanism for cytokine-induced signaling is a cytokine in a first step is going to bind with very high affinity a receptor change, and then in a second step, it will recruit with much lower affinity a second receptor suburb. And what that is going to do is going to bring tyrosine kinases of the JAC5. Thyrosine kinases of the JAT family in close proximity. They are going to transfosorate each other and then they are going to phosphorylate tyrosine motif in the intracellular domain of the receptor, which they are going to add as docking site for transcriptional factors of the stack family, which then they are going to be phosphorylated on tyrosine by the JAX. They are going to form HOMO and heterodimers, which translocate to the nucleus and induce specific gene expression programs. But we know for many years now that Cyto cannot only activate JAC and style. Can not only activate the JAC and start pathway and they can activate additional non-stat pathways that help them to fine-tune their responses. Although we honestly don't really understand how this additional pathway actually contributes to the response. But for the last 10 or 15 years, we have started to realize that this initial process of the dimerization of the cytokinoreceptor is critical to define the type of signaling responses that are going to be activated in a way that it will manipulate the kinetic of engagement of the total. The kinetic of engagement or the topology of the receptor engage, we can alter signaling downstream. But we still don't fully understand the boundaries of those changes, how much we have to change the complex stability, how much we have to change the topology in order to alter signaling responses. And on top of that, there is one extra layer of complexity, which is what is being brought in the course of the last few days: that there are 50 cytokamp, but all of the signal via. Cytokan, but all of the signals via four jacks and seven stats. And not that I have written here four jack and seven stats, 80-85% of cytokines use the same two jacks, jack1 and jack2. So somehow two jacks, jack1 and jack2, are able to interpret 50 cytokan and to produce hundreds of differential responses. And we don't really understand how that happened. So today I'm going to give you a brief summary of two projects that we've been working on in the lab. The first one is trying to understand. On in the lab. The first one is trying to understand how cytokina activate at least apparently common signaling pathways drive very different biological responses. And that was a full collaboration with the lab of Carmen Molina, which he's presented in an hour or so here. And then the second one is our attempt to manipulate the way that the cytochrome receptor to fine-tune downstream signaling and try to understand a little bit better how that dynamic process influences self-efficacy. Self-aid decisions. Okay, so the first project focuses these two cytokines, which are we like a lot in the lab, Interluckin 6 and Interluckin27. And what I'm showing here is a schematic representation of the topology of the complex that these two cytokines form. So Interlookin 6 forms a hexameric complex and all the signaling is driven by GP130, which activates JAG1, STAT1, and StAP3. And in the case of Interleucuan 27, who is at heterogameric cytokine, the signal is driven. The signal is driven by one molecule of GP130 and one molecule of 27 alpha, which activate JAG1 and JAG2, and also drive STAR1 and STAR3 phosphorylation. But on paper, these two cytokines should be quite redundant and quite similar in terms that the signaling problem that they activate is very similar. But when you see the functional consequences of a cell scene interleukin-6 or interleukin-27, they are completely opposite. So interleukin-6 is the classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, the one driving. Inflammatory cytokine, the one driving the cytokine storm that we have heard so much from COVID. And you know, it's very pathological. Interleukin-27, on the other hand, is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokines that we have, drive expression of interleukin-10, it prevents inflammation, promote differentiation of the regulatory cells. So how can a cell tell whether the cell is seeing interleukin-6 and interleukin-27, and how can interpret the same signaling program to produce completely opposite response? Produce completely opposite responses. That was sort of what we were looking for in this project. And sort of our workhorse in the lab is causal flow cytometry, that, you know, our bread and butter, we do that every day. We have adapted this protocol developed by Gary Nolan in Stanford, who is what is called barcoding for source flow cytometry, in a way that we can barcode each population in a well and then combine all that. And then combine all that in the same tube so we can analyze in an ITC sweat play like in three or four epilogue tubes. So that you know, speed up things, save a lot of money because you don't have to stay an ITC's web, you just stay in four of them, and then you can deconvolute all that in the program and generate very accurate dog responses and kinetics. So we get very quantitative signaling from many different populations. So the first experiment that we did when we started this project was purify human T cells with different Purified human T cells, we differentiate them towards TH1 phenotype because we can get a lot of cells in vitro, and then we estimate them with different doses of interleukin-27 in blue or interleukin-6, in this case hydrochrome-6, in red. In the X-axis, you have the concentration of the cytokines, and in the y-axis, you have the amount of star1 phosphorylation or the amount of stat3 phosphorylation. And of the bag, you can see that TH1 cells seem to be more sensitive to interlubin 27 and interlubin 6, to be much lower. 27 interruptin-6 should be much lower dosage of 27 to activate phosphorylation of stats. But at saturation, at least at the level of STAT3 phosphorylation, a T cell cannot tell whether it's seeing interleukin-6 or interleukin-27. At the level of STAT3, interleukin-27 is a bit better than interleukin-6 because even a saturation interleukin-27 trigger about 20% higher level of STAT1 for solation than interleukin-6. And this is not the result of a delayed kinetic. The kinetic Not the result of a delayed kinetic. The kinetic of activation are equivalent between interlucking 27 and interluckin 6, at least for stat 3, although interlukin 27 produces a little bit more sustained activation of stat 1. So it's not only increase in amplitude, also the time the stat 1 remains for the data is a bit longer. We interlook in 27 and that we interlook in 6. So we have seen this for many different cytokines where they activate multiple stats and some of them are sustained, some of them And some of them are sustained, some of them are more transient. And, you know, all reviews have assigned that to different regulations by phosphatases or SOX or negative regulators, but it has never been clear to me particularly how these different kinetic as are achieved by cycle cards. So we were very interested to understand how this more sustained activation of statue one by interleukin twenty seven happened and how that contributes to the unique biological property of interleukin twenty seven. Property of interlooking 27. So, I don't have time to go through the whole set of experiments that we did to get to the model that I'm going to present you, but this thing is being published, but I'll be happy to discuss them if you are curious about it. But, you know, we assess kinetic of receptor assembly, we assess kinetic of signaling, and we look at different internalization model receptors. And together with Carmen, we came out with a mathematical model to try to explain of all these different. Of all these different steps after Ligand binding, which one was the most important defining kinetic of starsulation by interlute-6 and lutein-27? And this is the model that we came up about. And what we try to propose here is that in the case of interlute 6, where you have two GT130 driving signaling, GT130 binds with high affinity stat3, but binds with low affinity stat1. So what is happening is that you get this competition between the two stats, in which stat3 is the first one to be engineered. In which stat 3 is the first one to be engaged, is the first one to be phosphorylated, and only when the complex goes to the endosome is when stat 1 starts to get activated and phosphorylated. So you get a delay and a more transient activation of stat 1 due to that competition between these two transcriptive factors. And that's sort of the common aspect in cytokines. Most cytokines will activate one star, and the other stars, although they're engaged, they're engaged in a much more transient form. And they contribute very little. And they contribute very little to the biological activity of that cyclopan, being the main one, the one that drives most of the activity. But in the case of 27, what we see is that both stats are activated to the same extent, stat 1 and stat 3. And what we found is that 27 has evolved from this common motif into a different one, but including a high affinity binding interaction between stat 1 and one of its receptor subunit, 27 or alpha. So 27r alpha is the one. So 27 alpha is the one taking care of activating STAR1, and GP130 is the one taking care of activating STAR3. And what you get is this kinetic decoupling of star activation that allow 27 to produce very robust responses in the ever-changing environment. But again, you know, this difference in kinetic of stat activation are very, very, very small. We see a delay, but it's not like 300-fold stronger star one activation. We're talking about 20, 25. Activation, we're talking about 20-25% more stat1 over a period of time. So, how can you get completely opposite responses with 25% more stat1 between 6 and 27? So, we were curious to understand what is the long-term functional consequence of this more sustained stat1 activation by interleukin 27. And for that, we did transcriptonics. And the way that we did it, we took human pH1 cells and we estimated those cells with saturated amounts of interleukin 6 and interleukin 27 for a different type. For a different time. We were for a short time, one hour of stimulation, for an intermediate time, six hours of stimulation, and for a late time, 24 hours of stimulation. And what you can see in this principal component display analysis is that starting after one hour of stimulation, interlucking 27 and interluckin 6 are very similar. You actually cannot tell them apart based on the gene program that they regulate. But after longer time of stimulation, six hour and twenty-four hour, those gene programs start to decouple. Program starts to decouple and differ dramatically in a way that looking 27 that would, and Interluki 6 does the opposite. And when you look at the number of genes that are differentially regulated by 27 and 6, you can see that at one hour, both of them interregulate around 60 genes, and those genes are the same between the two cytokines. But after one hour, the respond by interlude in SIG disappears and very quickly, with very few genes regulated at 6 hours and almost no genes regulated at 24 hours. While the respond in regulated While the response regulated by intelope 27 keeps increasing and remains the same with time. And when we cluster the type of genes that are regulated by the two cytogenes, we get these sort of heat maps and we can see several clusters. And we can start with this cluster here, which are genes that are used at one hour by both 27 and 6, but they are only transient views. You don't get them regulated at 6 hours and 24 hours. And there are no differences in this cluster of gene. There are no differences in this cluster of gene between Telukin27 and Telukin 6, and this corresponds to classical STAT3 dependent genes. So you have here SOX3, FOX, EGR1. These are very classical STAT3 dependent genes. Then we have a second cluster of genes, which is equally induced by 6 at 27 at one hour, but then interlucines cannot induce these genes anymore. And 27 produces a sustained indication of this gene, as you can see here plotted. And this corresponds also to classical. And this corresponds also to classical STAT1 dependent genes. Here you have PDA1, you have SOX1, you have IRF1. This is a very classical genes regulated by the STAT1. And then you have a third cluster of gene which is exclusively induced by Teleukin27 by its delay with regard to cluster 1 and cluster 2. And these are classical interfering-regulated genes, what are called IFG. As you have here, IRF9, the GBP proteins, USP18. Proteins of USP18, these are classical type 1 interfering signature. And they are only induced by interleukin 27, but not by interleukin 6. So, two cytogens that activate very similar signal responses in the early hours of stimulation can produce very different gene expression programs after six hours of six hours and 24-hour stimulation. But how can that actually happen? Because again, the difference in style one activation is there, it's present, it's very reproducible, it changes from cell to cell. Is very reproducible, it changes from cell to cell, but it's not massive. We are talking about 30-40 percent more star one phosphorylation. So, how 40 percent more star one phosphorylation leads to a completely new gene program of interfering inducible genes six hours after stimulation? So, we thought that there should be some sort of synergy or additive effect between the first wave of genes in LURPA-27 and interleupin-6, and we focus in these stat 1-dependent genes that they are different between 6 and 27. That they are different between 6 and 27, in which 27 induce a sustained expression of them, and 6 only induces a transient expression of them. And we saw this one, I red one, which is a transcriptive factor, and it has been described in the literature to synergize in certain contexts with star 1, particularly interferon gamma responses. So we thought that maybe interlocking 27 sustained induction of error 1 was feeding back into the signaling program and the gene expression program and allowing 27 to access And allowing 27 to access a different set of genes that interluckin C cannot. So we went ahead and silenced IFREV1 in cells. And as you can see, when you silence IFR-1, you don't affect a STA3-dependent gene, that's SOX3, but you clearly affect this second wave of interference-like signature in you by interleukin 27. So our model now for interleukin-27 differential responses is that this more sustained star1 activation would result from a One activation would result from a high affinity interaction between 27er alpha and STAT1, leads to a more sustained upregulation of IDREF1. STAT1 and IREV-1 cooperate together to induce a second wave of interfering-like signature genes that allow 27 to produce a completely different response than that one induced by interducing 6. So that was the first part, like how two cytokines that trigger signaling responses that are very similar can diversify the Are very similar can diversify the responses and control different activities. The second one is have to do more with how we use protein engineering to manipulate those cytokine responses. And the concept here is that we know that cytokines, like I say, one that the complex is formed, you have tyrosine phosphorylated in the intracellular domain, and that leads to activation of stats and a given number of responses. But we asked the question whether we could manipulate whether the ligand was binding and timerizing the receptors and act. Antimirizing the receptors, and after the pool of phosphophyrosin engaged by the complex, and in doing that, fine-tune or bias, activation of different stem molecules to decouple functional periodophobia by cytokines. In this case, we focus on interlupin 6. And the way that we approach this type of project is when we have structural information about the system, which we have for interluptin 6, we focus on a binding interface, in this case GP130 in blue and interluckin6 in green, and then Blue and interlocking 6 in green, and the amino acid that we chose to mutate in interluckin 6 are highlighted in red. And we can make this very large library of mutants using this surface display. And normally we can generate libraries on the size of 10 to the 8, 10 to the 9. And then we can screen all libraries to find mutants that fulfill the properties that we are looking for. And the way that that works is one of the libraries generated, so the protein gets displayed in the surface of the genes, and then we can use fluorescently labeled cytokine sector in this case. Label cytokine setor in this case GP130, which we incubate with the library. So Gs that bind GP130 are fluorescently labeled, Gs that don't bind GP130 are not fluorescently labeled, and then we can use magnetic beads that bind the fluorochrome and that we use to label the Gs to isolate those Gs that are binding our protein. The one that they are not binding get discarded. And we can repeat this in an iterative round until we find the properties that we are looking for, higher affinity, different topology, more stability. More stability. One that we have reached that point, we can pick colonies, and each colony will have an individual sequence, and we can get cross-sequencing, we can express recommending kretose protein, and we can start to characterize the binding profile, the signaling profile, the activity profiles. So in the case of interluckin6, this is an example of what we'll go with this library. So here on the bottom, we have Walta Interlukin 6. We bind GP13 with a high micromolar affinity. With a high micromolar affinity, so we cannot detect this on G surface binding experiments. And then we generated a series of mutants which are displayed here, which by GP130 we increase these affinities. And you can see that very nicely in the sequence distribution of the library. In mutants that are isolated from early rounds, you can see that the mutations are random and they don't converge together. But as you start increasing the affinity by increasing the number of selenium, all mutants tend to converge into few. Tend to converge into few mutations that explain the increases in affinity. In this case, we got this mutant over here that was binding with around 10 damolar affinity, but we wanted to have a wider distribution of binding stability. So we did a second library starting from this mutant, and we got these other mutants over here that were binding with even higher affinity than the one that we got within the library. So in two RAM of using two library, we could go from one type condition. From one ties condition, which binds GP130 in the micromolar range, to a mutant that we call mu3, who is binding GP130 in the hundreds of picomolar range. At that point, we express the protein and we characterize biophysically and biologically the protein. And I'm going to show you here a kinetic experiment, but again, we did both responses and many other experiments to characterize these ligands. So, these kinetics were data saturation. What that means is that no matter how much. Saturation. What that means is that no matter how much more ligand we add, we don't recover the difference in amplitude. And what you can see here is that the different mutants elicit different amplitudes of star 3 and star 1 motivation, all compared with hyper ILC, which is the stronger signal that you can get. So the high-affinity mutant in red, mu3, is almost as protein as hyper IL6. The intermediate affinity C7 induces around 70% of the staff field level in hyper IL6, and the low affinity A1 induce around 50%. And the low affinity A1 use around 50% of the level of STA3 used by high-parallel 6. But we also noticed that the two pathways that engaged by interlocking 6, STAT3 and STAT1, weren't equally affected by changes in complex stability. So if you focus in the green mutant, in C7, you can see how induced 70% of the level of STAT3 induced by hyperl6, but only 25% of the level of STAT1 induced by hyperl6. So you can start biasing down. Biasing downstream signaling and decoupling signaling activation by these ligands and these binder-looking signals by changing the affinity of their binding to the Russetto. And if we plot that in ratio of star3 over star1, you can clearly see as you decrease the binding affinity toward GP130, you have strong activation of star3 over star one. So, what is the functional consequence of this? The easiest way to look at that is look at way to look that is look at the gene program that these different ligands engage how they are affected and here we were curious to see to test a couple of models and I think that this sort of correlate with the discrimination model that Omer saw yesterday in which you know you can have this sort of linear correlation with 50% decrease in activity produced 50% decrease in all gene induced by the cytokine and that would try to be displayed here so you get a partial average activate Here, so you get a partial algorithm that create 50% of STAT3, then all the genes induced by these partial algorithms are decreased by 50%, and so on and so forth. And then another model, another possibility for this that you get this type of graded response, where sad genes don't really care much how much stat you get activated. They are either on and off, either, you know, the second that there is a little bit of stat activation, they are fully in use. And some other genes are very sensitive to changes in static forelation and they can send how much stat is they. And they can send how much staff is engaged and adapt their responses accordingly. So, we were curious to understand whether these partial algorithms that we generated would follow a linear model that we call of this grading model. So, we did LRNA-seq using the different ligands as applications, like I shown before. And I think that you can clearly see that at least in this scenario, in HIDA cell, but we have also done it in pH one cell and many other cell subsets. Interlupin6 follows more like a grade model. So, you have some genes that we call bio. So, you have some genes that we call binary because they are either on and off, which they don't really care how much stat 3 or stat 1 is engaged. As long as there is a little bit, they will be fully induced. And then you have intermediate genes that are sort of in between and some genes that are very, very exquisite, sensitive to changes in static relation. And this is just here on the right, an example of gene in each class, just to highlight that these are real differences that we are seeing. And I just wanted to finish with a couple. And I just wanted to finish with a couple of extra slides because we've been trying to identify how a gene is binary, how a gene is digital, that we have called it here. What define the different classes of genes that cytokine can trigger? Because this, we and many other people have found that this is a very systematic thing in cytokine. There are what some people call them robase, some people call them tunable, I mean different names, but the name is the same thing. Some genes are very sensitive to estaphofabulation, or some genes require different. Some genes require different levels of stat to be in use. But we don't know what makes a binary from a digital. So we thought, naively, I would say that maybe it was the sequence in the promoter of the gene that was engaged, that small differences in the sequence would lead to different binding affinities, and those different binding kinetic will lead to more robust or more sensitive binding of STAT3 and gene responses. But we have looked very, very, very hard. We haven't been able to find. We haven't been able to find any differences. I mean, you know, like if you go and look, sure, that there are some small differences, but it's difficult for me to believe that that makes such a huge difference in binding affinity and kinetic that could actually drive different gene responses. But we haven't tested, I have to say. But one thing that we noticed from this large gene data set that we have obtained is that there is a general trend that when genes are very sensitive. That when genes are very sensitive to changes in stat activation, they tend to have more stat three, more stat binding side. And genes that are sort of binary, are they on and off, they tend to have one at the most binding side. So the model that we are working with now is like a low stand concentration, both binary and digital genes are induced. When you start increasing the dosage, so increasing the responses, that you get more stack for formulation and activation. The binary genes don't have more binding size, so they are fully occupied. Binding side, so they are fully occupied and they deliver the signal that they can deliver. But the digital gene, because they have more starphalit binding side, those bindings can be occupied by the new staphos related, and that can lead to a more linear response that the more you have, the more signal you get. But we are still working on that. This is our working model. We don't have any improvements so far about it. So, anyway, just to finish up the talk, I think that when you go to textbooks, type of representation of the giant. Type of representation of the JAG and StAT pathway, and I think that applies to any pathway that you signaling pathways that you actually see. You get this linear model where you have JAG1 and JAG1 activate a stat, a stat do something. But in two, I think everybody knows that this is an equilibrium type of model where all components of the pathway are competing with each other. And all the cytokines going to engage a given jack and a given stab because binary higher affinity changes in the concentration of the other components are completely going to. Component are completely going to shift the nature of the signaling power engaged by that cytokine and therefore change the responses. And I think that we have to move away from my cytokine activate this STAT, STAT1 or STAT3 or STAT5. And we have to start including my cytokine activate 20 molecule of STAT3 or 50 molecule of STAT3 or 100 molecule of STAT3. Because I do really believe that the number cells can count the number of star molecules. Can count the number of star molecules activated and define the response accordingly. And that's the way that a cytokine can distinguish an interleukin-10 from an interleukin-6 or an interleukin-6 from an interleukin-27. And in fact, if you look in disease context, and in this case, these lupus patients, they are often associated with inflammatory environment, like interferon gamma, and that's going to have a strong impact in the proteome of the cell. And particularly in this patient, you have a much higher... In this patient, you have much higher levels of style one and stat three, and what that's going to do is that when you put your cytokinine cells that have been in that context, you're going to get a stronger style one for fluoration and a stronger stat3 for folation. And that don't correlate linearly. So ultimately, what is happening is that you have a bias towards star 1 for folation by inteleuption 6 and interleukin 27. So depending on the cell context where the cell is found, your cytokine is going to engage different rates of stativation, which are going to find kimblis. Activation, which are going to find the responses accordingly. And with that, I'd like to finish by thanking the people that actually did the job. So, Stefan and Jonathan from my lab, and Pollyanne from Carnegie Lab, and of course, our collaborators and our funding. So, I'm happy to take any questions if you have any. Any question on Zoom or in the room? Zoom or in the room? I have a question. So, Anta. Uh, great talk, Ignacia. Thanks. Um, so could you clarify a little bit again, uh, going back to the IL-6 versus IL-27? Do I understand how the differences in STAT1 and STAT3 levels translate to even higher, even more dramatic differences in the G. Difference in the gene expression pattern between the two. Okay, so if I understood your question, would you want me to restate how do I think that Interlooking 27 can lead to different gene programs than Interlooking 6? Well, sort of. I mean, I'm trying to say, so if we look, if I look very naively at the STAT1 and STAT3 profiles, I can see how this can be explained by slightly different kinetic models of the receptor. Models of the receptor. But then I don't see how, from these relatively small differences in stat one and step three, you get these completely different gene profiles. So what we are seeing is that in every time point, there is no difference. So that small difference that we see in step one activation, if you look at gene programming induced at one hour, it's not enough to drive different gene programs. But when you start looking later in time, you start to see some genes, particularly IREF1 and some other. Particularly, IREF-1 and some other STAT1-dependent genes that are a little bit more sustained in the use by 27 than interleupin-6. So now you have two different points of divergences: the STAT1 for sphereulation and the IRF-1 protein in the cell. And those two combine produce a synergistic effect that allow 27 to induce a completely new set of genes after six hours of stimulation. Okay, I see. Thanks. Okay, so we write on time actually. Ellen has a question for me. Ellen has a question for me. Oh, Elene? Okay, Elene. Elene, maybe we'll ask a question by Elena. Sorry. I'm very interested in this project. This is a beautiful talk. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the header, the complementation of the different signaling pathways. And specifically, when you get your super high IL-6 agonists, you're never, is it true that you're still not crossing over into the IL-27 domain? You're still failing to activate IRF-1? Activate IRF1. Yeah, so no matter how strong interleukin-6 binds to the receptor and how stable is that complex, it will never induce a sustained STAT1 activation. The only way that we have seen to increase that is by putting a lot of STAT1 in the cell. So if you prime yourself with interferon gamma, you have a tenfold increase of STAT1 in that cell. And in that context, you start seeing a little bit more. Context, you start seeing a little bit more sustained stat 1 activation by Interlukin C. The only other way that we have been able to alter that is we get rid of STAT3. If you completely knock down STAT3, then Interlucking C takes STAT1 and drives a STAT1-dependent response. Okay, and are these really the only pathways activated by these receptors? Because I know the gamma-C cytokines often activate rasters as well, and that can complicate everything. Yeah, so that's that's been a personal war of vendetta of mine because I started my PhD working with interference and you have all these papers saying that interferion activate all these other pathways. So, you know, it's been 15 years trying to identify all these other pathways. And I have worked like with 10-15 cytokine in many different cells. And I have to tell you that very few cytokines activate any fuel jack understats. In the common gamma, a green interlooking tub, you have PS3. Green they're looking to what you have PF3 kinase and ERIC, but in our hands, six and 27 in human cells, or at least in human T cells or monocytes or B cells, we don't seem to detect those other pathways, at least you know, in 15, 20 minutes of attenuation, you go two or three days later, maybe, but in early time points, yeah, we don't seem to see them. Thank you so much, and good luck. Thank you. Okay, thanks a lot. So
