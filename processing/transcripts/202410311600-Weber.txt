Yes, thank you very much for the introduction. Thank you very much for the organizers for organizing this very nice workshop. So what I'm going to talk about are exosymmetry workers and this is a joint work with Anna Maria Osetoa from Arto and Elikolet, who you all know. So the setting is as follows. So we heard a lot of talks about 2D waves, water waves and 3D water waves. So this is somewhere in between. So, this is somewhere in between. Geometry in between, namely axisymmetric water waves. So, you should think about, say, a chat of water and surface waves on top of water propagating. So, we consider 3D, but with axis symmetry. So, we have a continuous symmetry in the system, so everything is, so to say, not dependent on the angle which I call theta. Theta. So for the vector field, of course, this means that in cylindrical coordinates, the respective components are independent of the angle. So I denote by upper indices r theta and z the respective components of the velocity field in this local coordinate system. And again, it's of course a free boundary problem, also the model domain. And the surface is given by a function eta. So this is. So this is a function here on top, and then you rotate it around the cylindrical axis to get the free surface. R is, of course, the standard R in cylindrical coordinates. And as usual, we have that the water is inviscid, incompressible, and has constant density, so the usual assumptions. And we are interested in the periodic settings, so we want to construct periodic waves where I call L. I call L the period. So and they are moving in the set direction, so the period is with respect to the coordinate set, which is maybe different from other talks where X or Y would be variable where everything is periodic. So as restoring forces, we only have surface tension and corresponding parameter sigma. So there's, so the reasons were because. So there's so the reason is because there's just no reasonable direction where gravity could act without destroying the symmetries of the problem. So we want to have periodic periodicity and axis symmetry, so there is no reasonable direction of gravity in which it could act without destroying the symmetries. So it could only act in the angular direction, but that's of course not possible. So we have Euler equations and as usual boundary conditions, kinematic and dynamic. Dynamic on the surface, and as I said, we're interested in traveling waves, say, moving to the right at a constant wave speed. So, concerning equations, we have seen already reformulations of the steady Euler equations and the steady water program in different versions, but maybe not all of you are familiar with the corresponding version in the axisymmetric case. So, in 2D, as we know, we get basically, if we introduce the string function, then we get a semi-linear elliptic equation for the string function where gamma corresponds to vorticity. And this basically follows from the fact that the vorticity is transported in 2D. Now, this is no longer true in 3D, but there is another one in the axisymmetric case leading or giving rise to a similar similar equation in the model. Similarly, the equation in the most general case. Which is, however, this is again one reason why, so to say, the axisymmetric problem is closer to 2D than to 3D, because in 3D you cannot find such a stream function and such a nice elliptic equation in the end, so to say. Okay, so how does this follow? And for you, some words on the derivation of the stream function and so it shows. Stream function and so it's Stokes stream function and the corresponding elliptic equation. So we get a stream function by using the incompressibility of the velocity field. If you write this in symmetry coordinates and use that the independence with respect to the angle, then you can, this is just a computation, it's just an identity. You can write this as this term here. So basically now we're in a two-day context again where this vector field here, RUR. Where this vector field here, RUR, RUZ is divergence free. So we can find a 2D stream function for this vector field here and recover the radial and the set component of the velocity field by a Stokes stream function. And so you get this additional factor of R here because you have this additional factor of R here. You can recover by this Stokes stream function psi the Z component and the radial component of the velocity. And then of course it's And then of course it's trivial that the Stokes stream function is constant along streamlines. But however to get a complete picture you need another quantity that is also preserved with the flow, which is here the angular momentum, or also called swirl. This is just because you have exit symmetry, continuous symmetry, and therefore a conservation law, which is here angular momentum is conserved. That angular momentum is conserved, which is R times the angular component of the velocity. And then, as you do in 2D, because vorticity is transported, then it makes sense to impose the global functional relation between vorticity and stream function. You do the same here for the angular momentum. So, you impose a priori this global relation that the angular momentum can be written as a function of the stream function psi. So, f can be anything. So f can be anything, but can be anything at first, but we choose it and then fix it and then study bifurcation pictures, so to say. We want to construct a solution for this fixed F. Okay, and then with psi and f, we basically have recovered all velocity components by these three formulas here. Okay, so this is kind of similar to the two-dimensional situation where also you can recover the velocity if you. Where also you can recover the velocity field from one scalar function. But fundamentally different to 3D. Okay, so the analog to kind of this semi-linear elliptic equation in 2D is the following, which is shown on this slide. How do you get this? So you have Bernoulli's law. So this local kinetic energy plus potential energy is constant along streamlines. So there is no gravity because as I said, So there is no gravity because, as I said, there is no gravity in the system. And this is a very general fact that we have already seen a couple of times this week, so I don't have to explain too much. So if you just take the gradient, then you see that it's velocity times vorticity, so transported. And then, so to say, this H is another, so additionally to the angle of. The angular momentum, also this h here, this Bernoulli function is transported with the flow. So, again, it makes sense to impose this global functional condition that h is in fact a function of the stream function. And for some reason, only its derivative will enter in the equation, so it makes sense to introduce this gamma, which is for it. Yeah, usually minus the derivative of h with respect to psi. Okay, and then if you take basically this line here again and insert the definitions how u can be recovered from psi and so on, then you end up with this line here. And of course you don't want to have that go stagnates or something like this, so you want that the spin parenthesis here vanishes and this is your PDE. Where instead of the Laplacian, you get here, the Laplacian corrected by some metric term that you, as you look at when you go to send your coordinates, so you generically get some coordinate-induced singularity here. And then on the right-hand side, you have some nonlinearity in terms of psi. And this equation, in fact, appears in many physical contexts. Factors appear in many physical contexts. So it's known as Higgs equation, Rykhauflan equations, square-long equation. Or it also appears, as we have already heard a couple of times, that there is correspondence of steady order to MHD. So if you're interested in MHD equilibria, that you axis symmetric, say, in a tokamach, then this equation also appears with some reinterpretation of gamma and f, and it's then called the Gratzho-Fanov equation in plasma physics. Okay, so this is a Okay, so this is so to say the equation that replaces this here in 2D. And I wrote here down the stream formulation, the full stream formulation. So the original steady equations are as usual, in ready condition. Then there's also an artificial boundary condition on the z-axis. So why I call it artificial. I mean in the end you of course only are interested in a 2D or z-plane, where you are the z-axis. RZ plane, where the Z axis is, so to say, an artificial boundary in this RZ plane, which is not a boundary, of course, if you consider the physical cylindrical three-dimensional domain. But the point is here that the velocity has to be also pointing in the z-axis at this length axis. And that gives you two boundary conditions for the stream functions. As usual, this has to be constant on the Functions as usual, this has to be constant on the surface, and it also has to be constant on the symmetry axis. And we normalize it such that it's zero on the symmetry axis. And that immediately yields a constraint on the choice of F because the angle momentum has to be zero at the cylinder axis if the velocity is continuous at the cylinder axis. And the dynamic boundary condition is as usual, you reform a. As usual, you reformulated using Bernoulli's law. So you got here the full velocity squared. Just rewrite the velocity squared in terms of psi, which is this here, and then minus sigma times the mean curvature, which I denote by gamma, kappa equals the Winnodi constant. Okay, so this is quite similar to many equations and that we have already seen in this week. In this week. Okay, so now the question is how to get solutions to this set of equations. And of course you have trivial solutions. Trivial solutions are solutions for the flat surface, meaning perfectly cylindrical domains. Flat cylinder. Then of course you can think, you can imagine that there is at some point some bifurcation. Points on bifurcation, so you have some small amplitude solutions here, where the amplitude is say order epsilon, and but the velocity, in fact, is of order one. This is like the classical way what you do in 2D and maybe also in 3D, that you perturb from a laminar flow with a flat surface. This is another one here. But actually, what we want to do here is, so this can also be done, but what we want to focus here in this talk is that you start somewhere else. Somewhere else at some other explicitly known family of solutions, where in fact the amplitude is not small, so it's of order one, but the velocity is small. So here this explicit solution, the velocity is zero, and if you want to perturb them to get a solution to the bottom wave problem, then the velocity is here for that. So it's kind of interesting that you have this kind. It's kind of interesting that you have this kind of structure here. Because usually you perturb from a flat surface and then get small amplitude solutions, and you can maybe continue to large amplitude solutions. Here you start already with large amplitude solutions with small velocity and then can try to continue down. Okay, before we come to that in more detail, let me just mention this slide here. Okay, maybe I want to say something here because some Some we are interested in this theory here: bifurcation from a flat surface. So, you this cannot happen for any choice of parameters because at the linear level there is this famous Rayleigh instability that causes the rupture of jets and the formation of droplets. This is basically just the reason why a water chip is dripping. And you can see this on the linear dispersion relation here in the irritational case, because it admits the magnetary. Because it admits imaginary solutions and therefore this corresponds to growing modes in the linearized time-dependent problem. And so, for example, if you were interested in solitary ways here, in the irritation case, they cannot exist by this very instability horizon. And that's why some people here in the room, Mark, Mark, Miriam, Doc, had a look at, or some people had a look at ferrofluids, where so to say some magnetic. Where, so to say, some magnetic effects kill this radiant stability and allow also for solid waves close to flat cylindrical. But I will not talk about ferrofluids. This is only water waves, so no magnetic effects at this point. Okay, so one comment about this coordinate singularity. So remember, in this semi-linear equation, there was this term here. Let's go ahead and do singularity 1 over R. How you can get around of this is the following. Use this chip going back to the knee from 80. You rather work with this function here, not with the original psi, but rather with this little psi, where you factor out r squared. And why does it make sense to factor out r squared? Basically, this is just the motivation here, because if you take the limit of capital psi divided by r squared, L'Abital inserted the. L'Obital inserts the definition of Uzbyte. So we get here a limit here. It's just up to some constant set component of the velocity at the symmetry axis. And the nice thing is, which goes back to me, this observation, is that for delipsi, you in fact get a Laplace equation, a standard Laplace equation, because if you compute this delta star of capital psi, then up to some factor of r, you can think of Some factor of R. You can think of the first term here as the four-dimensional Laplacian. So if you want to get rid of this coordinate-induced similarity, you can lift everything up to five-dimensional space and consider this little psi and search for solutions to little psi that are symmetric with respect to the first four coordinates. And because in the corresponding equation for limp psi, there's no singularity. For Limpsi, there's no singularity anymore. We call that the constraint, we call the constraint of f of 0, so in fact this 0 is not a singularity. Okay, this is just, if you wonder how to get rid of this one over r singularity, another way how to get rid of this and use some kind of abstract functionality setup is due to Mark and Dan. I think Dan will talk later more about this, so I refer to More about this, so I refer to this later talk then. Okay, so but we can just forget about this in the following. And the other general thing that I want to mention is the usual flattening, so which variables you choose and which fixed, which so to say, fixed the a priori unknown domain. So we use the naive flattening where you just scale by the height, eta, and search for solutions eta and sine with smat variables. And you, as usual for capillary problems, you directly have an elliptic structure in the equations because you can, the Bernoulli equation, the mean curvature you can think of in terms of regularity as a second derivative. So you can write the Bernoulli equation. So you move this eta set side to the left hand side and everything to the right hand side, everything else to the right hand side. And then the right hand side will be of low order. That's the elliptic structure coming from the mean curvature. Curvature and on the other hand, for the Higgs part, the interior part, you already have an elliptic structure, like an Laplacian basically, if you think in terms of take the highest order terms of, say, it's just a Laplacian. And this gives you ellipticity for psi. So this immediately gives rise to necessary compactness. So if you construct small solutions here or small solutions here, you can Here, you can immediately continue them to a global extended to a global continuum by this elliptic structure. Okay, so this is just a small side comet. Now, the more interesting thing is how to construct, or what are these explicitly known solutions here, and how to construct biofilm solutions here. And one observation in the axisymmetric problem is that you have explicit solutions with no With no flow at all, so where U is zero, or equivalently that psi is zero. Then, under the constraint gamma of zero zero, the equations just used to the fact that the mean curvature is constant. So everything else is just zero in the equations. So you're just left with the equation that the mean curvature is constant. And so this is a problem of a very well-known problem in geometry to classify constant. Geometry to classify surfaces of revolution of constant mean curvature. This goes back to Delaunay, 1841. And the so-called unduloids are surfaces that have constant mean curvature and are periodic. So here's like the formula, if you're interested in formulas, how you can construct or how you can write down explicitly a parametrization of this surface profile, but it's not so important. But it's not so important. More importantly, it's a picture. So what do you do? You take an ellipse. You take an ellipse. Then this ellipse has two foci here and here. And then you basically roll the ellipse along the z-axis. So you roll this to the right and to the left. To the right and to the left, and then you trace out the curve of this focus and the corresponding profile that you get, and then you rotate it around, then you rotate it around the axis. This will be your undweight, right? So you have ellipse, take one focus, roll the ellipse along this z-axis, trace out the focus, this gives you the corresponding surface profile that. Corresponding surface profile that corresponds to a constant mean curvature surface. And a well-known fact from geometry is that you can do this with any conic, not only an ellipse, but other conics which correspond to non-physical surfaces of revolution that are not physical for the water wave problem. Okay, so these are the explicit equations, not so important. I mean, it's in terms of elliptic integrals, as you would expect. Elliptic integrals, as you would expect, because you have an ellipse in the picture. Okay, the motivation for this work was actually a paper by Vandenberg Mino and Spirak, who computed irrotational axisymmetric water waves. And they found that, so you have here the broken curve is water waves with non-zero flow. And then they found that there is this curve touch. They found that this curve terminates at the static branch here of static solutions, so with no flow at all, and where the surface profile is exactly such an underload. So this they found out numerically. And basically what I'm going to tell you about is to put this onto firm analytical ground and improve the corresponding bifurcation result. Or in fact, it's not a bifurcation argument, rather, an implicit. Argument rather than implicit function argument. Okay, so basically you have a two-parameter family of explicitly known solutions. So you have here, so this here is your parameter C and this is your parameter A, which uh characterizes um this ellipse. So in fact you have here on this side you have actually a sheet of solutions parametered by uh A and C. By A and C. So here's something corresponding to A and C, say. And the thing is that you can connect a curve of solutions to any such point A and C and where the profile is no longer an ideal, but something cylindrical, and where the flow is then not zero. So you have really a solution, an interesting solution to the water wave problem. Okay, so ch some Okay, so j some uh some general effects. You can compute um the period L, so the period in terms of the z-axis. This is given as an explicit expression in terms of elliptic, complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. And now the point is you have here a two-dimensional sheet of ambuloids here, parametrized by two parameters. So you can only expect some So you can only expect some two kernel elements of the numerous problem and actually also a third kernel element due to a translation invariance of the problem. And as I said, we want to make use of an implicit function argument, so we have to kill these kernel elements somehow by fixing certain quantities. So the first thing is that you fix the period. Fix the period. So you're only Fix the period, so you only prescribe the period and then search for solutions, starting from an Android with this period and constructing solutions that have the same period. And so what you first encounter with what is not so nice is that the period depends on both A and C, so you rather want to work with other parameters, which where one is basically the period or the size, you can think of this, as the size of the underwood, and then the period is just given explicitly only in terms. Only in terms of the size parameter, and this other value is basically the shape, or also in one-to-one correspondence to the eccentricity of the ellipse, which is this guy here. And you can reparametrize this two-dimensional sheet, so to say. You use B and K instead of A and C. That's a straightforward computation that this is one-to-one mapping. And now we fix B, so to say, in this argument. Argument. Take any arbitrary V, fix this, and then construct solutions with this fixed V. The other thing is then this kills, so to say, one kernel element, but you also want to kill other kernel elements. And this is why you want to fix the Bernoulli constant. And so the Bernoulli constant is basically at the static on-door lead. It's minus sigma times the mean curvature. And the mean curvature is given in terms of B and K, like this here. So it's just one. Here. So it's just 1 for B dependence on B. This is just because mean curvature scales inversely proportional to size. The dependence on K is more important here. And the key property is in fact that this curvature is strictly monotone with respect to K, which you can see in this three-line proof here. So we basically only take, so we take the derivative with respect to K, and you know how K prime looks like in terms of E and K. K prime looks like in terms of E and K, and E prime looks like in terms of E and K. So these were completed with the integrals. And you also have a power series representation. So you just differentiate, you get this formula using these two equations here. And then for the denominator, you use this power series expressions. And then magically, I don't know if there's a deeper geometric reason for this. All of these coefficients in this power series have the same time. So it's very easy to conclude that we have this strict monotonicity here. We have this strict monotonicity here. Okay, and this basically gives everything that you want. So you can kill, so to say, all the kernel elements, or you can also think about the three parameters sheet. So you no longer use A and C, so the parameters of your ellipse, so to say, but you rather use the period and say the binotic constant as parameters parameterizing this I'm measuring this uh sheet of uh static underlies. And then you fix L, fix Q in your equations. And uh so so basically only one point here is a solution to this to this problem. And at this point you do an implicit function argument. So that's the thing. And how you do this implicit function argument, basically it's already set up. So you linearize around this unduit and static flow. And because the velocity appears squared in the Nulli equation. The velocity up here is squared in the New equation, you get a zero entry on the off-dyniagonal top right here. So, invertibility just reduces the invertibility of the two diagonal elements. So, this is just a linearized operator here, elliptic operator here. And okay, so this is just an assumption that this has not zero in its spectrum, which is of course generic because this depends on gamma prime of zero, f prime of zero, and prime of 0, F prime of 0 and L and Q so to say and analytically so this is a generic condition that 0 is not in the spectrum of this operator and it's for example always holds true in the irrotation case or more generally if gamma prime of 0 is less than 0 and f prime of 0 is 0. It's just some maximum principle. The more important thing is that A is invertible and in fact it's invertible on the space of even functions with this fixed period L. With this fixed period L. So, why is that? So, you basically take one and do it, this defining equation here. So, the left-hand side is, by the way, the mean curvature. It's been written in terms of the surface profile. And it's constant in Z, so constant mean curvature. And you can differentiate this with respect to Z and parameters P and K. Of course, if you differentiate with respect to Z, you get a Differentiate with respect to Z, you get a kernel element that's just translational invariance. But you kill this kernel element because you only restrict yourself to even solutions, as usual, in the water wave problem. Well, except Douglas told us something about asymmetric solutions, but we are interested in symmetric solutions. And if you differentiate this with respect to B and K, you get, again, this object relations here. So basically, this is. So basically, this is this A is just. This formula is not very important, it's just the linearized mean curvature operator, so to say. And from these two equations, you can combine to get the second kernel element of this OD over at A. And here the important thing is that you can divide by d kappa over dk, which we showed in the earlier slide that it's non zero. And the point is now here this the second kernel element, so this is a second order OD operator having two kernel elements here, so that's already the full kernel. So that's already the full kernel. And the point is here that this is even, so varying B and varying K doesn't change the evenness, but it's not periodic. Why is it not periodic? Well, varying K doesn't change the period because the period is basically only B. It's varying K doesn't change the period. But this year, because the P here is just L, or two pipe times L, variant B does change period, therefore this theta over the Therefore this d eta over dB is not periodic and therefore you have a current element which is even but not periodic and therefore also not in the space of even functions with fixed period. So in fact on this space here you have no kernel element and your linearized thing is invertible and therefore you can apply an implicit function theorem, in fact a global implicit function theorem because of the ecliptic structure that I explained earlier. And now it's time to start. And now it's time to stop. And in fact, I just started
