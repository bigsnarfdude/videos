Just one person. The basket for the gifts is on Iraq. You can pay by hand all of us with the service cards at the reception. Okay. So let's introduce Rigo Urban, who is going to be talking about all algebra of a regular non-commutative pool of carnal scan. Thank you very much, and I'm very good for it for. Very much, and I'm very grateful to the organizers for inviting me to this beautiful location and also for the possibility to give a talk. Um, well, to start with, let me recall a result everybody knows here in this audience. So, let K be a field, and I want to stress it, no further assumptions I made on it. And I consider in the category of In the category of coherent shifts of a projective line, the following vector bundle, which is well known to be tilting, and so it's endomorphism algebra well. Well, if one wish, one dualize is the pass algebra of the Kronecker quiva. And well, I think we know, of course, that in this setting we have a derived equivalence. And the point I want to make now is a certain application of this equivalent well, which is to buy premier limit reverse. By preliminary work of many authors and finalized by Olivia Schiffman and myself in 2012. And the statement is that this equivalence categorifies a well-known isomorphism in the theory of quantum affine algebras. So it categorifies the so-called backdringfeld isomorphism. Where on the one-hand side we have the quantization of the The loopalization of the quantum affine algebra of type SO2, and on the other hand, we have quantum affine algebra of SO2 head. And the method we use, so it applies theory of whole algebra. So, I will speak more about whole algebras in the last part of my talk, but maybe the point I want to make it now is the following. So, on the one-hand side, we have an equivalence, which is nowadays maybe the part of an undergraduate course in homological algebra. And this equivalence controls a fairly complicated isomorphism between two quite involved objects. Well, now. Well, now the question I would like to address in my talk is about generalizations of this result to other fine denkin types also. Well, and in the past also quite a lot of work was done in this direction, but the current difficulty is to go beyond of the cases of type ADE head. All right, so let me recall a little bit about LinkedIn types. So in this case, So, in this case, we talk about the type. Well, there are several notations, but it is the type A1 tilde. So the corresponding affine Dinken diagram is drawn like that. So there are two edges and two directions pointed at here. So I personally prefer to speak about Cartan matrices and the Cartanat. Matrices and the corresponding Cartan matrix is the following one, and the underlying hereditary algebra is the pass algebra of the chronic equipment. However, if we would like to speak about affine algebras in the full generality, so there are cases, well, which are not simply laced, and there are also affine diagrams which are. Also, a fine Linkin diagrams which are not extended Lincoln diagram. And in this case, Algebra SL2 hat has a twin brother. So, and I would like to speak about this browser in my talk. So, we have now four arrows, and one direction is indicated, and I like notation for this type A1 tilde prime, indicating the relationship. And now the Katana. And now the Catan matrix in this case is no longer symmetric, but has this form. So this Catan matrix define an affine algebra and one can quantize it. And now the question arises, so what should we write instead of H? And to write a replacement of H, we have to leave the world of algebraically closed field because we need Algebraically closed field because we need the field extension. So here, capital K is a field and the degree of the field extension is for. So actually, you see for here, that's why we write we need an extension of We need an extension of degree four, but of course, a natural question would be to ask: why do we take four and not three, not five? So I think the best evidence is provided by the following observation. So then we take this algebra H and pass to the algebraic closure. And I wish to assume, well, separability of this extension. Then What we get is the following algebra, and here we suddenly recover the pass algebra of a funding quiva of type D4 tilde. So the algebra H is kind of non-split version of De for tilde, so it's different. Tilde. So it's different. So its representation theory is controlled by a different root system, Sd4 tilde, but of course it's same. And it is algebra well we need to take here. So in general, so if we would like to speak to address my question, so on the algebra. My question. So, on the algebra side, we have to replace well, past algebra so affine quivas by so-called species of affine type. So, this theory was initiated by Pierre Gabriel and studied in a very detail, very intensively by Dlab and Ringer. So, I think all So, I think almost half a century ago. And well, the wish and the study of the arising categories is actually very long. So, we want to speak about such an equivalence. So, on the left-hand side, we have the derived category of hereditary algebra. Right category of hereditary algebra on the right-hand side we have something, and the question is: what is this something? So, an attempt to speak about that was the starting point for Helen Mutt Lensing to speak about weighted projective lines. But so now I would like to present so Present my perspective on this kind of categories and talk what is maybe the best way to think about X. So now a technical question arises. I'm not sure whether this blackboard is completely visible. So if not, so I need an assistance. So, but I would like you to recall the definition of the classical order. So a ring. A is a classical order. So if the following properties are satisfied, so first of all, there is a condition on the center of A, and I want the center to be an excellent reduced ring of cruel dimension one. So, a cover dimensional if you ask me what is the meaning of X and all, excellent. I'm not going to answer this question because my answer will not help. So, it's a condition. Condition. So the definition was introduced by Grotendik, and well, so the ring is an Assyrian, and the meaning is to exclude pathologies one can get. So for instance, it could happen that you have a reduced ring, local, you complete, and you get ill potentially. So some things are not going to happen if you wish ring to be excellent. And actually, it's very difficult. Difficult to construct examples of non-excellent rings. So, most rings in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry are excellent. So, please don't ask me about this. So, the extension, so A over R is going to be finite and I want A to be torsion free over R. Over R. And I also want to request a semi-simplicity of the rational whole. So, if I have a reduced ring, so I can take the corresponding total ring of fractions and the rational hull of. And the rational hull of A is required to be semi-simple. So, if this is all filled, so I speak about classical orders. So, and non-classical orders are not relevant for my talk. But of course, a discussion. So, Osamo smiles. Of course, a discussion starts. What should we impose if cross-dimension is higher? So, Sarah's definition of house land, so Osamo suggested deviations. So, deviations. So, but let us remain on this level. And I want to recall the following facts. And actually, I don't know due to whom is this result. So, if A is maximal, then maximal order is hereditary. And a hereditary order has the properties that it's The ordinary order has the property that its center is dedicated. So the result can be found in the book of Rainer on others, but maybe it's even older. So now let me globalize the setting from a fine case to the case of curves. And please do not object to my definition. To my definition. So, I wish to talk about non-commutative projective curves. So, a new committee projective curve is a ringet space bolt X. XA so where X is a projective curve which I require to be reduced and A is a shift of orders over the structure shift of A. So, this such might look like a bit restrictive, but I want to forbid nilpotence. So, I do not like them for my talk. And maybe it's because of my poor English that I have not found a better word for this more restrictive case of curves. Now. Now, so without loss of generality, I can impose a centrality. So I want that for any point x, all x is the center of my order. So if it is not the case, it can be achieved. So please don't bother about that. But now, well, let me introduce the next. Uh the next definition. So, in the title, there are several words which may be not familiar to anybody here. So, what I mean under regularity. So, X is regular. So, or hereditary. So, hereditary is kind of clearer. So, what I want to wish. So, I wish that. So I wish that the stock in the regular case is maximal and well hereditary, hereditary for all points my commutative scheme. Okay, so next, so I So I call a hereditary non-commutative projective curve X exceptional if it's got category of coherent shifts as a tilting object. So now I would like to comment why I insist on this condition of semi-simplicity, because, well, sometimes it's omitted, but I do not want to omit it. And the reason is that I wish to speak also in the non-commutative setting about the analog of Of the field of rational functions. So I say in this generality, so now let bolt f be the field of functions of my non-commutative my commutative kernel. So let's assume it's indeed the field. So let's It's indeed the field, so I wish irreducibility. So now I can define an invariant of my non-commutative curve, which is defined as a space of global sections of shifts ratiic rational hull of my sheaf of orders. So curly k is a sheaf of rational functions and. And what I get here on the assumptions I made is a central simple algebra. So it is a matrix algebra of some division ring dx. And so lambda x, so its class is equal to class of dx and And the Brawler group of my function field. So I have a field of transcendence degree one. I can speak about its Brawer group. So Brauer group is the group whose elements are Merita classes of central simple algebras and then the product. And then the product gives a group structure. But merit equivalence is important to impose. So, having a non-commutative curve, I have an element in the Brauer group. And well, the perspective of Brauer groups is one point I would like to promote in my talk. Now, let me state your results. So, it's not one theorem, but a lot of theorems. So, to begin with, I would like to start with a commutative statement, recalling you that whatever our base field small k is, a smooth projective curve over field k is uniquely determined by its field of rational functions. So, the category of fields of transcendence degree one over k is anti-equivalent to the category of projective curves. And this statement, so absolutely classical statement. Absolutely classical statement has a beautiful generalization on non-commutative world. And well, as I discovered at the beginning of this year, so it is for the first time due to Artin and the Young. So an absolutely nice result, actually not so difficult to show, but still of high aesthetics, is the following: that whenever we fix our We fix our smooth projective curve x, commutative one. We would like to understand possible regular non-commutative curves with the central curve x. And it turns out that such curves It turns out that such curves are in bijection with elements of the Brauer group. So if I have a curve, I attach to it the corresponding Brauer class. So, one precision is necessary to make. When I speak about Make when I speak about non-commutative curves, the right notion of equivalence is the Morita equivalence. So, what is not surprising at all? So, I do not want to distinguish between lambda x and dx. And actually, the notion of isomorphisms in the sense of ring spaces seems to be a wrong one. So, for non-commutative schemes. Commutative schemes. So it is well, I think, nice result showing actually the role of the Brower group and also explaining what is going on in this situation. Well, you consider the category of coherent shifts. Consider the category of coherent shifts or quasi-coherent shifts, if you wish. So, two categories are equivalent if and only if the corresponding Brauer classes are the same. Well, but now another statement, which is a classical result due to 10. And actually, I would bet it is from Certis. So So, if you have an algebraically closed field, then it turns out that the Brauer group is simply zero. Which means that any commutative curve, so any regular non-commutative curve Is actually commutative. Well, actually, because of the result two and result three, I think well, the terminology is warranted. So, such curves deserve to be called regular. Well, but now. Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you can create commit non-commutativity if you need it. Yeah, right. But now what happens if k is not algebraically closed? So and skipping this assumption is not just a technical thing, so it really leads to something new. So I now would like to stay another classical result from algebraic numbers theory due to Hausser. Number theory due to HASA. And of major interest today for me is the case of the finite field. And to state HASA's result, let me first recall you what is happening with the Brauer group of the field of formal Lorentz power series. So Brauer has a proof that there is a very special isomorphism. That there is a very special isomorphism called index, and the Brouwer group is Q modulo Z. And to give you maybe a better feeling of what is going on, so let me say now that here there is a special element, so the class of one half. And the class of one half corresponds to something unique here, and this something unique is This is something unique is a unique Cotonian algebra over this field of formal Lorentz power series. Well, and this is algebra. So, I think everybody heard about Hamilton quaternions over reals, but well, quaternions exist. quaternions exist and are important of arbitrary fields and here is definition so like for Hamilton quaternions but here well I have to pick up element in the field k which is not in the square of k g square is equal to t is the parameter Equal to t, t is the parameter. So it is a Cotonian algebra, and I have also to add that the choice of A is irrelevant. So different choices of A lead to isomorphic algebras. And now the second part of Hasse's theorem characterizes the Brauer group of the function field. So it's Hasse, Has in something different. So the Brauer group of F So the Brawer group of F sits in a short exact sequence. And I sum overall points of my curve of X, meant in scheme theoretic sense. I take completions of my field and I map to Q model Z and the map. And the map here is expressed in terms of the local maps of indices. So elements here are tuples, finitely many of them are non-zero, and the sum of indices is mapped to Q modulo Z. So if the tuple is chosen in such a way that the class of the sum is zero, then I get. Of the sum is zero, then I get an element of the Brouwer group, and it's a very well, I will think about the Brouwer group now. And now, well, we want tilting. So, the conference is about silting. So, there will be no silting in my talk, but tilting is a partial case of silting. So, all right, so it's statement number. So it's statement number four. And well, the theory of exceptional non-commutative curves was initiated by Helmut Lensing, well, in another language, and continued by his student, Jorg Cussin. And one result said that if we have an exceptional curve Then the central curve X has genus zero. So I'm not saying it is a projective line because of arbitrary fields, we could have a Brouwer-Severic curve. So for instance, over reals, we can have x square plus y square plus z square equal to zero, which is also has to be taken into account. But if we say We say, ah, so what is a weighted projective line in this language? So a vector projective line occurs. So if X is indeed a projective line, but the invariant, so the class of lambda Yes, zero in the brower group with the following consequence. So if my field is algebraically closed, then firstly we do not have browser severity curves. So any curve of genus zero is a projective line, but also by the theorem of 10, the We have a trivial Brauer group, which leads to a conclusion that exceptional curves are just weighted projective lines. So, it was not, of course, the primary definition of Geigel and Lansing, but it's a restatement. And well, the appearance of the Brawler grew. And well, the appearance of the Brauer group, I think it actually explains what's going on. Algebraically closed field definitions are equivalent, but in general, not. So now, so I still have not addressed the question about existence of tilting or regular curves and So, in my series of results, it is the last one in the final form due to Dirk Kusian, whose proof is heavily based on an unpublished work of Artin and De Jong. And of most interest for me today is the case of a finite field. So now So now, so there are no Brauer-Severic curves of the finite fields as well. So let me now take a ringed space which is regular, meaning that A is a sheaf of maximal orders. So now, well, there are non-trivial choices for A. And the question is now when When a well, when x is exceptional. So I told you that any regular curve has corresponding Brauer class. And this Brouwer class knows everything about the curve. So I have to say, so which classes lead to curves admitting tilting. And it turns out that. And it turns out that X is exceptional in the following two cases. So the situation is very restrictive. The first case is that the Brower class has the following shape. There are only non-true, only two non-trivial entries. So some fraction. So, some fraction and another fraction. So, when I write this tuple, I mean, well, an element of the middle term of my short exact sequence. And I also have to say the non-trivial classes of non-trivial fractions leave. So, over zero and infinity. zero and infinity. So it's one possibility for x to be exceptional, and there is only one alternative, which is the following one. So I have one half, so fractions are no longer arbitrary. So everywhere else are zeros, and there is also one half at another. Also, one half at another place. But now, so where these classes live, so one class leaves at infinity and another class leaves at the point of degree two. Uh so Chiao Tung. So tilting occurs only in these two cases. And well, there were some other words in my title. So the terminology is due to Artin and the Jong. So the first case was called ruled. And the second case was called half-ruled. And I decided to follow the terminology of inventors when speaking about this object. Well, so here is the result. And I must say, so when I first read it in the paper of Dirkusin, I was had an opinion for quite a few days there was a mistake. And I can tell you why I think it's very surprising. So whatever we take here, we can go to the algebraic closure. And the algebraic closure of that is a weighted projective line admitted. Is a weighted projective line admitting tilting. And there are a lot of types which can occur. But now the outcome is that for all other cases of eta, so we have a geometric object without tilting over small k, but with tilting when we go to the algebraic closure. And for me, it was completely counterintuitive that, well, there is such a constraint. There is such a constraint. But well, now I would like to come closer to whole algebras and to applications. Well, first of all, so I was convinced by the proof of Artin and De Jonk. But secondly, I realized there is an algebraic counterpart of this, which was even earlier, which is due to Ringel when. When we classify algebras with separating families of simple tubes, and well it's actually well a mirror statement if one wishes. And Klaus Ringl basically discovered some similar pattern without any geometric intuition, which I found really well astonishing. So, but whatever, well, whatever case we take, so. Take so the category of coherent shifts. Well, well, so there is a separation into vector bundles and torsion shifts. So I pay special attention to the half-rolled case now. So in the half-rolled case, so we have two parameters, one-half and then one-half, and the corresponding, well. Well, Brauer class defines an algebra which is quaternion algebra. So unlike over reals over K of T, there are many quaternion algebras and the one I'm talking about is specified by this local data. Specified by this local data. And in the half-world case, so slightly differently to the case of a projective line, we have indecomposable objects of rank one and rank two. So let me draw you the Auslanderite enquiva of indecomposables. So L0 is a structure shift. Then in this category, we have Auslanderite and translation. So L minus I is tau power I of L 0 for any I. So we have an almost split sequence Well, and now, so actually, the key point is that these neighbors form a tilting, well, tilting object. F L0 plus M0 is tilting, and then the corresponding tilted algebra. Well, this is the algebra I actually wanted to have. So this ring of matrices with field extension of degree four. Okay. So in general, in general, so what is going to be the tilted algebra? Tilted algebra of a regular non-commutative curve. So, actually, something similar, and this something similar was classified by Ringley. So, Ringle introduced the notion of a tain by module. So, if we have a regular non-commutative curve, so then torsion shifts live in simple tubes, and it is often in the tilted algebra, so we have only homogeneous tubes and. And well, the class of arising culture process is very restrictive. It's what Klaus Ringel figured out, and what's going on is compatible with his classification. Well, but now let me state the final thing. So I have 10 more minutes, right? Because, well, one application Well, one application one has, well, so this for this kind of homological algebra concerns quantum affine algebras. And the main, so everything what was told before, well, it's maybe resetting of known results. So in, well, this language. But this result is new and is due to Heike Herr, a student of mine. A student of mine, like myself, saying that this equivalence. So now X well is a special case, so half-ruled non-commutative regular curves. So it categorifies. Well, some isomorphism between two realizations of the same quantum affine algebra. So, Derenfilter realization of affine algebra of time A1 tilde prime. So now I have to tell you how the routine works. So, and I have to start my story with giving a short definition of the whole algebra. So, one can speak about whole algebras in a greater generality, but A generality, but the nicer theory is if we start with a hereditary x finite category over finite field K and by results of Klaus Ringel and Green. So, when I can attach to H an associative algebra U of H, well, which is so-called topological by algebra. So, if H is a Length category, then U of H is a Hof algebra. But if not, so and if it's a category of coherent shifts on the hereditary curve. On the hereditary curve, then the topological Bill algebra is the right replacement, which still allows theory to work. So I will recall you only the algebra structure of U of H. So to do it, so I take square root of Q and consider the corresponding Consider the corresponding field extension of rationals. Now the whole algebra of H is an algebra having a distinguished basis, and this distinguished basis is given by the isomorphism classes of objects. So, whole algebra is an associative algebra over Q tilde. It has a distinguished basis. And, well, following the definition of Ringl, so one has to explain how to multiply two basic elements. So, there is a formula. So, I take V power the Euler form of M and N, and then a sum of And then a sum over all k so and I also have to tell you what is the structure coefficient. So the structure coefficient FKMN actually counts short exact sequences starting at n, ending at m and with the middle term k. So formally it's a cardinality The cardinality of the set of maps from N to K whereco kernel of I is isomorphic to M. Well, and then when I count monomorphism, actually, I'm not out equivalence.
