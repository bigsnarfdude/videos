There's a project that I'm working with Jason. We're looking at broken sheet diagrams, but possibly what you're projecting down has boundaries, so like a doctor boards. And to do that is formals, which may make sense why I was working with Jason. In the top right, click the three dots by the printer sign, and you see sit. I'm a grad student at Lucy Davis. So just to, so we're on the same page, so what I mean So, we're on the same page. So, what I mean by a surface diagram is: so, take a closed surface in four-space, just like a knot, and you project down to get a diagram. You can project down generically the surface into three-space. And you'll see the singularity, you'll see double-point curves, you'll see triple points, and then you'll see orange points. So, if you give it breakings, like you do for a crossing with the nine, you can then tell how to go lift. So, if you have a broken sheet diagram, Broken sheet diagram and the breaking of the sheets tell you how to get to a surface knot that then projects down. I do want to say what's interesting, one fact that I like, is if you have a generic general position S2 in a plane, you can always find a knot that projects down to that. But it's not the case that if you are studying generic closed surfaces in three-space, that there are some, like Boy's surface, which is an immersion of. Surface, which is an immersion of RP2, and you can that there is no embedding into there's no surface knot that projects down to that. And you can see that quickly because in the diagram of a surface knot, here the sum of the branch points, the sine sum, so the branch points will be positive and negative. The sine sum is the normal Euler number, the self-intersection number of the surface knot that it represents. In RP2, Represents. In RP2, that number is either 2 or minus 2. So an immersion would have no branch points, so that kind of contradicts. So voice surface is an example where you can't give it a broken sheet structure. Just like classical knot diagrams that have Leidemeister moves, these diagrams, these surface diagrams, have Roseman moves. And any two diagrams that are Roseman equivalent represent the same surface dot when you lift it up. Okay, so this the tool we'd like to use to generate lower bounds, I'll say what we want lower bounds for. Well, we want lower bounds on the number of triple points, and quandals have been used to do this. So I want to describe what a quantal coloring is. So think about three coloring. So three coloring is a type of quandal coloring, except when you were three coloring, you didn't care, there was no You didn't care, there was no need for an orientation. So the three coloring is just for unoriented links. So, what is different here is that I'd like to have some orientation and it gives me a normal and it's telling me a direction. So, a coloring is, so a quandal is just a set, and a coloring is a choice of each arc. I'm going to define it for the classical sense, but you can see I'm just going to like times I, and it's the same setup, but I assign each arc an element, a color. Element, a color, and then I need to make sure around each crossing that this satisfies, that following the orientation AB, and then this should be A times B. So I purposely didn't tell you what is a quandal yet because I'd like to motivate it. If this is the rule that I have, I'd like to say what should I have the operation, what axiom should the operation satisfy so that it's invariant under Reidemeister 2. So if I had a Reidemeister 1. Write a mystery one and say I colored this here. At this crossing, I would see my A is an x, my b is an x, so then this should be x times x. I'd like it to be invariant under a Reitemeister one move. I would want this operation, every element is item home. I want x times x to always equal x. I want x times x to always equal x, so that after I do my right-handweister move, my limit colors are the same. So that should be one axiom of what a quantum should do. It should be idempotent. Every time you multiply by yourself, you get the same thing out. Another one that's, so the Reinmeister 2 is also easy enough to draw. Yeah. Well, that's a part of my telling it. You just ignore it, and I'll come look at it. Okay. Okay. Oh, and this is the drawing time, too. Oh okay, I'll just continue. Just keep going in. Okay, so right in my stir two, I color this arc Y and I color this arc X. One thing that I would like to know that if I were to go this way, That if I were to go this way, well, I certainly would like to know that there exists a color here that I can choose. So I want to know that there exists a Z here that makes this satisfied. And then I would like to know that it's unique. So if I were to start with this picture and poke it through, there's just one color that uniquely extends that. So I picked this one color. So therefore, I can White point is tributary, so it distributes over itself. And if you look at it by a bunch of trees, just like it did here, it makes sense. This on This object started to soak E-I-K, which is end coloring. You need with that, so three coloring, end coloring. That is if instead I had this axiom I replaced it with this one. And a K is something that doesn't care about the orientation. And what this axiom is telling me is if I look from left to right or right to left, the same, if one works, the other one works as well. So a quadruple is a way to So a clausal is a way to color that it that needs an orientation, and perhaps it's more specific than if I had just a three color. If I erase the first axiom, I get what's called the rack Lawrence and Sanderson step here, where it's rack photomology, and later Joyce and Matie were the ones kind of at the same time who used it quadruple. And the associated group of a fundamental particle is the fundamental group. A group of A group under the operation of conjugation forms a quantile. This one is the end coloring, but this one has a kind of a nice geometric picture of what's going on. So when you're doing n coloring, you say that the colors of the under arcs, their sum should be twice that of the other, of the over arc mod n for n coloring. One way to see this is if I'd like to create a multiplication table and I'd like to figure Table and I'd like to figure out what 5 times 4 is in my dihedral quantal order 6. I can take a regular hexagon, the second coordinate or the second term in the product, I draw a line that goes through the center, and then I reflect the first term across that line. So you can kind of see this involution. So this, it is called a dihedral quandal, but it is also just a K. Here is an example of how you would, or here's an example of one way to visualize what a broken sheet diagram would look like. Because, like I said before, the diagram itself kind of blocks what's going on on the inside. So, this, you glue this end to that end, and what you're looking at is the singular set. So, the singular set is the double-point curves, the triple points, and the branch points. That forms a graph that has. That forms a graph that has six valent vertices, which are the triple points, and then branch points are one valent. So that's what this picture is. Except, so you can kind of see how I'm going from there. I can, there's this, it kind of commutes. I can take, if I'm going to create a diagram for the twist spun or the spun knot, you can first project the tangle down and then rotate that in three space, and that would give you. In three space, and that would give you a diagram of the twist spin. Or you can twist, or you can spin it in four dimensions and get an embedding, and then project it down, and you'll get the same diagram. But you color them. This, in order to see what's going on the inside, they deleted these gray parts. So you're looking at just a neighborhood of the singular set, and it just tells you kind of how the double point curves are colored. Jason and I both really like this picture, but we agreed that it's very hard to see. Agreed that it's very hard to see. Apparently, the only thing that's missing are discs. So you glue in these colored discs, and then that's your diagram. But your sheets could have genus, so it's not clear just from looking at it that that doesn't happen. Okay. To enhance the invariant, to make it a little stronger, so right now there is an invariant of the number of colorings. So three coloring, if you can find one non-trivial three-color, you know that there's more than just the trivial coloring. So the number of them must be. So, the number of them must be more than, say, for the unknown. So, the tray falls not the unknowns. You can make this a little stronger. I decided not to talk about what condyl cohomology is. It's fairly, it's not as difficult as it may sound, but the chain groups are fairly straightforward. They're free abelian groups on your Cartesian product, and then you have some differential that makes it so all of the quantile operations work well. But there is for each quantile. But there is for each quandule, there are, with the choice of an abelian group, there are cohomology groups, and the co-cycles from those turn out to be very useful to define an invariant. And that invariant is the co-cycle invariant. On my broken sheet diagram, that's colored. I look at each triple point, and at each triple point, there is one of the eight regions that all of the arrows are pointing away from, and that is called. Pointing away from, and that is called the specified region. And that may, so here would be an example where my these are my specified regions. So this one's here and the other one's on the back. And it depends then if the crossing is positive or negative. So I take a co-cycle which eats quartile colors. And I look at each triple point at the specified region, and I fill in the lowest color, the middle color, and the top color. Color than the top color, and then that gives me some number, it gives me some abelian group element. That is a weight that I assign to the triple point, and it's based upon the coloring I have. So I do that, and I weight each triple point, and then that gives me a weight for the diagram. And that is this WF. So the way that you would write this is: say your weights are written multiplicatively. That's first you do the product. That's first you do the product, and then you sum over each coloring. So I color it, I figure out the weight, I sum up over the triple points, it gives me a number, and then I check the next possible coloring and the next one, and then all together that information tells me, so either as a multi-set or as this kind of group green looking thing, it'll tell me an invariant. Any questions? So these are the authors that The authors that Anthony mentioned, but Carter, Kamada, Lankford, they're the ones who wrote the co-cycle invariant in an application for surface knots and also just classical knots. Here's an example where you three color and I take the two twist spun trifoil and I check all of its three colorings and then this is some co-cycle and I look at all the triple points and that will give me a weight. So if I have the Weight. So if I have the two-twist spun trifoil, this is telling me that I have nine three colorings. The zeros are saying that three of them have trivial weight with this specific co-cycle. The other ones have one and two. And this distinguishes the two-twist spun trifoil from its orientation reverse. If you're looking at classical knots, you would use a quandal two-co-cycle, so you would just feed it the two colors of a crossing, and that you can detect. That you can detect the right hand from the left hand tray foil. So, those are two applications of what it can do. And then I have one more that is the last background information that it's also been good to detect or to try to calculate the triple point number. So the triple point number is analogous to the crossing number of classical loads. How many, what's the minimal amount of these zero-dimensional points that I Zero-dimensional points that I have in any diagram that represents it. The triple point number is kind of interesting. It's known not to be additive. So there's that example where you have a knotted, a VRO, you have a knotted S2, and you connect some with an unknotted RP2, connected some, and then it unknots it. So you can imagine that that's kind of odd, and the triple point number, therefore, is not additive from that example. I took these two results to kind of cook up. Two results to kind of cook up a narrative of how quandils are being used and then how Jason and I are expanding on it. So these two results, well you can kind of tell that this co-cyclone variant is combinatorial. And what they did is they said if you had one triple point, if you had two, and they checked all the cases. So to get a lower bound of four was pretty difficult. And then to bump that up, there's just, seems like. Just seems like emotionally exponentially getting harder. That if you would like to then get a lower bound using this method that is greater than eight, it would be very difficult. So my point is that quandyls, it was recent that Kamada and Oshiro found a way to use quandyls so that you can get lower bounds that go off to infinity. Okay. So, what Jason, the objects that Jason and I are thinking about are. And the objects that Jason and I are thinking about are these broken sheet diagrams of not comportism. So here's a trivial one. So the non-trivial ones, triple points, it was a little too hard to draw. So I was thinking, you know, maybe just a trivial one. And then the proof that the quantal co-cycle invariant is an invariant is that it's invariant under Rosemann moves. So you can do Roseman moves in here, and it lifts up to isotopic concordance. Concordances, concordances. The problem is that the Roseman moves, you're not allowed to change the boundary at the top and the bottom. So it's like as if you are fixing a projection direction. So we have examples where if you project the chordism of concordance down this way, it gives you some invariant that is different if you projected it this way, even though they lift to isotopic things. So instead, the way that we're thinking about it is: so think just in terms of diagrams, if you give me In terms of diagrams, if you give me this trayfoil diagram and then give me a list of Reidemeister moves and maybe some pinched moves and saddle moves, and then I can build this diagram. So you need this Rosetta stone that tells you how do I go from motion picture and Reidemeister moves to the broken sheet diagram. So if I have a Reid of Meister 1 and I trace that out so that the motion, the time of the Reid of Meister move is now the height of it, Reidemeister 1 gives me a branch point. Reidemeister 1 gives me a branch point, and then Reidemeister 3 gives me the triple point. So since the quandal co-cycle invariant is defined for triple points, the Reidemeister 3 moves or what I can say something about in correspondence too. So we're looking at how many R3 moves do you need to unlink trivial link diagrams? So we have some families, and here are some kind of easier ones to see. I'll just say, let's say like this one right here. Say, let's say, like this one right here. So, it seems like all you need to do is you take this component and you drag it out, or maybe each of these figure A's you slide off, and each one of those contributes a Reid of Meister 3 move. So that is going to give you a triple point in this diagram that you're tracing out. And we found that we can get the co-cycle invariant to go up to infinity in a nice way. So, the lemma that they have is: say your weights are 0, 1, or minus 1, and you're One and your total weight is five. You couldn't have had six triple points because you couldn't make it past, you need as many triple points. You couldn't have had four? Five triple points the way to spot. Oh, right, right, right, right. Sorry, yeah, lower bound. You want the lower bound, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this leaves me, so that last diagram that I explained, if you, you know, imagine the diagram you get, that was my abstract. So that was. So that was, you slide off each of those figure eights, that gives you these blue ones. I peeled this forward so you can see, but it's truly like a bunch of diagram stacks, so it's R2 cross I. But I peeled it forward, so there's triple points in here. Quandals tell you that they're essential in the sense that any link concordance to a trivial diagram must have at least that. Must have at least that many triple points in it. So that means that you need that many R3 moves, and then since this is an example, that's a sharp bound. All right, that's all I have. Questions? So, I have a question about the triple G's in these diagrams. So, like, when you have So, like when you have an ordinary point where the sheet passes through its outbreak point, so the surface that has the gap in it, presumably you're pushing that portion of surface into the past as opposed to where you define the projection. Yeah, I guess I didn't say how you get so like it's like an orthogonal projection, and at a triple point there's three sheets that meet. And if you look how those three sheets lift back, there's like one's lower, one's There's like one's lower, one's in the middle, one's high. So, how like how what you do? Like, you do you have to fix some sort of convention, or is there some like nice way of uniquely assigning the order to the different sheets through the triple point just based on the diagram? Oh, oh, like if I if you have a Reidemeister 3. Yeah. Yeah, and then how, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, I guess I didn't try it. Um, yeah, I guess I'm imagining, like, if you, so if you have. I guess I'm imagining, like, if you, so if you have whatever is the lowest arc is becomes the lowest sheet. So if you have a crossing here and your Weida Meister move is going to be from an arc that is underneath them, that will trace out the bottom sheet. But if the arc is on top, it'll trace out the top sheet. But then for like just a generic broken surface diagram, where like you don't know where it came from necessarily. Just to make you just see more of the picture. Can you show us on the next slide the triple point picture? Sorry, I mean just the previous. Oh, sorry, I mean just the previous slide. Oh, it's one of the catches. The one that's most broken up is the bottom. I got it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I should have said that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the way that it's written is that one sheet is broken up into four chunks, and that's the lowest one, and then the middle, and then the top sheet is not broken. Yeah. Another question. So um is triple point number known to be non-additive if you are only looking at orientables? Yeah, I've wondered that. I don't know. So no, it's not known whether or not that, yeah, I've wondered that. I guess the other question was like, could you use what you're doing to like show that certain like loops of isotope are non-trivial or something like that? Like, by saying that like the triple play number is Like loops of isotopes of like clusters. So specific, not like you start with a two-star diagram and not. Oh, right. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, no, no, no, you go for it. Oh, yeah, right, yeah, sure. And then it's great. Well, I don't know that Ethereum Ethereum has been adapted, especially not just one, but that's a good idea. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. The thing about what Nicholas talked about today is that it's really sensitive to which diagrams you're playing. Did you hear his first question? That if you only restrict to orientable, is it then additive under connect sum? I know it's not known. Thank you.
