Thank you for the introduction and thank you for the invitation to speak. Before I get started, I should mention this is joint work with Holly Krieger, Nicole Looper, and Mirto Mavraki. So first, just some setup and motivation. Throughout this talk, K will be a number field. S is going to be a finite set of places of K, including all Archimedean places. And OS denotes the ring of S. OS denotes the ring of S integers of K. As you probably glean from the title, this is going to be motivated by the Sheforavich conjecture, which was proven by Faltings, which says that there are only finitely many K-isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian varieties defined over K of a given dimension and having good reduction at all primes outside of S. So, the motivating question for this talk. The motivating question for this talk is: Is there a dynamical analog of the Schaferavich conjecture proven by Faulting's? Okay, so just like in the Faulting's conjecture, what we want to say is something like there are finitely many dynamical systems up to isomorphism, which have good reduction outside of S. Okay, so first we need some definitions to set this up. Amorphism F defined. A morphism F defined of Pn defined over a number field K is said to have good reduction outside of S if there exists an OS morphism of Pn whose generic fiber is PGL conjugate to S. This is a really fancy way to say kind of what you'd expect good reduction to mean. So if you don't like this definition, just think of good reduction as for rational matters. For rational maps, as meaning if I take my equations for my morphism and I reduce mod a prime, as long as I maintain the degree and I have good reduction. So for example, this map xy goes to p x squared y squared has good reduction outside of s as long as the prime p is one of our elements of the set s. With this definition, we want to notice first that if f Notice first, that if F is a map of good reduction outside S, and we take any element phi from PGL N plus 1 of O and conjugate S by that element of PGL, then the result also has good reduction outside of S. So good reduction is maintained by this action of PGL. Okay, so our first naive shot at trying to prove a finite number. Shot at trying to prove a finiteness, Sheparavish finiteness theorem for dynamical systems might look like this. For a given number field K, dimension N, degree D, and set S of primes, can we say that there are finitely many PGL conjugacy classes of morphisms of Pn defined over K, which have good reduction outside of S. Unfortunately, the answer to this question. Unfortunately, the answer to this question is no. For example, I can just look at over P1 the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients. That's going to, or with the monic polynomials specifically, sorry, with integer coefficients, that's going to have good reduction outside of S as long as the place, the archimedean place, the place at infinity is in S. And we assumed from the beginning that the Archimedean places are always in our set. Places are always in our set. But unfortunately, there are infinitely many distinct PGL2 of K bar conjugacy classes of polynomials. And so this most naive version of dynamical Sheffievich fails. So we need to do something else. All is not lost, though. We're just going to add some more structure, which is actually natural, because if you think about the original Sheffieldish conjecture, it's discussing abelian varieties, and an abelian variety is. Varieties and an abelian variety is really a variety together with a marked point, and without that marked point, the Chevrovich conjecture would be false. So it's natural to add some level structure to our dynamical system in order to prove a finiteness result. Okay, there's a lot on this slide. Bear with me for a second. All we're doing on this slide is defining good reduction of a set, and specifically we're working. Of a set. And specifically, we're working in P1 here. The first definition is just going to be the reduction of a set mod P. So we want to define what it means to reduce a set modulo prime. And then after that, we can talk about what it would mean to have good reduction. So first, what's the reduction of a point mod P? Oh, sorry, I guess. So in the first definition here, I'm defining the reduction of a point in Pn for any N, and then we'll talk about just the P1 case in the second definition. P1 case and the second definition. So, this definition, this first definition we're going to use throughout the talk. If I take any point in Pn, I can write that coordinate-wise. And then if I normalize my coordinates so that they're all p integers and at least one is a p-adic unit, then I can define the reduction of a point as just the reduction of each of the coordinates mod p. So exactly what you would expect. Now, moving on to a set, if I take a subset of If I take a subset of Pn, then I'm going to define the reduction of that set as just the reduction of each of the points in the set. Okay, so that's how we reduce a set mod P. And now the second definition here is what it means to have good reduction. So in this definition, we're going to assume that X is a subset of P1 of K bar, which is Galois invariant. Then we'll define X to have good reduction outside of S. Reduction outside of S if every for every prime p outside of s and every prime capital P lying above that in the field of definition of our points, this reduction map is injective. So none of our points are going to collide mod P. Okay, so that's what we mean to have good reduction for a set. We've already defined good reduction for a map. And then to get some. And to get some Shefrovich finiteness theorem, we're going to define these good reduction triples. So, what we have is a morphism F of degree D. Again, we're still working with any in dimension one here. Then we're going to take sets Y and X defined as follows. So, Y will be a finite set. X is going to be the union of Y. Going to be the union of y and the image of y under the map. This is just so we have some kind of nice dynamical behavior to work with here. And we're going to assume that x is Galois invariant. And then to be one of these triples of good reduction, we're going to assume that f and x each have good reduction outside of s. And I'm also, to get the finiteness, going to restrict sort of say something about the size of our sets. So we're restricting. Size of our sets. So we're restricting essentially either the size of y is n, or we're taking really ramification of these points into consideration. And then we're defining n is going to be the sum of the ramification indices of each of the points in our stat Y. So I'm going to write this fancy GR, superscript one to represent the dimension, subscript D to represent the degree of my maps, N is this sum of our images. Is this sum of our ramification indices, and this is going to be on these Gauan variant sets over K, and our set S of primes is fixed. Okay, so we want to know, are there going to be finitely many conjugacy classes of these good reduction sets when we act by elements of PGL2 of OS? So, first let's So first, let's just notice we do have an action of PGL2 on this set given by I take my morphism F and I conjugate by any phi and then the pre-image of Y and the pre-image of X to make all of this stuff well defined. So kind of the natural thing you want to do for a dynamical system. Okay, so with all of this set up, Silverman in his paper, in a paper in 2017, In a paper in 2017, proved that as long as n is large enough, namely greater than or equal to 2d plus 1, then we do get finitely many isomorphism classes of our dynamical systems. I want to mention before we move on, we're not going to say much about this, that other definitions of good reduction and finiteness theorems were explored in other papers, including more including papers by Morn. Yeah, including papers by Mauren Silverman, Pesci Stout, Spiro Tucker, Spiro Tucker, and West, and other things. So there's other papers too. So if you want to see more of a history of this, you can check out this paper by Silverman from 2017. I probably can't give you too many more details about this. Okay, so our goal here is to try to generalize Silverman's theorem. So Silverman's notion of good reduction and proof of finite. Reduction and proof of finiteness to higher dimensions. So let's try it. Our first stab at this is not going to quite work. And this is also noted by Silverman in the same paper from 2017. If we try to just define the good reduction set for n equals 2 or higher in the same way that he did previously, and we can. And we can construct examples where we still have infinitely many inequivalent triples in this, these good reduction sets. So here's one such example. I'm going to first fix n and define s to be the set of primes dividing 2 or 2 to the i minus 1 for any i from 1 to n. And we'll define a morphism f sub a b from p 2 to p 2 like this. I'm not going to read that, but I'll let you. This. I'm not going to read that, but I'll let you look at that for a second. Then, if we define xn to be the set of triples 1, 2 to the i 0 for i going from 0 to n, and I construct a triple with f sub a b, xn minus 1, and xn. This ends up being a triple of good reduction, and these things will give me infinitely many different equations. Will give me infinitely many different equivalence classes. So, what's going on in this example? Well, these sets xn, while they do have good reduction outside of S, are not really random points in Pn. There's something special about them, namely they all lie on the line z equals zero in P2. Okay, so maybe what we need to do is impose a condition. To do is impose a condition of having some sort of general position for our sets. So that's going to be the first thing that we'll add to our definition of good reduction. So this is the standard definition of general linear position. We say that a finite set of points X and P n of F has good reduction if basically if no hyperplane contains or Plane contains, or basically, if no sub-variety contains more points than it should. So, if no hyperplane contains n plus one points, given that x has at least n plus one points in it. So, we want to use this notion of general linear position to define our new notion of good reduction. So, again, there's a lot of text on this slide, but all we're really going to be saying, these definitions, is is if I have a set of good reduction when I reduce mod a prime if that set still has sorry set of general linear position if I reduce mod P and I still get something with general linear position that's going to be our definition of good reduction so to define this we need to define the reduction of a hyperplane which we do exactly as you'd expect if I have a hyperplane given by this equation with coordinates AI Ai, then I'm going to define the reduction of that hyperplane by kind of normalizing coordinates again and taking the reduction of each of those coordinates, modulo p. So now our actual definition of good reduction is here at the bottom of the slide. If x is a finite Galois invariant set with at least n plus one points with field of definition kx, then we just say that x has Then we just say that X has good reduction outside S if for every prime P outside of S and all the primes capital P lying above that in our field of definition, the reduction mod P of X remains in general linear position. Okay, but that's still, so maybe I should pause back here and see if there are any questions. Everyone with me so far? Okay, so what I'm doing here is I'm going, we know that we want to add this definition of good reduction into our set of good reduction triples in order to try to get our Chef Ravich finiteness based on that previous example. But that's still not going to quite be enough. And here's an example that illustrates that. So here I'm working just in P2. In P2, let's fix an N greater than or equal to 4, and we'll consider the family of maps Fc given by this equation here. Again, I'm not going to read that out, but I'll let you stare at that for a second. Now, we're going to fix a set Y of order N, which is in general linear position. Position and this contained in the sub-variety given by this equation here. Notice this x0 squared plus x1 squared minus x2 squared shows up in our defining equation for Fc. And we'll let S be the finite set of places so that the set X, which is Y union F C of Y, has good reduction outside of S. Now, obviously, it's very important. Now, obviously, it's very important here that this set S is independent of C, because what we want to do is fix S from the beginning of our setup. Now, if I look at the triples F, C, X, Y, as we've defined all of this, there are going to be infinitely many PGL3 conjugacy classes in this set. So, again, we have a problem. We're not getting finiteness here. What's going on? Well, it's exactly from On, well, it's exactly from the way we constructed y to be contained in this sub-variety. So, what we really need is Y not just to be in general linear position or X to be in general linear position, we need to eliminate issues like this. So, here's the definition of good reduction triples that we use. We changed our notation a little bit here for no reason but simplicity. No reason, but simplicity and the way that we were writing it as we were working. So we'll denote by math, by R D N M K S the set of triples F X Y so that again, F is a degree dimorphism, this time on Pn defined over our number field K. Y is going to be, oh, I already made a typo here, so this should be a P n of K. should be a P n of K bar with side M. X is going to be the union of Y and F of Y as before, and we're going to assume that that's Galois invariant. We need obviously f and X to have good reduction outside of S. So in particular, we're assuming that X is in general linear position when we say this. And we need Y to not be contained in a hypersurface of data. Contained in a hypersurface of degree at most 2D. So that's to eliminate issues like in the last example. Another thing, so a couple things to notice here. First, I want to just say that this last condition actually implies that y has to be at least as big as n plus 2d choose 2d minus 1. And this is just to make sure that, so in order to not be containing any hypersurface of degree 2d, we get this condition. Of degree 2D, we get this condition. Any smaller sets than that will be contained in some hypersurface, some smaller hypersurface. So we, just like in Silverman's theorem, end up having a condition that makes y at least a certain size. But this is also going to imply that x has to have size at least n plus 2, which is going to be important in our theorem. And it's also why when we're talking about general linear position throughout this talk and in the paper, we don't worry about. And in the paper, we don't worry about the definition for smaller sets. Okay, so here's our notion of good reduction triples, and we want to prove a Sheforowicz finiteness result for this. So again, I'm going to pause here for a second. So you can either stare at this definition a little bit longer or ask any questions that you have. Okay. What happens if you said of y union f of y you look at y union f of y union f square of y? I think it's just for simplicity. We can't, if we want to make sure that x was say y and all of Say y and all of the pre-image or all of the images of y, then you'd be restricting just to pre-periodic sets y, and we wanted something more general here. So that's a good question, but this kind of just to make the setup general. This is the way that Silverman defined it in his paper and several of the other previous authors did as well. So yeah, does that answer the question? I think I heard the question correctly. I think I heard the question correctly. Okay, so with this notion of our triples of good reduction, we can prove a Shefravich finiteness theorem. And this was just posted on the archive like last week, I think. So what we prove is that the set that there are going to be finitely many equivalence classes of these triples up to Triples up to PL equivalents. This probably looks like a typo. This one actually isn't. We're just trying to be extra careful here. In our proofs, what we want to do is really work with the group GLN plus one of a ring mod the units, which for a field is the same thing as PGL. But for an arbitrary ring, this isn't. In fact, these things are equal if an Are equal if and only if the Picard group is trivial. So this is just kind of to make everything really precise and careful, but if you don't like this, you can just think of working with PGL and it's sort of close enough to understand what's going on here. If you want to understand a little bit more about this PL and what's going on, there's a paper by Xander Faber from 2020 that kind of goes into depth on the subtleties there a bit more. Okay. Okay, just like before, we still have an action of PL, another typo, that should be a capital N, P L N on our sets of good reduction. Again, just given by conjugating the map F by our element of P L and then taking a pre-image of X and Y under the map. Okay, so let's see. Got quite a bit of time left. I want to. I want to go through a little bit of just some of the ideas that are in the proof. So, again, there's going to be a lot of text on all of these slides. Stop me if you want me to go slower or if you have any questions. I really am just trying to give you an idea. Probably this slide you can understand fully. And in the next slide, I think I'm just giving you some ingredients of the proof. So don't get mad at me that there's so much text. Just try to listen to what I'm saying and I'll try to talk you through a little bit of a few of the ideas that we have. Bit of the few of the ideas that we really need here. So, the first thing we're going to do is think about just the sets X themselves. So, we're sort of forgetting about the map F and the subset Y. And we're going to define this collection, calligraphic X, to be the set of sets in Pn of K bar, which have size N, which are Galois invariant, and which have good reduction outside of it. And which have good reduction outside of mass. And what we're going to do to prove this is in the first two steps here, what we're really doing is proving that there are finitely many of these sets up to our action by elements of P L. And we do that by first proving that if I take the natural map, which kind of extends my base field, so I'm taking my sets of bid reduction and I'm mapping them just to. Bit of reduction, and I'm mapping them just to the set of all sets of size n modulo equivalence by PGLK bar that this set is finite to one. It's not obvious a priori that this thing should be finite to one because it's certainly possible to have sets that are PGL K bar equivalent but not P L O S equivalent. So we need to prove that this is finite to one and then prove essentially just that the image Essentially, just that the image of this map is finite. So we have, so we've proven in that case that this set here x mod P L is finite by doing those two pieces. Now that we know that this set is finite, if I take any particular X from this set, we'll show that there are going to be only finitely many choices for f and y to get an element of this. Element of this to get a triple of good reduction. So that's the proof without any of the details, but that's these are the steps that we need to go through to actually prove our results. So let's take this one step at a time. First, let's think about this natural map from X mod P L O S to the set of sets of size N mod PGL. N mod PGL K bar. I'm not going to give you the details here. This is where I'll give you the least amount of details with the most amount of words on the slide. But the relevant pieces of information here are going to be first using the fact that these things are unramified outside of S and Hermite-Minkowski, we can get a specific finite field extension L over K where all of our sets are. L over K, where all of our sets are defined. So now we actually have a field of definition for these sets X, and we take the extension of the primes S to the field L. And we also want to take that set of primes in L and enlarge it so that the ring of integers, the ring of T integers is a P I D. Integers is a P I D. And we do this really so we can normalize coordinates. You probably noticed earlier on, the point of working with this P L, which was remember the general linear group mod, the units, is so that we can kind of work with matrices. And in order to work with matrices defined over this ring of integers O T, or sorry, the ring of T integers O T, we want to make sure we can normalize coordinates at all of the primes at once. The primes at once. So once we've done that, we get to kind of work with matrices and we're able to change coordinates and do nice, easier stuff to work with these sets. And then the general kind of argument goes: if I take any X naught from my set, then I consider the set of all PGL. Of all PGL k bar elements which map x naught to another set of good reduction. I'm going to show that there's a map from this set into a finite set and show that if I have any two elements of this set which have the same image under that map, then they differ by an element of P L N plus 1 O S. And that's what really shows that this map at the top of the slide is finite to one. Slide is finite to one. No details given there, but that's the idea. And one of the big takeaways from this is I can enlarge my number field K and my set S to kind of whatever I want based on the fact that this map is finite. So we're going to essentially replace K by L and S by T. By T, so that we know that all of our sets are defined over L and that we have this ring of T integers, which is a P I D. Okay, I haven't told you that much about why that's important, but if you go to read the paper, that stuff is going to be kind of the keys to that understanding that piece. Okay, now step two. Now, step two, we want to show that, so let's go back to this first slide. I want to show that the image of this map over here is actually finite. So I want to show that up to equivalence, up to PGLK equivalence, these sets of, there are only finitely many of these sets of good reduction. And this is going to, let's see, rely on S unit equations, the number that are finally. Equations, the number that there are finitely many solutions to S-unit equations. So, how this argument goes is I have my x, which I've assumed is in general linear position, so I can change coordinates so that these n plus 2 points specifically are in my set x. And then we'll define this union of hyperplanes on this shown on the slide. And now I want to really say that the other points of x X come from some finite set, so I only have finitely many choices for these points. So if X is any element of the set capital X that's not on one of these hyperplanes, then my good reduction hypothesis tells me that each of the coordinates Xi and the difference of the two different coordinates Xi minus Xj have to be S units. So it's not too hard to see. So, it's not too hard to see that. It just takes a little bit of thought. Then, we can see that we can set up the following S unit equation. So these two pieces are S units, which means that there are going to be finitely many solutions to this S unit equation. So, the ratios xi over X naught have to come from a finite set. So, that means there are. So that means there are finitely many points in P1 or in Pn that can make up the other points of X. Okay, and all of this I should probably have written on the slide, but the key here is that everything's really defined over the number field L, and we're able to do this normalized coordinates and things like that. Okay. Okay, so I don't know if anyone's still with me at this point, but what we've shown so far is really that this set here is finite. So after I've forgotten about my map F, forgotten about my subset Y, I see that there are really finitely many choices for X. And now I want to show in the last step that kind of adding And the last step that kind of adding on, there are only finitely many ways to add that structure back. So there are only finitely many choices for y. This is obvious because for any given x, it's a finite set. So there are only finitely many ways I can choose y and f of y within x. And again, since y is a finite set, there are only finitely many ways I can define the images of each of the points in y under my map f. And what I'm claiming here is that f is going to become Is that F is going to be completely determined by this choice? How does that work? Well, F and G are defined to be degree D morphisms. We fixed D from the beginning, and we see that the sub-variety where F and G are equal is going to be contained in a hypersurface of degree 2D. So that's a theorem that we just take as a black box. Black box. And we've assumed though that y is not contained in any such hypersurface. So if I've defined my map on y, then I've really defined my map in general. I can't have two of these maps that agree, that agree on y, but end up giving me different morphisms of Pn. So that's it. Without a lot of detail, that's the argument here. And so we have our Shefaravich finiteness conjecture. I realize. Finiteness conjecture. I realized I talked through that quite a lot faster than I planned. I'm sorry about that. But thank you for listening, and I'm happy to take questions.
