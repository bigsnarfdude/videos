The topic is about the vortex interactions on the shape of the evolution of both acoustic and magnetic evolution. So, firstly, please allow me to give a brief introduction on my previous work, splitting and capturing of the vortex dynamics. As well, the research objects or modern words Research objects, or more than vertex dynamics, mainly focus on the non-linear viscous flow, like the turbulent flow and the fluid structure interaction, and the coupling or sharing, compressing, and the thermodynamics. So, a common approach to solve the complex flow problem is to do the decomposition like the point-to-rose boundary theory. The point-house boundary theory and the Humboldt decomposition, and also we can do the transition to the neural stock equation so that we can get the longitudinal process and the transversal process. So, what I do is this on such a dream of leaking and coupling of fundamental flow process. And what I want to do is to answer how. To answer how the vorticity affects the force on the body and how do we affect the other process like the sound mode and the evolution of the entropy mode. So for the first question, our strategy is to replace the in the in the in the in the equation of the force we replace other variables by the vorticity as much as possible. And for the second question, For the second question, and we try to base on such a frame, and we introduce the three nonlinear mechanisms to give us a clear definition of the sun source. So, first is the force composition, and when the first part of first work, we expand the classic in force theory to a finite domain and finally. Finance domain, and finally, we propose a minimum domain info theory. It means that if a body removes all deformation arbitrary and external, we could do if it contains a set of discrete vertical structures like the flow around the cylinder. And we can express the force only by the vertex structures that still connecting the ball. That still connects the body. And this is the force expression. And the full force is contributed by the impulse force and the vertex force in this region. And it also includes shrilling mechanism. It is guided by the actual motion of the body. And one application of this theory is to explain light scale control. Is to explain light field conjecture about the fish bullying. This is a distribution about two fish and in fact in the collection motion of fish and we find that the fish can spontaneously form a stable configuration. It means we have an equivalent stable configuration. It means that the follower fish will have a specific trajectory in the reverse kind. Trajectory in the reverse common vortex stretch set by the leader. And Light Kiel conjects that is due to the passive hydrodynamic effect rather than an active control of the follower. And to explain it, we use the impulse theory to calculate the force on the follower. And we find that if the follower actually puts a trajectory, Acting to a trajectory to like this, like the black line, we call it a vortex lossing trajectory. Then the then the reverse common vortex treats will reduce the vortex generation on the polar. So it will inhibit the thrust effect. And if the polar choose another trajectory like the red line, we call it a vertex volume trajectory. The vertex volume trajectory, then the environmental vertex will infuse a high vortex generation on the follower and it will enhance the thrust effect. So if you choose the first trajectory, the environment vertex will pull you back, and if you choose the red trajectory and the environment vertex will pull you forward. So, if we want to obtain a net, a zero net force on the forward, it has been trapped in a trajectory like the blue length. And another application is we use the impulse theory to calculate the force contributed by each DMD mode and identify the key modes for the force control. And we know the DM dynamic. And we know the dynamic mode composition is a distributing algorithm and it's used for construct order model for the flow field. And but seldom people to discuss the force contributed by HDMD mode. But the imposed theory has that advantage because it can express the force only by the mortality arrival and the procedure. And the position width, and there is a position vector wage. So we can split the force into the sum of several terms and each term can express the force contributed by each YAMG mode. And the video assimilation is a separate proportion of a flexible body. And this is a The body, and this is a reconstruction of the force. And we can see we only need the first 50 modes to realize very good enough force contraction. But if we want to reconstruct the blue field, we need at least 25 modes. It means that the key modes for the force reconstruction is in fact smaller than the key modes for the blue field reconstruction. Reconstruction. And another application is based on our proposed modified force element theory. And this is a decomposition of the force. And in fact, there is a figure it doesn't show. And the problem and this is the figure about the force on the body at the as a as a function of time. As a function of time and it describes the force contributed by this term. And in fact, this term contributes to the main driving force for the jellyfish-like propulsor. It's an integral of the weighted second environment of the voltage region. And this is the sketch for us to explain the thrust mechanism. And we find that then the jellyfish. that then the jellyfish close their shell. If close their shell, if the body can capture the previous vertex pair, create at the open stage, and there will be a big string repetition done and it will call a big thrust. So a fast close and slow open motion is very beneficial to catch such paravert. Had such pair authenticities, and it is beneficial for the delifish-like proportion. And another work is our work about to study how the vorticity affects the sound propagation. And at present, as you know, there are more than 30 kinds of acoustic equations and the characteristic variable of sound mode is not unique. Of sound mode is not unique. It can be a pressure density and the dilution. And what's more, the definition of the sound source is not very clear. So to solve the acoustic dilemma, we use a research strategy. We consider the fundamental into three modes, sound mode, voltage mode, and entropy mode. And entropy mode, and we introduce a string linear mechanism to define the source or sun. And we think, like this equation, only the term on the right can serve as the source term because it can produce the variable from nothing. And we and we proposed two kinds of acoustic equations. One is characterized by the thermodynamic. Characterized by the thermodynamic variable, like the sensitive pressure and the temperature. And we, for the equations of these variables, we give a rebel rat for them. We can all be expressed like this. And the source of the thermodynamic ribbons is continuous terms when it's connected to the deformation of the surface deformation and the other congrams. Information and the other conference entropy source. And we also proposed the acoustic equation based on the dilatation. And this is the form of the equation. And on the right is the source term. It contains the surface deformation and the work mode. And if we also do the numerical simulation, it's an unsteady type 4. It's a unsteady type 4 stroke and stroke infection case. And from this and from these figures, you can see that the dilatation as an acoustic variable, it can clearly show the structures than other variables. And also in our paper, we have discussed the advantages of this equation rather than the traditional equation. The traditional equation. It's the extension. We also studied the magnetic vertical interactions on the magnetic splitting. As we all know, plasma is extensively funded in our stellar systems and intergalactic space, and there is highly non-linear fluid and magnetic interactions. Interactions and these are pictures provided by NASA. And we can see there are a lot of magnetic flux structures in the surface of the solar surface. And the non-linear interactions between the fluid and the magnetic field will lead to a complex evolution in the topology of magnetic structure and the fluid structure. And a noteful research about the magnetic sleeping is the work of Xiung and Yang in 2019. And they clarify the effect of twist on the tube litting and by the face profession of the Lorentz force on a divergence species. And we can see in the fact of Lorentz force. In effect, alongside the magnetic tube will split. And based on this work, what we want to do is how the voltage affects the magnetic splitting. So we study the evolution of magnetic cube in M32 flu. And our numerical illumination is based on the incompressible and magneto-hydro hydrodynamic equation. Hydro hydrodynamic equation and to construct the vortex tube and the magnetic tube, we use this function. And this function describes the central line of the cube. And the the uh the the flat is described by this equation. It's followed by the work and Simon Young in two thousand and nineteen twenty nineteen. 2019. And this is the initial setting of our magnetic cube and virtual tube. Here, the red tube is the vertical cube, and the blue tube is the magnetic cube. And the two fields at the initial time, they have the same energy. It means at the initial time, the magnetic the the magnetic energy of the magnetic cube is equal to the. Cube is equal to the magnetic energy. And here we can change the angle between the magnetic tube and the vertical cube. And we can also change the chirality of the two cubes. And the first term, we study the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy for several special pieces. And we can see the magnetic energy or. The magnetic energy all decrease with the time due to the distinction and its conversion to the kinetic energy. And this is the kinetic energy, and it has an overall decrease, but there is some increase for some special pieces. For example, for if the system don't have an initial Initial don't have an initial vertex cube, or the angle between the vertex cube and the magnetic magnetic cube is big enough, there is an increase at the initial time. And a very useful function is that as we can see in the blue line, as we can see in the blue line, it's the magnetic field and the Magnetic tube and the vertex tube overlap each other at the initial time, no matter it's isotile or anti-child, there is a notable reduce in the release or NV. And we also studied the effect of the angle between the magnetic tube and the vertex tube on the evolution of magnetic energy. Of magnetic energy and kinetic energy. And we can see that the small angle can provide exactly in curving the energy release. Of course, by comparison figure, it means that it must be at expense of magnetic energy transfer or conversion to the kinetic energy. They also do the morphology study for several cases. And one is the evolution of vertex cube with different chirality. And the first rule is the anti-car vertex cube. And we can see at the time increase and the tube will appear elongated. appear elongated and the the two tubes the two tubes uh you can see the two tubes will approach each other until there are some pieces have the overlap and this will engage in the mutual interaction and for the second case if the uh if we have the isotero vortex tube and it will exhibit a collective collective notional motion and finally it will separate it it will separate into an under structure and we can see the effect of the pirality is very significant for the evolution of the vertex tube and uh this big difference can be spread into the evolution of the magnetic tube. Of the magnetic tube, and we also do the morphology study of the system with the initial magnetic tube without the addition of the vertical tube. And we can see at the time increase, the magnetic tube will have a rapid flapping and then the two tubes move obviously from each other until they form a The NQD form of temporal structure, and the mercury tube also follows the morphology evolution of the magnetic tube. And we can also see that this rapid bleeding at the initial stage is high relative to the intense release of the magnetic energy. And what's more, if we change the pirality of the initial magnetic Of the initial magnetic tube, the evolution of the magnetic tube and the vertex tube remains the same. So, to explain it, we start from the control equation. As we know, for an initial magnetic cube, it will induce velocity field based on the short term at a learned. The short term, it's a Lorentz fourth term, and if we change the correlation, and this term will produce the same velocity field. And the induced velocity field will further modify the magnetic field, including its direction and direction, and its magnitude. And after our analyze, we find such a process doesn't doesn't doesn't change. Seven change change the morphology and the magnitude of the magnetic tube if we change the chirality. And this is the okay, and this is the this is a planar cut of the magnetic field, and we can find the homophology of the two case. is the same, but even they have different colours. And like the Qzo and Arzo, one is blue and the other is red. But the two cases will induce the same relation field. And here is the here is the X component and the Y component of the vertex control. And we also study the influence of the angle between the two between the two kinds of two on the on the evolution. And we can see that in this figure, okay, in this figure, there one is the next mode of the magnetic release and the magnetic energy list, and the blue one is the blue line is the maximum rate of the kinetic energy increase and we can see there when when the angle increase there is a drastic increase at the small angles and also the the the the vibration of the angle can instinctively affect the morphology evolution of the cube and the cube and we can see for small for small angles like speed equals to equals to one or equals to zero or two the what cube will handle will handle the splitting of the magnetic tube but for but for a big angle and and the the magnetic cube will be oscillating and from this speaker we can also see that From this figure, we can also see that the vertical tube is largely affected by the evolution of magnetic tube, but the magnetic tube it will follow the follow the evolution of the vortic tube. And from the about discussion, and we can get one important conclusion is that if the Japanese The jetty energy release is related to the magnetic duplicity. So, to explain it, we first study the impact of Lorentz force on the evolution of vertices. And this is the control equation for the velocity, and this is the source term for the velocity field. And we express it in an intrinsic line line frame. Line frame, and this is the this okay, and this is a voice pressure for it. And we can see it's voice pressure is very deep, it's very complex. But there are some special pieces. For example, for this band, it's a cylinder tube for the for this tube, and according to our according to our analytes, there is no magnetic field, magnetic bleeding. And the second case is the cube line in a plate in a plane, and so the torsion is equal to zero. And we can find that this term, the occur of the Lorentz force, will make the donut-like tube splitting because it will induce a pair of vorticities in this opposite direction, and the splitting will happen. The splitting will happen in the binomial direction. It means it's in the okay. I will show this picture. And we also do a simulation about the donut-like tube. And this is the initial tube. And we can see at time increase, this tube will split in the bi in the binomial direction and the vort and it will form a pair of vortex. A pair of vortex tubes, we have different directions. And we also find that the distance between the two tubes will increase with the curvature. Okay, we use this conclusion in our cases, and the first chapter in the left is this chip. The left is the distribution of the kappa, it means the correction and the torsion, and even the binormal direction along the curve. And this is a magnetic tube at time point O5 and we can see there are magnetic tube splitting. And from the red arrows, and we can see the splitting drag. The splitting reaction is similar to the binomial direction of the initial cube. And we also study several special positions like ABC on the tube. And A is the position with the biggest current, and the B is a smaller current. And we can find that the distance between the two tubes at a position A is bigger than a position. is bigger than a position B. It means that our conclusion about the distance, the relation between the distance and the curvature is right. And at position C, there is a biggest proportion and the weakness is the proportion will mix the tube, will inhibit the stability of the tube. And next we and the under the first uh and the and the first slide we we explain the why um of initial magnetic tube magnetic tube will space and the section we explain why the addition of the vertex tube will will will handle space it with the magnitude emission and we find that the addition of a magnetic tube has the same magnetic magnetic tube have the same magnitude as the vorticity induced by the induced by the magnetic tube. So finally, the final vorticity distribution is the thin line. So there is no magnetic utility. Okay, I will pass this. The finally is a summary and we find the magnetic tube well undergoing oscillating due to the curvature effects. To the curvature effects, and it will produce a pair of works with different direction, and it will make the magnetic tube splitting. But with the additional vortex tube, it will inhibit the splitting or the magnetic tube. Okay, thank you.
