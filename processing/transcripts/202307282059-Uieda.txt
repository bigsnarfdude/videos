Trust it. Thanks everyone. So Santi asked me to put together a few thoughts and share a bit about Simpaik, but also my personal motivations for being a part of Simpaik and where things are going perhaps in the future. We want the ambiance for Seth Better. Okay. It's like a slightly more intimidating, but that's okay. And so I want to start by sharing a video that To start by sharing a video that perhaps sets some context, and it's very fitting that Rowan is the one who introduced me to this video. And so, we're just going to start with the start of things. Ladies and gentlemen, at 10 we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First, of course, you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. Stand out and be ridiculed. But what he's doing is so easy to follow. So here's his first follower with a crucial role. He's going to show everyone else how to follow. Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. So now it's not about the leader anymore. It's about them, plural. Now there he is calling to his friends. Now if you notice, the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into. Transforms a lone nut into a leader. And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts. Three is a crowd, and the crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader. Now here come two more people, and immediately after, three more people. Now we've got momentum. People. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. So, notice that as more people join in, it's less risky. So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry. So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they will be ridiculed for not just. They will be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So, first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy, that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals. So it's clearly not the movement, not you. Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson. The biggest lesson, if you noticed, did you catch it? Is that leadership is over-glorified. Glorified. The yes, it was the sureness guy who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the low nut into a leader. So as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really effective. If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut doing something great, have the nuts to be the first one to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place to do that, Ted. Thanks. Now we're infinitely sure. I might need Santi's going to come and rescue me. But I think that there's some really interesting and beautiful parallels that a video like this shows in open source. Shows in open source is that it really does take a leader to do something bold, to do something great. But that it is so key to invite people to be a part of that. And I think that, you know, this resonates to me with a lot of how SimPeg was started. And I think, you know, with three of us joining in. So, you know, what we saw, and so we started SimPeg at UBC. I guess we started our PhDs in what, 2012, 2013? In what, 2012, 2015? Long time ago now. And so, you know, we're part of the geophysical inversion facility. A lot of what people are doing is computational research and wanting to do something and, you know, exploring new ideas with computation. And so what we saw and what Rowan really felt as a pain and something we really needed to solve is that in order to do something new, there was a lot of code being rewritten. In order to start out with an inversion, you've got a new idea, you want to change. Inversion, you got a new idea, you want to change it, and you can a lot of what people had to do at that point in time is actually rewrite everything from scratch. And you're spending so much time building up this code base, building up basically your square one. And there's a lot of perhaps wasted effort and things that we could really do to improve that. Furthermore, there's a lot of bright people in one place, but everybody is really working on their own things. And so seeing an opportunity to bring people together. To bring people together, Rowan was really effective in actually sparking us to work together. And I think one of the first things, one of the first things I remember, and I was reflecting back on this, is I think we were in LDAS course, and we're learning how to program up PDEs and do things about derivative tests. So to make sure you implemented your sensitivities correctly. And Ron had written up some code to do this test and print out a pretty table that I tried to hack together this test and had it all beautifully formatted. Can it be all beautifully formatted? And he emailed this around to all of us and said, Well, let's work together on this piece. This is something we all need. Everybody's implemented this part, but why are we not working together on this? And so that really started a spark of actually, let's start working together. Why are we all spending effort doing these same things when we could actually be learning much more effectively and having a lot more fun working together on these problems? And so, SIMPEC simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics. In geophysics. The real core problem that we're looking at is actually how do we can we distill and you know come up with a framework for simulations and inversions in geophysics. And what I think is perhaps a parallel with this video shows, that's a bold question. Can we come up with a framework for like a part of the field? That's a big question. And I think there's something really exciting and interesting in that. And part of what drew me to this is the boldness of that. Me to this is the boldness of that question. Part of what drew me to this is, you know, it's a way to actually learn about the field, is if you can organize your own ideas in a way that you think makes sense. You've learned something fundamental and you've learned something about really how to do science, is we are asking questions about how do we think about the world around us. And so to me, that was something really inherently exciting about asking and trying to answer this problem. And so there's a lot of opportunities that I saw. Lot of opportunities that I saw to learn a number of things and really sort of, you know, I think as you talk about doing a PhD, the philosophy piece was something that I really wanted to get into. And I think, you know, if you ask this question of how do I understand the field I'm working on, that's something I was really drawn to. But I think the other piece that was asked is, you know, can we develop this framework? But can we also do so in a way that perhaps has a major impact in the field? Can we do this? Impact in the field? Can we do this in a way that other people can reuse and build upon? That's taking on something that's a big foundational question in the field. And so what I think is quite exciting and I think is a theme that we can perhaps hopefully echo in this weekend together is I think taking on big questions and working in the open requires both the boldness to pick a big important question. Pick a big important question. You want to spend your time on something that matters. But also, humility. You need to be working with other people. You know, taking on a question like that shouldn't be solved by one person. It shouldn't be solved by three people. It should be solved by a community. And so this is something that was so important early on in the project. And I think that's true both in Simpeg and Fatty Ankel. And I can speak to Simpeg because I was a part of that, but I see that in the way that both of these communities have That in the way that both of these communities have built is that, you know, Bro and Sagi and I were drawn to be working together, but recognizing we want to be doing something where there is space for a community to jump in, a community to build upon things. And so as we talk about a community, you know, we think about people who are interested in answering and working on a common problem. And so Simpeg, what brought us together is an interest in working on inverse problems. Problems. And as we talk about that, you know, they're complex problems. You need people who know things about solving PDEs, you know people who know things about optimization, about regularization, people who know things about data, people who know things about just driving a code to get out answers and get out something useful. And no one person is all of those people. You need people from all of these different perspectives to be able to do that. And I think that it's exciting. You know, it's exciting to see that each new person who comes into the project brings something new, whether it's a new use case, it's a new perspective, a new way to wire together the code that we never think of, but it uncovers something new, and that is so incredibly valuable. And so there's contributions not only in writing code, there's contributions in using it, there's contributions onboarding people. Folks who actually help other people get up and running with the code. I think Dong is. And running with the code. I think Dom is an effective person, and Dom's inspired Craig, and Craig has inspired others. And that's a really exciting storyline: actually, you know, taking time to bring people on board. And, you know, coming back to this theme, perhaps, of boldness and humility, is it takes both of that to join a new project, right? To post a question in Slack or on a form somewhere requires you to admit, I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm doing here. And it may be something obvious, it may not be. But that's part of asking a question: you don't know that. It requires boldness to put that out there. And it requires humility to recognize that you've hit something that you don't know. And so I think that that's such an exciting thing that really I think this tension can really only coexist when you have a community. Is that when you've got people around you to support. Got people around you to support, you can ask big questions because you can feed off of each other's enthusiasm. It's so easy to, you know, ask a question, perhaps dream a little bit yourself, and then be like, Oh, yeah, you know, who am I to take this on? This is too much. You know, you sleep on it, and it's like, I'll recognize something else. You need to be able to bat that idea around with other people. You also need the support of other people to be humble. You need people to ask questions about your ideas to About your ideas to point out things that perhaps we can improve how we're thinking through this. Perhaps this could be implemented better. Perhaps we can create new examples, tutorials, to onboard people in a better way. And so I think that boldness and humility is something that can really be fostered and grow when we've got a community in place. And so I think both projects have really worked at developing. Have really worked at developing that. Perhaps in some places explicitly, perhaps in some we haven't thought about it explicitly, but I thought it was so cool. I actually started writing these notes before I saw Santi's slides, and I love that both of these themes and asking that of everyone here is bring yourself, bring your imperfect self, share your ill-formed ideas, and trust that we've got a community here who has both the boldness and the humility to help you develop those. And so, as we think a bit about the future, And so, as we think a bit about the future, both of the projects now at this point are quite mature. The first time we held this project, or we held this workshop, it was very early days of Simpeg. We had enough code to have it be something useful, but it was still something that's being formed. We were probably still in the point of both projects being like, you know, who's the project in geophysics? Which one is it? And turns out it's a big field. We need a few more than one single project. More than one single project to be making progress here, and it's certainly more than two. And that's part of what makes a healthy ecosystem: having different perspectives, having different ways to solve the problem. And I think we're now at the point where we have to coexist in an ecosystem, which is amazing. And so I think that we're going to have opportunities to talk about new technical developments. And as we look back on the past number of years with Simpeg and sort of where we've come from. Sort of where we've come from when we first started this. And Joe pointed out he started the first pull request to bring out Sonic Python 3. There's been a lot of work to improve efficiency and a huge amount of that is thanks to Joe. There's been a lot of work to improve documentation and samples. Devin, of course, is a wonderful person, made a lot of progress there. And many others in the community, Dom, Sock, Tebow, and others have contributed a lot in terms of making resources available. Making resources available. And there's going to be a lot of really exciting questions that are going to be answered by people's research who are in this room, which I think is amazing, is that you can pick up these tools and push in and develop new ideas. And so I'm excited for you to bring what you have in mind of where we should be going in terms of technical opportunities. And I think that in terms of other questions, you know, raising again. Of other questions, you know, raising again what are some of the important things we can be doing in the community. We certainly have opportunities to grow in terms of diversity and in terms of the ways we support our community. And I'm really excited to hear everyone's thoughts here. And so I think, you know, there's lots that we can learn to collaborate on. I focused a lot on the code bases, but I would also love to hear people's ideas on, you know, what are the adjacent spaces? I think there's huge opportunities in the education. In the educational resources. We've seen some of that with the GSI and throwing, putting notebooks out there, and the tutorials, things like the transform tutorials have been incredibly useful. Where are those opportunities for us to grow and engage with a broader community? And that's one, but I'm sure there's others. And I think, you know, coming back, we've got important questions that we can help tackle as we think about the geosciences and the types of problems that we face. The types of problems that we face in light of the climate crisis, we have some important things to contribute, and I think that everybody in this room has bold ideas that we can contribute to impactful problems. These are things that impact society, and as a community here, I'm really excited to see what we can do. So ask some big questions. And this weekend, I invite both your boldness and your humility. And I hope that you share your big ideas. Share your big ideas, and it's fine and welcomed if they're ill-formed. Nobody's formed all their ideas. So, put something on the table, even if you don't know exactly where it's going, and invite others to be a part of that, because that is where we can have impact. And so I'm so grateful that you are all here and have chosen to take time, take your weekends, travel from very far places. I want to also say a very big thanks to Santi. You know, a number of us were involved. Uh, you know, a number of us were involved in organizing, but he's really the one who made this happen. He wrote the proposal, he got funding for folks to be here. None of this would be happening without Santi's leadership, and so I just want to acknowledge and uplift and say a huge thanks to Santi because we would not be here otherwise. And so, I just want to thank again everyone. I'm really excited for the conversations that we're going to have over these two days, how this is going to shape the future. These two days, how this is going to shape the future of these projects, and what types of questions we can tackle as a community. How about just share things? Can we go through the primary questions if someone asks any questions? Was he ready for that? Yes, absolutely. Oh, shit. Oh shit.
