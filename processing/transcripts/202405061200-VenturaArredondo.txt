 So what I gusta is the pier of ramps. And every time the children, what is that existence of pastrones colorados in the arbitrary colorados and sufficiently great. That are more important. So a lot more than you have. If you have a structure, if you integrate, then the color is tomos, so the structure of integrated, puedevic, and more of the period of Ramsay, and one of the things that also. This prototype is much of the tones reduced a minimum. So, more amigable than that. If you vanish, no important, with some people or not all important, but with the fifth ten people or more people, so three people between three people where none of them. Personas where na yes with entrepreneurs. Siemens. So, vamos a conversos de porque esto esí. So, we are aponer, vamos a graphic, so that you are aponer un vertices porcada person of the piece. We put saved people. And we have a rista sul si las dos people es conoses, we aponer unarista roja si nos ko nos. Sale? Sinos with the fiestra, so no queer asules and rojas soon three people in the 30s, or that significant contrar with a monochromatic in this graphics. So, we're going to eventually see that the triangular monochromatic triangle. So, we're going to be in the person. Digimos in the 6 people, and we're going to go in a vehicle in the DA. We are going to say that this person is connected with one maneuver, and the noses that are not. What if we three people to si conse or three people to do not with us? Because if not, there are more people who do not know, and the more people know, in fact, one. Me falta uno. Transition pretres. Su pongamos que son suspres amidos. How we are triangulos monopromáticos, pued laista que está qui por examplo no puede serroja, but no puede de azún, because y no pa se ali un tíangulo azun, tiene que serro. Los mismos puera aquí, y lo mismos pure acaca. Porque esamos se tamos decembos unaplomato. Mandeme? Porque estamos. Because we are evident or not. Because we want to demonstrate that we do not. We are super queues to the field, we will super, that we do not regreg my climate change in this. The games like the camos sixteen. It is a division of no puede. If you have your propositions, you know, that is six people, three people with your sabers, that's the same for no. No, no, no. Posía. Ace. Tú vas a fiestra y tú ve esto people people. So 5 people segue va ver 3 que si conoses o tres que noces pode que llamas. But the mismati pode connection is perdad. So I general idea, their pod your mind. Well, you extract that champion. Well, if you have the triangulos, this is a triangular rock. So, no, you can devitate in this case the parallel of this patron that is inhibiting.  But no pussy employees, but my senses with your people can triangular monograms, but this no vaver tons here are amigos así y estos son des concios. So here no ay tregulos modo tomatoes. Puere esto estos. Monotomatic, because this is the matter of it. And that enterprise uses that platform about three projects in what we work in, the first ellama with solutions colorless. And that is a problem. And this problem is avoiding this million, I think, that. Jack Wesley, who is a postdoc in the Universidad of California in San Diego, and Yami Juan que es tanga licenciatura de matemáticas que UCD. So we are, but for yak, puetra vajamos por zoom. Muybin. Y ahora, tejimen estuento sobre una doministurimas fabritos. Te muy bonito, very principo, yes el terima de sur. Princess, and that is the truth: that is, in my 50s, and this is that colors. So, existing how the enterprise of one, with all the colors, a number of colours. If we contradict a solution monocralitable, A solution monochromatic solution is more questions. So, here we are in contradiction, triangles, or graphics. This is different, they are structural in the formats, in this case. So, we are a soul, very sensitive. All two. All two colours, all have two colors, from the numbers of a cynical, vanity container una solution to a question of surface. No important colour. So webitar esco, and here important color the results of the channel. We don't know with a solution to the exposure. So, we're going to do one. Enpear with the roco, import. But if we put the roco, here two que seasur, verada, si no ya cabamos. Don't be a sur. Sebadle. Sebada repeat the variable. Yes. If you lost a repetitive, you understand that the study reflects the top. But this force. This forza age doesn't. The cupro tiene que ser rojo, ti nos 2 más 2atro. But this forza aque el 3 tenga que ser, because if you 35 que sel a cinco que que color 1cer cuen 1 5 es roco ya cabamos y 05. Just here, no man, the solutions monochromatic solutions. And this mejor, valo, because we are the simple astonishing color that vita the solutions monochromatic solutions. The simples are not mejo. That significantly para two colors especially. That of two escapes. So here, I am the number of colors. Now, when numbers of source are with us, one is nothing. And the last paste and many can computational para resolve. This resolves in 2008. This more die, this Mas die: this parent usar combinatoria, and the first problem, and part of it whose name is. Yes, if you have the plan, and color integrals, like a system of. Averto esa averto. In the plan colored enter colonadas are rojas, for example. Well, you have to respect and have colored children and so that they encounter my solutions in the number of majority. Osar como nosotros lo trabajamos especially. Hamos especially. Puedespensar canes like the space, the grid of 3 mentions. So in the set, put a color, the color, in the 10 other colours. So these technologies, no? Pefficas in the points that are solutions, and that problems that are. That we have the taste. No, no, no. No paradox. Okay. Thos are the numeros are difficult to say that work in the size, if we are six. And well, the question naturally paused: OK, sio color está 5 in cuentro una. But what passes the interval? In contrast, more than interviews. And the solution is to collect a color, in the realization of all color, and your texts, four major three rocks. That is a solution. That's a solution. And the mechanism and other monotromatic solutions. If you ask with color, oscillos are two colors. But don't have to use the foliage on. So, you have toddlers. So, you have all the monochromatic solutions possible. But I want to contradict the number of resolutions monochromatic resolution that we can say that for example this number is cases of control of solutions. So this cases contain monochromatic solutions of sus together that two, the superior significance that you have a color colored country that contains these solutions. If you don't solution, very diverse. And we have a idea. I can't remember. If we don't. If we don't want the number, there is the inferior difficulty. So, I think that all the color continues to solution, homes. That part of this is all complicated because also this aveces the computer, now this problem of. Ronald Graham and 1929, noise for a conference, whereciocindolars a change of solution exactly. And the conquest that number era in ecuadradas oreces, but their factor in all textual parallels. The candido parises. La cano para cel? Ah, perdón. Aquís para two colors. Y aquí no pusen el first núcedo per para two colors. Estende yo se y cuatro puvas distintas de que este número es en equadas obreónci. Y la firsta, pue poroza yio perger. Yusar un calculo, calculo discreto envocho, no mucho despues que soncio el problema, porquíto después show en And COVID taught other demonstrations combinator and a color that number of monochromatic solutions, so here we go, that's. We are entering, but they are interspersed. This is the enterprise of one, and what this colour is a block of enters with proportion is four, seven years, and the annotation that we have for color. We are with a With a vector situation to efficiency, which is very good that they have a symmetry between the colors with a rock and sugar. But this repeat is not a symmetry between the proportions because we have many focus, that we have to. Yora, we have more colored past for more colored pods than a glutton where three color, one colored concilio, with this number of solutions monochromatic solutions, that are one or two loads with computers, algorithmic. And what? And what other yes, por estas cotas y bueno aquí están las las cotas are a poquito mejor, noso a loto mejor, but we are contendos, and the colorciones in cada caso are. For example, here with three colors, that you delimo tenemos una colorción por bloques y with a symmetria between the colors. So, Here comes a name. So, two are what we do. This is more si, but the queen, the first queen. Now, another question that we can pass with other equations, this result for many scholars, so that passes with other questions. Well, Bernard Gray, I will question monoclonal solutions to. Monochromaticas, this new question, so this is the tripletas generalized. So, as a general queue, and in this case, for two colors, this tan type of superior in 2000 here when there is two. If we don't have a question, So what we use are tripletas this type of monoplomáticas y contact. So a colorcion, here is the queen attack of edo, with these proposals. And 2:17 and established, and their doctoral violence provides and good. What other people have been working on with a general eset and all colors? When prompto, when we contradict the identity, the minimum number of monopromáticas that prevas contract is also in four to the part. And this is a idea of this demonstration. So, for the superior case, there is a codec. Superior aqueous coloration. In this case, the colorcent colours for blocks function here that function was signal multiplied by the same color, in this case, all the more sensitive. All so here we are, which is so that we consider all the reflections that are solutions. So, you have to be a multiplayer. For the tanto, no solution is not a puedecer solution of this equation. So, that means all the suits. Now, in the roads, it is perfect that in many candidates, but really much candidates. Equals who can. But, Multiplied, but that, because I want the roses, that is a multiplicity. So, you have equals, if you are a multiplayer, and part to multiplicate this meadow unorthodox. And this significant queue only means in the multiples of quadrature here, that are super, super. So, this was like a technical way to have. As a technical parole have the better channel of solutions, my problems now for the inferior, what we have a technical question, where we are, all the solutions of that, all colored children and someone between solutions monochromatic and solutions non-monochromatic. Okay? And so And so, in the context of these are tripletas, tripletas in total of the tripletas, tripletas monochromatic triplets, tripletas non-monochromatic triplets. Now, we are going to control the tripletas, which is tripleta non-monochromática to two parents no monochromaticas. Because if you have robas, robo, cues two ropas, and two pas. So, So, contamination non-monochromáticas y optimizamos esta function. From what we are figuring repletas, not promote to maximize this function, os esto meada una valo minimo para esta other valos, ya se tú vimos, nuestra nuestra cosa inferio. Vuybien. Muybien. Now, second project: this project, the many carriers, because it is a project that works from the doctorado. I work with the doctor launching with the amibas, and it is the California. And it is present to one, and we have a lot of amibas, and well, this works. And this work is with Gillian Eddie, Ryan Pesak, and Tenio Quentin, who are three octorants in UC Davis. So, we're going to see their animals. We're going to consider a graphic. A graphic vertices. And we're going to take vertices from the graph. For example, aquí está now the rista 3, and here the connecting 35, that is what graphic and tiquetaro, because I need the tiquetarient that is going to be one. One movie, but the four and the champion. So, this remote admissible dial is a permutation of etiquette that is in this class for 50. Vuy, or we affect us in all the permutations associated with all the decisions. At all the remote administrators. So, here in cadaver di bugito, pusemplo deplas admisible diarist can combinaro esto cone esto cosas. So, this el que vimos acha para que nosimos nadano, but uni 2, so nos limos aristas, per applicamos unautomorphismos, eso. Output transcript: That value and that unicorn that we can. Here, we have the three, a cuarto, so the three, the two cycles, and one. Acapes that we have the cuatro cycle, the puzzle in a cycle, and what passes that one, two more, sequero ensulugar. Sally? Sally? So, if I figured out, yes, their permutations were clear in this mechanism, general group, in this case, our general symmetric groups or 5 in this case. But I need all these para general especially. In this case, no, no, not necessarily. In this case, no, no, we all. Perceive that they are not allowed, but no sincere, but not necessitating all this group that generates all permutations, associated with the places, and the group of groups. Es el grupo ver dej y bueno paragráca tien es el grupo per sale por feasible edge replacements por eso yonza yos que son las amive porque no es dijo que esto. A graphic aje de ordenene se yama amive local si subgrupo fer grisomorpho alpo symmetrical group for an element. Symmetrical or in elements. Or, like the graphics that are local ahora. The question that we can do, I want to know what the minimum number of I have to do to make it a local. You cannot decide. So, we have with nice lungs, can bear in this family of locales, well, this family is the family of the typofibonate. And this family is very good because a report typofibonate, and how. And how is the vanity? We have the first one that is a segment that also is aquín identity. Now, to generate, we are going to take two vertices of anteriors of maximum and we will connect the pornists. There is now to generate four, we are going to treat it and Ah, are man, very good with the. We have the Hansberg and with all types of local and number of aristocrats that you have to demonstrate that the children are local is in 2020, very much because I think. Musondente because I think a choromas, because no escaped vertices. It is the number of vertices that are here, but the arguments as if the vertices comenoses. Unless you torn. So here we go, okay. Okay, we can decide what are trivial, no? But that is not remarkable. So, that one, that this par, one para. That is the unicorn that we need in this case, and we can use all the things. And what we're saying that as a action that is two transitive in the aristocracy, what is a little inductive? We are with many admissions. The pockets that can see here, with especially, we have And then we agreed one more, demonstrating that, and the manager of man action where the aristocraces, the puedes civilized others, using automorphisms, or whatever with aristocrats that we have as well. The fer es en porcalar. When here el fer es númer developer directi. Si aquí el fer es más por más elmento sí. Yes es el número if you want. Si, CCC, pi es el double doble, no. Si es el doble. C es el double. Muy dias. El toba. Maybe. The ton sabra is meeting 5 projects. Because I will have to 5 projects working. And this is a project also very emotional that this works with Antonio Torres and Luce Guess also postdocs in New City Davis and also with. Davis and also confess for your pupils, not in the photo, but what we are with and conducive is the idiot. So, we have a regid in the plan. So, if you put a point, porcelain, these points.  Y, si, si si. Los originals on the teros y el que trapas, pusamos que trapi unente entonces. Pues están para efficiency aquí aquí que estamos toda vien el plano que es un topos. To have the plan, which is a little more facilitated. We are afraid, in all the points, in these points that are coming from two lilies, no? These points in 2020. But I have a good, well, aquípos el result, that is a result of one, this mechanism for. The number to radon in the plan, in this case, erosion two is the dimension and aqueous in the region, this porn, what is here is that if in this point, and for this point, you cannot rectangle the vocabene, if you will, the two points. Almost two points of a development, among the two. So that two points of the rocks and assules. Of the rolado, significant points of profundity, two. So in this class, this point that we pampos film. This point that we profound 3 is that the bug, the importance of the restaurant, 3 of the latest, cada lab. Muy sabora, what we terminate today, mejor, the minimum. Mejor, the minimum number of points in the region now dimension, all the regimes, is that a partition of radon. So here the same in this trend is admitted a radon, se una manera designar, two colored signals, where a national. Albredo de los hazules, y una sabana rogo albredo de los rojos, a dentro de las os sabanas que à empunto el ter. Lasabunas la pretas, yiena pretas, una ligas, trivent 25. So what is the moment is that the number of donde three dimensions in the enteros in the latice? En los in the latest between what we do is that numerous artists, that is our concrete. We have this, we know that we have what we have is that if you three points not in the region three dimensional regions. In the three-dimensional region, and if that is that there is a point in it, with your 3 points in the region 3 dimensional regions, and these 3 points have been ten que formar unpolied. If not formaried, it is a partition of it. So, forman polier ahora figures. Piján says polier. There is a point of profundity, so that we are. No, we are finding the original points, adento, meficuan losers. Sieno uno dendida 3 points admit a fraction of what we are demonstrating, well, we are trying to demonstrate that if all the points are. If all the points are from the polier, they are profounder, and we have some results, but we don't have a little. This is what I want many por, I subject. For the first project, I think that's how we comfort the podcast. That is precisely what we are doing work with me. That is the part as well. Aboriginal queeremos determined the number, but if you have many studio posed the number. The number of solutions monofromátic is the model that the number of monoformatic solutions is a color dip. They are the same. So, these questions are and the noses of this laundry. So, if you have. So, if you try to do nothing else, monochromatic solutions. The number especially, like the same thing, not yusto, that we want to study in other episodes for example, there is no podcast in a farameter that has no other.  Yes, two parameters, we are like, but one of the colours, and the other layer, in my opinion. President the number of sure can be one. Tu estamos colorando en intervados con almenos el número de sur enters. Aha, si es cojo es el número de sur guarantizamos por. Guarantizamos un. No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, that's the clear query, no, but one, but it's not a very important thing. So, one more como del 5, you have a mask, so that is unmasked in a color. So, that's tiene que actuar, how. How solution of it? Well, how is this number? That is the most great delay that is a set. So, the set to queen corresponding here also with the solutions. If this is a solution of other parameters of numerous significant things that can be done. No, sipping because I could have two colors, but for three. My biences, the other normal and human beings of medicine artist. Well, it's important. These graphics don't invent that, Amanda Montejano, and my And I think that the first example of the first examples will be that no vaccine. And the result that we have. So one of the first examples, like a cyclos, with patitas, like a liba. All the vertices of the cyclohecumo. The cyclone in one. And not only, if we empendo the amibas, but first definite amidst, that we have global de las que aquinoble, but what are some vertices more and this is local, or this complete as the symmetric group, so. So, I will global. So, what significant is that we can move here as well? This patita, the puenos ponero la paraca o hacal quer patita, la puenos mover paraca incluso estas taminas, puimos move paraca. Y sucer y agregas more vertices. So, if you have a child of vertices, what you can do with these global mobility completability. Mobile completment, a otrotices entonces like. I think, well, one of the pero queries for their important information has programmed a photo for orbital. Programming in photos for the voyage, for example, more temporary to the character of the character.
