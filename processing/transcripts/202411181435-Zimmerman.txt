Generate a model for ringdown in specific theories. And this is a super fast one slide for some work I was doing with my student, Asad Hussein, on how we might do this. So the idea is we have a theory beyond GR, and that might have changes to Einstein's equations. It also might have new kinds of fields, which are generated by strong curvature effects. And so you have a metric which is perturbed both from the Kerr metric of the black hole, but you also might have additional fields. But you also might have additional fields. Then you ask, how does this affect ring down? You need to perturb both the fields and the metric, and so you have this complicated system of both field perturbations and metric perturbations forming a ring down. We showed how to project this onto the standard Tikulski equation for understanding the ring down of rotating black holes. And the result is the standard Tikulski wave equation plus some perturbing operator. And then from there, we propose that we can. And then from there, we proposed that we could use some old methods that I had helped develop with some collaborators at this point long ago, basically using traditional quantum mechanical perturbation theory, where we can take those perturbing operators, integrate them against the background solutions to the gravitational waves that we understand how to make, and therefore predict the shifts to the spectrum. This gives us a prediction. It gives us a general model, a general framework for calculating these shifts. We can then directly test them. And so as a first step, Testing. And so, as a first step, Assad applied this to a problem that various people have solved in various ways, which is: can we constrain the charges of black holes just from their ringdown? This is a great toy model because a charged black hole, when it's ringing down, you have the ring down in both its electromagnetic fields from its charge, as well as the metric. And so, it's a technically challenging problem to solve. And so, Assad used our methods to predict the ring-down spectrum, used the ring-down analysis code. Wring down analysis code that Wilfire and Max EC put together and did some constraints from some black holes. You can see 15914 and 190521 here. Both the charge and the spin, importantly, are constrained to lie in some quadrant. Really, it's the charge squared that affects the signal. So you only care about the positive branch of the charge. And both of them have to lie below the extremal limit. So they lie in some sort of constrained space like this. And unfortunately, the Like this. And unfortunately, the observations are fairly broad, so the hope was to combine the observations hierarchically and really constrain the population of charges. But in doing this, Assad realized that he was running into a technical problem that many people have run into when doing population analysis, and that's that the area we really care about drawing and constraint about is actually at the very edge of the allowed parameter space, right? Because we think real astrophysical black holes are not charged. Real astrophysical black holes are not charged. And so we've got this nice distribution on our population model, but we really need to accurately evaluate it right there in the corner. And this is really hard. People care about this in astrophysics because they might want to understand how likely is it that all of our black holes are actually non-spinning, right? Which is something multiple groups have written papers trying to diagnose. And so this set us on a long, on Assad really on a long journey. He went ahead and figured. Long journey. He went ahead and figured out new methods for doing population inference when you have compact population distributions or when you care about getting really accurate inferences at the edges. This required solving a huge number of technical problems. And he went off and basically wrote his own population analysis code, GravPOP, which we've recently released. We realized this would be interesting for something a little bit more normal than charged black hole ringdown or test of GR. And so he also applied it to spin magnitudes. Spin magnitudes for the GBTC3 black holes. So, allowing now two truncated Gaussian distributions, so a two-population model, including correlations in magnitude space, what we have is tentative evidence that there are actually two distinct populations of binary black holes. One is sort of has the spin properties we've known and seen for a long time. The primary needs to have some positive spin distribution, kind of concentrate. Distribution kind of concentrated around spin of 0.2. The secondary actually prefers to have absolutely zero spin. That's actually preferred from the Bayes factor analysis. But then there's also this other population where both black holes are rapidly spinning, and that actually contains about 20% black holes. And if you try to figure out which of the black holes probably lie in that population, they tend to be more massive, and they tend to prefer to actually be spin aligned. All of these statements are pretty tentative, and it'll be interesting to apply this model to a larger... To apply this model to a larger data set. But that's sort of our new thing. And I wanted to mention it because Sod's applying for postdocs. And he's really good. He can do both the ring-down calculations and write entire population synthesis code by himself with new and exciting methods. So you should take a look if he applies to your job. And I'm happy to discuss that more throughout the week if you're interested in the details there. They're really interesting details I barely understand. But the bulk of my talk, I actually wanted to talk about some. Bulk of my talk, I actually wanted to talk about something else, which is sort of an idea that we have a lot of parametrized tests in order to test to see whether or not the objects we're seeing are the ones we expect to be seeing, but we have fewer places where we're really using direct searches of the gravitational wave data for something entirely new. And so this was motivated by this study by my collaborators, Heng Chen Chia and Tom Edwards. What they pointed out is that there really is a discovery space still left over. There really is a discovery space still left over. Every time you tell a new audience about mesh filtering, they have the same question for you. Well, if you're doing mesh filtering, how do you find things we didn't expect? And that's a great question. And of course, we know that at low masses, sorry, at short durations, generally high masses, we have methods. We have unmodeled burst methods that are very good and can find shorter duration signals. But for fainter signals that are longer, those searches are not as effective. Effective. And in particular, you can imagine that you had some low-mass binary system whose properties deviate from our expectations for binary buckholes and binary Richan stars. And when the in-spiral goes on for a very long time, you can have a dephasing long enough that you really just kill your search, and you wouldn't be picking these things up at all. And so the idea was to develop new searches to actually target this parameter space, low-mass, inspiraling, exotic. In spiraling, exotic compact objects whose properties differ in some appreciable way from black holes and neutron stars. The cool thing about focusing on low-mass systems is we can actually do the modeling we need to develop a match filter search. And the reason for this is because, of course, when we're in the in-spiral phase, post-Newtonian theory tells us that we really don't care what these things are. They're just point particles dressed up with a few extra pieces of information that we know how they impact the signal. So they have spins, and we know how they. So, they have spins, and we know how the spins impact the signal. They might have intrinsic multipole moments. More importantly, they have these susceptibilities or polarizabilities, right? So, if an object is spinning, it squashes into an extra quadruple. That's the spin-induced quadrupole moment that influences the gravitational wave emission. You can also, of course, have tidal effects that we know very well from binary neutron star systems, which shape the black holes due to tidal effects. And these And these effects we can model as just three parameters in a post-Newtonian-driven inspiral. And so we can do a match filter search just allowing for these parameters to go well outside the expected range. And the great thing is that if you focus on just the inspiral, you don't need to worry about the unknown merger physics of these made-up theorists, fictitious objects, right? It doesn't matter. All you need to do is focus on what you can actually control from the theoretical side. And so. And so, the natural challenge in proposing a new MASH filter search for new objects with arbitrary spin-induced quadriform moments, title deformabilities, is we're really expanding our search space a lot. So the standard searches are four-dimensional, two masses, and the aligned spin components. The more dimensions you add, the bigger the search space, the more difficult the search is. So as a first proof of principle, we decided that we would look for exotic stars which had negligible spins. Stars which had negligible spins. That means that we know what the very first finite size effect is. It's a tidal deformability. And so we're going to allow for these objects to have potentially large tidal deformabilities. And there was one subtle new theoretical modeling thing that I really would be happy to tell people about if you're interested in hearing, which is that it turns out that when you make these tidal formabilities large or these spin quadratical moments large, these objects actually reach an innermost stable circular orbit. Reach an innermost stable circular orbit earlier than you would expect, and they can actually plunge and merge well before they would contact. Okay, and that introduces actually a new cutoff into the waveform model that you have to put in, that if you don't put in, you get some pretty gross time-demand waveform models when you try to then implement the search in GST law. So, that was a nightmare that we eventually figured out. So, that's straightforward to deal with. So, the target space we're going to look at here is the title of. Look at here is the tidal form abilities, lambda tilde, the combined one that leads at 5p in order, above 10 to the 3, leading off all the way to 10 to the 7. This seems enormous, but you've got to go large because it turns out that binary black hole templates are perfectly good at picking up neutron stars where lambda tilde can go to 10 to the 3 and above. But if you go beyond this, this is a plot of the effectualness of a standard BBH model to these large tidal deformabilities, you really start to lose your ability to detect these. Lose your ability to detect these when the tidal form abilities grow so large. This slide is just to emphasize that there are actual, kind of reasonable, real models for the kinds of stars you might expect. Most of them posit that you have some new scalar field, some new massive scalar field. And this is another cool side, of course, of gravitational wave astronomy. It turns out that if you're looking for very, very light scalar fields with masses 10 to the minus 10 to 10 to the minus 14 dB, these have Minus 14 eB. These have Compton wavelengths at scales similar to or bigger than the size of the compact objects we look for. And so they can actually have astrophysical scales and be relevant for astrophysics. The classic example would be if the scalar field condenses under its own gravity and forms a boson star. This is an easy place to generate enormous tidal deformabilities. 10 to the 3 is the baseline, but if the mass below m max, if the mass is something M max, if the mass is something below, say, 8.4 solar masses, then the factor of 10 here gives you some huge enhancement. Another one that's received a lot of attention is these so-called gravitational atoms. That's just the idea that, does this work? Yeah, that's just the idea that if you look at the potential for the scalar field outside of a spinning black hole, you actually have this trapping region which causes you to spontaneously generate scalar field material in this region, the shape the scalar field can come. The shape of the scalar field can kind of look like this. It grows by robbing spin energy from the black holes, and the end result is the black hole surrounded by this cloud of bosonic material, which can again give it these enormous tidal deformabilities. These are searched for also by looking at the spin distribution of black holes, but we wanted to look for it directly. So there's multiple different sort of simple beyond standard model physics that, if they're in the right parameter ranges, could really generate macroscopic. Could really generate macroscopic objects that we could search for with these searches. So, just a few words on the modeling in the template bank. We used Taylor F2 with the 5PM title terms. As I said, when you have large lambdas, you can cause a plunge very early, so you have to put in a sort of smooth cutoff frequency. And then we use the template bank construction approach used by the IAS search code, which basically breaks up the parameter space into which template. Into which templates have similar amplitude evolutions, gives those all the same amplitudes, and then provides a phase decomposition, which is sort of an S V D phase decomposition. And the only machine learning I've ever had any involvement in is hiding in here a little bit. Jay Watakar figured out a sort of random forest regressor to enhance our ability to capture the phasing with only three model parameters. The effectualness of these. The effectualness of these templates is pretty high, but not quite as high as we generally look for in gravitational wave searches. And because things are grouped by the amplitude shape, the template banks themselves are divided into sub-banks, which kind of actually have a weird shape in mass and tidal formability space. These banks are really shaped by when that cutoff happens, when the objects suddenly plunge and merge together. In any case, In any case, we used the IAS's search code to carry out this search, focusing on a moderate sort of system of total masses. It would have been nice to go to lighter mass systems, but that of course makes for a much more expensive search. We carried out the search. These are our results. And you can see that the actual foregrounds that were measured versus IFAR are totally consistent with the background and all of the observational data we looked at. Data we looked at. We did, however, detect many previously known black holes. I've got a few slides on that that I'll mention. And since we didn't have any particular detections, we could use this standard method to set a rate constraint, which in turn could in principle be used to sort of constrain these beyond standard physics models. It's hard to directly use these rate constraints to then say, oh, there are no scalar fields with masses of 10 to the minus 10 UVs. That's because, of course, you need a whole structure. Of course, you need a whole structure where you would form boson stars, where they would find each other, and where they would eventually merge. But these rate constraints should inform us about beyond standard model pivots. As I said, we do detect many black holes that were already known. So for example, 190412 is detected at a very high significance, both with this two-mass only, no spins, and tides model, as it is for a normal phenomenon sort of thing. And so this is interesting. Sort of thing. And so this is interesting. We can actually detect, with no spins in our model, a lot of the binary block holes that we would detect otherwise. So we went ahead and dug a little bit deeper into this to understand it. We did some parameter estimation. And this appears to be due to the fact that there's really quite a large degeneracy between chi-effective and the tidal love number. So presumably, by allowing for tides in our search, we've been able to pick up spinning binary black holes by allowing for a large tidal probability. For a large time of probability. That means that we recover with these models sort of biased chirp masses, and we can also use our detected set of binary black holes to draw some constraints on the tidal formability of black holes. I don't think we're the only people that have done this, but you could just as well. Okay, that's what we did. We actually did carry out the search. It would have been lovely to have a good candidate for you for us all to be excited about, but you can't always expect that. Looking ahead, though, that's not actually. Looking ahead, though, that's not actually where we wanted to start. Because the title deformability is actually way up at 5p in order. It is not the first finite size effect you run into. The very first finite size effect you run into is this extra quadruple moment coming from having a spin on your body. This comes in at the 2pn order, so presumably if you had any spins at all, this is the most important thing that you should be looking for. Black holes have a dimensionless spin. Dimensionless spin quadruple parameter of one, neutron stars less than 10. So within this range of kappas, our searches are good. But if you take kappa too large, your searches have the potential for missing these. And that's actually the target system that my collaborators, Hong Chen Chi and Tom Edwards, focused on in their original report. They pointed out that if you had some boson star that was spinning, its cap was like 500, and you just aren't good at detecting it with our existing searches. Searches. So we set out originally actually to tackle that problem. This is a six-dimensional parameter space. You've got two masses, two spins, and two spin quadruple parameters that you want to take large. And so we set out to try to dimensionally reduce this problem. That's something that a normal person might use some sort of SVD decomposition to do. I'm kind of weird. I thought I could do it all theoretically. I was actually influenced by Ajit's paper, sort of studying the importance. Sort of studying the important combinations of parameters during InSpiral that one can use to parametrize your models. And so you can define this effective PN spin parameter, which actually captures fully the leading PN spin effects. And we went on to try to develop effective parameters, which captured as many effects as possible when you have these large spin-induced quadratical moments. And the result was actually that with a four-dimensional model, we could do incredibly well. So this outcome was, I think, really. Well. So, this outcome was, I think, really surprising for us. What we're showing here is we constructed a template bank using the IAS result. We inject a population of exotic binaries, with very large bin quadruple moments being a possibility, into this, and we figure out what is our effectualness, that is to say, our maximum match across the whole bank. And the cumulative effectualness is really quite bad for binary black holes. They come in and they all. They come in and they all have effectualness of sort of below 0.9 with a mean effectualness of like 0.6 in this model. So you really would miss binary black holes with this, you really would miss these exotic objects with the traditional binary black hole search. But our four-dimensional and five-dimensional truncations have an effectualness of like 0.999 mean effectualness. So they you just don't need all six parameters to detect these things, and so this should in principle be a four-dimensional search. Will be a four-dimensional search. We also wanted to be able to build template banks through this approach, and so my collaborators wrote a paper led by Adam Coogan and Tom Edwards, actually building on a random template placement method by Chris, in order to try to basically have a code base that could very easily for the user generate new template banks given some model. And the only innovation, not the only, the innovation Innovation, not the only, the innovation over the old work by Chris is that we had trouble with the weird shape of parameter space here. And so it's essentially a two-step model where first we dust the parameter space with some live points, then we employ the random placement where you place the points totally randomly with the probability drawn by the local signal space volume. So there's a lot of volume at low chirp mass, less volume at high chirp mass. So you try to randomly place your templates. Randomly place your templates below chart masses, and you don't really care that there's a lot of overlap of them. You're sort of seeking a statistical statement on your coverage. So, what my collaborators did to handle the corners is sort of dust this with live points, start to lay down templates, and to continue until a sufficient number of the live points had been covered. Sort of a combination of random and stochastic templates. And the purpose here was just to be able to have a very easy, fast way of constructing template banks. They're not the most. Template banks, they're not the most optimal in terms of number of templates, but they're very easy to make. So we generated these templates, we have a nice model, and that's all I can tell you because we had trouble actually searching for the spin quadrupole systems. So if you'd like to hear more about that, come talk to me. But that's TBD to actually implement our template banks, our waveform models, and search now for spinning exotic stars so that I can one day come. Stars, so that I can one day come to you with rate constraints on those, or much more optimistically, maybe even an interesting candidate. So I'll leave my summary up here and take questions. Thank you. You had mentioned four donations, so which parameters you left out and was, I want to guide you. Yeah, yeah, this is, so this is sort of discussed in this paper. It is the cleverness, quote-unquote, that took some work. Quote unquote, that took some work. So our parameters are M1, M2, a G chi parameter, which takes in the full 1.5 PN spin contributions, and then something which basically captures all the effects at 2 PM, and then an optional parameter captures all the effects at 3 PM. Both of these are actually tuned to pick up a little bit more spin information. So these are new parameters, non-physical. It's essentially a brute force by hand S V D. We figured out the best parameters to use. The best parameters to use. Four were with Kappa, TPNN Kappa. Yeah, and so these four alone are sufficient to get 999% effectualness. So that's really surprising, actually. So I actually have a question about a SOLIDS project.
