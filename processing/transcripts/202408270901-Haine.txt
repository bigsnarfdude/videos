And sorry, I could not be there. It's always a great pleasure to be in band, both because of the conference and because of the surroundings. Yeah, so I guess how I usually think of things is that there are kind of three primary intersections between homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. One that I won't talk about One that I won't talk about, but Mura will talk about in the next talk, is motivic homotopy theory. And we already saw maybe a bit of this in Vicki's talk yesterday. And then this talk, I'll focus on two things which are a little bit separate. So kind of the first half of the talk will be talking a little bit about derived algebraic geometry. And mostly what I want to do is explain why, if you haven't Why, if you haven't already drunk the Kool-Aid, you might be interested in some of these tools. And then the second part, I'll talk about atoll homotopy theory. Okay. Yeah. One other thing to say is that I put the slides on my website, like on the kind of front page. So if you want to look back and Want to look back, and I mean, please feel free to tell me to go to the previous slide. But if you don't want to do that, you can just look on my website. And it's very easy to find. So, yeah, why should we try to inject home at huppy theory into algebraic geometry? And the first reason you might find this a nice thing to do to try to use how much huppy theory. To try to use how much Huppy Theory or the theory of higher categories is something that's not really about the spaces we're considering, but something beyond spaces, which is the categories. So one thing that you get somehow for free from working not with triangulated categories or ordinary categories is better descent results. So let me just So, let me just give a sampling of three things. So, the first one is that there's a functor that sends a topological space to its derived infinity category of sheaves of abelian groups, for example. And we learn very quickly that if you put the ordinary derived category, these things don't. Doesn't these things don't glue, and the failure to glue is because we've not remembered enough information instead of remembering like that two maps or how two maps are homotopic, chain homotopic, we only remember that they are chain homotopic. And that passage to isomorphism classes makes the sheaf condition no longer true. Makes the sheaf condition no longer true. But once you pass to this setup of higher categories, since you're remembering all sorts of higher data, you're not remembering just kind of some naive HOM, but the whole like RHUM complex. You actually get a sheaf of infinity categories. Similarly, if you look at the functor that sends a scheme to its director, A scheme to its derived infinity category of quasi-coherent sheaves. And for me, this is the unbounded derived infinity category. This satisfies flat descent. So it's an FPQC sheaf of infinity categories. Another maybe fun example is if you look at the functor that sends a topological space to the complex of Of that's not the complex of singular co-chains. So that's not a sheaf when you think of that as an actual functor to the ordinary category of chain complexes because simplex might not factor through each piece of some open cover. And it's also not a sheaf. Not a sheaf if you work in the ordinary home and huppy category. That's the ordinary triangulated derived category. But if you really work with this infinity categorical enhancement, it becomes a sheaf. And so let me try to say a little bit more about why you might care about this type of result, but also if there are any. But also, if there are any questions, please let me know. Peter, can I just ask a super naive question? Are these infinity enhancements sort of these derived categories? Is there a unique way to do that enhancement or is there lots of different ways? So often there's a unique way. So Ben Antio has a great paper called On the Uniqueness of Infinite Categorical Enhancements of Derived Categories. And he proves a bunch of And he proves a bunch of results that say, like, under some pretty mild hypotheses, there will be unique enhancements. So, that's also unique is up to some sort of equivalence, I guess. Yeah, yes. Yeah, so you can say, okay, what's the kind of space or infinity groupoid of possible enhancements? And then you prove that that space is contractible. Yeah. So yeah. Any other questions? Okay. So why might you care about this? Well, one reason is this type of descent result, once you prove this descent for these sheaf categories, an immediate consequence is that you get descent for the r gammas. So the co- R gammas. So the cohomology, but thought of as a complex valued in an appropriate derived infinity category, like of abelian groups or whatever. And an immediate consequence of that is cohomological descent spectral sequences for the cohomology. So this is, you know, often computationally what we're used to using. However, maybe if you've ever tried to like Maybe, if you've ever tried to go through the details of how the proofs of those things usually work, they're quite finicky. Like Brian Conrad has these famous notes about chromological dissent, which are like 60 pages long and wonderful, but extremely technical. And one maybe surprising fact is it often turns out to be easier to prove these types of results and you just immediately deduce. Just immediately deduce these other two things than to prove these homological descent results directly. And then you've proven a more powerful theorem as well. So let me just, I mean, for the, there's other things I want to say in this talk, so I don't want to maybe spend the entire time doing that. But maybe let me just say if you're interested in that idea. You're interested in that idea and trying to see that in practice. A great case study of this is this fantastic paper by Bott and Matthew called The Arc Topology, where they're interested in some refinements of the H topology and the V topology, which they call the arc topology, and they do a bunch of cool things with this. But in that, they prove various descent results, for example, that like construct the That, like, constructive, the derived infinity category of constructible et al. sheaves satisfies this arc to set. And maybe, from a conceptual point of why it might be easier to prove this, it's because you start to have additional maps that you didn't have before taking sheets. And the kind of main thing, like input, is that there's a specific result relating base change and descent. So, on the level of So, on the level of sheaf categories, you know, for every map, you don't just get a functor, but you get a pullback, push-forward, a junction. And there's a general result that goes back to like, I don't know, Beck or something, but has a nice formulation due to Lurie that says, like, essentially, if you can check some kind of conservativity of a pullback functor and some base change condition, which you always Some base change condition, which you always want, like so often, you know, you prove proper base change or something like this, then you immediately get some dissent. And so they explain how that applies in many situations. The second thing is with these tools, you can often get more conceptual proofs of old results with fewer assumptions. With fewer assumptions, as well as prove some new results. So, let me just give an example of this. So, three from the last slide was saying that the functor that sends a topological space to this complex of singular co-chains is a sheaf. And an almost immediate consequence of this, and the fact that Of this, and the fact that this r gamma is a sheaf, is that if you have a space which is locally weakly contractible, so that just means you know, around any point, there's some neighborhood where it's path connected and all of the higher homotopy groups vanish. So, for example, if it's locally contractible, then sheaf cohomology and singular cohomology agree. Cohomology agree. And it's not just about the groups, but actually these complexes are canonically quasi-isomorphic. And so classically, people only prove this, well, first of all, without this weak here, so slightly stronger assumption. Maybe that's not that important, but also assuming para-compactness. And the argument is quite technical, involving all sorts of things about flat. Involving all sorts of things about Flask and soft or whatever, sheaves, and somehow not very conceptual. But the kind of conceptual summary is that, well, if this is a sheaf and this is a sheaf, as long as I can write down a map between them, in order to check that they're the same, I can check this on a basis. So since the space is locally, weakly. So, since a space is locally weakly contractible, well, on any weakly contractible open, this is just Z concentrated in degree zero. So if you can check that for this, then you're done. And it turns out that you can do that, and it's not very hard. So somehow that's somehow something you can explain to someone easily where, I don't know, the classical argument is somewhere else. The classical argument is somehow much more complicated than this conceptually. Any questions about this? Yeah, I have a question. Yeah. Infinity category setting, often writing down the map is the difficult part. Is that clear? Here it's actually easy because, I mean, what happens is that you I mean, what happens is that you're you want to write down something from, I guess, to the so I think the natural map in this case goes in this way. And the point is it's to the global sections of something. So it's to a right adjoint applied to something. So you can also formulate it in a different way in which it's more obvious how the map goes. Yeah. But yeah, yeah. Any other questions? Okay. So now I want to talk a little bit about more like, okay, so that's about maybe the categorical framework why you might want these tools. Now I want to talk about a bit more about derived algebraic geometry. Geometry. And so I'll just quickly say one of the maybe most commonly stated motivations, which I won't say much about because probably this is the one that everyone has heard, is about intersection theory. So, you know, we all love Bezou's theorem, which in the formulation that I think is nice for this as, you know, say, For this, says you know, say you have two smooth curves that intersect transversely inside of P2, and then one formulation of this result is to say that if you take their fundamental classes and you cup them together, you get the fundamental class of the intersection, which is just counting the number of points. But if they intersect non-transversely, but still in a finite number of points, But still, in a finite number of points, you don't get inequality here, you get a strict inequality. And so you might want a world in which this statement is true, even for a non-transverse intersection. So the idea is to deal with this non-transverse intersection. You should try to somehow work in a world where you replace somehow work in a world where you replace the pullback by a derived enhancement that's locally modeled on the derived tensor product. And then you have to make sense of in what sense that derived tensor product is a ring. And okay, this is, you know, there's a lot of wonderful things to say here, but probably this is the thing people are most familiar with. So I don't want to say more right now. But the thing But the thing I want to focus a little bit on is something that already appeared in, I think, both Dhruv and Adil's talks, which is this hidden smoothness philosophy. And yeah, if you want to read more about this, Adil has written these wonderful notes on derived algebraic geometry in which he proves the thing I will state. Proves the thing I will state on the next slide. But the philosophy is that many classical moduli stacks are in some sense poorly behaved, like being not smooth or being LCI or to the wrong dimension or having this Murphy's law of the keel where they kind of have every possible bad singularity type. But they have derived refinements that are. Derived refinements that are better behaved. And so here's the type of result in that vein. So say you have some X, which is smooth and proper over a field, and you look at one of the following moduli problems, but you look at its derived enhancement. So it could be about vector bundles or coherent sheaves or principles. Coherent sheaves or principal bundles for some algebraic group. Then the result is that so this moduli derived moduli space, it has a cotangent complex, which is a perfect complex. And it has some features of being smooth, excuse me, in some homotopical sense. So the torr amplitude. So, the torr amplitude is going to be bounded by the dimension minus one. So, if you're a curve, then this is saying it's smooth. If you're a surface, this is like being LCI or being quasi-smooth. So, this already somehow appeared in Adiel's talk. On the other hand, the classical Um, the classical stack is very singular and has unbounded cotangent complex in general. So, I mean, in the low dimensions, it can be kind of fine, but in high dimensions, you have this unboundedness of the cotangent complex. So, that's one real benefit of working in this derived setup. And I think it may be the case that the only place where this specific result is proven. Where the specific result is proven is in Adeal's notes. So I would recommend looking there. Any questions about this kind of motivation? Okay. So are there other examples? Maybe there's mention. So are there other like these are the examples that a lot of us have worked with but are there other interesting examples beyond like one two three that sort of this applied? One, two, three, that sort of disapplies to? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, integrated with HIGS or something. I mean, probably another example is this thing that appeared in Adele's talk yesterday as well, of like moduli of extensions. I would guess this is another example. I mean, I think it's pretty, yeah, pretty common. So here's another reason, maybe, to be interested in these tools, which is some underived statements, meaning like the statement of some results does not, I mean, does not reference anything derived at all. But the proof somehow is quite nice and very natural. And it just happens that, you know. That you naturally use some derived tools in the proof. So, one thing that I like that's like this, which was my first pandemic project of trying to read this with some people when we had no idea how many millions of things would happen over Zoom during the pandemic and be totally overwhelmed. Is absolute purity for flat cohomology. So, this was something proven by Chesnovitchius and Schulze in 2019, I believe. So, the setup is that you start with a noetherian ring that's local and it's also a complete intersection. And G should be a finite flat commutative group. That commutative group over this ring. Then the claim is that if you take the local cohomology of spec R with respect to this point M, and that cohomology is flat cohomology, then it's zero below the dimension. And then you can put less than or equal to if R is regular and not a field. Is regular and not a field. There's a kind of more conceptual statement of this result, which is also global, which is about a scheme and the complement of an open sub-scheme of sufficiently high codimension. So it's a kind of Hartog's result. But I stated it this way just because it, you know, this statement only really involves commutative algebra. Algebra. You only really need commutative algebra to state this. So it's in some sense very not derived at all. But their proof really naturally takes a path through using some derived tools. And it's a really quite wonderful result. So, yeah, I won't say much about the proof because it's like quite a long paper, but their introduction is quite. Introduction is quite nice. Okay, any questions about this? Okay, so I thought it's probably a good idea to say something about how the setup. Something about how the setup of this works. But you know, this is some kind of long story. So I was trying to think: what's possible to say, which is useful if you have not seen this before, and doesn't take the entire time and still be not formative at all. So hopefully, this will be some answer to that. And so, somehow, the conceptual point is once you have this kind of Once you have this kind of theory of higher categories set up, and I think now, as opposed to even like, I don't know, seven years ago, things are such that, you know, one can kind of come in and, as a working mathematician, start to use this stuff without, you know, having to read the entirety of Hierotopo's theory or something, which I tried to do in one summer before grad school, and I can't. Grad school, and I can't say I was so successful. But anyway, so if you kind of, you know, accept that this kind of category theory works and that now you can write arguments that don't involve manipulating simplicial sets for years. Then the main obstruction to start getting started with this derived algebraic geometry. Derived algebraic geometry is if you take the functor of points perspective seriously, you decide that's how you should set up a scheme theory. And then the main obstruction is to just figure out what the category of rings is. And the traditional way this was done was using simplicial commutative rings. And this is And this is something that's maybe okay for homotopy theorists because we're used to having worked with symplexual sets, but maybe it's not the most accessible for other people. So what I want to do is try to describe some alternative perspective, which is equivalent to this, but somehow I think conceptually quite satisfying. And so to And so, to describe this, I want to explain some alternative description of the category of rings, or more generally, the category of R algebras for our ring. So, you know, maybe in some sense, every R algebra, it's built from polynomial R algebras. Polynomial are algebras. And so I want to be very somehow organized in the way I think of that. And the theorem is that the category of R algebras is obtained from this category polyR of finitely generated R algebras by freely adjoining two types of operations. So the first is So, the first is filtered co-limits. So, that operation allows you to build from finitely generated R algebras, infinitely generated R algebras, or with any types of generators, because you can just take some set and filter it by finite subsets. And then reflexive coequalizers. So, these are co-equalizers where you have a map backwards, and so that when you go up and down, So, that when you go up and down or up and down, you get the identity. So, these are quotients, but they're somehow the types of quotients that appear in very canonical resolution. So, what do I mean by this category is obtained from this category by freely adjoining some kinds of operations? Well, the meaning of this. Well, the meaning of this is that if I have some category D, which has these types of co-limits, then there's an equivalence of categories between functors from commutative R algebras to D, which have the property that they preserve filtered co-limits, and they also preserve these types of quotients, and just functors from polynomial R algebras to D. And that's that equivalence that. That equivalence, the easy direction to write down is this one, and it's just given by restriction. So, what that tells you is that actually any functor from polynomial R algebras to such a D, it will extend uniquely up to unique isomorphism to a functor from commutative R algebras to D that preserves filtered collimates and also preserves these. Colimids and also preserves these reflexive co-equalizers. All right, could you just explain the reflexive co-equalizers again? Maybe even just say exactly what you said before again. Oh, yeah, yeah. So it's a co-limit of a diagram that looks like this, where you have, let's call it F, G, and S, and S is a simultaneous section of F and G. So F So f doing f after s is equal to the identity is equal to g after s. Okay, and so concretely, how do I get quotients of polynomial rings from this? Yeah, so you can always write a resolution of a ring by saying you take the ring, you take the polynomial ring on the underlying set of the ring, and then you do that like one more time. That, like, one more time, and you get a resolution like this. So, of course, that's a kind of huge resolution. Maybe you don't want to take that particular huge resolution, but it's completely canonical. Okay. So, yeah, the kind of benefit of this perspective is that if you want to define any kind To define any kind of functor out of commutative R algebras that's going to behave well with quotients, and then filtered collimates somehow is not such a strong condition, then you only need to do it on polynomial algebras. So maybe as a kind of analogy of something people in this audience may be more familiar with, is if you think about how the cotangent How the cotangent complex is defined. You kind of say, Well, what do I know? I know how to define it for smooth things. And then what I'm going to do in general is I'm just going to resolve everything by smooth things and then somehow make an argument that says that no matter how I resolve by smooth things, it's unique. And this is a kind of more organized mathematical presentation of that type of idea. It says, Of idea that it says there's actually an equivalence of category. So instead of like writing down a resolution and then saying, you know, if I chose any other resolution, I can find like a simultaneous one that I will get the same answer. You just have an equivalence of categories. So instead of kind of proving that you have a groupoid of choices, which is connected, by proving this equivalence of categories, you're saying you have a contractible groupoid of extensions. GroupOID-BAST actions. Let me also say that there's an explicit description of whenever you have a category with finite co-products of this universal gadget, which is generated from it by filtered co-limits and reflective co-equalizers. So actually, So actually, this category of commutative R algebras is equivalent to the category of functors from the opposite of polynomial R algebras to the category of sets that send coproducts in polynomial R algebras, which are the tensor product, to finite products in here. So that's just some explicit way of describing that. Okay. Any questions about this? I know this is maybe not how people are used to thinking about commutative rings. The purpose so far has been to make big objects alongside our small objects. Is that protective? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then what we can do is And then what we can do is we can say, okay, can we somehow modify what we're doing here to do the same thing to define our kind of derived enhancement of commutative rings? And so the answer is yes. So the infinity category of, I think, what now people call animated are algebras. This terminology is due to Dustin Clausen and I guess popularized by Schulze, but it goes back to some term of Balanson, which is kind of fun. But the thing I'm writing down is actually equivalent to the infinity category you get from taking simplicial commutative R algebras and then inverting weak homotopy equivalences between them. Weak homotopy equivalences between them. So it is what people traditionally did, but I think somehow it's easier to understand. So it's the universal, not one category, but infinity category obtained from this category of polynomial or algebras by adjoining two operations. One is filtered co-limits. So same as before. So basically, you just want to get now all. Get now all polynomial R algebras generated by any number of generators and co-limits of now simplicial objects. So those simplicial objects, I mean, this first part is a reflexive co-equalizer, but they extend out forever. And, well, it turns out that actually. It turns out that actually, in the previous slide, if I had said the universal one category obtained by joining filtered collimates and collimates of simplicial objects, that would have been the same answer. And the reason is whenever you have a simplicial object like this and you calculate its co-limit in a one category, it turns out you only need to calculate the co-limit of this co-equalizer. Like somehow, since everything maps to here, Everything maps to here, you can just check by hand that the co-limit of this giant diagram will just be the co-equalizer of these two arrows. So, but in higher category theory, you really need to look at the whole thing. So that's like remembering some higher data about your resolution. So, what So, what that says is that this infinity category of animated R algebras, it has this universal property that if I have an infinity category D with these types of co-limits, so for example, if it has all co-limits, and I look at functors from here to D that both preserve filtered collimates and they preserve Co-limits, and they preserve co-limits of simplicial objects, which I write this because that's the traditional name for this category that indexes this. Then it's equivalent to the category of functors from polynomial R algebras to D. So, why is this useful? Well, what this presentation tells you is that if you want to define Is that if you want to define any kind of reasonable functor out of these animated R algebras, which is an infinity category and maybe we're scared of, we don't know how to work with. Actually, you just need to define it on polynomial R algebras. So all of the things you know how to do, like maybe you say write down the derived infinity. The derived infinity category of modules over some polynomial R algebra. If you can just write that down, it says you're allowed to extend it uniquely to all of these things. So somehow it reduces your work from understanding actually how to deal with homotopy theory to saying, as long as I want. As long as I want everything to be kind of built out of simple things from polynomial algebras, I can just define everything on polynomial algebras. Let me ask a naive one. So the thing on the right is those are just ordinary categories and ordinary functions? No, so these are infinity categories. So D should be an infinity category with these types of collimits. With these types of co-limits. So, for example, just all co-limits is usually the case. And then this is an infinity category. So this is functors from a one category to an infinity category, which is generally an infinity category. But in practice, what often happens is that the functor from the one category to this infinity category, maybe it factors through some one. It factors through some one category already. Like, for example, if you look at something like, you know, you want to look at the relative cotangent complex, well, for polynomial R algebras, it factors through the one category because it's just Kayler differentials. So that's a kind of maybe magic is that when you try to define things on this level, Define things on this level, like still a priori, you might have to write down a functor to an infinite category, but in practice, you often don't because things are so simple. Yeah. But even for the Taylor difference, isn't there like a base change subjectivity map that comes in somewhere? Then you need to go through that. Then it stops. That's good. Yeah, so that is a bit more complicated. So that is a bit more complicated, but it is possible to deal with this and not so horrible, actually. Yeah. Any other questions? Is there going to be a last line on that page? On the previous page, that was like a one-line definition of what the thing actually is. So is there a similar timing of that? Yeah, perfect timing of that question. So it's exactly the same thing, except we just change the coefficients here to be this infinity category of spaces or infinity groupoids or con complexes. I mean, now people have many names for this. But somehow the point is that, yeah, so we look at functors from polynomial or algebras op to this infinity category of spaces, which send tens. Which send tensor here, which is the coproduct, to product here. And that's what this thing is. So actually, this kind of perspective, it has a name which is called animation, or people previously called it the non-abelian derived category. And so somehow And so, somehow, the general setup, there's something more general you can say is many categories that arise in algebra, for example, this, you know, our algebras, but also our modules, many other things like this, they have this property that they're generated by some smaller collection of objects. So, for like our modules, finitely generated projective modules. Finitely generated projective modules generate under filtered co-limits and reflexive co-equalizers. So, actually, in that case, if you run the same story, so I know R modules is equivalent to this type of thing where I replace this with finitely projective R modules, finitely generated projective R modules. If I do the same story and ask for the infinity categorical version of this, I get the connective part. Version of this, I get the connective part of the derived category. So that's, and then you can kind of think about how the story of writing down derived functors works at that level. And yeah, there's a nice story there. Any other questions? Why is the last statement an explicit version of the statement? Version of this statement. Um like are you asking why uh why this is true? Yeah, and yeah, so there's a yeah, so there's um yeah, maybe I should have written equivalence here, but I think I copied it from the previous slide. So I didn't. So I mean, it's something that you have to prove. I mean, it's something that you have to prove, but you can prove in general. And basically, the point is that this type of co-limit and this type of collimit, they generate all of what's called sifted co-limits. And these are the co-limits, which are exactly the co-limits that commute with finite products in the infinite category of spaces. On the previous slide, sorry, on the previous slide, okay, maybe I cannot easily. Okay, maybe I cannot easily move to that. In the category of sets, the co-limits which commute with finite products are exactly the ones which can be built out of filtered co-limits and reflexive co-equalizers. So if you're familiar with like construction of IND objects, so like IND objects you can think of as you look at like all pre-sheaves and then you look at the ones that can be built as filtered co-limits of representable pre-sheaves. This has a similar construction, and somehow, because like for int objects, because finite, I mean, you have this commutation with finite limits, you can describe them in terms of some finite limit preserving functors. Here, it's because of this kind of complementary thing. Yeah, sorry, maybe this is too vague, but it's something that one has to prove, but is not particularly. Something that one has to prove, but is not particularly horrible, actually. Okay, maybe if there are no more urgent questions, maybe I can move on to the second topic. So if you, I don't know, didn't like the categorical thing, you can tune back in. And now we're going to do something else. So, the second thing I want to talk about is atol homotopy theory. And so, the atoll homotopy type is something that was defined by Arden and Maser in the late 60s. I mean, kind of amazing how early they were able to define this. And then it was refined a bit by Friedlander in the early 80s. But I think it didn't get a lot. I think it didn't get a lot of use for a while because somehow they were like so before their time that they were able to give a definition, but it was quite difficult to use and had no universal property. But even so, it was used by Sullivan and Freelander following a sketch of Quillen to prove something called the atoms conjecture in topology, which is about complex k-theory. Complex K-theory. And more recently, Mark Oywa gave a new definition of it using a tool of Jacob Lurie called shape theory. So it's something that uses his tools of higher dopos theory, but the nice thing is it has a universal property. And what I want to do is try to Is try to explain to you what type of thing this guy is and some interesting results in Atoll-Homme-Huppy theory. So what kind of gadget is it? So the whole idea behind it is you want to refine the etal fundamental group. You want to make the et al. fundamental group the actual fundamental group of some homotopical object. So you start with a scheme. So, you start with a scheme or even a stack, and the thing you get out is what we call a pro-finite space. So, this is a pro-object or some formal kind of inverse system of things called pi-finite spaces. So, these are spaces with finite pi-naught, and they also have finite homotopy groups, and then eventually above some point, they all vanish. So, the key thing about So, the key thing about this type of gadget, whatever it is, is it's some kind of thing which has homotopy groups, and those homotopy groups are profinite groups. Moreover, it's designed exactly so that the pi1 of this guy is pi1 atal. So it's some kind of homotopical gadget which refines this pi1 atal. Moreover, if you look at a finite If you look at a finite ring R, and it turns out you can make sense of cohomology of these types of pro-objects by extending it formally from spaces. Its cohomology is a tall cohomology. And in nice situations, like if you're smooth, this will also be true for some more general coefficients like. Like QL. However, if you're not smooth, you have to deal with the same problems that you already have at the level of fundamental groups, then why you need things like the ProETAL topology. So let me not say that. Another thing, which is essentially it's a universal property, if you state it sufficiently nicely, is that you, this gadget. This gadget knows exactly the entire derived category of lease or locally constant constructible sheaves with perfect stocks. So what the heck does this expression mean? Well, in this world of infinity categories, one nice thing is that our homotopy theory of spaces, you can think of them as infinity categories where every Infinity categories where every morphism is invertible. So it makes sense to talk about a functor from a space or infinity group point to some other infinity category. And then you can extend this to pro objects. So, you know, if, you know, I don't want to explain maybe the precise details of this, but the point is that classically you have this monochromy theorem that says. Theorem that says, you know, locally constant constructible sheaves of sets, you know, are representations of a tall pi one. That's even like it's defined to have that property. And this is just a refinement of that statement. And that's essentially expressing its universal property. So it knows everything about the derived category of locally constant constructible etal. Constant constructible et al. sheets. That's perfect. Yeah. So the demo. Oh, perfect is coming. Yeah, so they have perfect stocks. So the stocks should be perfect complexes. Also for finite coefficients? Yeah, also for finite coefficients. It's also true for like Zl coefficients, but if you're ZL coefficients, but if you want QL, it's already false at the level of pi one, so you need to do something fancier. And yeah, that's an interesting thing that I could say much about, but I think is more complicated already than what I will say. So maybe I'll leave that for now. So what happens? What happens when you input a field? Well, you just get one object profinite groupoid whose automorphisms is the Galois group of that field. That's one computation. There's a few other computations, like maybe one thing people often are familiar with is that pi1 atal of spec z is zero. And actually, the whole atal homotopy type of spec z is zero. Zero is contractible. I'll just mention that some work that I did with Clark Horwick and Saul Glassman also gives a new description of this that's in some sense more explicit. But for the purposes of this talk, yeah, I won't explain it, but it's just, I think if you want to understand it from just first. First principles, it's somehow easier to understand this explicit description. And that also has some applications, but that's a long story as to how we got to there. And I mean, too long for the 10 minutes I have left. So, what are the basic properties of this type of object? Well, if you want to not pay attention for the next five minutes. For the next five minutes, the summary is that anything you know about atoll cohomology is actually true at the level of the atoll homotopet. Of course, this is like a not precise mathematical statement, but let me give some examples. And this is the work of many, many people over many years. So, the first is that the kind of what I call fundamental exact sequence, sometimes people call homotopy exact sequence on pi one. Exact sequence on pi one that has a homotopical incarnation. So if you're over a field, then there's a fiber sequence going from the et al. homotopy type of the geometric fiber to et al. homotopy type of X to the etal homotopy type of the field. So, what does fiber sequence mean? It means really that you get a long exact sequence on the homotopy groups. On the homotopy groups. And since the higher homotopy of this is zero, it's really saying that for n at least two, the geometric part and the original guy have the same homotopy and the usual pi one exact sequence. So that's a refinement of that pi one exact sequence. Second result is a Riemann existence theorem. So usually what people say is, okay, if you take pipe, Will say, Is okay, if you take pi one of the complex points of a finite type C scheme and you profinitely complete it, you get pi one at all. And this is true actually on the level of homotopy types. So there's some kind of profinite completion for homotopy types. This is just my notation for homotopy type of x of c. And there's a natural math that becomes an equivalence after profinite completion. You also have Kunneth formulas. So, say you have a separably closed field of characteristic P, which is allowed, P is allowed to be zero. Then, you know, there's this usual statement about pi one commuting with products if one of the factors is proper. That's true at this level. There's another type of statement that is. That is after you complete away from the characteristic that pi one commutes with products, and that's true here. There's also things like Kuneth formula for symmetric powers. Those are true at this level too. And then just one, I don't know, other kind of random example is Like, just more obscure result, maybe, is like Gaber's affine analog of proper base change that's saying if you have a Henselian pair, then the cohomology of spec A and spec A mod I are the same. That's actually true at the level of atoll homotopy types. And there's many, many more results. So what I want to So, what I want to probably finish with is talking about how this can be used in anabelian geometry. So, this kind of question of Grotendieck in his letter to Faultings, well, he had this conjecture that if you look at a finitely generated field of characteristic zero and you fix certain quote-unquote Anabelian varieties, then there's a natural map from There's a natural map from isomorphisms between x and y, and then isomorphisms between their atol pi ones. Well, where you mod out by conjugation on the target and you make sure they're compatible with the map down to the base field, he conjectured that this should be bijection. So, somehow this at all plywunch. So, somehow, this et al pi one should know everything about these schemes. And yeah, yeah, so that's why I have this in red and in quotes. I will say something about this in a second, which is that we don't know. And that's the problem. But one example is Tamagawa and Mochizuki proved that this is true if X and Y are smooth hyperbolic. If X and Y are smooth hyperbolic curves. So that should be an example. But part of the issue with this program is that we don't really know what this term means. He said, okay, should be true often, but what does this mean? It's clearly some very restrictive condition. Like you can write down many examples where this map will not be even close to an isomorphism. And it's only really And it's only really reasonable if these x and y are atal kπ1, meaning this atol homotopy type doesn't have any higher homotopy. And that's a very restrictive condition in general. So one idea you might have is like, okay, I don't know what anabelian means. I mean, there's more about that that people do know that I'm not saying, but one. But one thing you might try to do is you replace in Grotonie's conjecture this pi one by the eto homotopy type, and then maybe it should be true more generally. That's at least less restrictive. And indeed, there's a wonderful theorem by Alexander Schmidt and Jakob Schicks about this, which is that in the same kind of setting, if you have smooth varieties that are embedded. Smooth varieties that are embeddable inside of some product of hyperbolic curves, not the same product necessarily, but just some product, then indeed, well, they get something slightly weaker, but it's still pretty good, which is that this map from isomorphisms from X to Y to homotopy classes of equivalences of these et al. homotopy types. It's a split. Happy types, it's a split injection with a natural retraction. So that at least tells you that if the et al homotopy types are the same, then these smooth varieties are actually isomorphic. So it's somehow quite a good invariant. What does hyperbolic curves mean? Sorry? Negative Euler characteristic. Okay. So if people might ask. Okay, so people minus three points. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Here's another kind of fun result in this direction, which is in positive characteristic that if you have a smooth variety, then its atol homotopy type is trivial if and only if it's isomorphic to the ground field. So that's at least some kind of At least some kind of partial result in that direction. And there's also this fantastic theorem that maybe makes Grotendieck's conjecture more reasonable, which is that actually for a connected affine FP scheme, the et al. homotopy type is one truncated, meaning it only has pi one. It actually is a k pi one. And this is a fantastic theorem proven by Peter Ackinger. Theorem proven by Peter Ackinger. So it's really telling you that a tall cohomology is just controlled by this one group, but it's going to be absolutely huge in general. Okay. So do I have two minutes or do I have zero minutes? Two minutes is okay. Two minutes is okay. Okay. So let me maybe just say one other thing that I think will only Other thing that I think will only take two minutes. There's one other application which is different, but I think really wonderful. So it's about something called the Art and Tate pairing. And so if you have a smooth, geometrically connected surface over a finite field and a prime, you know, which is different from the characteristic, then Mike Garten and Tate define some pairing from the From the L-power torsion in the non-divisible elements of the Brouwer group to Q mod C. And this is an analog of the Castle's Tate pairing from number theory. And Tate conjectured that this pairing is alternating. Now, there's some interesting history, which is Manon gave some examples disproving Tate's conjecture, but it turns But it turns out Manon's examples were wrong. And recently, Tony Fang proved this conjecture of Tate. And the proof uses the etal homotopy type and some ideas from arithmetic topology. So the kind of idea is that because of this fiber sequence, Because of this fiber sequence, we should think, well, since we're working with a surface, this guy we should think of as four-dimensional over the algebraically closed field. But the base is BZ hat, because that's a Gaois group of FQ. So that's really something that's like one-dimensional. So, if the fiber is four-dimensional and the base is one-dimensional, then the middle guy, which is the atoll homotopy type of the surface, actually behaves like a real five-manifold. And there's some more precise ways in which this is true. But what Tony did, which I think is really wonderful, is he had this idea that, yeah, if it behaves like a real five-manifold, there's some structures that we know. Uh, structures that we know about manifolds of dimension 4d plus one, namely, they have a form on them called the linking form. And this is defined using some characteristic classes and things like this. And what he did was he showed, actually, if you use the et al. homotopy type and push this analogy, you can write this art and tape pairing in essentially exactly the same way as this linking form of a five-map. As this linking form of a five-manifold. And then people know how to show the linking form, how to show when the linking form is alternating. And he used exactly this type of argument. And, you know, you deduce this old conjecture of tape, which is really cool. So I think that's where I will stop. And I was inspired by Dhruv to show a picture from last time I was in Banff in July of 2020. In July of 2022, where we found some snow if we went sufficiently high.
