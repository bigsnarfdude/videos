It's always like a huge privilege and pleasure to be in Van. It's so beautiful here and it's so nice to see so many of you at Gamma. So I want to mention just some basic, basic problems in not theory, and then my thing is going to be more of a motif or like a theme, I guess, and a trick. And then I'll talk about someone else's credit. So the problems that I like to think about a lot are things. About a lot are things like basic things like let's just calculate the non-invariant. This is a pretty basic problem. That's what I'm going to consider a kind of direct pursuit. And then maybe determine whether knots are related by crossing changes or other local moves. Other local moves, so crossing changes or advanced surgeries, also called H2 moves, many other names. Or a related question, determine whether three manifolds are related by daint surgery. And then another kind of classic question or pursuit: understand how proper. Or pursuit, understand how properties of thoughts determine surgery on those thoughts. Properties of knots or links determine properties of, say, rational Dan surgery along that knot in the three sphere, or maybe some other animal. So these are the types of problems I like to think about. These are the types of problems I like to think about. And my motif is like try a tangle decomposition. Try tangles. So let me put a tangle decomposition on the board of a small knot. So this knot, if I get the crossings right, is 5, 2, just to have an example. Just to have an example, there's nothing so special about 52 for the purposes of this talk. And so when I take a tangle decomposition of this knot, I mean a two-string tangle decomposition. So something like this. So what I'm drawing here is the numerator closure of T1 plus T2. And so I'm writing as a pair, you know, the three-sphere and my not. A three-sphere and my not being written as tangle one union tangle two over this sphere. And so by capital T, that really means like a pair of the three-ball and two properly embedded arcs. So like bold T I. And S is a four-puncture sphere or a conway sphere or sphere that not intersects transversely in four points, depending on how you want to think of it. So, if my first thing that I want to do is I just want to experiment and I want to calculate a non-invariant, sometimes the tangle decomposition is a good way to go about doing that. So as a real warm-up calculation of some kind of non-invariant, and this is something that probably is familiar to everybody, we might want to calculate the bracket polynomial or the Jones polynomial using tangle decomposition. So you can write as So, you can write out the bracket polynomial for your diagram of your knot by doing a pairing where, let's see, we'll have delta 1, 1 delta, f t1, 2. So f and g are polynomials, something like this. Alright, and so f and g here And G here are in polynomial ring Z, A, and that means that we're thinking of this as being kind of the bracket of the tangle. So F we would write this with basis elements given by the two resolutions. Okay. Resolutions. Okay, so hopefully this is familiar, but you can go ahead and calculate, you know, the bracket polynomial by doing this instead of doing skein resolution or using the state sum. And it's handy if, like, say, you want to have an arbitrary tangle and then you want to perturb it by, like, maybe adding twists or tacking on some sort of tangle where you know what this expression is going to look like. So this is for calculating the bracket polynomial. For calculating the bracket polynomial, and then the kind of categorified version of this, the Jones polynomials categorification is covalent homology. And so, in categorifying this, it's kind of the Barnetton way of doing covalent homology. So, still thinking about using tangles, I'm not going to say too much about this Barnetton and Kavanaugh homology, but think about what was in Andrew's. But think about what was in Andrew's talk, the first talk of the conference, where you have the ting complexes associated to the tangles. So tons take on quadrant homology. And another thing that's super useful in this realm is to take the immersed curve kind of interpretation of all of that that's due to Katevsky. Katowski, Watson, and Sabrovius. So here you might take a tangle and then using Barnetton stuff, associate to it a chain complex over some combordism category, modulus of local relations. And then what could teach us? And then this gets converted. And then this gets converted again. There's another bumper that gets applied to turn this into an immersed curve, a set of curves, decorated immersed set of curves on the four-function sphere. We'll just say gamma for now. And so that can be an incredibly useful way of calculating Kavanaugh. Cavanophomology of your link. There's a whole parallel story that's useful in not plemology, too. So parallel strategy, tangled decompositions for not phlemology. There's actually more than one way to do this, but I want to talk about Zabrobius' way of doing this. So, not phlebology, you know, was due to Ochba Gonzabo and Brass Newsen, and Zabrobius. And Zabrovius' peculiar module works similarly. Peculiar module. So here you have your tangle and you take the Hager diagram of the tangle complement and then turn that into a Hager IV module. So CFT delta in algebra. Work in algebra. And then this then can be converted into an immersed curve, or a set of immersed curves on the four-punctured sphere. So that'll be H of T, or maybe just gamma, for short. And a little example, I shouldn't erase this. Nope, don't erase that, Allison. Okay. What it would look like. What it would look like without the decorations and the gratings and stuff for this knot that's on the board is just a handful of curves. So, okay, so like for this single crossing, a picture of the module looks like A B C P. There's some maps with algebra labels going. Algebra labels going between them. I won't write all the labels down because we don't need that level of detail. But there's gratings on all of this. There's Alexander Maslow and Delta gratings on this. These arrows will have labels of the form, you know, maybe P1 or Q2, I think of this one, in terms of P and Q, kind of giving you information about the perimeter surface on which all this is supposed to live. But then when you can. But then, when you convert this into an immersed curve for this, for this, then you get just a very simple curve, which, because this is a rational tangle, ends up being an embedded curve on this four-puncture sphere. And why all of these things are so great, whether you're doing just the Kaufman bracket or you're computing chlorophomology or not fluorophomology, is because Or not phloromology is because you can kind of modularize your calculation. So you can take the different curves individually and pair them together to count rank or to figure out what the gradients are. And if we want to calculate like the knot pharmology or maybe just the rank of the knot phalarmology for now of this 5.2 right here, then we need to have the also the, we need to have the set of immersion curves for this tangle as well. And let's jot them down. Let's jot them down. Now, ah. Okay, so here's my four-punctured sphere. And there's a couple of curves. There's three of them. So there's some that are not embedded, that are actually immersed. Pair like this. Pair like this. Okay, there's this bit, right? And then there's one. Alright, and then there's one more, which I'm going to draw separately just because the picture gets kind of crowded. There we go. All right, so for the other tangle, the 2-3-pretzel tangle, you have these curves. And so when you pair them, when you do the pairing, what you're doing is Lagrangian intersection hormones on the four punctures here. The idea is to convert this Hagar plemology into Lagrangian plemology and then. Chloromology and the Lagrangian hormology, and to do that. So we would superimpose this curve, which is the invariant for this tangle, here and here. And then we can count up all of the intersection points. And for this particular example, when we count the intersection points, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, we get eight. One, two, three, four, five, six. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 plus 6, that gives us a total of 14. And that's twice the rank of the knot pleuriology of 5, 2. Because the pairing theorem, it's Brogius' pairing theorem, is that the knot pleuromology, tensor B, comes from taking the intersection homology of the tangle invariant from first. Invariant from first tangle and you mirror one of them and the second tangle. Alright. Okay, so it's incredibly useful if you want to calculate and mirror it. That's like a direct pursuit. One place where this is useful is for statements like the following. Okay. So, in the vein of a direct pursuit, let me go back to. The vein of a direct pursuit. Let me go back to a statement that's already known to be true. Okay, so work of Wu from 1996 implies the following statement. So if K admits an essential conway sphere that if you do Dane surgery along K, it's going to have infinite fundamental errors. It's going to have infinite fundamental groups. So, pi one of rational D frame gene surgery along the K is infinite for all R. So, as the sufficient, are you destroying? Yeah. Yes, so this, this, this, this, the union of these is the tangle invariant for for this 2-3-pretzel tangle, and the red one is for this one. One is for this one. And that's the kind of modularized way of putting them together. So, alright, so how can we apply this in understanding a statement like this? Okay, this is known, but we can recover it. So, and this is along kind of, you know, pursuit number three, which was like, can we understand whether properties of the knot tell us something about cancer control and the knot? So, um, So the statement that we got was quite similar to this, actually, and that's that if K admits an essential Conway sphere, so first part's the same, then Yeah. This is definitely the way I want to phrase it. Then it's never going to, then surgery is never going to be in L space. Okay, so when you're in, you know, when you're in L-space, you have the simplest possible, not plemology. Possible, not thermology, but there's, and there's a lot of examples, for one spaces, S3, but anything with finite fundamental group is an L space. So if this is true, then we get to recover whose result is a corollary because, you know, otherwise we would get a contradiction. So we want to use tangle decompositions to get at this. And it's pretty clear that tangled decompositions are the way to go. I mean, the statement is like if there's an essential The statement is like if there's an essential conway sphere or not, and that's what tangled decompositions are all about. So, if this is the statement that you have in mind, when Claudius Zaprobius comes up with this tangling variant, it's like, okay, boom, that's exactly the right tool for this job. And overall, the strategy is also very sensible. So, what you want to do is say, well, knots that give rise to L-spaces through DANE surgery have very restrictive knots. Day surgery have very restrictive not philhermology. They need to have this stair-step structure. There's restrictions on what the rank, you know, the rank has to be one everywhere, and there's a lot of constraints on what the gradings ought to be. So just as a strategy, it's sensible that you'd use a tangle decomposition. So that is basically how the proof of this goes. You say, well, I'm going to write down a tangle decomposition, and I'm going to use a couple structural things. Structural things. So essential means that there is no, that it's incompressible on either side, so you shouldn't be able to find a compressing disk. So Zabrovius proved that this tangle invariant detects rational tangles, but actually you can strengthen that a little bit and detect split tangles. So that's what you need for the essentialities to see whether there's a compressing disk or not. So together with that and the tangle decomposition, then the idea is you just say, well, I'm going. And the idea is you just say, well, I'm going to take an essential Conway sphere, and if it's incompressible on either side, then I'm going to run into a problem with either the rank being too big or the gratings not being put together in such a way that respects the staircase structure of a mouse-based knot. It's more technical than that. There's like more steps to it, but the basic idea is just that, just like exactly what you would want to do. So this is what I would consider like the direct a direct use of a tangled decomposition. But tangled decompositions are also useful for like less direct pursuits as well. So let me say something about those as well. Okay, so indirect pursuits. Alright, so when you study non-definitely, When you study knots, you study three manifolds, and when you study three manifolds, you study knots. You just know how to have it. So, how do you go from a knot to a three-manifold? One way is to lift to the branch double cover. So question number two was, well, what was number two, but in, let me say, let's consider thoughts related by rational tangle replacements. Tangle replacements, and three manifolds related by vein surgery. Yeah, I think that was number two on my problems I want to think about. Well, somebody at this conference has to talk about the modesty notes trick. And I guess that somebody is me because it's Thursday and nobody's talking about it yet. And I was given a piece of advice. And I was given a piece of advice earlier that I should rant for a little bit, you know. So the rant is that it's a theorem, not a trick. And it's from 1976, the student Monocinos. And that is that there is a one-to-one, so theorem, Monocinos, 1976. Okay. There is a one-to-one correspondence. correspondence between rational this is a way to state it rational tangle fillings and rational vein fillings I'm saying in this sort of imprecise way too and the branch double network So, what's my trick is not my trick, but my trick is using this theorem, and I use it all over the place. So, I want to draw a picture, though, of like how one picture visualization of the monocinostric. This is a picture that I like to go back to when I can't remember. It's supposed to be a half-integral surgery or an integral surgery. Which one is it? Which one is it? So let's look at not a crossing change, but a resolution of a crossing to the oriented resolution. So let's look at this tangle. Actually, let me use more of the board. We're going to look at this tangle, and we're going to look at this tangle. And we're going to lift both of them to the branch double cover, but we're going to keep track of. The branch double cover, but we're going to keep track of some extra stuff. So the crossing, well, it's not a crossing arc, but a resolution arc, is here. And I want to take a meridian of this arc. I've taken a small meridian and I've pushed it out to the low puncture sphere. And I'm going to draw it in the branch double cover, but I like to draw an intermediary picture where I deform this. Mediary picture where I deform this sphere to look like a little bean. And this is a little bit unnecessary for this tangle, but it will help for the other tangle in visualizing it. Okay, and so now I have my co-punctured sphere. There's my tangle coming in. And now I'm going to lift this up and I'm going to double my beam. So here's my solid torus. Chorus, okay, and my crossing arc, maybe I should have used orange or something for this, is now here, and is now here, is the core of the solid torus. And my meridian lists to two copies because it's a double cover, but let me just draw one of them for now. And it's in meridian of this orange core. All right, now we want to be doing Want to be doing a rational tangle replacement. We also want to be doing rationally frame vein surgery. So we need to know where this meridian goes after the surgery. That'll show us what the surgery looks like. So this is the after picture for after tangle replacement. I'm doing the tangle filling of like what's on the outside. So my arc is now here. And when I take a little meridian of this arc and push it out. Of this arc and push it out to the boundary. Think of this as maybe being normal to the board, and then it becomes, reading becomes a curve like this. Okay, please tell me that I did my solids and dashed the ways that I did in my notes. Alright, and I did. That's great. So when I draw the beam and then draw the lift, And we'll get the following pair of curves upstairs. Okay, intermediary picture looks like this. And lifted pictures look like this, kind of heart-shaped. Curve. There's one of them. And then the other one we don't actually need, but I'm going to draw it anyway. Okay. And yes. There. Okay, so there's a pair of curves. All right. So I want to convince myself that I'm doing an integral surgery when I do this. Not a half integral surgery, because I'm doing a band surgery rather than a crossing change. And so there's a pair of these curves, but if I took this one, Curves, but if I took this one together with my previous meridian and just superimposed them on the same torus, I could see that they intersect once geometrically. That's right. I'll get another color. Blue. Let's make this one blue. Okay. So they intersect once. Once with this curve, because I'm taking one of the pair. So I can see the image after Dane surgery, and I can see that wasn't. Image after Dane surgery, and I can see that was an integral Dane surgery. Alright. So that's my visualization of this particular operation. Alright, so where do we use the, well there's a few places where Monocenostric has been used, restricted to things that I've been involved in, which is a very small subset of places where the Monocenos theorem have been play. Okay, so here are a couple of statements. So, this one joint with Delski, Linden, Watson, and Robinus. Alright, and then I'll just say one or two words about this. Okay, so if you have a strongly invertible If you have a strongly invertible knot with surgery along K, orientation preserving homeomorphic to, our prime surgery along K. Okay, then you also need to know that there's a compatibility between the covering involution and the whole. covering involution and the homeomorphism. So HR goes with F is F H R prime. Then R is equal to R prime. And a completely unrelated statement, but that also hinges on the Montesinos trick. So these won't be connected at all. Is this one from a few years back. Okay, and this statement is T2N is related T2N is related to T23, the trefoil, by banding oriented or non-oriented, either one. What is that? This map right here. Um By this move, if and only if n is plus or minus 1, plus or minus 2, 3, minus 4, plus 6, 4, minus 6, or 7. Okay, so these are not related statements, but both of them involve the Modoceno string. So how, okay? How, okay? Or what's like the strategy in doing these? I don't know if you're doing it. What, no? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I've forgotten it. Really important. F. Okay, yeah, that's an if and only if statement. One direction is completely trivial. And the other direction is where all of the effort is. So for the So, for this statement, the idea is here, you want to say something about the three manifolds, so you prove something using tangles. But it's not enough to just use the tangles. You have to be able to get some understanding of the invariance of the tangles involved. You can't just take, you know, you can't just go without any information. So, for this first statement, For this first statement, the three ingredients that are most important: one, of course, the monocenosis theorem. That's how you go up and down. But you also need to use work of Hanselman and Ni Wu. Yes. Okay. So if you're trying to study these cosmetic surgeries, which is what it's called when you have two different day surgeries that give you the same manifold, Lee and Wu told you that these surgery coefficients differ by sign. And Hanselman told you even more about it, which is that really that surgery could be, it's going to be pleasant. It's going to be plus or minus 2 or plus or minus 1 over q. Sorry, plus or minus q. 1 over q. So then what you have to do is just say, well, I'm going to look at the tangles and I'm going to look at the corresponding tangle replacements and then use the immersed curve body of work. of Kotelsky, Watson, and Zabrovius to calculate the quantum homology of the tangles and then lift it up to a statement here. So this is kind of in the directionality where you prove something about tangles because you want to show something about three manifolds. But if you're using Monocene's theorem, you can go the other way as well. So here, the statement. As well. So here, the statement that we really desired was about knots. We wanted to obstruct knots being related by bands, which is a pretty simple goal. And we foolishly thought, oh, this problem would be so easy. We could just use the linking form or something. It'll be easy. But what we had to do instead was prove something about three manifolds and then push it back down. So here, what you do. So, here, what you do instead is you say, Well, okay, for this kind of statement, there's two directions, and one of them is just picture-proof. So, if you have these particular tortoises, knots, or links, you just find the banding. But otherwise, what you're showing is in the branch double cover that Ln1 is related to L31. To L31 by an integral Dane surgery, if and only if the same numbers. So if and only if, and in plus or minus one, plus or minus two, three, four, minus six, or seven. Alright, so to get the, you know, this existence of the Dane surgery, you just The existence of the Dane surgery, you just looked at the picture that you have. For the non-existence, well, you need to obstruct Dane surgery between two three manifolds. And that is something that Hagarthlomology is really well equipped to do. So you can't just use Ponacinos' theorem, then you have to do this stein surgery problem. So the idea is here that you want to do something like use the D invariance. Okay, so more specifically, how okay. All right, so I guess some people like to use plus, and some people like to use. I guess some people like to use plus and some people like to use minus, but for HF plus, structured theorem says that we have a tower, a free part, and a detrion part, which I've produced. So if we look at the tower and we look at the And we look at the minimal grading. We get the D and Mary. It's called the correction term sometimes because it corrects the statement that the Euler characteristic of Higgard plemology here should be the Cast invariant, but you need to correct it a little bit, and that's the invariant. So, what we're So, what we need to do is use this as an obstruction, and sometimes we can use a formula of knee and wu. So, knee and wu have a d-invariant formula that says if you're going to do integrally frame dein surgery on an eye, then the de invariant of the manifold you end up with is equal to the d invariant, but the manifold just. Equal to the de invariant manifold you started with, plus a kind of corrective term, minus a not invariant that comes from the not-floor complex of the knot. So that formula kind of looks a little bit like this. Integral surgery along K in some C structure is equal to the D invariant of the manifold you started in. This is in In S3 typically, or some other settings minus 2ni. These are also sometimes called VI or H. So Nibu's formula looks like this. And we're doing surgery, though, in L3, 1, trying to get to LN1. Trying to get to L and one. And L31 is an L space, that's nice. But the problem is that the knot that we're surgering along might be null homologous or might be non-null homologous. And Ni-Wu's theorem is for your null homologous knots. So sometimes we can just apply it and say, well, you know, if we're doing the particular kind of Dane surgery and we're able to calculate these terms out of Out of known formulas for the de invariance of length spaces, then we can show that as we kind of run through the different spin C structures, we're going to run into some sort of contradiction with this being an integer usually. And that's how the argument should work, but then we have to recreate this Ni-Mu formula when you have a non-nel homologous knot. So the idea there is to use, is to use directly and Drip height and also recreate and use this formula. So that's what goes into getting the statement about surgery between lens spaces, and then just push it back down to get the statement that you want about the knots. And not space, you have a For L space, do you have that analyzer at the remote now? For any L space, no. No. What we did was like highly specific to L31. There is another person whose name is slipping my mind who did a more general version of that in other lens spaces. But it's there are a lot of technical details. There were a lot of technical details in making it work in L3.1, and it wasn't easily generalizable. Like mod C, that's that makes that applied to the term classes and structure. Like you mentioned that like linking form doesn't just solve the problem. Linking form doesn't get you. Linking form, we did have to use. Linking form, linking, we did have to use the linking form to, we did have to use the linking form, but it wasn't enough on its own. I don't know how to say how far it got us. I think it got us for like, like if we're going from L31 to like L5, looking at L51 or L7.1, but we could just do LN1 for arbitrary N. But I think for small values, I remember. And but I think for a small volume, remember if we tried just linking one for small values, then we would have to figure it out. Yes, so in the last couple of minutes, I want to describe another indirect pursuit that tangle decompositions are useful for, and that's if you're interested in theta curves. And if you aren't interested in theta curves, you should be, because they're basically just tangles. So I'm not saying they're better than tangles, they're worse than tangles, but. But, you know, you can use a lot of the same stuff to study theta curves. So I have some, I kind of thought that I would run out of time for drawing pictures, so I drew some of them over here. Let me erase the stuff that's not theta curves. So here's a theta curve. It's just an embedding of the literal graph theta, two vertices, three edges, just like you would a knot. And when you study theta curves, you have two different kinds of connect cells. Curves, you have two different kinds of connect sum. So there's a little difference there. You can do a connect sum like this, where you connect sum at an edge. That's an order two connecting sum of this trivial theta and this not, or you can do a vertex connecting sum. This is not actually two theta curves. It's a theta curve in a handcuff graph, which also has three edges and two vertices, but is not as nice as the theta curve. And so one of the problems that's been bugging all of us for a while, and not theory, is whether Not theory, is whether a knotting number is additive under connected sum. And Charlemagne has a result from the 80s that says that a knotting number 1 nots prime. So one of the places in which tangible decomposition is really helpful is in trying to prove that for theta curves. So here's a statement. So here's a statement. The short version is unknotting number one theta curves are prime, but because of this caveat about the two different kinds of connected sum, you have to have any more words. So if the unknotting number of theta curve is one, then either it's prime with respect to both. So with respect to regular connected sum or Regular connected sum or vertex connected sum, or you can have something cheesy like what's over there where you connect some on an unknown number one knot to the trivial theta curve. You can do, you know, that's a knotting number one, but it's a connected one. So theta is the trivial theta connects your favorite unknown number one knot. Okay, so that's true. Tangled decompositions, as you can guess, feature heavily into working out a statement like this. But for several reasons, But for several reasons. I mean, doing a crossing change is a rational tangular placement. So there's that. But also, you know, when you deal with a theta curve, then if you just take a small neighborhood of one edge, you go ahead and isotope your theta curve so that one of the edges is just like a little untangled edge. All of the complexity will be pushed off somewhere else. The complexity will be pushed off somewhere else. What's outside of the neighborhood of that edge is a two-string tangle. So theta curves are essentially two-string tangles. All right. So outside here is a tangle. So you can think of them as tangles in this way. And there's also a relationship between theta curves. I mean, this is the same thing as what I'm describing here, but if you have a theta curve and you want to lift it to the branch double cover. To lift it to the branch double cover, then the branch double cover of the three-sphere branched over, let's say this is edge one, edge two, and this one's edge three, branched over edge one, union edge two. That's a knot. Okay, that's the branch double cover of some knot. It contains in it the lift of this edge, E3. So whatever this is, is a strongly invertible knot in a manipul. In a manifold, strongly invertible. Not because you have two copies of this edge. And this is on the branch set, so we can define with the temperature. So it's even better if you happen to have a constituent unknot, it's a strongly invertible dot in S3, and we understand those pretty well. So there's all of these different. There's all of these different relationships that you can use. But in kind of trying to get to this statement, we use tangled decompositions in an even weirder way because the plot twist is that the operative tangle is not this one, but is actually that tangle row, which I've redrew on the board over there because it has a lot of crossings in it. So this is the tangle that somehow is the most important tangle for proving that statement. And it comes through. comes through overwrought and complicated argument, but basically what we want to do is show a related tangle statement. And the tangle statement is that here, the tangle statement is that if you have a sum of two tangles, t1 plus t2, and neither t1 nor t2 is itself an integral tangle. Is itself an integral tangle, then there is no crossing change of the sum of crossing change of t to an integral tangle. Integral tangles are like basically trivial. So this is this proposition lets us get to this. But to prove this proposition, we use this tangle row in this weird way where we assume for a contradiction that we have a tangle sum, either of which is integral, that does admit some sort of crossing change to an integral tangle. Change to an integral tangle. And we tack on rho. Rho has a lot of nice special properties. It is definitely not rational. So we take a look at rho plus this t1 plus t2. And there's a crossing change that takes us to an integral tangle. So we have something which up to read parameter is. We have something which, up to reparameterization, looks like this. And in one minute to say how this gets used, when you take the numerator closure of this, you get this not K row. When you take the numerator closure of this, you have the numerator closure of row. And one of the nice properties of this not row is that the numerator closure of this is a 10-crossing knot that has, well, that's, sorry, that's the unknown. The unknot. This one is the unknown. But you end up with an unknotting number one knot that has an essential convey sphere. And you can use work of Gordon and Lucy and Eudave Nunoz and do a lot of case analysis basically to understand K-row and to argue for a contradiction that its other closure, its denominator closure, should have a knotting number one. But its denominator closure is sometimes crossing knot that. Denominator closure is some 10-crossing knot that has like a knotting number, not one. That's the contradiction. So that's a gross oversimplification of it, but the bell has spoken, so I will stop there. Questions? These sort of techniques extend um to learn about instead of just Well, I mean, you can definitely try and look to a cover and understand that. If you take like some other, I mean, I guess the thing is, I haven't thought about it. Probably so. Like, you could probably look and then look at the pre-image of things and try and. The pre-image of things and try and use some symmetries on it and stuff, but I have only gone into Theta. If you don't want to see us try to correct character set up, like if you want to sign the cover on, you have some tangible body, which you can see through the body afraid of a certain walk-in. I thought a little bit about it as a confusion, whatever. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's I thought a little bit about it, but I don't, there's less existing information about cutting and pasting along like higher genus surfaces just to take advantage of. Not that it can't be done, but another cover that's useful on these is the Z2 cross-Z2 cover. You just do this twice. You two cover. You just do this twice, and now you're lifting, you take in the branch double cover with a strongly invertible non-S3 or wherever you're at, and that's the Klein cover. Okay, any more questions? Thank you, Allison, again. The next step will be at one.
