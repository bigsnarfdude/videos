And he will speak about a few conjectures on convergence of intrinsic volumes of Riemannian and Axantov spaces, please. Okay, thank you. And I would like to thank the organizers for the opportunities to speak here. The goal of this talk is to describe a few conjectures on the behavior of intrinsic volumes on Alexandrov and Alexandrov and Riemannian and Alexandrov spaces under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. This conjecture is the result of joint discussions with Anton Petronian. Probably some of you heard, maybe even more than once, similar talks I gave for the community of experts on convex geometry. And here I'm happy to have an opportunity to. Have an opportunity to present them to experts on Romania and Mietric and Alexander Geometria. Let me remind you again what is intrinsic volume. Also, it was discussed several times during this conference. So historically, intrinsic volumes come from convexity. Steiner, Minkowski, I will not remind Not remind the Steiner formula, it appeared in the previous talk, and well, I will not need it explicitly in this talk. And then what is directly relevant to explicitly relevant to the conjectures I'm going to discuss is that in 1939, Hermann Weil generalized them, intrinsic volumes, to smooth remarkable. To smooth Riemannian manifolds. Actually, he did it for closed Riemannian manifolds. And let me remind you again his construction. So let Mg be a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold, possibly with boundary or corners. If you don't know what is corners, just ignore it. It is not very important for the talk. Important for the talk. Consider an isometric embedding yota of M into a Euclidean space Rn of high knife dimension. So it is always possible due to Nash theorem. In fact, Nash theorem was proved later than Weil work, and Weil used weaker results about the existence of. Results about the existence of local isometric invaders available at the time, but we can use now Nash theorem directly. There is the following theorem that volume, Euclidean volume of epsilon neighborhood of the image yot of M so you consider epsilon neighborhood of the image of yott. Neighborhood of the image of Yota. Take Euclidean volume of it. First of all, it is a polynomial in positive small enough epsilon of the following form. Epsilon to power codimension of the embedding times sum from zero to dimension of the manifold n, sum normalizing. Some normalizing coefficients which can be written down explicitly and which depend on M capital, little n and i times what is called i intrinsic volume vi of m and times epsilon to the power n minus i. So this is true for positive small epsilon and Epsilon. And the key point is that where these coefficients appropriately normalized, Vi of M are independent of Yota, of the embedded. So there are, I emphasize, there are n plus one intrinsic volumes and they will be They will be important for the rest of the talk. Let me have a remark. Weil approved this theorem for closed manifolds. For manifolds with boundary and corners, it seems to be a foil claw. But I couldn't find classical reference, and the only reference. And the only reference I have is rather recent paper by Fuent Vaner. Actually, the goal of it was different, but in particular, they needed also this statement and proved it. Italy is asking if while Surium Podels for C1 is a better competitor. The question is: does well theorem hold for? No, no, it is not true, I think, because, for example, for closed manifolds, the expression for intrinsic volumes while gave, it is some integral of some expression, no polynomial expression, Riemann curve, which is tensor. So you need at least two derivatives. And I think for Sivana, does. And I think for Sivan it doesn't work. But that doesn't quite prove it. I mean, I suspect it doesn't work, but what you said is not really an argument. I mean, the metric on M might be C infinity. I'm just asking about if the embedding is, so Nash has a theorem about C1 embeddings. For those, it probably doesn't work, but well, then I don't know. Okay, I didn't think about it. Okay. Again, let me remind you some basic examples of intrinsic volumes. The maximal index Vn of n-dimensional manifold, which is just Riemannian volume. V0, it is the earlier characteristic. V n minus one. V n minus one of n dimensional meaningful. It is a half volume of the boundary. Now in the next example, let us assume that M is closed. Then about half of intrinsic volumes vanish, namely Vi vanishes if N minus I is odd. Next example, let M be closed. Then Vn minus 2 of this manifold is proportional to integral of scalar curvature. Okay, these are examples which. These are examples which are well known to differential geometers. And let me add also one more example. I will not write it. If you have a domain, a compact domain with smooth boundary in a Euclidean space, then it its maximum intrinsic volume is of course volume, but all others can be presented as integral over the boundary. Integral over the boundary of some elementary symmetric polynomials of principal characters. Okay, this is another elementary example of intrinsic volume. Okay, now let me state a fact which was important for the motivation. Uh, important for the motivation for at the early stage of this work, so motivation. So, intrinsic volumes being restricted to the class of convex domains of Euclidean space extend uniquely by continuity in the Hausdorithmetic to all convex compact subsets. So, in fact, intrinsic volumes are defined for all convex. Defined for all convex of Euclidean space, and there continues in the Hausdorff met. Continuity on convex sets turned out to be very useful in evaluation theory, but even more generally in convexity. This convey is not hard to prove, but turns out to be. But it turns out to be an important property. And in the context of Riemannian manifolds, this continuity property is almost invisible on the first glance. And the basic motivation of the present work was to understand continuity properties of intrinsic volumes of Riemannian manipulations. As far as I know, in literature, these continuity properties in the context of Riemannian manifolds were not very well studied. And the earliest work I know in this direction is the work of Chiger, MÃ¼ller, and Schrader in the 80s, who studied convergence of intrinsic volumes when Intrinsic volumes, then Riemannian manifold is approximated by manifolds with perihedral metrics. Rather special approximation. In this talk, I will be interested in Gromov-Hau-Dorf convergence and behavior of intrinsic volumes under this convergence. A few conjectures based on discussions with Petrunian will be stated in terms of ground cause of convergence with sectional curvature uniformly bounded below. Sorry, Financial, Jan is asking what is the Clanvox domain here? Question mark, an open bounded planbox edge. Question mark. The sets question mark. Okay, convex domain in Euclidean space. It is just a convex set of full dimensions with smooth boundary. Okay. Okay, yeah, domain usually it is something important, but okay, what I meant. But okay, what I meant is convex something which includes also boundary, smooth boundary. Okay, also in this talk, I will consider Riemannian manifolds, mostly which are so if there is boundary but not corners, we assume that manifolds. We assume that manifolds are convex near the boundary. Equivalently, the second fundamental form of the boundary is non-negative. And this is again equivalent that the corresponding manifold with boundary is an Alexandra space. That's it, near the boundary. So I will consider Riemannian compact Riemannian. Consider Riemannian compact Riemannian manifolds with such convex boundary. The first conjecture, which is most elementary, I will just formulate it most elementary form of these conjectures, most elementary special case of conjectures. It says that intrinsic volumes on smooth. Williams on smooth Riemannian manifolds of given dimension with given lower bound conceptual curvature and with convex boundary are expected to be continuous in Gromov-Hausdorff metric if there is no collapse, which means if the dimension of the limiting space equals to the dimension of the manifolds in the sequence. So all of them. ones. So all of them are supposed to have its dimension and the dimension of the limiting space should be the same. I will so this is the most elementary conjecture and I will elaborate on it a little bit in the second conjecture, which is somewhat more precise version of that. Besides the ocean of that, and now let me have a comment for the more advanced later for the later of the talk. If there is collapse, there is no continuity in the Gromov-Kausdorf metric. There are easy examples. In this case, there should be correction coming from a metric version of mere bicycle construction. Of nearby cycle construction. I will discuss this nearby cycle construction a little later. First, I will discuss no collapse case. Okay, so let me state conjecture two. Again, no collapse case. Let MJ be a sequence of compact smooth Riemannian manifolds, no dimension n. Dimension n with sectional curvature uniformly bounded from below and convex boundary. Let it Gromov-Hausdorff converge to compact Alexander space XN. I emphasize the same dimension, which means no collapse. Then there exists a limit of printed volumes of the manifold which Of the manifold, which we just denote the I of X, of the limiting space, Alexander space. And what we expect from this limit. So first of all, the conjecture is that there is a limit. But what we expect, in addition, where this limit V i of x depends on x only. Depends on x only and not on the sequence. And if x is smooth, it is equal to i's intrinsic volume of this smooth manifold. We know what it is by wild theorem. So presumably, this limit is, we should call this limit in general or general Alexander space. As ice in principle, volume of the Alexander. Intrinsic volume of the Alexandrov space. Okay, it is just an intrinsic invariant of this Alexander space conjecturally. So this is a conjecture. This conjecture two is more precise form of conjecture one. And let me tell you what is known about this conjecture. Some older results can be interpreted in special cases of this conjecture. In special cases of this conjecture. So, first of all, for volume Vn, this is a result of Burago-Gromov and Peraman, and in fact, it holds even if there is collapse. Yeah, even if there is collapse. Second example, V0, which is colour characteristic. In this case, In this case, again, it is known, it follows from Perlman's stability theorem, which contains a stronger statement, which claims that in the situation of no collapse, all but finitely many MJs are homeomorphic to the limiting space X. In particular, they have the same colour characteristic. Next known case, Vn minus 2, Vn minus 2 of Mj per closed manifold MJs. That there is such a limit. And it is very recent preprint on archive due to Lebedev Petrunians when they publish this result. Okay. That's all. And I remind you that Vn minus 2, I just want to remind that is proportional to integral of scalar curvature of mj. Yes, so this is something very well known to Riemannian differential geometers. Geometers. These are the cases, these are the known cases when this conjecture is proven. Now, let me state one more conjecture. It is not about convergence of intrinsic volumes, but it follows from some more general form. some more general form of the conjectures which i will not discuss today it is a consequence of conjectural consequence of some more general conjectures and more lemian theory uh so the next conjecture says that there exists constant c such that for any compact manifold m with convex boundary this sectional curvature bounded by This sectional curvature bounded by a constant kappa, diameter less than G, one has absolute value of intrinsic volumes are bounded by this constant. All intrinsic volumes are bounded by this constant, which depends on the dimension, lower bound and sectional curvature, and upper bound on the diagonal. Again, what is known? Again, what is known about this conjecture? In what cases is it known? First of all, for volume VN, which is the Riemannian volume, it is known Bishop inequality for V0, which is Euler characteristic. It follows from a stronger. It follows from a stronger result of Gronov, who proved actually boundedness of all beta numbers under the above assumptions, in particular earlier characteristic boundary by absolute value. Or Vn minus 2 of closed manifold. So Vn minus 2 is less some constant. I remind again, this is proportional to. This is proportional to the integral of scalar curvature. This is a result of Petronium. And one more statement for one more case for surfaces. For two-dimensional surfaces with boundary, V1, absolute value of V1 of surface, I reminded is half of the length of the boundary, is also bounded. And this is a And this is an unpublished result of Petronium. Actually, he claimed me the proof, and I must understand the proof. Okay, these are known cases where an estimate on intrinsic volumes was established. Was established. But now let me explain the case of collapse and I will need to draw some pictures. So let me change the screen. Do do you see another screen now? Do you see another screen now? Does it? I think so. Yeah. So, what I'm going to explain is a kind of metre version of nearby cycle. Version of nearby cycle. Version of nearby cycle in for metric geometry. So, nearby cycle, this notion on complex analytic algebraic geometry goes back to Milner and then it was generalized to the situation of algebraic geometry and number theory by Delin in the 60s and kind of similar basic geometric idea. Basic geometric idea, similar idea was used in a completely different technical setup of real analytic geometry by Fu and Macroria. And now I will propose again very different technical setup. Technical setup to define nearby cycle in the context of metric geometry. So, um, by the way, I don't know the construction, I don't have a proof that it works, but Petronian mentioned that he has a proof which is unpublished. So you can consider it again as a conjecture, although. Again, as a conjecture, although recently, in some very special cases, this nearby cycle construction was computed, and it will be discussed in the next talk by Raman Ratsman. Okay, it is that follows. Assume we have a sequence of Alexander spaces of given dimension, which convergence in the Gromoff Hausdorff sends to Sense to another Alexander space, everything is compact curvature is uniformly bounded from below. We are all the time in the situation, and the goal is to define certain integer-valued functions on the limit. Valued functions on the limiting space, a bunch of them we call nearby cycle, and they control some topology of how this space topology, how they degenerate, collapse to the space X roughly. Roughly. So let me draw a picture. This is X. This is Xi. And like in the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, we define Meatric. We choose Miatric I on the disjoint union of X and L. Of x and xi, such that the Hausdorff distance between them tends to zero. Yes, so this is by definition of the Gronov-Hausdorff convergence. Now, let me draw point X here. point x here and we can reduce an angle. We choose a ball of radius delta centered at x radius delta p denote this set we do know this set B B I x of delta, which is all points y from xi, such that di y x less than delta. And over simpl let me oversimplify what we are going to do. Later, I will state it more precisely. We are interested in carmology. Interested in cohomology of this set and where Xi gets closer and closer to X, after choice of subsequence, dimensions of this cohomology stabilizes conjecturally. Conjecturally. And this and this dimension conjecturally depends on the point x and doesn't depend on small delta. And so we get a bunch of for any homology, a degree homology, we have integer-valued function on the limiting space x. Now let me state it more precisely. Stated more precisely. So, this is kind of conjecture, but maybe I'm not further proof. There exists subsequence of these spaces, of our spaces, which I will denote by the same notation, such that for any point x on the limiting space. X on the limiting space, there exist epsilon Fs, epsilon zero positive, such that for any delta one less than delta two less than epsilon zero, there exists I zero such that for Such that for any i greater than i zero, the following happens. Consider image. Now, this map, this homology space may not behave very well, but we consider image of homology of a larger ball, larger set. Larger ball, larger set of delta two in homology of smaller i x delta one and dimension of this so and now the conjecture is that this dimension stabilizes this dimension This dimension is independent of I, namely of large I and delta one, delta two, which are provided they are small enough. Okay, and this dimension we denoted by little a little h of a of little h of a of x they definitely do depend on the point x so we have h0 h1 etc several functions on on the limiting space with integer values okay and bunch of these functions it's called nearby cycle Also, well, in when you, if you read, say, dealings work much more sophisticated bunch of functions, but for us, but nevertheless, in his setup, these functions can be deduced from what he constructs. Okay, integer valid functions. Integer valued functions. Okay, they somehow remember topology of how spaces degenerate, collapse to X. Remember it locally. Now let me go back to the slides. I'm sorry before you can you that this you said that there is a city. That just you you said that there is a sequence of xi, but are you claiming that for every sequence such that everything they're false, you will get the same functions? I do not hear you well. Sorry, the statement starts with there exists a sequence of spaces xi, correct? Yeah. Do you claim that for different sequences you will get the same functions? functions oh uh for different sequence you may get for different sub sequence you may get different functions oh okay and there are easy examples um yeah okay now Let me return to the screen. So, remember, sorry, can I interrupt more? Can you go back to this picture? You actually don't need, I mean, these maps are going to be isomorphisms from cohomology for small, I mean, for all large I. If you fix delta one, delta two. I, if you fix delta one, delta two, it's uh this is maybe, but this is not obvious. No, no, no, it's pretty easy, but uh this is conjecture. You claim that this is true? Yes, yeah, it just follows from uh from from critical points here. I mean, the of uh even more interesting. Even more interesting. From the fact that there are no radial points for the distance function to x in x, and this basically this lifts to the sequence. But that's a small comment. Anyway, continue. So you said for small for small epsilon zero, this is always isomorphism. This is always isomorphism? Yes. Very much it's okay. Okay, so now Okay, so now um okay we have this situation uh where Alexandro space is collapsed to some other Alexandro space everything is compact curvature bounded from below and we do not by f introduce one more function which will be particularly relevant for the conjectures sum alternating sum of these functions HA H A. Okay, this function f capital. Natural sum of functions H A. So these functions H A and F take finitely many values. We assume that after choice of subsequence, all these functions are well defined. Are well defined, then they take finitely many values. In fact, they are bounded by some theorem of Gromov, uniformly bounded by depending on the diameter of the limiting space and uniform lower bound and curvature of this sequence. And the level sets are expected to be nice. And let me say it in the following form. I don't have time to define everything here. More precisely, Petrunian mentioned that these functions are constant on the Perryman-Petrunian strata induced by extremal subsets. So in the middle 90s, Perryman and Petrunian introduced some canonical stratification of Alexander of Of Alexander of spaces and by some locally closed subsets. Or compact spaces have finitely many strata, and these functions are expected, are constant on such strata. In no collapse case, in no collapse case, this function of capital. This function of capital is identically equal to one, and it follows from a result of Kapovich. So, what I'm going to say due to this fact, no conjectures about when there is no collapse, they are special cases of conjectures which I'm going to state shortly. Yeah, and these functions H, A, and F were recently computed for sequences of closed two surfaces. This nearby cycle was computed by Katz, Prasanov, and me. Maybe probably it will be discussed in the next talk by Romani. Okay, now to state more general conjecture when there is a collapse. When there is a collapse, let me make some preparations. So this is a presentation of function f, or any function which is constant on the strata, as linear combination of with integer coefficient CS of indicator functions of the clause. Functions of the closed strata, closures of the strata. So here is the sum of all strata, and we take indicator functions of their closures. The strata are so-called primitive extremal subsets, whatever that means. So any function which is constant on the strata can be uniquely written in such a form. There is the following conjecture form, which is more general. More general than the if there is collapse. So let Mj be a sequence of smooth compact Riemannian manifolds with convex boundary and sectional curvature uniformly bounded below. Let a Gromov-Hausdorff converge to a compact Alexander of space X such that the function F. That the function f is defined, which means we have chosen an appropriate sub-sequence. Then there exists limit of intrinsic volumes of the manifolds. This is the first thing that the limit exists. And moreover, it is equal to the following expression. Who sum over all primitive extremal subsets S Subsets S take this coefficient Cs which you get in this decomposition times numbers just numbers which we denote Vi of S. So far this is just unknown numbers V i of s and let me comment what's going on here what are these numbers so where these numbers V i of S VI of S are presumably, so it is high intrinsic volume of S of extremal primitive extremal substance. It is very singular in general. It's not clear how to define it directly. It is even not necessarily Alexandrov space, as it was observed long ago by Petrunya. Next, this number we. Next, this number I of S would depend only on arbitrarily small neighborhood of S and X, in particular independent of the sequence. So these numbers, they depend only on geometry of the limiting space. All the information about the sequence which is needed to compute the Which is needed to compute the limit of intrinsic volumes is encoded into these numbers TS, namely into this constructible function f, yes, which produced from the nearby cycle. Now, one may wonder, so what is the point of this conjecture? Point of this conjecture because some limit of some known quantity is expressed in terms of some unknown numbers, Vi of S. Let me explain that this is not a tautological statement. You see, we may consider sequences of Sequences of Riemannian manifolds of larger and larger dimension. Also, we may relax lower bound on the sectional curvature and get more and more sequences convergent to the same Alexander space X. And so, but this will, of course, influence this. This will, of course, influence these numbers CS, which means you are known. But we will get infinitely, this equality will provide us conjectural equality, will impose infinitely many conditions on these finitely many numbers, VI of S. It's known that there are only finitely many strata, and we have infinitely many conditions. Have infinitely many conditions on these finitely many numbers. And well, it's most likely that they are defined uniquely by these conditions. And this might be a way to give us a way to define intrinsic volumes of all extremal subs. Sorry, there is a question for you, yes. So sorry, another question. Okay, this is all pretty abstract for me so far. What happens in this simple situation when you have collapsing a lunar Lie group actions? Say you have a fixed manifold with a compact, you know, that you can collapse with low curvature bound along a compact group actually. On a compact group, actually. I will get in a more general form. I will comment on it. Because it should be this known then? This formula holds for this? Okay, I think I will stay. Let me finish the statement of the conjecture and then I will go to examples. And I think I will answer your question. Okay. Answer your question. Okay. Okay, so this conjecture is true. So not much is known. Let me state what is known. So it is true for sequences of closed surfaces by a recent work of again, which will be discussed by Roman, probably. Also, in this case, there are only two intrinsic volumes. Intrinsic volumes which are non-trivial area and Euler characteristic for area. No, we know these conversions by Borakogromov and Perelman, for example, for Euler characteristic, which is V0. No, well, it follows from computations which we did directly that the corresponding statement holds. Now there is one more. Now there is one more example where of situation where this statement is true. It is true for Riemannian submersions to rescale along the fibers, which I proved. And let me stated more explicitly this result. Maybe this is what Vitaly asked. There is a following theorem. Let M over to N, map M to N, be a reminder. M to n be a Riemannian submersion of smooth quote Riemannian manifolds for positive epsilon denote by m epsilon the manifold m rescaled by epsilon metric along the finers. Okay, then clearly m epsilon converges to n in Gromoff-Hausdorff sense when epsilon goes to zero. And intrinsic volumes of m epsilon converge. Epson converge, pay attention to the intrinsic volume of the limited space times the order characteristic of the fiber. How it is related to nearby cycle. So, in this case, this function f capital, which was on the previous slide, it is just earlier characteristic of the fiber. Oops. And so it is indeed very special. No, well, here the curvature doesn't have to be bounded from below. It's a very special case, but in some sense, a little bit more general. So this is at least consistent with the above conjectures. Italy does come. So, if italy, does it answer your question? No, not quite. I was asking about more general situations where you have a Lie group action which is not free, which can have various fibers. And then the quotient space will be singular and will have some external subsets corresponding to different isentropic groups. So, in this case, you can also collapse, right? You can take M cross G. M cross G and rescale the metric on G and M cross G divided by G, right? If you rescale the metric by G, then it will collapse to M by G. So this is an interesting case where you see extremal subsets and you see all your stratification thing. This is what happens there. It was not studied. Okay. Okay, so I will stop here. Thank you. So, thank you very much. There were already quite a few questions. Are there any more questions, please? Please, Alexander. Yeah, thanks again for the very interesting talk with so many questions. So many questions. So, very stupid question, probably. This n minus one intrinsic volume. Is it the volume of the boundary? Yes. So, I think for that one, so people also know that it is stable under non-collapsed convergence. So, I think it was kind of folklore and recently a Japanese guy has written this up. Oh, th it will be very interesting. That will be very interesting. Yeah, I didn't know. So, but but for example, how about estimate of volume of the boundary? So if the boundary is convex, yes, you mean convex boundary. Yeah, yeah. So I'm talking about the non-collapsed case. So this is this is about your first conjecture. I understand, but wait, wait, wait. But the boundary is convex? Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Okay. There are okay. There are okay. I would be happy to have a reference. Okay, yeah, I'll send it to you. Okay, good, very good. Any more questions? Please. Pablo. Hi. I had a question about this conjecture, too. So, for these intrinsic volumes, do you have some? These intrinsic volumes, do you have some characterization in terms of, say, like a Chern-Weil polynomial or something like that? For the so I'm thinking of a sequence of three-dimensional manifolds that doesn't collapse to a limit space. But then in this case, you have four of these. So we know like three of them. But are there any other ways of describing these in terms of the Riemannian structure? The way I know. The way I know for well, it is the way which while actually use the some integral over the manifold, some polynomial and Riemann curvature tensor. But I don't know if there is these are also coefficients on while G formula, well, but I don't know if there are other ways. Are other ways because for you have like the volume, the Euler characteristic, and the integral over the scalar curvature? But then there's the other one, which I think in this case is V1. No, sorry, V2. So V2 for a three-dimensional space, is there another way of describing that? It is zero, yes. For three-dimensional manifold, it is zero. Oh, okay. For four-dimensional manifold, it is not zero, but it is again integral of oh, this is. Oh, this is something new for five-dimensional manifolds. Wait, is that okay? So V3 is the volume. Yes. Okay. And again, I don't know something better than Weil's formula, some expression in Riemann Kirvicha tensor. In fact, because I was thinking. Because I was thinking, but sorry, for this conjecture, too, I mean, in dimension three, there are these works that explain how three-dimensional Alexandru spaces also can be geometrized in the same way as three-dimensional manifolds. So we I mean, one could try to use that classification of geometries and different types of collapsing that happens in these geometries to try to think about this conjecture. To try to think about this conjecture. That's what I was saying. Interesting. Yeah, thanks. It was a very nice talk. I really enjoyed it. Okay, thank you. Are there further questions or remarks? So if this is not the case, let's thank the speaker again. And we continue in three minutes. Sorry, Simano is still there. Yes, can I ask somewhat unrelated to your naive question, maybe? Question: Maybe is just because I don't know this theory, are intrinsic volumes related to the heat kernel? I mean, what if you can take the heat kernel, say, the diagonal term and expand it. So instead of expanding like volume tube G, you expand like the heat kernel, and there are also. Like the heat kernel, and there are also some coefficients. Yes, as far as I remember, they can be expressed through a spectrum of Laplace on differential forms. Intrinsic volumes can be expressed via spectrum of Laflush and differential flux. Semyon, could you stop sharing your file? Thank you.
