All right, well, thank you so much for the introduction. And of course, a big thank you to the organizers for still being willing to put on this conference, even though it's not in the format that you had originally imagined. I'm definitely very grateful to have this conference going on this week. So the work that I'll be talking about today is joint with my grad student David Gill, my colleague Jeremy Rouse, and my postdoc Lori Watson, but it does build significantly on some prior work that I did with Os. On some prior work that I did with Aslam Edjar, Yuan Liu, Francis Odumundu, and Bianca Varai. So, I want to start by saying what an isolated point is. And so to motivate it, I really want to back up to a question that I think many of us already know the answer to, or at least a general idea of how the answer goes. So if I have a curve defined over a number field, I could ask, well, is the collection of rational points on my curve finite or infinite? Curve finite or infinite? And so for this question, the answer is essentially dictated by the genus of the curve. So if my curve has a rational point, if it's genus zero, then the collection of rational points is infinite. Genus one, the collection of rational points could be finite or infinite, depending on the rank, which in this case we have an elliptic curve. But any curve of genus bigger than or equal to two, we know this collection of rational points is finite by Falting's theorem. And so what I'm interested in is what happens. And so, what I'm interested in is what happens when we ask a more general version of this question. So, instead of looking at points on my curve in a fixed number field k, I want to look at all of the points that are defined over all extensions of k of a fixed degree d. So that means I'm fixing some positive integer d, and now I'm considering all of the points on my curve that are of degree d. And I want to ask again, is this collection finite or infinite? finite or infinite. So the case of d equals one is the previous slide. And this is a, we have a lot bigger variety of behaviors in this case because for example if you have a fixed quadratic field and a curve of genus bigger than or equal to two, there's only finitely many rational points in that particular field. But now if I'm allowing myself to range over all quadratic fields, you could pick up an infinite collection of points. And so one natural way to get an infinite collection Way to get an infinite collection of points in this case is maybe if you have a rational map to the projective line of degree D, then Hilbert's irreducibility theorem is going to give you infinitely many points of degree D coming from pullbacks of the rational points on the projective line. You could imagine a similar situation if we had a map to an elliptic curve of positive rank. You could also get a family of degree D points, but this isn't all. So we do know that you can have infinitely That you can have infinitely many closed points of degree D, even in the absence of a degree D map to the projective line or a positive rank elliptic curve. And so a better way of thinking about this question is actually by examining these points, the image of these points in the Jacobian of the curve. And so just to make this setup easier, I'm going to assume that my elliptic curve, or sorry, my curve C has a rational point. This isn't necessarily. A rational point. This isn't necessary, but it just makes this slide easier to make. And x is also going to denote a closed point of degree d. And so then we have this natural map from the dth symmetric product of c to the Jacobian. So here, if x is a closed point of degree d, so that means that they're going to be, it's some Galois orbit of length D, if we view X as a Galois orbit of points over the algebraic closure of K. And so Closure of k. And so we have this, we can view x as the sum p1 through pd. And then I can map it to a point in the Jacobian by taking the divisor class associated to the sum minus d times the rational point p naught. So this is giving me my divisor of degree zero and thus a point in the Jacobian. And so I want to imagine, well, what if I had infinitely many degree D points? Well, what would happen to those points under this map? And so we have two choices. Either there is going to be Choices. Either it's going to be injective on this infinite collection of degree D points, or it's not. And so if we have a case where two points, two distinct degree D points, have the same image in the Jacobian, then that's going to give us a function f of which is going to define a degree D map to the projective line. And thus, again, by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, we would get an infinite family of degree D points coming from that map F. Alternatively, if we imagine Alternatively, if we imagine that that collection of degree D points maps injectively into the Jacobian, well, then Falting's theorem takes over because we know that the image of this map can be covered by a finite number of translates of abelian sub-varieties of the Jacobian. And so if I have infinitely many rational points in the image, that forces at least one of those abelian sub-varieties to have positive rank. And so then we would have an infinite family of degree D points parametrized by that positive rank abelian subvariety. By that positive rank abelian subvariety. And so this motivates the definition of an isolated point. So an isolated point is just something that doesn't belong to one of these two natural infinite families. So we're going to say that if our degree D point X has the same image as some other point in the Jacobian, then again, remember that builds for us a degree D map to the projective line. And so on Projective line. And so that would mean that x's belonging to infinite family of degree d points parametrized by that map, by the rational points on P1. The other option would be if we had x belonging to an infinite family of degree d points parametrized by some positive rank abelian subvariety in the curves Jacobian. And so in that case, we're going to say that the point is A V parametrized. And so as I had mentioned on the previous slide, an isolation. On the previous slide, an isolated point is just a point that doesn't belong to one of these two natural infinite families. So we do have some general results that we can say about isolated points. So this is something that essentially is extending an observation of Fry that really builds on Faulting's theorem. And that is that we can have infinitely many degree D points. Infinitely many degree D points on a curve, if and only if there's a point that's not isolated. So, in particular, if we have only finitely many points in a given degree, that means that they're all isolated. And you can also show that there are only finitely many isolated points on our curve of any degree. And so, one of the things that we looked at in this first paper was isolated points on modular curves. Points on modular curves. And so this is of interest because of this natural classification problem. You know, given an elliptic curve defined over a number field of degree d, what are the possible torsion subgroups that can arise? So we know the answer for number fields of degree up to three, but the problem with higher degree classification is that you need to better understand isolated points on modular curves. And so this is one of the things that's sort of holding up this classification question for torsion subgroups of elliptic curves. Elliptic curves. And so that's why we looked at isolated points on modular curves in this particular project. And so recall that x1 of n, so we're going to view this as an algebraic curve over q. In this modular curve, the non-cuspital points parametrize C isomorphism classes of elliptic curves E with a distinguished point P of order N. And I'm also going to be using J to denote the J map. So if my point core map so if my point corresponds to the elliptic curve e and the point p then j j of x is just going to be j of the j invariant of my elliptic curve so with this notation uh again so here i'm going to be using balof to denote the collection of my co-authors which was edjar leu odomondu and varai and so i'm going to use i to denote the set of all isolated points on all modular curves x1 of n so this is actually an infinite collection This is actually an infinite collection of isolated points. And if I assume that Sayre's uniformity conjecture holds, so that is, if I assume that for all non-CM elliptic curves over the rational numbers, the mod P-Gawa representation is surjective for sufficiently large primes, then what our result says is that if you look at all of those infinitely many isolated points and all those infinitely many modular curves, and then you look at their image under the J map, Under the J map, there are only finitely many J invariants in the rational numbers. So, alternatively, you could think of this as saying that all of the isolated points on all of the modular curves, which correspond to elliptic curves with rational J invariant, are actually coming from only a finite number of elliptic curves up to isomorphism, assuming Sarah's uniformity conjecture. And I should also mention that, so I'm not requiring my elliptic curve to have a model defined over the rational numbers. model defined over the rational numbers. I'm only asking that the J invariant be in the rational numbers. All right, so I'm going to use the term isolated J invariant to just be the J invariant that we get of by if we have an isolated point X on X1 of N and we look at its image under the J map, I'm going to call that an isolated J invariant. And so this result leaves open a number of unanswered questions. Unanswered questions. And so again, I'll keep with the notation where I is denoting the set of all isolated points and all the modular curves. So Sarah's uniformity conjecture says that the collection of rational isolated invariants is finite. So this is likely a finite set. But then you might wonder, well, can we make this set explicit? We do know that it contains any J-invariant of the CM elliptic curve, so it does. elliptic curve. So it does contain those 13J invariants. And there were a couple other examples that were known previously. One of the things, so some of my prior work, as Philip had mentioned earlier, so some of my prior work is dealing with elliptic curves with complex multiplication. And so one of the things that I've been curious about is what the proportion of CM to non-CMJ invariants looks like in the collection of isolated J invariants. And then of course, right now, this is conditional on stairs. And then, of course, right now, this is conditional on SARS uniformity conjecture. And so, you might want to have an unconditional version of this. So, there's a lot of evidence that suggests that SARE's uniformity conjecture is in fact true, both computational and some partial cases with theoretical work. We even think that maybe you can take the constant to be 37, but nonetheless, this is still not proven in general. And so, you might wish to remove this from the theorem statement. And so, one of the ways that you can make some progress towards Ways that you can make some progress towards these questions is by imposing restrictions on the degree of the point that you're considering. And so, sort of like what Philip mentioned in the first talk, restricting to odd degree has a number of advantages, which I'll get into a little later on. But if we restrict to odd degree, then this is the main result that we get. So now i sub odd is denoting the collection of all isolated Noting the collection of all isolated points of odd degree on all modular curves, x, 1, of n. And so now I'm wondering what happens if I look at the projection of all of those isolated points mapped down under the J map. So what are the isolated J invariants that we get in this case? And so now we can say a lot more. So we have this explicit set of five J invariants, three CM and three non-CM. This is at most the J invariants that are in the The J invariants that are in the set, and we do know exactly the non-CMJ invariants in the set. So the two non-CMJ invariants on the left do correspond to isolated points of odd degree. Perhaps surprisingly, it's actually like the CMJ invariants that we are having trouble determining whether or not they correspond to isolated points of odd degree. We do know that they do give isolated points of even degree, but the points of odd degree are hard to Of odd degree are hard to analyze in a way that I'll mention in a minute. So, first, I wanted to say something about these non-CMJ invariants because they've come up before. So, this first J invariant minus 3 squared times 5 to the 6th over 2 cubed. So, this is coming from this degree 3 point on X1 of 21. Actually, there are two degree 3 points on X1 of 21 coming from the same non-semilar. Coming from the same non-seam elliptic curve. This was an example that was discovered by Philip Nyman. It appeared in publication in 2016, but it was on archive quite a bit before then. And so this is sort of a famous example of what's usually called a sporadic point of degree 3, because not only is it isolated under the definition that I've given, but there are also only finitely many points of degree less than or equal to 3. So it's even a stronger condition. So this point we Condition. So this point we knew was going to be in the classification, or this J invariant we knew was going to be in the classification from the outset. This other non-CMJ invariant, 3 cubed times 13 over 2 squared. So actually, there was a recent computational project, Philip Naiman and Enrique Gonzalez-Jimenez, found that there was an elliptic curve over Q, which attained a point of order 28 in an extension of degree. In an extension of degree 9. At that time, it wasn't noticed that this point is, in fact, isolated because there are infinitely many points of degree 9 on x1 of 28. And so there would be no reason to suspect that that point actually is isolated. But what we find is, in fact, even though there are infinitely many points of degree 9, this particular degree 9 point does not belong to one of those kinds of infinite families. To one of those kinds of infinite families that's parametrized by either P1 or an abelian subvariety of the Jacobian, and so it in fact is isolated. So the CMJ invariants, the problem is we can't determine whether or not they belong to an infinite family parameterized by a positive rank abelian subvariety. So we can reduce to the case where, you know, the first J invariant gives us a degree 21 point on X1 of 43. The second J invariant is giving us a degree 30. The second J invariance giving us a degree 33 point on X1 of 67, and the last J invariance giving us a degree 81 point on X1 of 163. But the problem is that in each of these three cases, the Jacobian of the modular curve has positive rank. And so I know, or I am aware of some computational techniques that would allow you, maybe in smaller degree, to tell whether or not this point belongs to an infinite family parametrized by one of the positive. Trias by one of the positive rank of sub-varieties in the Jacobian. But my understanding of the computational techniques is that degree 21 is a little too big to actually have them work. But I would definitely be happy to know if I'm wrong, because I realize that some of you may be listening right now who are know a lot more about those computations than I. So I'd be really interested to know whether or not you can determine whether or not these points are AV isolated. You can at least. Isolated. You can, at least in some of the cases, do a Riemann-Rock computation to show that they are not belonging to an infinite family parametrized by the projective line. So it's really just these abelian sub-varieties of the Jacobian that you would need a new idea in order to understand. Okay, so in the time that I have left, I want to say a little bit about what goes into the proof here. And one of Fear. And one of the biggest things is: what does this restriction to odd degree buy you? Well, it buys you a lot. So one of the reasons to restrict to odd degree is that you have a really nice connection between the possible n. So if I have an odd degree point on x1 of n with a rational j invariant, the support of n is very much restricted if you're in a case of odd degree because of a connection to rational isogenies. So this is something that So, this is something that was known for elliptic curves with complex multiplication by work of Aoki in the mid-90s. And this connection to isogenies, as you saw in Philip's talk, is also really important for the case of Q-curves in odd degree. And so here, just to make this result easier to state, I'm going to suppose that J invariant is not 3 cubed times 5 times 7 to the 5th over 2 to the 7th, and that also it does not correspond. Also, it does not correspond to the J invariant of one of the four non-cusponal points on X naught of 21. So there are four J invariants of elliptic curves that have rational cyclic 21 isogenies over Q. They're a little unusual, and so I just want to omit those for now. And so what we can say in this case is if I have this odd degree point on x1 of n associated to a rational j invariant, which is not one of the ones I've already excluded, any odd Already excluded, any odd prime divisor of n, you're going to have a model of your elliptic curve over Q with a rational cyclic P isogeny for any odd prime P dividing N. And so this is huge. And because we know the classification of rational isogenies of elliptic curves over Q due to Mazer, Kenku, and many others. And so you can actually conclude that under the restrictions I've imposed, then N has to be of the form 2 to the A times P to the B. To the A times P to the B, where P is in this finite set of primes, which you may recognize from Meser and Kenku's classification of isogenies. And so, not only is the support of n extremely restricted, but also the exponent of 2 is restricted as well. So it's always less than or equal to 3. But in fact, if the exponent of p is non-zero, then the exponent of 2 is bounded by 2. So you have a very, you're very So you have a very, you're very limited in the values n can take on if you have a point of odd degree with rational j invariant. So then the biggest challenge is dealing with these exponents of p. And so the key ingredient here is work of Greenberg and then follow-up work by Greenberg, Ruben, Silverberg, and Stoll, which says that if you have an elliptic curve over Q, it's non-CM and it has a rational And it has a rational cyclic P isogeny for some prime p bigger than or equal to 5, then basically the image of the piadic Gao representation is as big as it's allowed to be given the isogenies you had over Q. And so this is extremely helpful because of the following result. So if we have a finite map of curves and we have an isolated point X on our curve C, then if you look at the C, then if you look at the image of X under this map, so we have X lying above its image f of X, and if the corresponding residue fields, if the growth is as big as it's allowed to be, given the degree of the map, then an isolated point on C is going to map down to an isolated point on D. So when you have sort of biggest possible growth of residue fields, it allows you to take an isolated point somewhere higher up in the tower, pushing it down to an isolated point somewhere. Down to an isolated point somewhere lower down in the tower, where maybe it's easier to analyze via computational techniques. And so, just a rough outline of how these the nice cases come together is, so let's assume that we have an isolated point of odd degree with rational J invariant. And let's go ahead and assume we don't have a corresponding elliptic curve with a rational cyclic 21 isogeny. So, in this case, we know. So, in this case, we know just from the assumption of odd degree, and since I've assumed that the point is isolated, n has to be of the form 2 to the a times p to the b, where a is less than or equal to 2. But now we're ready to use that result of Greenberg, Rubin, Silverberg, and Stoll along with the Belloff result. And it's going to say that if I had an isolated point on some modular curve of the form x1 of 2 to the a times p to the b, it's actually going to have to. To the b, it's actually going to have to map all the way down to an isolated point on x1 of 2 to the a times p with a finite number of exceptions, which we can handle. We know those exceptions explicitly, and we can handle them via other means. But essentially, this reduces the question. So the assumption of odd degree restricts the possibilities for n. And then the results of Greenberg, Rubin, Silverberg, Stoll, and the Philip paper allow us to push a possible isolated point down to essentially the curve x1. Essentially, the curve x1 of p or x1 of 2 times p. And so then we can show that either we have an isolated point or that there's the you can't possibly have an isolated point of odd degree on such a curve. And so this is the way that the nice cases go. And so you might ask about like the cases that are not so nice. So the main thing is with the 21 isogenies, well, first, the supportive and Well, first, the support of n is a little bigger. We could have power of 2 times a power of 3 times a power of 7. But the big problem in this case is that you can have maybe unexpected entanglement of torsion point fields. And so you have this degree 3 number field that's contained in both the 7 torsion point field and the 9 torsion point field. And if you're trying to understand isolated points, it gets more complicated when there's intangues. Gets more complicated when there's entanglement because, you know, for example, if you could have a point on x1 of 3 that's not an unusually low degree and a point in x1 of 7 that's not an unusually low degree. But if those residue fields intersect in some unusual way, you could then have a point on x1 of 21 that is an unusually low degree. And so when you, it's when you have these instances of entanglement that you're concerned that maybe you can't control where these isolated points are. And so one of the things And so, one of the things that came up in the first paper that was really useful is that we are able to give an explicit uniform bound on the level of the M-atic Galois representation if we fix the support of M. And what I hadn't realized until working on this example is that actually, if you have instances of entanglement, then the bounds can be improved. And so, that was one of the things that we were able to leverage. One of the things that we were able to leverage in understanding elliptic curves with rational cyclic 21 isogenies is using entanglement to actually get improved bounds for the ematic OWL representation. The only other case I wanted to highlight is the case of the prime 3. And again, this case is hard because you imagine all sorts of entanglement could happen between two and three torsion point fields. And so in this case, we have to take a very different approach. And so just, for example, one of the really So just for example, one of the results of this flavor, so if we want to rule out isolated points of odd degree with rational J invariant on X1 of 54, X1 of 62, we actually construct curves that parametrize elliptic curves with a particular kind of entanglement. So for example, if you have an elliptic curve where the intersection of the two torsion point field and the 27 torsion point field is an S3 extension, then we actually construct an explicit model of a curve C over Q. An explicit model of a curve C over Q, which would have a rational point if there were such an elliptic curve with this kind of entanglement. And we can essentially reduce to the case of having to understand a particular explicit genus 4 curve. But luckily, that gives a map to a genus 1 curve. And so we can use that to show that the curve C has no rational points. All right, so that's, I think, about all I have time for. So I will leave you with the final. Leave you with the final result and stop here. So, thank you very much. Are there any questions or comments for Abby? So, I have a question. So I have a question. What's next? I mean, X1 of N is awesome, but there are more modular curves out there. Yeah, no, I haven't been looking at those because I know of some other people who are working on like X naughtovin, for example, might be a certain person's thesis problem. And so I, yeah, I mean, you can definitely do this for other, for other families of curves, but for the sake of not stepping on any toes, I've been sort of sticking. On any toes, I've been sort of sticking with X1 of N's for now, but yeah, that's always like the natural question: like, what about X not of and what about just like X sub H in general? So, so yeah, you could definitely move on to other families of curves, yeah. I have a question. Um, so I mean, odd gives you a lot of leverage, but if you increased either like degree. Like degree two times an on, or maybe looking over J invariant intersected with like a quadratic field. Can you push any farther in that direction? Yeah, and so this is actually, so David Gill is one of my grad students, and so he is exploring like the case of even degree and whether or not you want to either just place restrictions on N outright or if you want to. right or if you want to you know look at you know instead of odd degree would you look at at two times odd degree um but it definitely uh it it it definitely gets a lot more complicated once you move away from odd degree I mean the the exponent of of two if you allow that to increase at all then you're allowing for you know a lot of possible instances of entanglement which might be harder to control and also if you move for j invariance outside of the rational number Invariance outside of the rational numbers. Well, all of this was crucially relying on the classification of isogenies of elliptic curves over Q. So even if you just move to J invariance in a quadratic extension, you no longer have that nice classification. You know, in line with Philip's talk, I actually think that if you maybe look at Q curves, then that might be like a way to try to push the classification farther because there is this connection. Because there is this connection that he talked about at the end, where you can connect them, especially in the case of odd degree, to elliptic cursors, rational J-invariants via isogenies. But yeah, I mean, I think you certainly, I don't think you would be able to get this explicit list without knowing a lot more, but there are various other restrictions that might be fruitful. Other questions or comments for Abby? Well, if not, let's thank her again. So, Habby, if you could send your So, Abby, if you could send your slides along, that would be fantastic. Yeah, sure. Who do I?
