Okay, hi everyone. First of all, thank you the organizers of this workshop for the opportunity to present my work. The work that I present today was done in collaboration with Luis Palasio, who is my student here, Federal Desparana, and with Marcel Flamarion with the University of Peru. And the more details about this work can be found in this preprint, which is available at the archive. Okay, the agenda for this talk is the following. That for the stock is the following. First, I will make some quick comments about results on stock strift. How may you go? Then you give some physical description of your problem. And at the end, you present some numerical experiments. Okay. I start this talk by saying that, okay, a Stokes wave is a period travel wave. In this talk, we denote by Lambeth, the wavelength. By lambda, the wavelength, and by C, the wave speed. And it is known in the literature that the particles beneath a Stokes wave and they were drift in the direction of the wave propagation and the trajectories are loop shape. It's also known that the total kinetic energy of a fluid particle in the lab frame over streamline is a convex function and reduces with the increase of the depth and depends solely on the death in which it. Solarly on the depth and reach its maximum on the free surface. And besides, it's also known that the total kinetic energy of a streamline in the moving frame is equal to a constant. And this constant is given by the speed, the wave speed times the wavelength divided by two. Oops, problem. Okay. Now our main goal is to investigate the effect of a normal magnetic field on the trajectory shapes. Field of the trajectory shapes and in kinetic energy properties. Basically, we measure the trajectory shape, the trajectory shapes by computing these three parameters here, D1, which is the Stokes drift, D2, which is the maximum horizontal displacement of a particle, and D3, which is the maximum vertical displacement of a particle. The numerical setup is the following. Let's assume that we have two wall electrodes, and between them we have a dielectric fluid. And we also assume that we have a difference of voltage potential between the electrodes. We assume that the fluid is in rotational flow and that the electric field is a normal one, which means that the electric field acts the normal direction. Electric field acts the normal direction of the wave propagation. We write the Governor equations of this system in the non-dimensional form. And besides, we write the Governor equations in the wave-moving frame so that we can eliminate the time-dependent at the free surface. And by doing this, we get a Laplace equation for the velocity potential and for the electric potential, the fluid. For the electric potential, the fluid domain. And also we get these boundary conditions. Here, the most important thing that I have to say about this boundary condition is about this parameter here, this parameter EB, which coupling the fluid with the electric field, and EB controls the intensity of the electric field. When B is equals zero, we obtain the classical Euler equations. Euler equations. Okay, the numerical procedure that we use for solving this system is basically the conformal map that we use based on the first Fourier transform. And pattern trajectories are computed through the Hujikuta methods combined with the transform with the conformal map. And those results can be found. Can be found, details about those methods can be found in those papers here. So let's start with the numerical simulation. The first simulation that I'd like to show is this one in which we compute the drift time as a function of b. So the drift time basically is the time that a particle takes to travel from one troth to the next one. To the next one in the wave move frame. So basically, when we see here the drift time as a function of EB, we basically notice that as we increase EB, which means when we increase the intensity of the electric field, the drift time increases, which means that the velocity of the particle is getting slow. slow it's got it's got it's got slow and i uh and i understand this this increasing in the drift time as a consequence of the decreasing of the wave speed as a function of e b and in order to investigate the effect of e b in the geometric parameters of the particle trajectory basically we use the wave generated by e b equals zero as reference then we compute zero as reference then we compute d1 d2 and d3 for different choice of vb then we compare the the relative a ho for of these parameters those figures here basically tell us that the okay d1 d2 and d3 barely change with variations of v b, which means that the electric field does not change the shape of the particle trajectories. Of the particle trajectories. And so now we move on and try to investigate the influence of VB in the total kinetic energy of a fluid particle. The total kinetic energy in the laboratory frame is given by this formula here in red, and the total kinetic energy in the wavemove frame is given by this formula here in blue. In blue. So let's first see what happens with the total kinetic energy in the laboratory frame. See here, when we increase EB, what we see is that, what we notice is that the total kinetic energy decrease. And also, we see that as the particle goes to the freezer. Particle goes to the free surface, we notice an increase in the total kinetic energy. This is the same that happens in the water wave flows. And when we see the total kinetic energy in the wave move frame, basically again we notice that the increase of V B decrease the energy. the the energy and and besides we notice that the the energy is constant in the in spite of variation of the death this and this constant uh we can we can check numerically that is the same constant that is valid to the case of water wave flows so basically uh this in summary uh our results indicate that a normal field act on the you know the Magnetic field acts on the wave, it slows down the path trajectories and does not change that shape. Besides, we down-numerical investigation tell us that the total kinetic energy decrease with the increase of the intensity of the electric field. And we show numerically, of course, that the properties of convexity and the constants approved for water wave flows remain applicable to HCD flows. So, this is the So, this is the main reference that I use in this talk. And here's my email address. So, anyone interested in this problem, anyone who has any suggestion, please feel free to make contact. It would be a pleasure. Thank you for your attention.
