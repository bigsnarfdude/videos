Are you Are you talking? No, it's uh it's a recording. Okay, so go go ahead, please, then talk. So, Suman, we can see the recording, but we cannot hear it still. Oh, you cannot hear? No. So, there was a suggestion that maybe if you unplugged your headphones, we would be able to hear? No, I'm plugging. I'm I'm plugging a headphone for I have I'm blogging a headphone so Suma, Isha suggested that you need to go your computer setting to actually share the computer audience and mute your your earphone. Is that correct, Ishan? Yes, yes, it was. Yes, yes. It's my earphone. Just two minutes. You have to show a computer audio first, actually. Yeah. It's coming, right? Or another way is you can show your video and you talk yourself, right? You don't need to record it audio. Uh audio Yeah, just speak to the slides that are that are on the screen. Suma, we still cannot hear you. I think you need to do probably the best way you do the live full audio and and you just talk and sh and show us share with us the uh That's the slide. Okay, I will explain this one. Is that work? Yes. Yeah. Okay, go ahead. Okay. Hello, yeah. This is my topic: construction of new cufflash with Qing Application. And I'm working this with my supervisor, Professor Dr. Yujang Kyuzhao. And this paper has actually two parts: one is construction of new copulas, construction part, and one is application part. Part and this is a construction of copula. And here we construct a new copula. Its name is bound copula. We have given a name bound. And we also construct and derive, we derive measure of dependency and tell dependency of bound cofula. And in application part, we have so many applications of cofula, but here, since this is a concave and it's Since this is a con cube and it's about queuing, and we try to apply copula in a queuing theory model. And here, we just analyze the dependency between two service times to evaluate mean waiting time and mean service time. When customers launch two copies of stocks on two parallel servers, and we use a cancel and finish process, and in that case. And in that case, the interval time is assumed as exponential, whereas the service time is general. And for this process, we have considered the service times, since service times are general, we have considered service times are shifted exponential and hypo exponential. And actually, this is a working paper. We are still working this paper, and we are trying other service times. We are trying other service times also, like Parato, Habitail, and other. Now, definition of copula. We are all, I think, familiar with definition. Copula is a Latin word, and this word coming from the Latin word copula, and it's meaning it's joined together. And it's meaning it's joined together. So it's a function kind of function, vibrated function that joins a distribution function to their one-dimensional marginal distribution. And we have a famous Skeller's theorem, which is a relation between marginal distribution to their joint distribution function. If x and y are two dependent random variables, with distribution function, Random variables with distribution function u and v, then this colour's theorem is defined as copula of uv equals joint distribution function of x and y, which is given here. And here, here is a mathematical definition of cofula. Cofula is defined as like function i squared to i, where i is from 0 to 1, and it satisfies. 0 to 1 and it satisfies two conditions boundary conditions and two increasing property here measure of dependency and tail dependency for this new bound corpora we derive measure of dependency and tail dependency it's a very measure of dependency and tail dependency we know are plays very important role to analyze To analyze the dependency between two components, a measure of dependency generally denotes how much two components are dependent to each other. So it summarizes the dependency between two random variables. And in the literature, we have so many measure of dependency there. And we have considered here four measures of dependency: experiments rook, Kendall Strauve, Blanquetzbita, and Kinney's Ghana. Kendall Strau, Blanque's bita, and Kinney's gamma. And for this new copula, and we derive these four measure of dependencies also. And for tail dependency, tail dependency means how much the two random variables are dependent in the tail area, right tail or left tail. And for the bound copula, we also derive a coefficient of upper tail and lower. Coefficient of upper tail and lower tail of the bound cofula. Motivation for constructing bound cofula. We know that we have many different data in real life situation. Any particular copula cannot fit for all data. So it will be an asset if you have varieties of copula in the literature. That means we have more. That means we have more copulas in the literature. We will have more choices to select copula. So we are interested to construct a new cofula. And at this bound coffee, satisfies fresh bonds. Here, this is the relation of fresh bonds. Maximum U plus B minus 1, 0. This is a lower bound of fraction bound. Fractured bound and minimum UV is upper bound on the fracture. Any copula lies between these two bounds. We realize that many copulas do not reach upper bound and upper bound minimum UV for perfect positive dependence and the lower bound for perfect negative dependence. That's why we try to find such a copula which reach this bound, minimum and maximum bound. Minimum and maximum bound, and this our newly derived bound cofula satisfy these properties. And in the literature, we do not have a similar structure-wise cofula like a bound cofula. And here is a definition of bound cufula. Bound cufula can be defined as cufula after. can be defined as couple of uv 1 minus theta square uv plus theta by 4 times 1 plus theta square minimum uv minus 1 minus theta square maximum u plus v minus 1 0. Here obviously if we take theta equals minus 1 for perfect negative dependence then we get copula value we get lower bound that is maximum u plus b minus 1 0 and for theta equals plus 1 for perfect positive dependence For perfect positive dependence, then we get CUB equal to minimum UV here, and this bound copula satisfies two properties of copula, that is boundary condition and two increasing property. We have already proved that this cupola satisfies both properties of a cupola and its characteristics is simpler in construction. Simpler in construction compared to other copulas in the literature. For example, other copulas, Archimedes Coppola, Clayton Cumpol Koppula, Frank Koppola, Gaussian T. Koppula, Mikhail Olliha Coppola, all compulsors are little bit different and it's very difficult to use and find like a distribution function and expected value in explicit form. Value in explicit form, but for this bound cupola is comparatively easier than other cupolas. It has a wide range of dependency. That means all four measure of dependency, that is experiment zero, Kendall Star, Blancet's beta, and Guinness gamma. The range of these four measures of dependency are from minus one to one, like a copular parameter. Copular parameter also. Parameter, coupled parameter also from minus one to one. So it has a wide range of dependency and it is that it satisfies for all data. And the one important thing is it has dependency in the tail, right tail and left, left tail and measure of dependency and the four measure of dependency experiments through Blanquish, Beta, Guinness Gamma and Candle Star are given here. Candle star are given here, and the first three that is experiments through Blancos beta and Guinness gamma are all equal, which is theta times theta squared plus one over two. And candle star is here. In all cases, when for perfect negative dependence case, theta equals minus one, all dependency are equal to minus one. Whereas for theta equals one, for perfect positive dependence case, all four measure of dependency are also one in this copy. Dependency are also U1 in this cupola and tail dependency of bound cupola tail dependency is defined as coefficient of lower tail and upper tail equals theta times one plus theta square over four here for this bound copula. So, it is it has significant dependence in the right tail and left tail. Application of copula. Now we are going to application part. Copula, we know copula is useful and popular in many areas and its popularity is nowadays growing day by day. Growing day by day. We can use this in keying model, financial risk, hydrology, portfolio management, optimization, etc. But here we have as application in keying model. And actually, we are going to analyze the dependency between two service times and deriving expected mean waiting time and mean service time here. And we have some literature reviews. Literature review related to our paper. I have mentioned four literatures here: literature review. The first one is on the waiting time strengths with dependency between inter-arrival and service times by Mueller. In this paper, the author analyzed the dependency between inter-arrival and service times. In the second paper, the conditional distribution of waiting time given Q length by Patil and Nimbleker, they analyze the dependency between waiting time and Q length. Between waiting time and queue length. And they use their gumball capula with one example, one airport example, and they analyze the result. And third paper simultaneous arrival of customers to two different queues and modeling dependence via couple approach. In this paper, they just analyze the dependency between two waiting times when customers arrive to two different queues, two parallel different queues sign. Queu to parallel different queues simultaneously. And fourth paper: Efficiency Radency Technique for Latency Reduction in TART system by Jossie, Solzhenin, and Overnel. In this paper, they have evaluated mean waiting time and mean service time when customers launch a replica of ESQ in two parallel servers by using cancel and finish. Cancel on finish process and cancel on start process. But here we are going to evaluate mean waiting time and mean service time. But we are just analyzing or we are just considering dependent service times here. In this paper, they just consider independent service time everything, but we are considering for dependent service times. Dependent service times. First of all, I want to discuss about cancel and finish policy. Cancel and finish policy means when we launch two copies of each tracks in two different queues, parallel. That means we have two parallel servers and two queues. Two queues and each tax has two copies. And when any copy of the tax is served, the other copy is cancelled and removed from the system immediately. This process is called cancel and finish policy. And the other policy is cancel and start. And cancel and start policy is different. And cancel and start policy, when any copy of the tax reaches the head of the queue. Riches head of the queue, then the other copy immediately stops. But we are just in this paper, we are just considering cancelled and finished policy, which is difficult to analyze service and service time in cancer and start policy. And here are one lemma in this paper: if we launch two copies of fees using
