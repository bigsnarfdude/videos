I'm happy to get to a bit of a polling feature to get a sense for all of you a little bit better. And so I'm going to be using Slido. If you are new to Slido, you can either scan the QR code that's on the left side of the screen with your phone or another tablet, or you can go onto a browser and type in reg stringer numbers at slider.com. At slider.com. But Kenny, the first thing to get some more depth here is to get a sense for what companies research study we consider to be classified as changing subject research. Okay, people starting to respond. Fantastic. Response is still coming in, so I'm going to give it a few more seconds. Okay, so it seems like the majority of people would say half or more of their research studies would be categorized as human subjects. And that's the two question. And here we just one more question here, which is how often does your research go through the IRB review process or something similar? Okay, there are more flip here and also a couple of responses being here. Okay, thank you. So I want us to keep this in mind as I go through. So again, I've got some questions. So again, I'm about to talk about some of the ethical implications of bio-brand analysis. And broadly, when people are asking that, they might cover things like respecting research for the economy or informed consent or ethical considerations for the return of results, data privacy, donor confidentiality, data storage and concern for diversity in file banking to promote equity. And I doubt Dr. Lewis is going to be talking after me and we'll cover some of these topics as well. But I'm actually going. As well, but I'm actually going to take somewhat of a different approach. And so, when I think about the bio-game process, if we think about what it means to set up a bio-game, one it starts with participants sharing their data. That data is then protected, researchers access that data and study it, participants then get information, and researchers share their discoveries. And so, the process starts with humans, and then it hamfers to those humans being. And it transfers those human beings transform into data points. And what I'm really interested in is how do things get translated back to the people who have contributed their data to the biobank? How do we fully realize the benefits and also mitigate against some of the potential risks of human biography and health? So this is taken from all of us, but some of the stated goals of developing biography, include things like nurse partnerships. include things like nurturing partnerships, delivering rich data sets, conducting health research. And what I am going to get to is how do we prioritize these different aims? How should we prioritize them? What does it mean, practically speaking, to develop partnerships? And what goals beyond recruitment should we have when doing so? So in short, what are the processes that transform the humans to give their samples for research into data points that researchers The data points that researchers then ask us to conduct their studies. And how often are we explicitly thinking about the humans behind the data when we're looking at biobank data or other big data sources? How often are the preferences and values of the humans behind the data considered upstream in the research conflict? And how would we even effectively incorporate those preferences and values? So thinking about this, what can make it challenging to fully realize the benefits of biobanking? Realize the benefits of biobanking out, you can also mitigate against potential harms. And this is really what I'm going to be focusing on today. Hopefully, in our discussion, we'll be able to brainstorm some way to human rights or analyses such that the humans behind the data feel closer or more immediate to us as we do our analyses. So the first consideration that can make it challenging to realize the benefits of bio-bank analyses and also to mitigate against potential harm is the fact that existing mechanisms for regulating the equity. Mechanisms for regulating the ethical concept of research, they are limited in their ability to appreciate the downstream implications of research, especially the potential social harm. So in the United States context, researchers tend to be regulated by federal policies like the Common Rule, by research ethics committees, by institutional review boards, IRBs, and IRBs generally don't regulate risks other than those that are directly encountered by research participants. Encountered by research participants. So, one of the reasons that I had those fully upgrades at the start was to get a sense for how often are people interacting with IRBs, if at all, and also to make clear here that IRBs are not the be-all et-all when it comes to considering the ethical implications of our research. This is taken from the common rule, and it says frankly, IRBs should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gains. Effects of applying knowledge gained in the research. So, for instance, the possible effects of the research on public policy, as a non-just research risk that fall within the purview of its responsibilities. So, this first consideration is really that the broader social impacts of research are generally neglected when we think through existing mechanisms for regulating the ethical conduct and translation of research. The second consideration. The second consideration is when you think about who is given the ability to decide the harms and benefit of research, it's traditionally left to researchers themselves, to professional societies, to regulatory bodies. So even if we were to expand how we think about risk and benefit in our ethical analyses and think about some of these broader down-to-implications, we would still be constrained by a relatively narrow set of actors who are. Narrow set of actors who are allowed to define the harms and benefits of research. So, for instance, if we look at IRB membership, despite efforts to try and enhance diversity among IRB memberships, they still remain relatively, racially, ethnically homogenous. If we look at the genetics profession, this was a survey run by ASHG that found that the majority of Majority of people who are working, training, and studying in the U.S. in genetics are self-identifying as white. So, again, there's a relative homogeneity in terms of the researchers who are doing the research and also in terms of the kind of external entities that are given the responsibility right now, which is through risk and benefit. But one of the issues with this is that there are actually many different communities who are affected and who affect the conduct and change. And who affects the conduct and translation of genomic research. People like funders, academic journal editors, members of industry, media journalists, educators, members of the public more broadly. And not only do these different communities affect or are affected by the context in translational economic research, but they also have responsibilities to mitigate the harm to the genetics and to promote its benefits. It doesn't just fall on the scientists. And so thinking about And so, thinking about that, the third and final consideration that I want to bring up here is the fact that the role of social responsibility in the ethical conduct and translation of scientific research is poorly understood. So people may have heard of the term social responsibility, they may be familiar with that phrase, but there's not necessarily a lot of clarity around what it means. Researchers, all of us, we have an obligation to address the social and political To address the social implications of our work in an ethically responsible manner. So, what does this mean? This includes the obligation to do no harm, the obligation to help others, and to help the public address the influx of sin of our research. And society, we have all benefited whether directly or indirectly from government support of our education and research. And so, we also have an obligation to society. These various obligations that come together to form the Come together to form this concept of social responsibility. And I think one of the things that I want to emphasize here is that social responsibility isn't a concept that is only relevant to those who are doing subject research. You know, for instance, if we think about gene drives, that's an example of an area of non-human genetic research that had a broad implication. Gene drives affect the environment, the ecosystem, they can adversely impact people living in those communities. In those communities, as much as they might also benefit them. And so, all of these factors: the limited ability to appraise the downstream implications of research, the limited range of perspectives that are allowed to define harms and benefits, the lack of clarity around what exactly social responsibility is and how to practice it. They all come together to reduce the incentives that exist to consider both our own and others. Both our own and other social responsibilities to mitigate against the harms of our research and health focus benefits. In 2021, AAAF submitted a survey of scientists and engineers, and one of the key findings here was that researchers view themselves as having social responsibilities, but their beliefs about these responsibilities, they don't translate into consistent behaviors and actions. Again, not a lot of clarity on what exactly it means to practice social responsibility. Social responsibility. And some of the dilemmas that we might encounter when thinking through how to perform our social responsibilities include the one that's related to problem collection, so deciding whether a proposed study is worthwhile to fund, to do, to report on. The one that's also related to publication and data sharing, so deciding whether to publish the study, where to publish that study, how to publish it. And then finally, the one that's related to engaging. Environmental developments related to engaging society, so deciding whether or how to engage the public. And these dilapidates pointed to how difficult the concept of social responsibility is and how difficult it can be to know how to exercise it. And so just to summarize these three considerations, one, it can be easy to see the data, but it can be hard to see as humans to hide the data. The downstream and locations of research affect real people in the real world, but they often In the real world, but they often go underconsidered upstream during the design phase. And also, there's a relatively narrow set of actors who are empowered to define the risks and potential benefits of research. Finally, as I've said many times already, social responsibility is difficult to define, and it's also poorly understood. So with those considerations in mind, I want to provide some examples of thinking through how do we go from Thinking through how do we go from humans to data and staff again? How do we translate the benefits of our analyses to the people who have donated their data for our study? One example here is the Native Bio Data Consortium. Folks may already be familiar with this. This is a nonprofit research institute. It's the first nonprofit research institute to be led by NHS scientists and tribal members. Scientists and title members in the United States. As a biorepository of biobanks, the Native Biodata Consortium endeavors to ensure that advances in genetics and health research benefit all indigenous people. It was established in 2018. And here are just some examples of the aims of the NATO BioData Consortium, keeping samples and data local, building tribal capacity, fostering trust in research. Fostering trust in research and conducting research that benefits size. And here they say, in this era of big data, small populations such as indigenous groups will always be at risk for erasure. And so our goal is to build more robust data sets that encompass all aspects of health to investigate health outcomes that actually benefit conditioned people. So including the community, not only as getting their perspectives in terms of how these studies. Of how these studies might be conducted or what other values and preferences are, but also building that capacity to have members of the community, maybe the researchers themselves. Another example here is a project that I was fortunate enough to be involved in that had a community founding board accompany a larger republican group thinking through the risk and benefits of social and behavioral genomics in particular. I know Dr. Alicia Martin. I know Dr. Alicia Martin is there with you all at present, and she was a part of this group. And the community sounding board component of this project had a number of goals, but one of them was to foster dialogue between academic scholars and community members whose lives might be impacted by research into phenotypes that social and behavioral genomics researchers currently study. Another one of our goals was to get public insight regarding whether conducting some types of social and behavioral genomics. Some types of social behavioral genomic research is not ethically permissible, and to the extent that this research is conducted, how it can be conducted and communicated. And there's a QR code if you want to access the paper. I only have 20 minutes, so I'm not going to go into too much more detail about the community sounding board, but you can access that paper if you'd like. Another one that is a pilot program that was started at Stanford, where I'm based, is something called the Ethics and Society Review. Ethics and society review. And this, in particular, is meant to supplement or help researchers to think through the downstream implications of their work and fill the gaps that may exist given the relatively narrow scope of IRBs. So, right now, most of the studies that come through the Ethness Society Review are studies using AI with machine learning. And the goal here is that. And the goal here is that as a requirement to access funding as part of the grant process, the funding process, people who are submitting their proposals have to submit an ethics and society statement. And then they iteratively work with those of us work hard out of the ESR community to think about the downstream implications of their proposed work and to think about potential strategies to both mitigate the potential harms and to promote the benefits that they tell. To say it's helpline. So it's really designed to think about those downstream implications, and in particular for areas of research that maybe aren't going through the typical IRB review process that might not be classified as unique subject research. And also studies where we know that there are broad vital impacts for the work that aren't necessarily under the purview of the entire CDC process. And then the final example that I want to provide here is more in the realm of education. Another initiative that we started at Stanford is to develop work forums for genetic PhD students and trainees to think about the ethical and societal implications of their work. This was a trainee-led course started by PhD students within the genetics department at Cancer University. We have a paper that's come out. We have a paper that's come out that detailed this process. I'm very fortunate that I get to get faculty sponsors with the course. And our curriculum is available online. We want to make it available for others who are hoping to integrate this training or components of this training into their own programs. And three of the learning goals for this course are to connect the historical context of genetics research into its modern-day practice, to evaluate the prior. To evaluate the societal ethical implications of genetic work, and to analyze how societal norms are structured, along with personal identities, biases, and responsibilities impact the conduct of scientific research. So with that, I'm going to take a bit of a whirlwind, but hopefully opens up the door for some fruitful conversations. I'd like to thank my colleagues, in particular, those that I've been able to work with on the rest of the social and behavioral genomics working group and our community founders. Working group and our community counting board members. I'd like to thank, in particular, the two PhD students who have now been friended, Rosine Patal and Rachel Ungaugh, who are the leads behind this Gene Q20 or genetics ethics and society course. And I'm also funded on a K01 that is in different day. How do we get a broader consultation about the risks and benefits of genomic research to happen? And I will leave it there. All right, next thing, Group Speaker. Questions? Yeah. Yeah, Definitely, I think this is maybe a softball, just giving you more time to.
