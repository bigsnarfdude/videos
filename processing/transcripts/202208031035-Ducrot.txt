First of all, I would like to thank uh the organiser for uh the invitation. It's a great pleasure for me to be here. Actually, it is my first time in Barnes and also my first time in Canada, so I'm doubly happy to be here. So my talk will be related to the existence of pulsating wave for epidemic system, and this is a joint work with And uh this is a joint work with uh um Jean Jong Deng from Long Jong University. So um the aim of this talk is to discuss uh the existence of wave for an epidemic system uh similar to the one uh presented at the beginning by Roman. Presented at the beginning by Roma yesterday. So it is this system of fraction diffusion equations. So S depends on T, so the time, and X, the spatial position, and it denotes the number of susceptible in population, and I denotes the number of infected in this population. So here, the process for the contamination is very simple. Is very simple, so the susceptible and infected guys can meet, and with some probability that may depend on the special location, can become infected. And the infected, after some rates, after some time, can become removed. So here removed means either it's dead from the disease, either it's immunized or whatever. It's immunizer or whatever, but either way, it exits the system. And the individuals are able to move according to a diffusion that also here we choose a dependence with respect to X for the generality of the model. And the question we would like to discuss is: can we get some information about We get some information about the existence of wave for this system, in particular when the spatial heterogeneity, so modeled in the diffusion coefficients but also in the contamination function, are periodic in space. So for simplicity, just think about one periodic in each uh direction. Alright, so this is the the Alright, so this is the goal of this talk. And so first of all, I will discuss the case where the coefficients are not dependent x, so homogeneous case, and then I will go to the periodic case and give you some idea of the proof. Alright, so the homogeneous The homogeneous system in 1D, in one-dimensional of the spatial variable, read as this one. So here you have constant diffusion coefficients and the contamination rate and exit rate, remove rate. And um question is uh how to describe uh the outbreak of a disease Outbreak of a disease when you start close to a disease-free equilibrium. So, this means a population which is constant in space and the density of infective is close to zero. So, we can start by a picture. So, this is a numerical simulation. So, here you have the time, here you have the space. So, the time and the space. So, this is Space. So this is the density of susceptible and the density of infected. So at the beginning, the density of susceptible is constant in space. And at the beginning, you just put a small amount of infected close to x equals zero. And then under some good choice for the parameter, you have the development of a new break for the disease, propagation space. propagation in space along a straight line with plane x and time x and t so this means that with mostly a constant so the question we can discuss is what about the traveling wave for this system and so this system has been actually well studied Well studied. So if you think about the diffusion coefficients are both positive. DS and DI are positive. So you can look at traveling wave solution. So that is specific solution that are depending on one variable, Z, which is X minus C T and C, the speed of propagation. So you look at the profile equation that The profile equation that reads as follows. So you have a ODE for the profile. And you look at solutions that are bounded, both are positive, and you want to be close to the disease-free equilibrium you fixed at the beginning when Z is close to infinity. In that case, the existence of The existence of such a wave is strongly related to a number that was also introduced by Roma yesterday, which is the so-called basic reproduction number. So, which is given by this formula. So, you have the ratio of the contamination and mostly the time during which to stay infected, and it is multiplied by the density of susceptible at the end of the day. Density or susceptible at the beginning of the eclipse. And so, to describe the propagation phenomenon, so the traveling wave of the system, you can compute the linear speed. So, you just use the equation for V and you replace U by S 0, so the point at infinity, and you look at exponentially decaying solution, and you can get an expression for the An expression for the linear speed, which is given like that, and this expression is only valid when R0 is a strict is larger than 1. We have a positive argument under the root. And okay, so now we can look at the precise existence results for this. When the R naught is less than 1, actually we don't have any traveling wave. So R naught small. So R0 smaller than 1 means that even for the ordinary differential equation without space, you cannot have an outbreak for the disease. When R0 is larger than 1, strictly larger than 1, then you have a minimal wave speed. So no traveling wave when the speed is smaller than C star. And for any C larger than C star, you have a traveling wave, which is which satisfies some Which satisfies some properties. So, in particular, the S component is non-decreasing, and this traveling wave connects S0, 0 to some constant that you call S infinity to 0. And this constant, so the the density of susceptible after the epidemic is actually less than one over Less than one overwhelm or not, so that you cannot have successive waves that appear for this model, just a single outbreak. So, this result has been proved by Ozono and Ilias. And so, they use ordinary differential methods to prove that. And then you have some results that make use of That makes use of, we would say, a PD method. So PRSTT, ML, T-SLEF, and RESIG, that work not on this epidemic system directly, but for a system that occurs in congestion, but which is rather similar, and which is both in a cylinder and with a personal boundary. Thomas worked also on this kind of problem with a cylinder with heterogeneity for Heterogeneity for a section. Here, Magellan, you work on that when you have some additional structures such as age of infection. And you also have some work with time delay, in particular by Wong and about ten years ago. So for the homogeneous system, you have system you have good description of the of the of the traveling wave actually okay so now let's uh go to the periodic case for the periodic case you assume that the coefficients now depend periodically on the space and you assume that all the functions are let's say smooth and beta and gamma are strictly positive Strictly positive, and both matrix the matrix of diffusion DS and DI are symmetric and uniformly analytic. So we would like to discuss the same question as in the homogeneous case. So we fix this E3QB protocol, S00, S0 is a constant, and we look at pulsating wave. Pulsating wave describing the propagation close to this disease free kilo. So, what is a pulsating wave? So, it is an entire solution that is bounded. Both components are bounded. The S is in between 0 and S0 and the I is strictly positive. And you have the two-setting relation, so when you move the time. The time according to this k dots E. So E is the direction of propagation divided by C. Then this means that you move the profile, translate the profile by K in space. And finally, you want to converge to the disease free equilibrium in the direction of propagation E far away toward the full. Uh for the front, and you want this convergence to be locally uniform with T and uniform with respect to the variable which is orthogonal to the direction. Right. So, so what do we get for this system? So, first of all, we can look at the way speed. What is the expected way speed for this problem? So, we use the same on that as for the fish. The same answers as for the Fischer-KPP equation, and actually the same onsets as for the homogeneous problem. So you choose S0 close to S0 and Y, which has an exponential decay, and you plug into the equation and you get eigenvalue problem as before. So it is exactly the same elliptic operator as you can get for the Fischer-K equation. So we can look at this relation between rate of the wave and the direction of the propagation and the speed of propagation. And to do that, so we define mu zero as a minus k0, which is a parameter which is independent of the direction of propagation. And this parameter Propagation. And this parameter actually plays a role as the basic reproduction number of the homogeneous case and more or less describes the stability and unstability of the disparate. So in particular, if mu0 is negative, this condition is similar to R0 larger than 1 for the homogeneous case. So we expect to have a wave. While when μ0 is not While when μ0 is positive, then it is similar to R naught less than one, and we do not expect to have training. It is exactly what we obtain. So, we define first the minimal way speed. So, we assume that we are in the case where mu zero is negative and we define the minimal way speed. This minimal way speed in each direction is a strictly positive using this. A strictly positive using this condition. You have an alternative definition, which is a minimal speed for which you have a DK rate, a positive D rate. With this notation, actually, we have obtained the following results. So you assume now in the situation where outbreak may occur, so mu zero is less than zero, then for each direction And for each direction, and the speed C star E is strictly positive, and for each C strictly larger than C star E, the system and it applies to the wave propagating in the direction E with the speed C. When new zero is strictly positive, then as expected, you don't have any missing in any direction. So, this is the results we have obtained. So this is the result we have obtained. So uh to uh connect with the work the work CT by the uh Roman yesterday, so you have also similar results when the susceptible do not diffuse. So the that case you can quote Kalen, Brighton and Bistoma you also get some results for the periodic case. The main idea is to look at the total amount of the total amount of um removed individual, so the integral from zero to t of the density of infected, and this quantity actually satisfies the Fischer-type equation so that you can so uh the idea of the proof is uh the following. So if you look uh the following. So if you look at uh the the profile, the profile of the of pulsating waves. So it is what is a profile? It is a a solution for which you have the variable of propagation and another variable for which you have paired. So if you plug this profile into the system, you obtain a degenerate elliptic equation, typically this kind of elliptical. Typically, this kind of analytic operator. So, to avoid this degeneracy, there is several methodologies. So, here we use another way to write down the profile. We split the variable t and x according to the direction of propagation, so the projection along the vector of propagation, the projection Projection orthogonal to this direction of propagation, and we keep the time. And we will use this free variable as independent variable to obtain the system for which we don't have elliptic degeneracy, which is already good, but if you choose well the direction of propagation, actually you end up with a space and time periodic problem. Space and time periodic problem, so that you can study it. And the direction of propagation we choose are the rational direction. And then, since this is a dense in the unique sphere, we can use an approximation argument to obtain any general direction. So, we use this idea to revisit To revisit the existence of wave from a multi-dimensional feature KDP function. And I need to say that this actually, this methodology is inspired by some work of Bages and Martinez twelve years ago, and also Bages, Martinez and Rogchov around ten years ago, who 10 years ago, who used this kind of splitting of the state variable to study propagation phenomena when you have only one direction of propagation. Alright, so now if we want to go deter it further, so we heard by By E1EN, the canonical basis of Rn, and we take a linear orthogonal transformation that maps one vector to the direction of propagation. In that case, actually, we can have a parametrization of the variable we discussed before. So, we can generate point X can be decomposed as a project. X can be decomposed as a projection along the vector P and the orthogonal. And if you look at the orthogonal inverse applied to X, so you have the first component which is along the first vector E1, and E1 S, which is What this, which is on the vector E2 to EA. And you can define, so if you look at this operator acting on the orthogonal of E, you have here, you can define a new orthogonal operator that maps the orthogonal of E into a vector space spanned by E2 to En, so this means K minus R to the R minus R to the n minus 1. Alright. So now if we look this kind of change of variable, so what we call a profile, a pulsating profile, is a specific solution that depends on three variables, C, T and Y. So X C is a real variable, T is time, and Y is a variable in R to the In R to the n minus 1. It is given by S i T x and we replace x by the rotation, so the orthogonal transformation applied to this. Here you keep the propagation along with the vector E, and here you have the orthogonal area. And if you look at the profile in this the uh profile in this using this coordinate coordinate actually, you don't have a degeneracy for the uh elliptic operator. So that's good. And if you look at the pulsating condition, actually the pulsating condition rewrite like that. So it's quite awful if you look at this. But if you choose well the uh the orthogonal transformation and the direction of propagation actually. The direction of propagation, actually. This is a very simple condition. So we can, if you, the direction of propagation is rational, actually, you can find a basis such as that the lattice N can be written with the new basis as a lattice like that, such Lattice like that, such that the first vector is actually the vector of vector you consider in fixed ability direction, and you use it as the first vector to transform your vettis. When you use the orthogonal transformations that map the canonical basis to this new basis, actually the condition, the possessing condition, rewrites The presetting condition we write as this space and time parallel condition. So, all right, so this is a reformulation of the problem we have to handle. So, we look at solutions of this problem that are periodic in T in Y, so the two last variable, and you have the propagation along with the first real variable, and you collect. Variable and you connect the disease-free equilibrium probably to something that you don't know in general. Okay, so for this problem, we can prove the existence of solution using a sub-super solution pair, like in the method to look at the homogeneous problem, you can obtain the existence of solutions for any rational direction of problem. For any rational direction of propagation, so you have the existence of a bounded solution with an exponential decay at infinity that preserves the rate lambda coming from the speed C, which is larger than the sister in the direction you are considering. And uh the when you have this so this the proof is obtained uh by using a suitable uh fixed point argument. suitable fixed point argument. For this specific system actually it is quite complicated to obtain the boundaries of the solution. So here we use some idea we developed this Thomas and Hiroshi in years ago. And now to conclude for general directions, so we need to to pass to the limit. To the limit. So we fix a general direction, we choose a sequence of rational directions, so this is possible. So this has been used recently by Ding and Agile Etiv. And we fix a C which is larger than the C star E, and we consider the sequence of solution, and we try to pass to the limits. So here again, a difficult So, here again, the difficulty is to prove the boundedness of the solution. But the boundingness is okay, you can easily pass through the limit. And conclude. So, here we have the existence of solution connecting S00 to probably something, but we don't know what is beyond what is behind the forms. So, we can do it for specific directions. For specific direction and when the diffusion are constant. But what about when you look at the general direction and non-constant diffusion? An open question for the moments. Thank you very much for your watch. You? Are there questions or comments? You mentioned that so before the last step you assumed the directions are rational. Where did you use that rationality? Rationality is to obtain when you look at this problem, you need to use a fixed point argument and you need To use a fixed point argument, and you need to get compactness in some sense. So if you have the no, you cut, actually, you get the three variables are unbounded. So here you need to cut for the first variable so that what we are working we are working on for bounded interval for the first variable and we keep You keep variable like that, and you have a compactness compacity property for the two other variables using the priority. Sorry, you don't have a non-existence result. You don't have a non-existence result, but do you think this time is optimal or not? Is it always like not above this threshold you can construct and I think it is optimal we will leave, but you're right for the moment. There are other questions with no, let's thank Huno again. So thank you.
