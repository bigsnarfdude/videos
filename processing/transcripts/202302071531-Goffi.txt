Thank you for the invitation. First of all, thank you for this nice invitation. And I'm thankful my talk within this nice workshop in this nice place. And in which we will talk about homogenization. When I say homogenization meaning that you have something inhomogeneous and you would like to get something homogeneous. For some materials we will see why they are dispersive. We will see why they are dispersive and when saying strongly, that means there is something big. And then we try to understand all of these words here. The work is a collaboration between mathematicians and physicists. So we try to work together in order to understand these materials. Okay. My plan is the following. We start by the motivation and we should be In which we understand the concept of these materials, which are called meta-materials. In the second part, we will see some of the applications, where we can find them and what are their properties. Third, we move to the most important part, which is the homogenization, where there are many approaches and we received one use. And to conclude, I will. Okay, the problem to which you are interested is the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a periodic medium here. And when having something composite, that means if you would like to define the equations, the equations, yeah, whatever the phenomenon, the coefficients will be possible. And in order to have a more simplified equations, Equations, we proceed, we do the homogenization. That means writing these equations through some coefficients. And these coefficients are constant. They do not take into consideration the spatial variations here. As it is the propagation of light, our equations are the Massive equations. The time dependency is harmonic. We see here four equations. We see here four equations which are combining the four fields. We will discuss them in the next slide. And dehomogenization means writing these equations with homogeneous coefficients. Here we are not seeing any coefficient, only the field. And omega is the time frequency, C is the speed of light. For making this process, we should be at first careful about some constitutive About some constitutive relations which we use for our homogenization. This is what we use in later. This is why we start at first making the difference between matter and these artificial materials. It is always better to get to what do we know or what do we have in nature in order to understand what we have fabricated. For natural materials at the atomic scale, At the atomic scale, they are constitutive of a huge density of atoms. For one cubic centimeter, you have approximately 10 to the power 23 of atoms. Here, through average, these materials will be seen as homogeneous through the average theory, and it is all the whole theory that we don't talk about it now. But through averaging, these natural materials will be seen as homogeneous. Will be seen as homogeneous. We don't take into consideration any spatial properties. And for the equations which are governing the propagation of light here, our Maxwell equations, where you have the electric field, the electric displacement, the magnetic, the magnetic induction, H is the magnetic field, omega as I said is the time frequency, C is the speed of light. C is the speed of light. You have these four equations, and all of these fields are vector-valued complex fields. That means you have in total 12 amounts. And here we have only 8 equations, which are not enough for solving this system. This is why it is important to introduce some equations, which are called the constitutive relations, and these relations give us the results. They give us the response of the medium to an incident electromagnetic wave. In the general case, we have the electric displacement which is linked to the electric field through the polarization P, and the magnetic field is linked to the magnetic induction through the magnetization P. These relations are general and there are some simplifications. The polarization depends only on E and the magnetization depends only on E. And the magnetization depends only on this. And in the most simplified constituted relations, this polarization and magnetization is somehow they will be represented by the electric permittivity epsilon and magnetic permeability u here. Both of them, they depend on the time frequency and their properties. We can say they are complex numbers or real numbers. What is remote What is remarkable here is that they are positive, or if they are complex, the real parts are positive. Exception for the metals where the permeability can be negative, for some fixed easier. The question that one can ask here, what about the materials with some negative parameters? In nature, in reality, we don't have that. Is it possible to To fabricate them, and in case it is possible, which properties do we have? This question was asked by Victor Dizilago in the 16th of the last century, and he gave also the answer. It was a theoretical answer, where he said that if they exist, there will be some unusual phenomena. And the result. Oh my god, really? I have to go to the beginning. Sorry. Yeah. And it was the result was published in this paper, February 68. And the phenomenon that we can have, I choose it, a liquid, in order to see this situation over. Here on the left-hand side, you have a liquid. When insert. When inserting for example a spoon or a pen or whatever, you see this is the reflection. So the same thing in vacuum and into the liquid. But on the right hand side, you see that the direction is inversed here. This is what is called a negative refraction because, sorry, because it is changing the direction. Here it is a liquid, but here it is more CN. These materials These materials, after almost 30 years, John Pendry could fabricate them. He could produce them in reality. And his idea was to use a combination of high contrasted particles, combining different materials with high contrast of this electric and magnetic permeability. In this way, you can get, in general, a negative permittivity and permeability. And after that, there was a bunch of applications. And then there was a bunch of applications in physics and engineering. For understanding more how these meta-materials are constituted, so meta means it's a Greek word, I think, and it means beyond something, beyond the properties of natural materials. They are artificial periodic materials which are constituted or made of a large number of sub-wavelength inclusions. It is in somehow the case. It is in somehow the case for atoms for natural materials. And these inclusions, they are called misses. And if you are curious how could we make them, there are several cases. And what is important here is the nature of the user's materials, their geometry, and also the way of arranging them. In the first example here, when taken a slab, metallic slab, A slab, metallic slab, for example, and across it with continuous wire, then you get this unique sand here. When arranging them periodically and having different layers, you get what is called efficient metal material. A second example are split-ring resonators. Having these rings, crossing them, this is our new mid cell, and then we get the following structure of. A selector of hemitamaterials. They are arranged periodically. Now, what about their applications? In fact, we can find them at first in optics, as I started, and this is the case to which we are interested in our research. Here, in the following picture, you can see the axis here is epsilon and E. For the case of natural materials, when you have epsilon and E positive, you have a positive reference. Positive refraction, this is what you have in general. For meta materials, when both of them are negative, you get this negative refraction. But in case where one of them is negative, you get only reflection. There is no transmission inside the material. As I said, you have always a negative refraction for this kind of metamaterials. The first structures that they were made before, at first it was. Before, at first, it was these split rings here. You can see here that they are a little bit big. And what they do here, they express this negative permeability. And when crossing them with continuous wires here, you get also a negative electricity. And for the applications, always the first thing, when say you meet a material, it's hiding objects. In this simulation here, we have two materials. One is material and one is a metal material. You can see that in the scattering, you have here a scattering. But here there is nothing. It is hided. And the point here is that when playing on the geometry, the light rays will be bundled and that they hide your object. The second application is in acoustics. Sometimes you see some ceilings which have Ceilings which have some holes here. Here you don't have it, but I'm pretty sure that all of you have seen them. In fact, they are not for decoration, but they are made for absorbing sound. Another application is to make some structures to be invisible to some sound waves, and we find that especially for submarines. Other thing is to enhance the quality of voice, where they use here. Phones where they use here these Helmholtz insulators. You have a cavity with a neck here. You can either set them periodically or have only one of them. The third application is in mechanics. In mechanics, the aim here is to have this negative modulus bulk, density, and Poisson ratio, whatever. The acoustic metamaterials are a special case of them. And for the applications here, And for the applications here, first it's better to see. So, here you have a picture for a mechanical metamaterial. It was made first by Belton Mohels, I think, a famous book about composite materials. And you can see here how they are joining these unique cells. And for example, for such type, when you do shear, this shear tensor, it will be somehow small, not like something which is bulk without such size. Bulk without such structures. For the applications here, it is for hiding objects. And there is something funny. That is a kid's story. Do you remember of something like this? A baby. And there was sorry. And something like this. Do you remember the kids' talent? The princess and the mattress and the pee. Oh yes. Which was suffering for Satan when she had this pee and her mattress here. If this mattress was made of metal materials, she will never No store in that case. Yeah, there will be no story. This is one application. They are used for hiding objects. Hiding objects, or for example, for security reasons, for absorbing shells, for example, for hell mass development. And also, it can be here up to hundreds of meters or kilometers, for example, for guiding the fiasmic waves in order to protect some invisible, some sensitive infrastructures. Yeah, these are here the applications. The most important thing is that you have the composite structure with some. Composite structure with some strange properties. Now we move to the most important part: the homogenization. I think all of you have already an idea about the homogenization theory, where you do some asymptotics and then you write the homogenizing problem at the end. In fact, here we will not follow that approach and we will see how. Before starting, it's nice to remember always what do we have for natural materials. Matural materials. For them, you have these types of constitutive relations, where you know that you have positive materials. For metamaterials, they are also inhomogeneous, which needs to be homogenized. But for this process, here it is important to be careful about these constitutive relations that we start for, than for doing our homogenization process. This is why it is important always to check the ratio between the arrangement periodicity and the weight line. In fact, if your periodicity arrangement is much smaller than the weight line, here you can always use these constitutive relations. And they are called it vocal because when observing at a point R, the Point R, the response is always obtained at the same observation point. This is why they are called local constituted relations. But for the case of meta-materials, in reality, especially optical metamaterials, it's true that the arrangement periodicity is smaller than the wavelength, but they have the same order of magnitude. This is why physicists recommend to use such type. To use such type of constitutive relations. The following relation describes your metamaterial at the effective level already homogenized here. But the issue is that for this R here, the response tensor or response function, we don't have an explicit formula for it. This is why this formula should be simplified and why it is non-vopping, because if you send an electron Because if you send an electromagnetic wave at an observation point up, your response will be obtained at a distant point. So we take the distance between these two points, which means you are taking into consideration the neighborhood of your observation. This is why it is non-local. And then we will see the importance of this non-locality for observing the properties of the metamaterial at the effective level. Yeah, and here you can. Yeah, and here you can resume. We have always an inhomogeneous metamaterial just for understanding the limits of each approach. For natural materials, here you have the A is much smaller than the wavelength. Here you use these vocal constituted relations for your homogenization approach. For the case of optical metamaterials, you can see the periodicity is smaller. The periodicity is smaller, but they are comparable. They are at the same length of magnitude. For this case, here, for high-frequency regions, physicists say it is not possible to do the homogenization, or in other words, it doesn't have a sense. Because if you send a wave here, it will see all properties and it will not see something in here which has a combination for some different parts. This is why we are not into the. We are not interested in this part here. In the math community, you will find most works which are using these local constitutive relations. For our case here, we are setting ourselves in this area here. And now, before moving to our approach, I would like to recon some of the most important works where the others used these The others used these local concept due relations and they used the asymptotic homogenization. The homogenization in PDEs, it means taking the asymptotics, which means taking for example these oscillation parameter to zero and then doing some limits and generally write your big problem, you prove that it has a unique solution, and then we try always to get some a priori estimate which says that your solution. Estimate which says that your solution is founded, and then you extract a sub-sequence which is weakly convergent, two-scale convergent. It depends on the case where you are, which type of convergence do you prefer or what is available for you. And at the end, we say that all the subsequences are convergent and we get our homogenized prof. For example, here, the first work that was done, it was by design. The first work that was done, it was by Buchitti and Finberg. It was exactly at the same time where John Penry discovered or fabricated this micrometer at 1797. It was for parallel fibers. For split ring resonators, we have the works of Robert Lipton and Ben Schweisser. For this sound absorption, when we use the Helmholtz equation, we have also some works for Ben Schweizer, mainly and AMAD. And Amari. Amari was also studying the resonances for these meta-materials. And there are also some methods, numerical methods, where we find maybe Gaddis, Hanem and so forth. And there is also another group in the UK, which is a Russian group, but they are in the UK, where they use some multi-scale expansions and they arrive also to the homogenized problems. The difference here is that. The difference here is that for metamaterials they arise to some homogenized problems which do not have the same nature of the initial problem. And in somehow it describes this dispersive character of meta materials. So their homogenized problems, they were more close for discovering or observing this dispersive character of meta materials. Uh dispersion. Uh dispersion means there is always a dispersion relation. It allows us to compute or to observe how these lead is dispersive. For by definition the dispersion relation, it describes the dependency of the components of the wave vector or the wave number will be frequency. And in order to get it for our case, what we do, we insert We insert the plane wave inserts into our wave equation for the Maxwell equations. In fact, we started by first order Maxwell equations. Here we have a second order. What was done? We just apply the curve on the first equation for the electric field and then we get the following one. And we also use it, which involves also this electric displacement here. Here. K0 is the wave number for the monochromatic incident electromagnetic wave. The plane wave here is just a plane, a wave which is written in the form where E is the amplitude, which is constant, and you have here K, which is the K wave the wave number, and R is the position. For simplifying things, we can do some specific polarizations. to some specific polarizations, TE polarization or TM polarization, while inserting them into our equation, we get the multiple system. It seems to be like applying the Fourier transform, the spatial Fourier transform. If you apply it also on your equation, you will get the same formula here. For computing your dispersion relation, uh what we do, we compute the determinant of the following system. And Of the following system. And when this determinant, it is your dispersion relation because here it is a system and not something for only one component here. And its solutions, which are the component of this wave vector here, are the eigenwaves and their corresponding functions or they are the propagating eigenmodes. When computing these special relations for metamaterials and sodiness, we can observe the propagation. We can observe the propagating modes here. And what we see here is it felt better to go back to natural materials, to be able to see this, what is happening between both of them. When using a local constitutive relation, this is your dispersion relation. It is a polynomial of order 2, which means at the presence of a surface you have two propagating modes. For here, you have the For here, you have the incident wave, you have one which is reflected and the other one is transmitted. And for defining or solving the system here, we use the interface conditions for Maxwell equations, where you have the jump of the electric field, which is zero, and also the jump for the magnetic field. Here, the curve of E is the magnetic field. This is what happens for natural when using natural. It is always true for natural materials, and when also considering the following equation for also metamaterials, we will see the same thing here. But when considering a non-local constituted relation, we will see later that when simplifying this relation, the dispersion relation will be a polynomial of higher order and not of order 2 here. Of order two here. When having a polynomial of higher order, that means you have multiple propagating modes inside your ether material here. And for defining these propagating modes here, you need more interface conditions. These two ones here, they are not enough. And you need to compute additional interface conditions. This step here is very important. This step here is very important and you can see that there are many propagating modes dependent on your dispersion relation and its order. Now, the most important task here is to simplify this constitutive relation. So, the approach is the following. You see that your relation is simply a convolution between the response tensor and the electric field here. Densor and the electric field here. And when having a province, the first thing that comes to mind is to apply a forget one's law. Forgetting a multiplication. Here, k is the spatial frequency and you have the multiplication of R, the response, with B, E, the excited electric field. And for small lenses or for small length is or for small um yeah for small wave numbers or the um the length of the wave vector when it is small we can do some approximations why we do these approximations because we don't have an explicit formula for the response field we do some approximations and when approximating the kernel we have mainly some polynomials multiplications and when applying the And when applying the inverse Fourier transform, these multiplications will be written as different derivatives somehow. And after that, what you can see, you can see that the simplification or the approximation for these constitutive definition will be seen as the definition operator. What we do later, we substitute it into the wave equation that we have. To the wave equation that we have. And then we derive the approximate max wave equations which are homogenized here. And their coefficients will be the effective coefficients that we are looking for for describing these homogenized medium. But in fact here, these coefficients here are not only effective coefficients, but they are also important for computing its propagating waves. Waves. Here we have an explicit example. What we considered as an approximation, it was a Padilla-like approximation or a rational approximation, where you have the inverse of an operator applied on another one. Here we don't have operators, but we have polynomials. We are still in Fourier space. Of course, this one should be not uh This one should not vanish. U-hat and P-hat, here we assume that they are second-order polynomials. And at this point, it comes to this intuition of physicists. Which type of polynomials to take for our approximate constitutive relations? What was suggested here is to consider some second-order polynomials. Polynomials, and when applying the inverse FUD transfer, what we recover? We get something in the following form. Something written in this curl form, gamma and alpha are the effective parameters. They are dependent on the pipe frequency. And we don't know which one of them will be useful. This is why we considered the three cases for each one of them. Cases for each one of them. Why we do this? Because gamma and alpha are matrices. We consider them to be diagonal matrices. They do not commute with the curl operators. We considered the three situations for both of them and when substituting into the wave equation, we get the following generic approximation for the wave equation for the Maxwell equations. In blue, the terms in blue here are second order, up to the second order, because P here is a second order operator. For Q here, it is a second order operator when applied on these two curves here, which are coming from the equation here, which will be at the end of fourth order mode. So, here, at the end, what we are seeing, instead. what we are seeing, instead of having as usual second order equation, wave equation, we have a fourth order one. The blue terms here, they can be simplified in a way that we can recover the Maxwell equation, the second order Maxwell equation which is given by the curve of E minus 1, curve of E equals to E equals to k squared epsilon E. This is what we have in general. The one that we get when considering walking constitutive directions. And the blue term here, for one case of them, can be simplified to the following problem. The most important term for us here is this, the fourth order, which is describing the non-local effect and Effect and this monologue effect can be seen as a dispersion inside these beta materials. And the way for being able to observe this dispersion was to start from a non-local constitutive relation. When substituting each case of these ones here, which means at the end you will get nine equations. Nine equations, which one of them is good for describing your homogenizing. Describing your homogenized beta material, what you should do, we should study all of them and then arrive to the best. And the best means the one which fits more or better what is coming from the experimental data in somehow. You can see all of them they are of fourth order. The difference is always these effective parameters which are Effective parameters, which are each time sitting in one place, and each one is keeping its place. This is why, as I said, we have to study them. And the case that we consider here is to consider, it's the most easiest one in some way, is to consider a half space vacuum. And vacuum, we have the relative electric permittivity to be always one. Alpha and gamma are zero. The magnetic permeability is always. Permeability is always one. And something I didn't say at the beginning is that in these magneta materials, we always consider non-magnetic materials. That means your mu is always one. And in the second half space, you have your homogenized meta material. These affect the parameters, alpha, epsilon, alpha, and gamma, all of them they are. Alpha and gamma, all of them they are assumed to be diagonal latencies. Here we know the behavior in each half space, but what is not yet clear is the behavior at the interface between them, which type of interface conditions which are allowing us to move from one part to the other one. This will be something of big importance for us because it describes how they are behaving and also And also, they allow us to compute many things that you will see later. Okay, the dispersal relation. It is the dispersion relation which allows us to see the dispersive character inside these homogenized metamaterials. When computing this dispersion relations for all of them, Hood resumed them in the following table. And in fact, they were nine modes, but you could regroup them into three and some five types. Q0, Q1, P0, P1, they are some coefficients involving this epsilon, gamma, alpha, all of these effective parameters. But what you see here, all of them, they are fourth-order polynomial equations, which means we need to see. Equations, which we need to solve now for computing our propagating waves. So, you're assuming that your coefficients are isotropic, right? Yeah, yeah. But how? Because I'm thinking if you have like a fibered material, you will get a transverse isotropic material. Not get an isotropic material. You're right here. What we are considering in reality is this fishnet meta material. That was our. Material. That was our specific. Yeah, it is for that specific one. So it is not for fibers, but for these layers. I see. And now, as we have seen together, nine equations, each one is the best. After starting analyzing all of them, we could set the checklist constituted of three criteria. If the model satisfies If the model satisfies these three criteria, we can accept it. If not, we reject it. That means the model is not good for describing these homogenized metamaterials. The first one, it is based on the analysis of interface conditions. It's well known that for solving an equation, the number of anodes should be always equal to the number of interface conditions to be handled. After sat sat and computing the interface conditions, In computing the interface conditions, some models of them didn't satisfy these conditions. But we're rejecting them since the beginning. And then the number decreases. The second step was to compare that model with what do we have in reality. A reality for natural materials, they are described through a model where your non-local parameter gamma is zero. That means if we take that gamma, means if we take that gamma to be zero, are we able to get an equation like that one? And are our interface conditions the same as the interface conditions that we have seen for the jump of the transjunction components of the electric field and the magnetic field? If it is satisfied, we move to the third one. The third one is based on a symmetry condition. condition. The symmetry here it is called Kazinier-Onzager reciprocity. It is not Onzager that we have seen in talk of Felina where she considered some Onzager critical spaces I think. Here it is something for symmetry. These relations or symmetry relations here say that the electric field and electric displacement D, they are symmetric and they're Symmetric under time inversion and they are anti-symmetric under space inversion. When checking the symmetries for our response function in somehow, the approximate one, we found that it is symmetric. And at the end, in the following table, you can see all of it. So, here with the red cross they are rejected since the beginning, these two models want These two models, 1.3, 2.3, that is satisfying this and somehow that you have the same here for both lock and open. And for the symmetry condition, you can see that for the model 1.3, it is not fully accepted, which is the following one. Why? Because it satisfies this CP condition only if your gamma is a scalar. Your gamma is a scalar and not a diagonal matrix, as we started. And then we considered the model 2.3, which is the following one here. You have here the second order term here, epsilon, and this second order term here. In fact, this alpha here can be combined, these two second order terms here can be combined together. And what we get when we combine And what we get when we combine both of them, we find uh something we can write mu minus one to be one minus k0 squared alpha. Which means we got an artificial microphone. Remember that we started from material. Started from materials which are not magnetic. They have mu is one, but then we have an artificial magnetism. This is a very important property also that we can have from meta-materials. You can get an artificial magnet. Yeah, and the most important term for us is always this fourth-order term, where gamma is the non-local effect. The non-local effective parameter, which is allowing us to observe this dispersive character. Okay, yeah, and now it's true that we have the model, but right now we are not sure whether it is good or not. Through this analysis, it says that it is good, but in reality, we should also check this. Check this. This is why we move to some comparison with some data that we can get from experimental. As I said, according to your question, we consider it a fishnet metal material. For in yellow here you have a dielectric material and in between there is it is a metal. is it is a metal. Of course they have their specific permittivity and permeability is always to be on. What we do, we solve the Maxwell equations here numerically, which is F and here solving them by Fourier model method. We can get the solutions and what we do through them, we compute some coefficients. These coefficients are called the reflection Called the reflection and transmission coefficients. In fact, these coefficients are the following. Rho is the ratio between your incident wave and the reflected. And two is for the transmitted wave and the incident. Be incident. One. When computing these two coefficients on the surface, which is separating the beta material to the vacuum. And we do that for fixed frequency and for different angles of incidence. We can see here in blue, they are the coefficients obtained when considering local confusions. Considering local constitutive nature, it is called weak because it doesn't allow us to observe this dispersive character. This is why it is big spatial dispersion. The second one, which is up to the fourth order term here, it is said to be strong dispersive or a strong dispersion relation here. You can see here for the real part, which is the continuous line. Which is the continuous line. The weak spatial dispersion or the local constituted relations are good up to maybe 29 degrees for your ancillary wave, the angular wave. But in red, which is the strong one, it is up to 60 for both of them, tall and old, which means they are good. They allow us to observe something. We could have something that we We could have something that we didn't have before using these, or sorry, these ordinary constituting relations. But somehow there is still some gap here, which it is better to be improved. This is why it is better to move to high-order approximations. Before moving to these high order approximations, let us see together how to compute the interface conditions and which type of interface conditions do we have one. interface conditions do we have when computing them for this mode local code, this relationship. The model I chose is the following one, 3.1. Why I used this because it was rejected and we will see why it was rejected. You can see it is the following. What we do for computer interface conditions in general, we start from a weak formulation. Everything here is in the weak sense. Uh we multiply by test function and we use the following really formula for the curves. You have if the curve moves to the other field without changing sign like for the gradient and something on the interface. For our equation, when writing the big formulation and what we do, we separate, we have the equations in the upper half. In the upper half space and the lower half space, we regroup and then we do inverse integration. We recover here, as you are seeing, the wave equations on each half space. And we have also some terms which are common, which are defined on the interface. These volume integrals vanish. And what we keep, we keep only the surface integrals. Surface integrals are the following. And you can see here that you have the following term, which is multiplied by your test function, the tangential components for your test function, plus something multiplied by the curve of your test function. What we do here, we which means in somehow we have two different test functions here. What do we do? We choose We choose at first a test function in the following separable form. You have phi1, phi2 test functions on R2 multiplied by a smooth function defined in the normal direction, which is equal to one, for example, on the surface, and it vanishes at infinity. When that means the trace on your gamma, here we get phi outer, and when we At 5.2. And when computing its curve, you get that the Don Zosch components, the two components here, they are zero, which means the following term here vanish and you get only this integral. Since phi1 and phi2 are arbitrary, then you can extract one interface condition. What you can see here, it seems to be like the It seems to be like this term having the jump of the tangential components plus a term coming from non-locality. Now, this term it gave us one interface condition, then when choosing another for the test function. This time what we do is eta we multiplied by z here and when making the trace for both phi and trace for both phi and its curve, you get this time start zero, that means that one it was already zero, and here for arbitrary phi 1 and phi 2, we export the second interface or the other interface condition the following one, which is only involving non-locality. These are two interface conditions we could obtain for these and we have another one which is We have another one, which is coming from the assumption that the energy is finite, which gives you that the term of the tangential components of the electric field is zero, plus and minus here they just refer to the places on the upper half space and the lower half space. In addition to the other two interface conditions we computed. That means here you can see that we have three. At the beginning we had only two, but here We have only two, but here for this model, these are the interface conditions that you use for solving your equation, for computing the reflection and transcription coefficients, for finding also your effective parameters and computing them namely, which is called the retrieving process. Yeah, the important term here is the fourth order term. But when comparing this with what do we have in general, with what do we have in general for the Maxwell equations when considering all the constitutive equations. Here we have the inverse of u. It cannot be seen here when taking gamma to be zero. Here it has alpha to be zero. And this is why this model was rejected because we had the same number for interface conditions Number for interface conditions and the second number of the modes we are looking for, but when comparing this with the equations which are our reference, it didn't satisfy that compatibility we got. This is why, for example, this model was rejected. And so on. We do the same for the other ones. Okay, as I said, in order to improve the quality of Of this approximation, we can move to higher order approximations. What we do here, we start always from the constituted relation into Fourier space. What we do? We considered the following polynomial approximation. I said before that here we were guided by these intuition of physicists, where we considered some massifications which allowed us to recover later operates the Recover later, operates the curve operators, which resemble the nature of Maxwell equations, which are written by curve operators. That was the idea. Here you have always your electric permittivity. And alpha and m are the effective parameters. And here you have an approximation up to the order 2m for any gigaby entitle number. number. When applying formally the inverse Fourier transform, these multiplications will be seen as derivatives, the curve operators, and of course here we applied n times here to n minus n. Okay, when substituting into this constitutive relation, here you have the approximation. The response is given Response is given by the following higher-order differential operator. Okay, and if we go to that example when considering two health spaces, vacuum and homogenized metamaterial, you have the homogenized equation here, and in vacuum it is always homogeneous. We don't do anything there. But the issue here, we don't have. Here, we don't have any information about the interface, but how to move to the other side. This was the main important thing that we should do. And it was not trivial because you have any given order of your operator, not second or third or fourth. This is why the challenge for Asian year was to compute these interface conditions and write them in a nice way that allowed to use them. To use that. Okay, yeah, and the approach is always the same: writing the big formula and doing some integrals in where you recover the volume integrals, the surface one, the volume ones vanish due to the wave equation, and the surface ones they allow us to do our computations. Here, the choices for the test functions they got the following form. The following form: we always separate these test functions here for each component, where phi1 and phi2 they are C infinity compactly supported functions in R2 and chi z in the normal direction or the propagation direction, they are also smooth functions which are one at the neighborhood of your perfect and vanish to infinity and then. And then we extract them one by one, one by one. And we try to write a compact formula which regroups all of them, which can be valid for any approximation or any order you consider. Here we have always this first interface condition that we have from the energy which is finite. Second, you see that you have this first term plus an operator LK which is applied E minus, that means trace of the electric fields on the lower part. This operator is given in the following form here. Here you have this still in function and for k here vary into this interval which interval which covers all these orders and somehow up to arrive into 2n minus 1 because we are considering an approximation of 2n. The order is 2n. Here you are seeing something very general but it is nice to see its efficiency for something specific. This is why what we did we just considered the sixth order. In fact there is something here you didn't ask me about it. Why the order Me about it. Why the orders are always even and you don't have odd order terms. In fact, they are all even because we considered symmetry in our beta material. The central symmetry, all odd terms, they disappear. And we have only even odd terms. This is the model. And when using that formula, the complicated one. The complicated one. Here you have the other additional interface conditions. The affected parameters are alpha1, alpha2, alpha3. And all of them they are dependent on the time frequency. Now, to see whether they are really good or not, our judgment is always based on these transmission and reflection coefficients. We computed them for both. We computed them for both. In the square here, the curves which are made by these squares here, they describe or they are coming from the fourth order approximation. Both of them, they are strong, but one of them is higher than or better than the other one. The stars are the curves describing the sixth order term. What was happening here? Always for fixed. Here always for fixed frequency we took a set of angles of incidence between 0 and 90 and you can see here that the sixth order, it fits better the transmission and the reflection coefficients it fits better than the fourth order. Before this, when considering big formulations, Formulations, it was very weak, in fact, and not only weak. But with the stone, we can see that they differ according to the approximation order we consider. And I think we should stop here. We are not going to the A and the night. I think that one is quite good and we are happy about it. Maybe now what is important for us is to try to understand the meaning of these electric parameters. We know that alpha is electric permittivity, mu is the magnetic μ is the magnetic permeability, but these coefficients which are written in the higher order terms, it will be nice to understand their meaning, but do they reflect the reality? So this is something which is in progress. We are trying to understand these now. And also here you can see the objective function, which means the error. The error between when you have the exact The exact, and when you have these approximations, and you can see that this error here is always small for both of them, but always smaller for your the sixth order than for the fourth order. And we come to the equation. So, I think the first thing that you could learn from this board is to have some information about these strange materials which are About the strange materials, which I call it materials. They are materials fabricated or invented for having some properties we don't have in reality. We are looking for something new that reality doesn't show. How to do them, we consider just a combination, a periodic combination for different materials which have in general a high contrast between these uh their properties. Their properties. And yeah, these meta-materials express this strong dispersion. For natural materials, if you have a wave which is propagated, there is nothing. But here we can find something about this dispersion. And it is said strong because what we have doesn't show big things, it was called it as weak. was called it as weak. And this strong dispersion, a way for explaining this strong dispersion, is to say that we have multiple modes which are propagating inside your material. And how to be able to get this strong spatial construction? We do this through or by considering non-local constitutive relations. And here we arrive to the fact that in saying something is non-local. That it's saying something is non-vocal. In fact, in this case, it describes its dispersion. But for other situations, I'm not sure, maybe you can say whether it is the case or not, but at least for this case, non-locality means dispersion. And for getting some concrete formulations for this tongue dispersion or these non-lock effects, we use the approximation theory. And the approximation theory. And the approximation theory allowed us to see that a non-local operator can be seen as a higher-order differential operator. This is a way of saying things or simplifying them. I will thank also my collaborators. You can see all of them they are. Since this is for me males, so I'm the only female in them. And And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Fatima. We may have the time for a quick question. So, um how big of a role do defect play? Sorry? How big of a role do defect play if you have a defect in your if you have a periodic structure? What is your periodic structure you can't say period a periodic? Aperiodic in some cases. Like walls, you have a dislocation, you have things like that. In fact, here there is another theory which are like the stochastic metamaterials. Right. But it's not the same thing. They are using the probability and stochastics. I'm not the right person to answer you, but I know that there is another field for studying these stochastic disputes. Yeah, and somehow. Yeah, but I'm not saying that the default. Yeah, but I'm not saying that the defects are randomly extreme. Let me study them by say one. Yeah, maybe it is nice to think about that in the future. So the project here is somehow something which just started, just started since maybe eight years for arriving here. But now at least we know what happens for the periodic case, we have the models, and in the future such cases that can be Future such cases that can be considered as future questions for study. Nice question, thank you. The bell rang. So thank you so much. Thank you. So maybe we should explain in this
