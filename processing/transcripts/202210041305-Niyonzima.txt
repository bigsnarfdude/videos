Okay. So, can I start? Yeah. Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Jean de Jenyon Zima, third year PhD student at Solborn University, and I'm carrying out my research at Institut des Chance de Paris on topological defects in semi-tikes. Defect in semantic liquid crystal din films under the supervision of Professor Emmanuel Lacas. My presentation will have three main parts. I will start by introducing on the system that I am working on, and then I will talk about the experimental and theoretical methodology that I am using to study this system. I'm using to study this system. And then I will talk about the results on topological defects. Then I will go to conclusion with some perspective. Selected liquid crystal fish can host a variety of topological defects and these are areas or places where the order is normally defined since they break the symmetries of phases. And they are ubiquitous in nature as they. Ubiquitous in nature, as they can be found in different ordered systems, like in cosmology, in biology, even in condensed matter physics, where they play a central role on mechanical and electrical properties of material. So this semantic liquid crystal topological defect has been extensively studied theoretically. However, the availability of experimental data on Of experimental data on the exact structure is still scarce, especially when the nano scale is concerned. And the question of stabilization of topological defect array is very important since they are energetically expensive. For instance, our system that has a high defect density, this stabilization can be This stabilization can be attained only when we have a precise understanding and description of their structure. And the question of whether it is when they are straight or when we do some defect engineering that these defects find some application. For instance, it has been demonstrated some flexible or Flexible or defect engineering has been shown, like this bending and display, where they will changing the orientation of anchoring. And we can see one stripe here for the bending is corresponding to one flattened ME cylinder. And so, by virtue of some By virtue of some specific liquid crystal defect engineering and based on their optical properties, some applications like optical vertices generator and polarization imaging has been also demonstrated. And for the case of straight defects, it has been shown that they are able to attract and trap nanoparticle and defect core and then. On the defect core, and then stabilize the liquid crystal nanoparticle. And so, the aim of my study is to develop an experimental method that will allow to study with a nanoscale resolution the intimate structure of these semantic liquid crystal topological effects and apply the methods on the M-cylinder system with and without presence of. Presence of nanoparticles. So, the material that I work on is the ACB molecule, which is known to be able to transform from isotropic to nematic to semantic, then finally to solids. The temperature decreases. And I studied in particular when it is in semi-tick A, phases which is characterized by a stratified structure. A stratified structure with an interlayer distance of 3.16 nanometers. So it is this lamera structure actually that allows us to study it using X-ray diffraction. So what we do, we deposit a polyvinyl alcohol on a glass slide and then we wrap it using this machine and this impose a uniform planner anchoring. Anchoring on the ACB molecule that are deposited upon it, and then the AR-ACB interface will impose homotropic anchoring. So then the two antagonistic anchoring induce the bending of semantic layers into a periodic array of flattened cylinder, which are parallel to the substrate and perpendicular to the anchoring direction. So when we observe this. So, when we observe this in a polarized optical microscope, you see a periodic array of stripes where each stripe has been shown to be an M-cylinder. And this has been actually extensively studied because some parts like this sublayer, which are formed by perpendicular layers that are satisfying the uniform planar anchoring, has been put. Has been put in evidence. Also, the part of rotating symmetric layers and also the part of central flat layers, which are being the homotropic anchoring. And also some different green boundaries have been shown, like this cavature wall that is separating two neighboring ME cylinders. There is also a rotation. There is also a rotating grain boundary separating rotating layers from the central flat semantic layers. And also there is these central grain boundaries that is separating the central semantic layers from the perpendicular layers. And some topological defect also has been put in evidence. I can show like these two. Can show like these two-dimensional topological defects. Also, this 1D dimensional topological effect, I mean the dislocation. So then we aim then to precisely describe the structure of these topology codifects and their evolution as a function of thickness is also very interesting. Also, very interesting. And we also want to find out whether there are some additional defects. So the first focus is this part of quarter of ME cylinder that I will present in this part, but also we work on this. I have worked on this central part. So why do we study these two parts? These two parts, and actually, they are competition between two different types of defects which lead to a geometry in particular the period. For example, when this period increase, the central defect will be very large and then it will be energetically expensive, and then it is become unfavorable. Unfavorable. But at the same time, when we increase the period, the effect density in this quarter of a cylinder part will decrease and then will be favored. So it is interesting to precisely understand all the structures of topological defect in this system. But also, the second reason we study the two-party, we believe that the origin of The origin of the presence of this M-cylinder periodic array of M-cylinder is this energetic imbalance between different type of energy like the surface energy, the defect energy itself, and the anchoring energy. So it is also important to understand the issue of stabilization. Of stabilization of this energy. So we use a grazing incident small angle X-ray scattling. We collected the data on 6S beamline at Soles and Croton. So the first, what we do is to orient the stripe in a direction parallel to the X-ray beam, and then we rotate the And then we rotate the sample through an angle omega, which is an angle between the X-ray beam and the substrate. It is the incident angle. And also we rotate through an angle mu around the axis perpendicular to the substrate. So on these two Eiger detector, we observe a scattering ring, which is showing the orientation of the wave vector transfer Q, which may Vacuum, which makes an angle alpha from the substrate, and this ring depicts the intensity that is deflected by semantic layers whose normal is parallel to the wave vector transfer and they oriented at an angle alpha, which means that this angle alpha is showing the orientation or rotation of the smectic. The symptomic layers that are rotating around the axis of the anti-cylinders. So, then going to the part of experimental or methodology, I will talk about the data extraction. So, the first data that we extract is the delta Q, which is the width. It actually contains the information on the quality of order of semantic layers and the And the number of semantic layers that are deflecting this intensity. The second is the Q, which is the radius of this ring. And when the Black's condition is satisfied, this Q is related to the interlayer distance by 2 pi over D. So it is also very important parameters. Important parameters. And then the other data that we extract for a given alpha i along this cycle, we extract or we plot a mu max curve, which is formed by maximum intensity as a function of mu. And then we use a go. And then we use a Gaussian fitting to extract the maximum intensity and their position. And then we also extract the delta mu, which is a full width at half maximum. And actually, this contain information on mosaicity of the ME cylinder, and it comes from the the rubbing process that we we have um a side area on the the substrate. The area on the substrate. And so we have then been able to plot the position of maximum intensity as a function of algorithm, which means all along the cycle, and the maximum intensity. We needed to know to ascertain whether this intensity are in Black's condition. And so to do this, we have calculated the Bragg. The Brag position. It means for a fixed incident angle omega and knowing the wavelength of the X-ray beam that was used and the interlayer distance D, we can know on a given orientation alpha of smectic layers that we are in black's condition at this position. Blacks condition at this position, mu blags. So we have plotted this theoretical opposition, then we compare them with experimental position of maximum intensity, and we find this superposition, which confirms that this intensity was in Black's condition. So, however, to precisely study the internal structure of our imcellium that we Structure of our immune cylinder, we need the integrated Bragg intensity, which is given by the product of the Bragg intensity times the delta mu and the delta Q. So this is the curves evolution of integrated Black's intensity. So then for the part of the theoretical methodology, we have considered a perfect quote of a mi-cylinder. Cortal of a mi-cylinder, which is formed by a missing number of semantic layers from the center of curvature. And also there is a number, total number of layers in this M cylinder. And then we have calculated the intensity that can be scattered by this perfect M cylinder. And we have found that. Cylinder. And we have found that this intensity is proportional or is related to N2 squared minus N1 squared by this relationship. And then we also find a relationship of 1 over delta Q that is proportional to N2 minus N1. So having the two relationship and having the experimental values. Values we can able be able to calculate the value of N1 when we know N1, knowing this value of integrated intensity. And also, we can use one over delta Q1, we know N1. So I just want to highlight that we have tried to make this N2 constant, but it was in vain in all the attempts. Vain in all the attempts. And we only have two possibilities. The first one was to keep N1 constant, N2 varying, or N1 varying, both N1 and N2 varying. For the constant N1 evolution, because we were actually targeting a value of N1 that will give these two values. These two various proposing to each other or same result. So for constant value of n, we have find this 10. It was giving this nice superposition that we are seeing from the small alpha to around 80. Around 80, where we can see a difference due to some fluctuation in semic layer, as we will see later. So, for the case of N1 varying, we actually were targeting again to minimize the energy that is associated with this large defect, very close to the coverage center. To the cover center, and so we were building an area or a grain boundary without dislocation, but upon which there is this dislocation of buger vector around four. So we can see that there is one dislocation here. So we wanted to find this system, which is characterized by the position from the center, but also the alpha. Also, the alpha c. So, by these two parameters, we were able to find an evolution of N2, which is shown by here. This is it. And this is actually favored because it was giving a system which is less costly energetically. And so, let's go to the value of N1. I mean, N2. I mean N2 or evolution. So we can see between alpha 40 and 70, the smectic number of semectic layer is around 40. So we have plotted this in a Caltesian coordinate and we plotted all the semectic layers and we find that the thickness of the rotating semectic layer is 130 nanometers and using And using ellipsometry, it has been shown also that this sub-layer part is having this thickness of 30 nanometer. So for our sample of 180 nanometers, we can see that 20 nanometer is missing. So when we look at the path from 70 to 90 degrees, we see a very strong increase in. see a strong increase in semectic uh a number of semectic layers and then we have used this um uh number to construct this part because the first part was between 40 and um 40 and and 70. i'm sorry i lost track what's the yellow the yellow data yellow the yellow first sorry on that There's on that on the right-hand plot, there's yellow. There's yes, here. Yep, I lost track. What's yellow? That is. Yes, this rainbow. Yeah, they are data. Yes. They are, yeah. It is this number of semantic layers that we have used to plot. Then we have then plotted the semantic layers. Semectic layers, then we find this part. So, using this number of semantic layers between 70 and 90, we have then protected this part where we can see that there is a variation of period as we have seen later. I mean, area. So, by doing this, we have put it in evidence of minus one half of the. Minus one half disclination of defect core of size around 30 nanometer thickness. So then the remaining parts on small alpha from 40 to up to around 16, we can see that there is another increasing number of symptomic layers. And so this extra layer, they have to be also added because they came from a sketch. Came from a scattered intensity. So, when we look at this part and try to zoom, we will see some gaps, empty gaps. It means that there are places. However, to understand this, we can first look at the result of William and Clemens. When we consider a sample of flat or planar. Of a flat or planar sample and apply disorientation on the two parts, we will see that the curvature will immediately go to the center or between the two disoriented parts. So when we increase the disorientation, so the relaxation from this large stress will be associated with the addition of extra-smectic layers, which Layers which are also associated with dislocation. So, this is what we have in our system. It means that here we are currently building a system where we will have a chain of dislocation all around this curvature wall. And also, we are trying really to build a model that's To build a model that will be in agreement with the value of N1 that we have seen. Once we finish, then we will see how the presence of nanoparticle can affect this system. Thank you. Any other questions? You're on Zoom and you have a question. You may feel free to speak up or type it in the chat. Lisa. The buckling, I guess, of the smectic under these hybrid anchoring conditions, does it always happen in your sample only in one dimension so that you only have these rows, or do you ever see like two-dimensional undulations? I can hardly listen. I try to find a way. I'm sorry? I can hardly listen, understand. Okay. Oh, I'll repeat what I said and I'll scream at the microphone. Now I can understand. Okay. Do you see here you have these heavy? Here you have these heavy cylinders, which means that the smectic is bending under the anchoring condition just in one dimension. Do you ever see it in 2D where you would maybe see squares or something? Yeah. So yes, our oh okay, the anchoring is in one direction. One direction because the uniform planar anchoring is coming from the rubbing, which means we are rubbing in one orientation. Yes. Okay, thank you. May I just add one point on this subject? Just you see, the thickness of the simple that Donbodie is studying is quite small. But in fact, in the past, But in fact, in the past, it's a paper, the papers that Bruno described as warming, it impacted exactly on this kind of substrate for a larger signal. When you increase the signals, this 1D structure has an evolution towards a network of photocodic defects. The ones that were presented strongly. I also have a question. Can you hear? I also have a question. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. So this is Frances Casero. In the network, sorry, in these chains of dislocations, so from this schematic, do you expect to have the chains of dislocation also in the upper part of the sample? Maybe I miss this part. And if so, do you think that the nanoparticle will be just completely free to move along this chain of dislocations? Okay, you are asking whether the nanoparticle will affect these parts, the upper part? Yes, and if it's, you know, if the nanoparticle is just going to try to latch on the dislocations and move along these chains of dislocations. I don't know, maybe it's impossible to answer. Okay, so the trapping of nanoparticle in this defect core depend on the size of the defect core and then the nanoparticle size. So the size of nanoparticle, they have to be compatible with the exact size of the defect core. Of the defect core, and this facilitates the trapping of the nanoparticles. And so, am I answering the question? Okay, for this area of discrimination, yes, it is also possible that some nanoparticle will be trapped. Someone and Patko will be trapped there. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Other questions? We have some time. Hello. All right. Well, thank you very much, Jean-Devieux.
