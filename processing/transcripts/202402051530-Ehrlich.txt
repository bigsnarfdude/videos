Philip, are you ready? Maybe you're ready. Okay, great. So, next we have Philip Ehrlich, who will talk about exponentiation on the surveillance. Okay, let me begin by thanking Salma and her co-organizers for inviting me. I would have liked to have been there in person, but that was simply impossible. Salma asked me to give a talk on sort of an overview of the exponentiation on the surreals. I was thinking of giving a talk on surreal integration. Giving a talk on surreal integration. So, what I decided to do in light of the fact that the theory of surreal integration depends entirely upon the theory of exponentiation, I thought I'd try to make both of us happy. At least this is my attempt. Okay. So, in his monograph On Numbers and Games, J.H. Conway introduced a real close field of surreal numbers embracing the reals and the ordinals, as well as a great many less familiar numbers. As a great many less familiar numbers, including minus omega, omega over 2, 1 over omega, the square root of omega, the log of omega, e to the omega, and sine of 1 over omega, to name only a few, where omega is the least infinite ordinal. This particular real closed field, which Conway calls no, is so remarkably inclusive that, subject to the proviso that numbers, construed here as members of ordered fields, be individually definable in terms of sets. Individually definable in terms of sets of NBG, it may be said to contain all numbers great and small. In this regard, NO bears much the same relation to audited fields that the audited field R of real numbers bears to Archimedean audited fields. In addition to its inclusive structure as an audited field, NO has a rich simplicity hierarchical or S hierarchical structure that depends upon its structure as a lexicographically ordered full binary tree. Ordered full binary tree and arises from the fact that Conway's recursive definitions of the sums and products of members of NO ensure that the sums and products of any two members of NO are the simplest possible members of NO, consistent with NO's structure as an ORD group and an ORD field, respectively, it being understood that X is simpler than Y, just in case X is a predecessor of Y in the surreal number tree. Among the most significant Among the most significant substructures A of NO, or of its redux and relational expansions, are those that are initial. Those such that for each x in A, the set of predecessors of x in A coincides with the set of predecessors of x in NO. Unlike arbitrary substructures, the initial substructures inherit many of the recursively generated canonical features of NO, including canonical copies. Including canonical copies of the subfields of the reals, value groups, integer parts, and systems of ordinals, to name only a few. One of the striking s hierarchical features of NO is that every surreal number can be assigned a canonical, proper name, or normal form, that is a reflection of its characteristic s hierarchical properties. These normal forms are formal sums of this form here, which should be familiar to many of you, where beta is. To many of you, where beta is an ordinal, the y-alphas is a strictly decreasing sequence of surreals, and the r-alphas is a sequence of non-zero real numbers. Every such sum is, in fact, the normal normal, oh, that should say the normal form of a surreal, the normal form of an ordinal being just its Cantor normal form. In the normal form of a surreal number, the R alphas are the members of Noh's canonical copy of the reals, i.e., the unique dedicated complete initial. Unique dedicated complete initial subfield of NO. And the omega to the y alphas are leaders of NO, a leader being the simplest member of the positive cone of an Archimedean subclass of NO. For some reason, I can't change my slides. Oh, there we go. Every non-zero surreal is the sum of three components. Is the sum of three components, each of which can be succinctly characterized in terms of its normal form. The purely infinite component, whose terms solely have positive exponents. The real component, whose sole term, if it is not the empty sum, has exponent zero, and the infinitesimal component, whose terms solely have negative exponents. Making use of normal forms of surreal numbers, the following figure offers a glimpse of some of the early stages. Offers a glimpse of some of the early stages of the recursive unfolding of no. This picture comes out of Conway's book. Many of you have probably seen it before. I'm putting up my slide, so if you want to look at it more carefully, feel free to do so. If L and R are subsets of NO for which every member of L precedes every member of R, there is a simplest member of NO lying between the members of L and the members of R denoted, it's lying between L and R. This line between L and R, surrounded by those brackets. In fact, every surreal number X may be written in the canonical form. You have these two sets here, LSX on the left, which is the set of all surreal numbers simpler than X and smaller than X, and RSX on the right, which is the set of all surreal numbers simpler than X and simpler than X and greater than X. The exponential ordered field of surreal numbers, okay? Of surreal numbers, okay? So, employing the canonical representation of a surreal number x, which I just showed you, and inspired by Conway's definitions of sums and products, the Chriska-Gonsure surreal exponential function may be defined by recursion as follows. It looks rather complicated, and as I'll show you in the next slide, it's more manageable when you break it down into its theoretically significant parts. So, this goes back to Ganture in 1986. That very complicated mess turns out to be, for the real case, simply e to the x. When you're dealing with infinitesimals, you get the Taylor expansion. And if you're dealing with a purely infinite surreal number, then you get a much more simple characterization than you had before, but one which is still a little bit complicated. Fortunately, however, Berarducci and Montovin. Berarducci and Montover in 2018 simplified Ganto's characterization for the purely infinite case by essentially establishing this result. This is sort of a notational variant on their result. Okay, so over here you have essentially the truncations of this sum here plus the one term left over here. And whereas in the sum itself, you would have this real number here. Here you have all the rational small. Here you have all the rationals smaller than it, and here you have all the rationals greater than it. Really nice result they have there. The significance of cases one through three accrues from the fact that for an arbitrary surreal number x, the exponential of x is the product of three exponentials, one having to do with the purely infinite part, one with the real part, and one with the infinitesimal part. It is already clear from one and two what Already clear from one and two what the exponential is for the real and infinitesimal values of x. The following additional result sheds further light on the exponential when x is purely infinite, again a result of Gonshore. So the restriction of the exponential function to the class of purely infinite surreal numbers is an isomorphism of ordered groups onto Noh's class of leaders. So for more on the relationship between the exponential and the class of purely infinite real numbers, I recommend you look at Gantre. I recommend you look at Gonsure and also this paper by Berarducci and Montober, which has a host of very nice results. By Van de Drie's McIntyre and Marker's result of 1994, the elementary theory of the expansion of the reals by restricted analytic functions, and that by the exponential function, is axiomatized with the theory of restricted analytic functions, together with the Basser axioms, which express the fact that the exponential function is an order-preserving isomer. Function is an order-preserving isomorphism from the additive group of the underlying ordered field onto its positive multiplicative group, such that the following two conditions hold. The exponential of any x greater than n square is greater than x to the n for every positive integer. And moreover, the exponential of any x lying within this interval minus 1 to 1 equals e to the x, where x is the function symbol in the language. Is the function symbol in the language of restricted analytic functions corresponding to this power series over here? Appealing to the above, Van Dries and myself showed back in 2001 that the field of surreal numbers equipped with restricted analytic functions defined via Taylor series expansion and with exponentiation is an elementary extension of the field of real numbers with restricted analytic functions and real exponentiation. And real exponentiation. As an immediate corollary, we have the audited exponential field of surreal numbers as an elementary extension of the audited exponential field of real numbers. So now I want to turn to some distinguished initial ordered exponential subfields of NO. In our 2001, Elliott Kaplan and myself provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an ordered exponential field to be isomorphic to an initial ordered exponential subfield of NO. This will be the subfield. This will be the subject of Elliott's talk, and so I'm going to leave all of that out, but I'm going to mention a few distinguished cases. So, for each ordinal alpha, let null alpha be the set of all surreal numbers whose tree rank is less than alpha. Again, back in 2001, Lau and I established that for each alpha, which happens to be an epsilon number, that includes all the uncountable cardinals, then no alpha equipped with restricted analytic functions and exponential. Strictly functions, an exponentiation induced by no is an elementary substructure of that big field, and an elementary extension of the real diet analog functions and the exponential function. Aschenbrenner, Van Dries, and Vandenhoef in 2019 established a really nice result showing that there's a canonical elementary embedding I of the ordered exponential field of trans series into no that sends x. Into no that sends x to omega. The same year, Berarduccio Montova introduced the audit exponential field here of no and proved that it's the image of this embedding. Using what is really a remarkably insightful characterization of this structure here, we found that's Elliot and I showed that the image of the trans-series under that canonical embedding, in fact, is an initial. Is an initial structure. So, trigonometric exponential, what is subfields of no? Let t trig exponential be the theory of the real field expanded by a sine restricted to that interval, the total exponential function x, and a constant symbol for each real number. Elliot and I call a model of that a trigonometric exponential ordered field. Exponential ordered field. Let k be such a field. Then k is real, real closed, so there is an integer part z of k. Using this integer part, together with the fact that cosine restricted to that same interval is zero definable in k, we may extend sine and cosine to all of k by defining sine and cosine in this very straightforward manner. Now, since k may have many integer parts, the extension of Many integer parts, the extension of sine and cosine to k is not necessarily unique. However, and this is the advantage, right, of dealing with initial structures, if k is an initial subfield of no, k has a canonical integer part, namely os intersection k, where os is no's canonical integer part of omnific integers. Oz intersection with k is the unique initial integer part of k. So, we come up with this result now, again from this paper from 2021. So, NO is a trigonometric exponential ordered field. Moreover, if K is an initial trigonometric exponential ordered subfield of NO, including NO itself, then K admits canonical sine and cosine functions arising from its unique initial integer part. So, making use of that result, the initial Result, the initial trigonometric exponential natures of the k's in question, and the corresponding map, we obtain the following result. The exponential functions on initial trigonometric exponential subfields of no extend to canonical exponential functions on their sur complex counterparts. So, for example, the algebraic closure of no, the algebraic closure of no alpha for each epsilon number. No alpha from each epsilon number alpha. And also the algebraic closure of that image in NO of the canonical embedding of the field of trans-series admit canonical exponential functions extending the exponential function or their corresponding restrictions thereof. Maximal Hardy Fields. I made mention of this nice result during the talk that Michael gave in the morning. So in their 2018 So, in their 2018, Berarducci and Montova construct a surreal derivation on NO, in which exponentiation plays a central role. Using the restriction of that derivation to NO omega 1, Aschenbrenner, Vandendries, and Vandenhover prove, assuming CH, every maximal Hardy field is isomorphic to no omega 1 plus the restriction here. Now, I doubt very, very much. I doubt very, very much that they will be able to get rid of the continuum hypothesis. I think they're going to need that to get this isomorphism. However, to have a maximal Hardy field, which is one of those omega fields that Michael was talking about, I suspect that's possible without the continuum hypothesis. We draw this part of the talk to a close by noting that in the ICM talk, That in their ICM talk of 2018, Ash and Brenner Vandendries and Vandenhoeven outline the program they, along with Berarducci, Montova, Baguioko, and Kaplan, are engaged in for developing an ambitious theory of asymptotic differential algebra for all of NO, a theory in which exponentiation, again, plays a critical role. Such a program, however, would require a derivation on NO, having compositional properties not enjoyed. Properties not enjoyed by the derivation introduced by Berarducci and Montova. If successful, such a program, at least in my opinion, would provide the most dramatic advance towards interpreting growth rates as numbers since the pioneering work of Paul de Bar-Raymond, G.H. Hardy, and Felix Hausdorff on orders of infinity in the decades bracketing the turn of the 20th century. In the second part of the talk, we turned Of the talk, we turn to a subject in which a derivation on surreal functions rather than on surreal numbers plays an important role. Okay, so this material comes from a forthcoming work of Ovid DuCoste and myself called Integration on the Surreals. That, in turn, is a substantially revised and substantially expanded version of portions of a paper we put. Of a paper we put up quite a long time ago, which was jointly written by myself, Ovidu Kosten, and Harvey Friedman. And it sort of languished for a while, but Overdue and I got back together and really worked hard on revising this and hopefully getting it in print soon. We have a very, very positive review from a journal and some very, very helpful remarks. And I would, from the ed the From the editor, and so I'm actually the referee. And so I'm hoping that probably we are 90% finished with revising it. And so it should be available pretty soon. There has been a long-standing program initiated by Conway, Kruskal, and Norton to develop analysis on NO, starting with a recursive definition of integration. The initial attempts at defining integration, in particular, the recursive definition of integration. In particular, the recursive definition proposed by Norton turned out, as Kriskel discovered, to have fundamental flaws. Despite this disappointment, the search for a theory of surreal integration has continued, but remains largely open. So here's a basic observation. Making real progress towards developing a satisfactory theory of integration on the surreals and more generally in interpreting divergent expansions by means of Diversion expansions by means of surreal analysis requires finding a property-preserving operator that extends the members of a wide body of important classical functions from the reals to the surreals. The existence of such an extension operator would then, in principle, provide a theoretically satisfying and widely applicable definition of integration. In particular, the integral of an extension from the reals to the surreals of a function on the reals. function on the reals would be defined to be the extension of the integral from the reals to the surreals. Now this is where I'm hoping this part of my talk is going to make Salma happy. Any such theory would have to keep in mind that the functions whose behavior can be described in terms of exponentials and logarithms are remarkably ubiquitous. Indeed, as G.H. Hardy noted in 1910, no function has presented itself. No function has presented itself an analysis, the laws of whose increase, insofar as they can be stated at all, cannot be stated, so to say, in logarithmic exponential terms. Accordingly, developing a satisfactory theory of integration on the surreals would require building on the exponential ordered field of surreal numbers. In the aforementioned paper of Ovidu Mind, it is shown that an extension It is shown that an extension operator as described above, and thereby extensions of integrals from the reals to the surreals, exist for a large subclass, FR, of a Kahl system of resurgent functions. Among other things, FR contains all real functions that at infinity are semi-algebraic, semi-analytic, analytic, and functions with divergent but Borel-summable series, as well as solutions. Series, as well as solutions of non-resonant linear or non-linear merimorphic systems of ordinary differential equations or of difference equations. As such, most classical functions, such as those listed above there, are covered by our analysis. The work we do is an MBG less the axiom of choice for both sets and proper classes, with the result that the extensions of functions and their integrals, at least the ones that concern us. At least the ones that concern us, are constructive in this particular sense. Okay. Building on the structural similarity that exists between the surreal numbers written in normal form and a Cal's trans-series, which is typified by the aforementioned canonical embedding of this trans series into no, which sends x to omega, there are two critical components that play roles in the theory. The first is Ecol's theory of resurgent trans-series, resurgent functions, and in particular, Ecal-Borel summation, which relates the two. So what we have is a composition of functions to obtain this extension, but this is just for the positive infinite case. We can handle the negative case as well, and I'll tell you about the finite case shortly. So the extension operator E for the positive. The extension operator E for the positive infinity case is the composition of two intermediate isomorphisms. One, transeriation, which is defined as the inverse, okay, of École-Borel summation. L over here is the Laplace transform. B here is the Borel transform. And I'll say something a bit mon when we get next slide. And then we have this map tau, which is Tau, which is in some sense a grand generalization of the kind of map that Aschenbrenner and Vandenhoever rely on in getting that canonical map of the trans series into the surreals. Okay. So in the Karl-Borel summation, as I said, El is the plastic transform, Mohn is what's called a well-behaved uniformizing. Behave uniformizing average in Ecal sense, and B is the Borel transform. Bacall introduced Ecal-Borel summation for the resummation of a large class of divergence series, which do not fall in the scope of the classical Borel summation. So, what this well-behaved average does is gives you a way of getting over these jumps. These jumps, okay, and we use it to get over the jump at infinity, okay? Now, it'd be very hard for me to spend a whole lot of time talking about this because I'd have to give you definition after definition after definition. But one thing about the paper that Ovidu and I have put together, a large part of that paper is an expository development of this stuff. So we lay it out, at least hopefully in our mind. We lay it out, at least hopefully in our minds, carefully, and it's something that you should be able to follow. The second component, okay, is the fact that the surreals are closed under absolute convergence in the sense of Conway. Actually, it's an idea that goes back to B.H. Newman in 1949. That is, for each formal power series f in n greater than or equal to one variables with coefficients in the reals, f of a1 through a m. f of a1 through a m is absolutely convergent to no for every choice of infinitesimals a1 through an. Kalman calls absolutely convergent what B.H. Newman simply said is a well-defined notion. So in other words, this thing is well-defined in the surreals. These kinds of sums are, they make perfectly good sense. So in fact, observation, a sufficient condition for developing our theory in an ordered exponential subfield of no. In an ordered exponential subfield of no, is that the exponential subfield be closed under absent convergence in the sense of Conway. So, for example, in addition to applying to NO, our theory carries over to no alpha for each epsilon number alpha, as well as to that canonical copy of trans series inside the surreals. Now, combining the two just-said components, here's the definition. Components. Here is the definition of our extension operator E. Now, I'm not really telling you what an extension operator is yet. I will come back to that later. I'm simply telling you what the definition is, the one that we actually use. So let F be a member of that class, FR, and let C be a member of the reals, such that F is real analytic on that interval. Such a C always exists. We extend S to this much larger. Extend s to this much larger interval on the surreals as follows. For positive infinite x, we define the extension using the composition of functions that I mentioned before. For the finite case, so x and element of no, where x0 is the real part, and theta is the infinitesimal part, we define the extension by these two parts here, f of x, and then here we have this basically. And then here we have this basically this expansion here, which happens to be absolutely convergent in the sense of Conway. So that is always well defined. All of this stuff here is always well defined. Now, in the next slide, I'll tell you a little bit more, and then I want to stop and tell you some things about uniqueness. So making use of this extension on operator E and an anti-differentiation operator A, likewise defined on that same class. Likewise defined on that same class. An anti-differentiation operator ANO on this extension here and a corresponding integral operator are defined as follows. The anti-differentiation operator is defined by this composition here. And then we introduce this integral making use of the anti-differentiation operator here. Now, before I get down to this next result, I want to stop and say a little bit about this. About this. This anti-differentiation operator here goes back to Obi-Dukosten at least 20 years ago, I think something like that. And what it is, is an anti-differentiation operator on the trans series. And it has a variety of properties. And you can show that if it has a variety of these nice properties, it's unique up to a real constant. So that's a nice fact about that. Okay. Now, the Now, in addition to that, we also have to make use of the Akal-Borel summation. And so that, if you remember, let me go back for a second. We have to go back and make use of this moan, this well-behaved uniformizing average. So that plays a role there as well. Now, it turns out there's a continuum. It turns out there's a continuum of these averages, and every single one of them will give you a different École-Borel sum. It turns out, however, Mohan has very, very nice properties. In fact, it's clearly the one that École likes the most. But moreover, what we are able to show is that when you're applying it to the Borel transformation, no matter which one you use, it gives you exactly. One you use, it gives you exactly the same value. So, in other words, when you're dealing with the class FR over here of functions that we're concerned with here, it turns out that it makes absolutely no difference whatsoever which one of those averages you're using. You wind up getting exactly the same value. So, between the fact that this A here is going to be unique up to a real constant, plus using the fact that the moan is all The fact that the moan is also makes no difference which one we use, we get a really nice uniqueness result for these extensions and anti-differentiation operators, as well as for this integral here, which I'll tell you more about here. So the following result demonstrates that this integral operator so defined is really worthy of the appellation integral operator. So So, this over here just tells you how to read stuff down here, and here we have a proposition. So, that thing defined as, okay, as I did above, is an integral operator, meaning a function of three variables, x, y, a member of no, and f from that family of functions, having the following seven properties. And these are all properties that I think you'll see are what you would like to have. Or what you would like to have if you were gonna be an integral. Okay? It has all of these nice properties. So it seems to us that we're being reasonable in calling this an integration. So a simple example. The most trivial example is e to the x, whose trans series without free constant is e to the x. And similarly, a gives you back the same result, and that winds up giving you. And that winds up giving you for the integral of e to the x dx from 0 to omega e to the omega minus 1, which is what you'd want. But I note that this stands in sharp contrast to Simon Norton's earlier proposed definition of integration, which was shown by Kristal to integrate e the x over that range to the wrong value. So our integral gives you at least, in this case, what you would expect to be the right answer. And in fact, we do not know of And in fact, we do not know of any case that doesn't give you what we think should be the right answer. Now, above, I made use of the notions of extension and anti-differentiation operators without stating precisely what we mean by these notions. In some of the remaining time, I want to lend precision to these concepts. So, for this purpose, we require a generalization of the idea of a derivative of a function at a point. So, if you look at this definition here, it's for an arbitrary function. Definition here, it's for an arbitrary ordered field, but it's a straightforward generalization of the idea of a derivative. And so, as usual, f prime a is said to be the derivative of f at a, and f is said to be differentiable if the derivative of f exists at each point of its domain. Now, this is precisely what I mean by an extension operator. So, let I be an interval, i a convex subclass of r. convex subclass of R, J be an interval of no that contains I. Also let F be a set of real-valued functions defined on intervals of R. By an extension operator E on F, we mean a map that associates to each function f from i to r in f a function e of f taking j into no in such a manner that, okay, they're going to give you extensions. You're going to have linearity. If beta and lambda are reals and n is a non-negative integer, then g of x of x to the beta, e lambda x, and h of x of x to the n, log of x, for all x and i, then you wind up getting back precisely the values you'd want. And finally, we have e to the f prime is the prime of e to the f. The F. Now, for the anti-differentiation operators, this gives you it for both the real and the surreal cases. So let f be a set of real-valued, surreal-valued functions whose domains are intervals on r and no. An anti-differentiation operator on f1 contained in f is a function. Contained in F is a function A mapping F1 to F such that for all Fg and F1, A acting on F is differentiable. And again, the derivative of that gives you back the function. For any lambda and all, lambda and no, you wind up getting, okay, this linearity over here. Again, another nice property you'd want for the anti-differentiation operator. And this And this tells you that the anti-differentiation operators behave the way you would want it to behave when dealing with monomials. Here it tells you that the exponentiation gives you right back the real and the surreal exponentiation, which we would want. And here we have this other nice and expected property. Now, let A be an anti-differentiation operation. Let A be an anti-differentiation operator on F1 contained in F, and let F, little F, be an F1, and define the integral this way. Integral operators thus defined have all the aforementioned properties enjoyed by the surreal integrator operator, integral operator. In other words, the theorem that I told you for the case of the surreals is actually a general result for integral operators. I just wanted to lay it out for you for the surreal case. For you for the surreal case. Okay, so how much further can the theory be developed? Trans series, a formal series built up from R and a variable x greater than r using powers, exponentiation, logarithms, and infinite sums. Bacall's classical construction of the ordered differential field of trans-series is inductive, beginning with log-free trans-series, and trans-series have exponential height. And trans series have exponential heights and logarithmic depths for each n less than omega that emerge from their inductive construction. But in our theory of surreal integration thus far developed, we are only concerned with log free, height one, and height one depth one trans series. The theory of resurgent functions for the class of trans series we are concerned with has long been worked out in detail. This is worked out in papers of a college. Worked out in papers of Akal. However, in a far-ranging recent work of a college called The Natural Growth Scale, he has provided what he describes as an exploratory rather than a systematic presentation of an extension of his theory, including École Borel's mobility, to trans theories having arbitrary heights and depths. This naturally suggests the first question. Based on a rigorous theory of arbitrary height and depth, Rigorous theory of arbitrary height and depth trans series, is it possible to generalize our constructive treatment of extension and anti-differentiation operators to the entire class of resurgent functions? We sort of suspect the answer is yes. However, the proof is in the detail, of course. A related and perhaps deeper question is this: Do well-behaved extensions Do well-behaved extensions and anti-differentiation operators exist for broad classes of functions that cannot be obtained by the inductive construction yielding trans series. While these questions are wide open, what we have shown is this. There is a foundational obstruction to constructively extending many important logic families of functions, including, for example, the full class of smooth functions to know and to define. Smooth functions to know and to define the integration thereon. The definition of extension and anti-differentiation and integral operators that I mentioned above are not recursive. As such, question three, can the just set operators be given simplicity hierarchical formulations in the recursive sense that Comwey's field operations and the Kruskal-Gantio definition of exponentiation. Your definition of exponentiation are. Obidu and I know, in fact, how to provide a simplicity hierarchical account for much of that in terms of Conway's left-right notation. However, the definitions in terms of Conway's left-right notation employed in the account are not recursive. There's no doubt that the theory would be much nicer if, in fact, if we can do that. We honestly don't know if it can be done. We honestly don't know if it can be done. So, concluding thoughts. So, in virtue of our combined positive and negative results, one can say that whereas the Conway, Kruskal, and Wharton surreal integration program succeeds in most practical cases and may very well be extended a good deal further. Its success is limited in the full abstract generality that some, such as Kruskal, had originally hoped for. On the other hand, On the other hand, I suspect that what has been and very well may be accomplished in this direction is far beyond the expectations of some, including Conway himself. Thanks for listening. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I can hear you. If there are any questions, I'm not sure how this works. Yeah, you should be able to hear us. Can you hear me? Okay, I do. I do. Okay, thank you for the talk. Any questions? I have a question. Thanks for the talk. I'm not sure I understood completely, but there's part of the construction of this extension of it. Could you just wait one second? I want to see if I can make this louder so I can hear you better. Let me see how do I do that. See how do I do that? Let's see. Maybe if I do that, let me do this. And now let me go back to sharing the screen. Okay, I just made it a bit louder. And oh boy, Lord. Oh, goodness. Not sure what's why this is not going on. Why this is not going on? It says I'm sharing the screen, but I don't see anything. Okay, okay, fine. Go ahead. Can you go back to the slide where you were using Taylor's functions, not resurgent functions? The ones where I evaluating at infinity decimals because. Evaluating at infinity is more than using the tailor. Oh, the ones where I said that we were concerned with this one? No, it's a formula. You know, f of x0 plus something is the Taylor expansion of f of x0. Oh, oh, I see, I see. Okay. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This is this it so uh. So, in the case of positive infinite story numbers, there is a part of the story that takes a resurgent function, one of those, and constructs the transeries, sort of transerial expansion of this function. And then you apply the map tau, is it the Berardo Chin Manta map takes the trans series to a function on the Transfer is to function on the series. I'm not sure I'm following what you're asking. You want me to go back to this over here, the tau compound with the transeriation? Yeah, I guess the transferiation is something that's purely like analyzing. Yes, the trans seriation is the inverse function. Is the inverse function of the Akal Borel summation. It's the inverse function. And then the tau acts as on transient. The tau, as I said, is, I mean, I didn't define the tau for you. What I said to you is that the tau is very much in the spirit of the kind of mapping. Of mapping that you find when you are mapping the trans-series into the surreals because you're trading on the really beautiful relationship between the trans-series and normal forms. And that's what we're doing here. Okay? We're trading on that nice relationship between trans-series and normal forms. I didn't actually define this for you. To define this for you. My question was: this tau function, La Much and Mantoba defined a way to take a trans series and vector act as a function on three numbers. I was wondering if the tau is exactly this function for yes. I'm not sure I'm getting what you're asking. You're asking if it's possible. You're asking if it's possible to do what with it? So I know a function like tau. It was defined by Vlado Cheymanto. I mean, essentially what you're doing is replacing x with infinite surreal values. And you're doing that for all the infinite surreal values. That's essentially how you're coming up with these functions. Yeah, so as I say, it's a math. Yeah, so as I say, it's a map from trans series to functions, and you're creating the functions by replacing the variables. In other words, what we have is a very large trans series, which has three different parts, and we're replacing the variable x by positive infinite surreal values. And for the cases that we're dealing with, okay, we With, okay, we then wind up getting, as I say, the infinite parts of the surreal functions. Does that help, or I'm not sure? I think I understand. Thanks. Yeah, okay. Well, let me say one other thing since you raised the question. Even in the case of the finite, you can actually handle in a similar kind of thing. You can actually handle in a similar kind of way, but you have to use a transformation to do this. We prefer doing it this way because it really brings to the fore, okay, the importance of this convergence in the sense of Conway, this absolute convergence. But maybe what I should do is really send you a copy of the paper, and then maybe the question that you're asking me, or maybe if you Asking me, or maybe if you could even write it, okay, it'd be clear to me how to. Because I'm not sure I gave you the answer you were looking for, because I wasn't exactly sure what question you were asking. I'll write to you. Oh, please do. Please do. So I have a general question, not related directly and strictly related to what you have been talking about. But originally, the book of Conway was called On Numbers and Games. Right. And the first part was on numbers, where he introduces certain numbers. His ultimate goal was to apply this to games. Now, I don't know very much the second part of the book, but maybe you know. So, there was quite a bit of development subsequent to this book, to the first part. There was systematic work on other structures of the surreals. Was there any early development on the games part? There's been vastly more development on the games than on the More development on the games than on the uh on the numbers, yeah. I mean, there's a there's a huge community of people who work who work on these combinatorial games, yes. I mean, is it parallel to the kind of development that you have been doing, for example, with uh van den Dries and with Ovid or with no? I think they have their own set of problems, and they're really quite. Set of problems, and they're really quite different. I mean, well, maybe one place I can think of as overlap, and that is there have been results which show you that when you just develop the theory of games that you, you know, which eventually you'll take the surreal numbers out of, that you also get a monster model for surreal. Monster model for certain kinds of structures, just like you get this monster real closed field from the surreals. And so there's parallel development in that sense, that you have these structural theorems that mirror one another. But outside of that, I really think the people who are interested in games really are interested in completely different kinds of questions than the people who are interested in surreal numbers. So if you look, for example, So if you look, for example, at books on games, the surreals will take up one chapter in maybe 15 or 16 chapters. They just deal with different kinds of things. Thank you. I had one last question. At the end, you, and one of the questions that you presented, you said that it would be designed. You said that it would be desirable to have a recursive definition. Yes. By the design. Well, okay, let me go back to the question. Yes, absolutely. It would be desired. Well, in my opinion, the most interesting aspects of the surreals are what emerges from these recursions because. Recursions, because the recursions enable you to build things basically out of nothing growing out of the bottom of the tree. And that's why I said these initial substructures are so important, because what distinguishes initial substructures from all the other substructures is that there are initial subtrees of the surreals for which you can now recursively define all those operations on them. And as I also said, Also, said the process of recursively generating these things give you canonical copies of all sorts of things, whether it be a canonical copy of the reals, of the value group, the integer parts. And the hope is that if we could actually come up with a recursive definition of the integral, then we might actually be forced, for example. Be forced, for example, to adopt a particular uniformizing average, like one of those well-behaved averages. It could also help us to get a better grip on how much further up in the system of trans-series we may be able to go. And plus, I just think that it's so much of an more elegant way of looking at it. I mean, I'm happy with what we did. Happy with what we did. It's just that if I had my drugs, I'd prefer to do it the other way. I do not know if it's possible. I mean, one of the problems is that thus far, it's not very, very well understood precisely what kinds of functions can be given this nice recursive definition using the simplicity of hierarchy. I mean, a number of people have written. I mean, a number of people have written on this, and there have been some developments, but there is no accepted definition that everybody sort of is willing to jump into. And so since you have these differences and you don't have people developing a great deal, what kinds of things can come out of it, we don't know the answers to those questions yet. And so we don't even know if it's possible to give such a definition. Definition. But if I could, I think it would be very, very nice to do it. Again, maybe this is a bias on my part, but I don't think so. As I say, I think that you look at the initial substructures that come out of no, and they just seem to have very, very nice properties. Yes, that's helpful. That's really cool. What's it? That's helpful. Thank you. I wonder if you guys can hear me. Better than I can hear you. If you guys can hear me better than I can hear you, I'm having a very, very hard time understanding your questions. Yeah, we can hear you just fine. I'm sorry that you can't understand us very well. But let's thank Philip again. Okay, thank you. And we'll resume in about 10 minutes.
