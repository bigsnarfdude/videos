Okay everybody, so welcome to the last morning session of the last session and our first speaker is Steve Shepherd. He will talk about one in the substance in which we organizers for inviting me. It's been a great conference. Okay, so what I'm talking about today is joint work with Mike and Alec about one-ended path spaces and group splittings. So let's start with group splittings. Splitting is where a finitely generated group G is acting on a tree T. And then I will make three standing assumptions about splittings for the Standing assumptions about splittings for this talk. I will assume that the edge groups, or stabilizers, currently prefer to call them, are finitely generated. I will assume there are no engine versions. I will assume there are no edge inversions, and I will assume that the action on the tree is minimal. So there's no proper invariant subtree. Okay, so this is fairly standard. What's less standard is this notion of half space in group splittings. So let's discuss this. We start by considering an orbit map from G to the tree. And let's now draw a picture. So this is some finite portion of the tree. And if we consider an oriented edge E, like this. Edge E like this, then this defines a half space within the tree, which looks exactly like this. It's just the union of all oriented paths that start with the oriented edge E. And then to the left of the picture Here's the group, and I'm thinking of this as a geometric object. So I guess I'm really thinking about the Kaleograph of the group with respect to some finite generating set S. And the cartoon picture here looks something like the following. So these problems. So these blobs correspond to the vertex groups, or cosets of the vertex groups, and each one is corresponding to a vertex in the tree as shown on the right-hand side. And then to define a half space in the group splitting, we simply take the pre-image of a half space in the tree. So half space in the group splitting will look something like I've indicated here. And furthermore, this half space will be a connected subgraph of the theory graph. For an appropriate choice of S so the half space itself is a geometric thing and we can consider it with the induced path metric. Now, one of the first things you might want to know. You might want to know about fast spaces is how much it depends on the choice of this generating set S. So we come to its lemma. And it's really a similar story to the fact that the Kelly graph does not depend on the choice of generating set-up to quasi-osometry. Set up to quasiosometry. Similarly, up to quasiosometry, the half space does not depend on S. It only depends on this choice of oriented edge E. So, this is good. This means that we can study the coarse geometry of these half spaces. And this is something well defined. It's independent of the choice of generating set. And I'll give some examples of path spaces and group splittings in a minute. Yes, I'd like to also remark that this notion of half space is something. This notion of half space is something new that we introduce in our paper, although in some sense it's not an entirely new idea, I would argue. But certainly there are many papers in the literature that study the coarse geometry of group splittings. In many of these, the idea of half space is maybe to some extent implicit, but as far as I know, we're the only ones to write down a general definition for this. Okay, so we have to. Okay, so we have these half spaces. The other part of the title is being one-ended. So, we can ask the following question when these path spaces to group spitzings, one-ended, and of course. And of course, being one-ended is a quasi-osymmetry invariant, so this question is independent of the choice of generating sets. Well, one of the first things you'll discover when you start to think about this is that if the group G itself is not one-ended, then actually none of the half spaces will be one ended. Um so for this question we should really be restricting to the case where G itself is one ended. Where g itself is one endpoint, which will do for the rest of the talk. Okay, so some examples Consider a surface of genus two with a simple closed curve which separates like this. This then induces a splitting of G, the fundamental group of the surface. Of the surface, and it's a splitting as an amalgam over Z, where Z here is the fundamental group of this curve, and then the two F2 factors, these are three groups of rank two, are the fundamental groups of the left-hand and right-hand subsurfaces. How can we get a handle on what the half spaces look like here? Well, we can consider this as a hyperbolic surface and look at the universal cover. And look at the universal cover of the hyperbolic plane. And then consider all of the lifts of this yellow curve. Of course, infinitely many of them. There are a few of them. And then we can draw a tree which is dual to this collection of curves. To this collection of curves in the hypolytic plane. And we get an action of g on this tree. And in fact, this tree is nothing more than the bass set tree for this splitting that we have written down. But more than this, we can use this picture to get a handle on what the half spaces look like. So for instance, if we consider the following oriented edge E, one can show red that the half space corresponding to E is quite Corresponding to E is quasi-asymmetric to the following subset of page two. It's this half plane to the left of this yellow curve dual to the edge E. Okay, so these half spaces, they're subgraphs of the Kayleigh graph. Subgraphs of the KD graph, but they're all quasi-asymmetric to path planes in H2. And it's not hard to see that these half-planes are one-ended. Okay, so this is an example of a one-ended group. So, this is an example of a one-ended group with a splitting in which all the half spaces are one-ended. Well, can we have the opposite behaviour? Can we have a splitting of a one-ended group where half spaces are not one-ended? And in fact, I can do a similar example where I modify the Where I modified this first example. So I'll start with exactly the same picture, but now I will add a yellow arc as follows, which is looping round this genus on the left. And this now induces a different splitting of the same group. Again, an amalgam, but now it's over F2, which is the fundamental group of this yellow graph. It's no longer just a curve, it's now a graph of rank 2. And then the fact is here that the F2 is still the subsurface on the left, and the F3. On the left, and the F3 is now corresponding to the subsurface on the right union with the yellow graph. So, because of this arc, it's gone from an F2 to an F3 on the right. I mean the F3 is the subsurface on the left, is it? The F3 is the subsurface on the right union the yellow graph. So the arc is telling the shot as well. Okay, and again we can draw the picture of the universal cover. So you start with the same picture with the lifts of the original arc, or the original curve. Um, or the original curve, sorry. But now we need to also uh draw all of the lifts of this yellow arc that we've added. So maybe we'll have a few things here joining together some of these lifts of the yellow curve. And yeah, I mean, certainly the picture is a little more complicated here, but if you spend a bit of time thinking about it, you can convince yourself that one of the half spaces That one of the half spaces is quasi-asymmetric to the following. We, as before, have a half plane, but now we also need to include any half-plane that you can get to by crossing over these yellow arcs. So it will also include these half-planes. These half planes. So there is a half space which is quasi-symmetric to an infinite union of half-planes in H2. And this is now something which is infinite ended. And in fact, in this example, it turns out that all of the half spaces will be infinite ended. So, certainly, both behaviors can happen. You can have one-ended half spaces, you can have infinite-ended half-spaces. But maybe this second example seems a little bit artificial in that we started with this nice example with one-ended half spaces and then we just modified it by adding this arc and it kind of had the effect of joining together a bunch of the previous half spaces, which now produces an infinite-ended half space. And indeed, one could go in the other direction. One could go in the other direction. If you started with this second example, you could think about modifying or upgrading the splitting to go back to the first example by removing the OR and by and as a result it sort of chops up the half space so that you end up with one-ended half spaces again. Someone could ask whether this is always the case. Kind of splitting of a one-ended group always be modified or upgraded to one where all the half spaces are one-ended. Where all the half spaces are one-handed. And I'll make it a bit more precise in a minute what I mean by have modified or upgraded here. But this is a rough question that you can ask. That you can ask. So, is there anything in the literature that could help us here? Anything which is relevant? Well, there's a Well, there's a theorem of Dunwoody, which is somewhat relevant to this setting, which says that every finitely presented group is what's called accessible. What does this mean? Every finitely presented group G is accessible, meaning. Meaning G admits a splitting with finite edge groups and finite or one-ended vertex groups. Vertex groups. So this is not about half spaces, but it is about one-ended vertex groups. And moreover, there's a related result about modifying or upgrading splittings. If you have an accessible group and start with some splitting over finite edge groups, then you can modify it to become a splitting like this, where all of the vertex groups are either finite or one-ended. Or one end. So maybe this gives us some hope that we might be able to have some kind of a positive answer to this question. And fortunately, we were successful. So, this is the main theorem of the talk. So, if we have a So, if we have a splitting of a one-ended group, and we assume that the edge groups are accessible. Then there exists the splitting g acting on T prime, so it's splitting. G acting on T prime, so it's splitting into same group, such that firstly all half spaces of the new splitting are one-ended, and secondly, something to relate these two splittings. Each vertex, respectively edge group of the new splitting, is contained in a vertex respectively edge group of the old splitting. So in this sense, we can think of this as modifying or upgrading the old splitting to one with one-ended path spaces. So it gives a pretty good answer to the question just with this assumption that the edge groups are accessible, which is a Which is a fairly mild assumption. Indeed, we know that every finally presented group is accessible, and many other groups besides that. Also, note that G is one-ended, but we don't assume that G itself is finitely presented. And go back to the examples, one could certainly apply this theorem to the second. Apply this theorem to the second example, which is a splitting of a one-ended group with ended half spaces, and the theorem would split out some upgraded splitting with one-ended half spaces. And I think there's a good chance that it would actually split out exactly the first example. Somehow, this is what exactly what this theorem is doing. It's it's chopping up the infinite end of the half spaces to make them one ended. So where would the f be lab? Aware with the S3 lab. So the vertex groups also change when you're upgrading the splitting. All you know is that the new vertex groups are contained in the old vertex groups. It's the other way around, and that's the other way around. Can I posit that the splitting you get is not quite that long, but you. That one, but you pick in your graph, you get a subsurface with almost three times. I mean, it's hard to know for sure what you get, given that there are some choices in the construction. Morally, I feel like it would make sense that you could possibly get the first example. Okay, for the rest of the talk, I want to talk about the property of being simply connected at infinity, which is something my co-author Mike Mahamack has studied for many years. And I think it makes for a nice application of this. Of this theorem from this idea of one-ended path spaces in group splittings. So let's start with the definition. A locally finite cell complex X is simply connected at infinity if any compact C in X coexists compact D in X for any loop alpha. For any loop alpha in X minus D alpha is homotopically trivial in X minus C. Let's draw a little picture to try and unpack what this is saying. To try and unpack what this is saying, we start with this compact C and then we produce a compact D. And we may assume actually that D contains C and then for any loop alpha outside of D, we're saying that we can fill alpha in with a disc with. With a disk, which avoids C. That's filling in with a disk. It might be that the disk intersects D, but we can definitely make it avoid C. So this is certainly similar to being simply connected, which is just about filling in loops with disks, but somehow we're doing it modular compact subsets, which is why it's simply connected at infinity. At synchrony. So the origin of this notion came from the study of manifolds. In particular, if one looks at contractible n manifolds, n at least four. Well, Rn is certainly an example, but then there are some other exotic examples which are not homeomorphic. So Are not homeomorphic to Rn. However, Rn is actually the only one which is simply connected at infinity. So this is a notion which distinguishes Rn from these other weird examples of contractible manifolds. But for us, we're more interested in applying this notion to groups. And indeed, this also gives us a property. This also gives us a property of finitely presented groups. So if we have a group of a finite presentation, one can then look at the Cayley complex, so starting with the Cayley graph and then gluing in cells for the relators, and ask whether this complex is simply connected at infinity. And one can show that the answer you get is independent. Can show that the answer you get is independent of the choice of finite presentation for the group. So, this gives us a well-defined group property for finitely presented groups. Okay, and as I mentioned, this is something which my co-author Mike Mahalek has been interested in for a long time. And one can also study this from the perspective of group splittings. Group splittings. So, in particular, there is a theorem of Jackson as follows. We have a group splitting of a finitely presented one-ended group with infinite-ended edge groups. And finally, presented one-ended vertex groups. Then G is not simply connected at infinity. Okay, so this is a good way to produce many examples of groups which are not simply connected at infinity. And as you can see, it certainly makes in well with the things we've been discussing in this talk. There's a group splitting, and one-endedness is showing up here, except again, it's one-endedness of vertex groups showing up here. So it begs the question whether we can produce another complementary result by thinking about one endedness of path spaces. The best of all slices. And indeed, we can. Here's one of the results we can get in this direction. Suppose again we have a splitting of a finitely presented one-ended group, but now we will strengthen we will first strengthen the assumption on the edge groups. So let's assume that we have virtually three edge groups. Edge groups, but we're able to completely remove the assumption on the vertex groups, and then we have the same conclusion that G is not simply connected at infinity. Sorry, you said you're strengthening the assumption, so you mean virtually non-ameelium-free? I think this does also work with Z actually. So, yeah, it's not quite strengthening plus that one of the codes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you might notice that the film we've got here doesn't actually mention half spaces anywhere, but they do show up in the proof. And for the remaining time, I would like to sketch the proof of this. I think it's a nice illustration of where one-ended half spaces can be used for. Which would be a silly round of the half-group. I think it works with Z edge groups as well. Z edge groups as well. So, the first step in the proof is to apply the theorem from earlier we have. Upgrade to a splitting G acting on T prime. with one-ended half spaces and using the second part of the theorem we know that the edge groups in this new splitting will still be virtually free. Since the Since the edge groups in the new splitting will be contained in the edge groups of the old splitting. And now we draw a picture. This picture will be taking place inside the Pele complex for the group. Complex for the group. So let's, well, we can choose the generating set so that there's an edge group GE, which gives us a connected subcomplex in the Kaylee complex. And let's suppose we've drawn this so that the two half spaces corresponding to GE, we have. Corresponding to GE, we have one above and one below. Okay, so we now want to negate the definition of simply connected. We start by exhibiting some compact C and we choose this so that it cuts GE into multiple unbounded components, which we Components, which we can do since GE is virtual 3. And then we're given some compact D, which might be much bigger. And now we have to exhibit some loop alpha. Well, we first choose two points in GE, right? Right, we choose them so that they're really far away from D and so that they're separated in GE by the first compact set C, as suggested by drawing one on the left and one on the right here. And then the crucial part, we now connect these two points together by a path in the upper half space. In the upper half space, which avoids the set D. And this is crucially where we use the fact that the half spaces are one-ended. And then, similarly, we can connect them by a path in the lower half space. And together, these paths give us a loop alpha outside of D. So what remains? We now have to show that alpha is not homotopically trivial in X minus C. So let's So let's suppose that we fill alpha with a disk and then we consider where this disk intersects GE. Okay, maybe it looks something like that. But the crucial thing to observe now is. Is that there will be a component where GE intersects the disk, which joins together this left-hand point and right-hand point on the boundary of alpha. So yeah, I won't go into the details of this part of the argument, but I think it is kind of intuitive. Since GE is separating the space into an upper and lower half space, it ought to also separate this disk into an upper and space. Disk into an upper and lower part. But once we have this, we now use the construction of these red points from earlier. We said that they are separated in GE by C, so that means that C must also intersect the disk somewhere. There's a bit of C showing it. And that's exactly what we wanted. And that's exactly what we wanted. Any disk must intersect C, so alpha is not on the topically trivial in X minus C. So that's a sketch. So that's a sketch proof, but actually it's not that far away from being a rigorous proof. Certainly all the main ideas are there. And I think that's a good illustration of how one-ended half spaces can be useful. And one could also get a similar theorem here. If you actually have, as one of the assumptions of the theorem, that half spaces are one-ended, then you could weaken this assumption of virtually three edge groups and just Of virtually three edge groups, and just assumed that you have an inpth-the-ended edge group. If you'll notice, that was all that we actually used in the previous game. So, thanks for listening. Are there any questions? What goes into the program here? Uh yeah, I can say uh a few sentences. Yeah, I can say a few sentences. So, if you suppose you have an infinite ended half space, you can take a compact subset that separates it, and then take the translates by the edge group. So, you're now dropping the half space into lots of pieces. And from this, you define new half spaces. So, you replace your infinite-ended half-space with these new half-spaces you get from. These new half spaces you get from chopping up. And then take the dual cube complex to this collection of new half spaces. And the tricky bit of the proof is doing everything very carefully to ensure that the dual cube complex you get is actually just another tree, so that you get a new splitting out of this. And then the final part of the strategy. Part of the strategy is to iterate that construction, get a sequence of splittings, and then you argue using the accessibility of edge groups that this sequence of splittings terminates. And so you must eventually end up with something where all the half spaces are one-ended. That's a very brief strategy of proof. Another question? What what would be an example of What would be an example of a group that is simple that simplicity? Yeah, so I mean I said that like Rn for R at least four or like yes R at least three I suppose and groups associated to this yeah I mean certainly there are many Yeah, I mean certainly there are many examples. I'm not super familiar with the literature on simply connected infinity. Is it really just saying the chromosome battery is simply connected? Yeah, yeah, hyperbolic groups of dimension three. Yeah, yeah, hyperbolic groups of dimension three and a bottle thing also the connected internet is yeah So we'll have the next talk ten to ten and now thank uh Sandy.
