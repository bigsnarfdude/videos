Today I'm going to talk about this project that I've been working in the last three years and it's about isoparimetric properties of spaces with non-negative rich or non-negative scalar, which just mentioned at the end, curvature. Okay, so this is a based on several joint works with Elia Brou√®re, Matthias Bernoulli, Federic Cloud, and Ripple Pox Collective. And um yeah, so let's let's start with the classical uh okay let's start with the classical isoperimetric problem and the isoperimetric file. This is very general, so let's fix a Riemannian manifold with volume measure ball and a perimeter measure. A perimeter measure there. Okay, for every volume from zero to the volume of the manifold, we can define the function that captures the isoperimetric behavior of the manifold, which is the isoperimetric profile. So this is the infinity of the perimeter of all the sets with volume. This is a function. And when this infinity is realized in the specific set, we call this set a magnetic perimetric set. Okay? So Okay, so the first good news is that we are able to characterize all the isovary metric sets in Euclidean spaces. They are both and they are unique. So we can write explicitly the value of the isovometric profile function, which is just a constant depending on the dimension. Omega n is the volume of the ball, times scaling, the correct scaling, the power of the Earth. Okay? But you also Uh, bad news, the isoprimetic profile function is not explicit given a lot of other examples. So, there are a few cases in which we isogrimatic space. Anyway, this definition, the definition of a perimeter and isogrammatic wave function makes sense in magnetic magic spaces. So the volume will be the measure, the perimeter is going to be some relaxation of an energy time that's being developed which is. But yeah, this is this has been uh started by Andros Piran and Second. So first thing, let's see why, statistically, a bound from below the reaching curvature should affect IG theory. And this is basically included in the second variation for plug. So I drew a picture here, and E is a smooth set manifold. Oops set manifold, and you take the flow of the enlargement. So you basically take the set of points whose distance is less than t, dt, and you can compute, I mean, if everything is you can compute the second derivative of the perimeter of these enlargements, and this is actually equal to the integral of the boundary of this function, which is h squared squared, minus the second phenomenon squared, min minus rich. So now you see why, statistically, if you have a bound from below with the cheap curvature, you can get some information there in the magnetic structure of the manifold, because a bound from below on the chi curvature will become a bound from above on the right-hand side. And if you take the solution of the minimization problems, then you have a bump from below on the left-hand side. So, well, in all, you get some bigger. Get some prevailed action. This is an idea that has been used in a more refined way, probably one, which is first examples of the comparison theorem for a ferig function that has been put in the 80s by Adron, and which basically asserts it's a theorem in the flavor of competence of geometry. If you have a smooth and dimensional complexity, man, it would be Then you can bound from below the scale version of the experiment with the one on the sphere. Okay, so this is the something that you can obtain by using this by DNS. And so let's start with this journey and let's try to understand we can we say if we can say something meaningful. If we can say something meaningful to start with about the existence of superimetric sets in a non-compact space, and I'm saying also a bit more negative approach, why? Because somehow, okay, if the space is compact, then standard minimization procedure logos and continuity of the perimeter, then the compactness will tell you that you also have so it's not really a problem in compact spaces, and also like if you don't ask. And also, like, if you don't ask some boundary curvature, you can easily construct examples in which you can't really expect that you can make sense. You just take play and you add more and more puppets. So, in the end, so there is no bubble curvature here below, but then the sequence of so if so, if this is going besides the volume, so there's an objector of the space. So there's an object or the space you get to screen that we said 30 volume. And so basically the first meaningful question in the non-compact case is what happens when you have more compact and you have, for example, more negative courage. Is it true that you can always have existence of spiritual sets? Or what can you say? And I want to start with this example that is actually the. Example that actually the answer is you can't really say that transistors for a spring that excess for everybody. And this is an example that I constructed. And basically, in a rather, in a somehow strong sense, for every dimension, you can construct this with non-compact manifold with positive sectional curve. That is these striggers behavior. String isofi behavior up to volume one, you don't have isofiometric sets from volume one on, you get isometric sets. And actually, the idea of this problem, of this result, is that we first do it with the analogy of the bounded values. And then we the construction management I will recommend is the boundary dimension is sharper. the dimension is sharper because for complex surfaces that you have 20 years ago that you only sell systems for every volume and also this behavior that for large volumes where by spreading that you said components you don't have is also sharp if you restrict your attention to the class of many points that have non-degenerate asymptotic points which means that if you go down you get something that is the same dimension this is because you when you are at the non-degenerate asymptotic concept you So I want to present a sketch of the tooth, which starts with a picture. So the idea of the tooth is you first construct a complex body in our end that has the same strange kinetic behavior for the rest. Behavior for the relative isochromatic. And this picture here is the example that you should have in mind in R3. The epigraph of this convex surface will be the modeling sample that we construct such that it doesn't have relatively significant percent with value less than one. So, what is the idea here? The idea is that you take A cone sigma and you cross it with R. So this, let me call this sigma cross R. Okay, so this is enough strength, for example. And then you smooth it in a very careful way. What is the idea? The idea is that now there will be two different competitions. If you have an actual If you have an isoperimetric set, it's all volume, you want to prove that it will be kind of staying here, okay? And but if you cut it slow enough, it's complex value, then this will look like perimetric set in these uh this uh let's call it sigma prime, which is just this sigma cross r calculus. R catalytes. Okay. And now we should put together this information. This is a contradiction. Why? Because you have, so as you have an experimental set of volume, then you get that experimenting experiment profiles is important to see. Now, by this picture, if you do the the catalyte jet, If you do the catalyst, this is most yes, but it would be sigma 5. Okay, so here all the work is here. But this is greater than the isogrammatic profile of the asymptotic one of this space. But the asymptotic con of this space is this. But this is the limit that you feel. But this is the limit at infinity of space, and you can always do that if you get. So, this is the idea to get something that goes with slide at infinity space. And so here, this so all the work is in this here, because you have two things. The diameter of the so you you are involved in a rebound of the diameter of the speed, like you said. Bound to the diameter set, which is completely derivative of the function that is yeah I mean I will explain it later and um and yeah, how do you do the example for this by surface is you got one dimension above you take the boundary of this complex part It's a complex body approximately carefully, then this is going to be an example as we make certain things. And so we want to kind of understand in general what happens to the existence of isopymetric sets. And the rough idea that this example is telling us is that we have to find our isopric sets at infinity. Sense at infinity if they don't exist in many forms. And there is a notion of convergence that has been introduced by Romo in 85 study and you can define this notion. I mean, what does it mean that point in metric space is converged in a in a chromobotic sense of a limit? It means that you can embed everything in a metric space and you can detect this convergence. You can detect this convergence as the house of the convergence of the system. Okay, so this is a well-behaved notion convergence might for a pointed matrix spaces. And the theorem that we dream of now is that if we don't have isopheriometric sets on our space, which is about then we get isopherometric sets in the limit at infinity, the sense. I didn't think it did essentially. But first thing we have to understand then, actually, what is the class of manifolds that we choose to path and this topology? The class of smooth mentioned are completely biomedical to the boundaries of the technology. It's probably here to all of us. All of us, which we think this class is expanding compact. The limits of what we shape spaces that has been a sort of study of dramatic properties of these spaces, starting by the semiconductor. And then this has also given a lot of interest to the development of the dramatic and the magnetic properties of C D in our C spaces, starting from C D which is like and then R C D terms are n. So we have a class that is a compact from the point of view of topology. So the theorem that we can try to prove now, actually that we prove, is this one. So the moral of this theorem is that, okay, take now any non-compact manifold of negative H curvature. The moral of this theorem is either you have a major Either you have an isometric, so if you fix a volume B, either you have an isometrimetric set volume B on your space, or you get an exoplanet set on A limit at infinity that is included in the volume of the exoplanet function xp. So there is an hypothesis here, this non-collapsiveness of the extreme of the volume to v1p is positive. This is not strictly productionist in drop-in this hypothesis, right? There are many for these. Hypothesis when your manifold is collapsing at infinity, you can prove that, yeah, so the metric file is always zero when you have non-negative machine. So it's okay. So again, here we can take a non-compact manifold, non-negative peak sheet, and the generative ends, basically, then either you have a speedometric set up on a manifold, or you go infinitely along the sequence. We should see some sequences for possible variants. This is the very informative picture. It's just a simple picture that tells you like what happens in the bad case. If you, the bad case, at volume B, there is a sequence sliding at infinity, and then you get an experimental set limit at infinity, and this is proved by concentration partners, very general procedure. Uh well basically you have a so if you take a minimized sequence of sub cells with a mass equal to v, and you basically put that either you are going to infinity or you split into this pieces, but the gravity of the children equal to zero doesn't allow this. And actually this sort of I mean you can receive the results for a bit of whichever bounds we said the given chip function. It's like very general. It's like very general. So now we know how to deal with the non-existence of isoperometric cells. We have this ISV star that tells us either an isopermatic cell or slide of identity. And now these apparently simple but the end powerful idea will give us a series of concepts that we think and I think the first consequence is that you can put a shot in the carbon case, you can let fire spaces with it. I'm stating the result in the most simple case, which is the most simple case that was moved to this is something I've obtained with the cospoletic symbol and this is a theorem you experience from geometry I need. But if you have a completely manifold negative. Manifold or negative curvature, then the correct scaling power against magnetic profile is okay. And now notice that the exponent here is sharp. If you take Rn, that is exactly the exponent that makes the isomatic fine function a linear function. So you can't get any kind of difference. And so let me speak a couple of words. So let me spend a couple of words. Actually, in the compact case, this is the first reference to this property is in work Bavaria in the 86. And let me also mention that I recently found that if you read the PhD thesis of PRAI 97, when you use the theorem, this theorem is basically a computation that tells you. Basically, any computation that tells you the condition is currently. But it's also in the compact case. And then this was created by Day in 2004. But this is in the compact case because it's important to exist in parametric sets because all the proofs that I've read on this file start with an experiment, take the second variation of the boundary. And uh mutation and here existence in the non-compact case can fit in some direction and so we have to deal with this lack of existence and now you understand that you're a bit in trouble because if you have the generalized existence sometimes you're actually very bad experience you're minimizing the sequence might slide off indicating something that is most There is no case, this is not okay. And you have to pay attention to be careful about the second variation of the area. And the sponcavity property that we mentioned has appeared in a very interesting where it had a practical role in showing that. Ensuring that there is quantitative control in several isomatic inequalities of spaces that are non-negatively curved in a big sense. And this is a key tool that there was in the Riemann setting. And actually, it wasn't clear whether this mechanic cannot outside the setting of the Myanmar. This was a little explicitly by Ledoux around ten years ago. And the problem is that if you want to prove this result, this is how we prove. This results, and this is how we do it. Then we have to learn how to deal with the settings because we want the second variation of the area in the limit. And actually, our result holds in the general. So in this case, I mean for wire, also our result also in general spaces, alexander spaces, need a massive spaces for an interpretation of the nouns. And basically, it resolves this issue that we didn't know how to. didn't know how to do this locality outside the Romanian sector. A quick list of the consequences of the locality, why is desire to have this locality, it gives one like connectedness for experimental features, because it gives productivity of the experimental profile. It gives literature continuity for the experimental profile, which in turn becomes basic estimates on the metric boundaries. estimates on the effective boundaries is uh how to about stability of the curvature under long loss of burdens and again i would and also let me mention whether uh you can give a new control shuttle quality in spaces with no negative distribution of independence also has been transparent by augustinian from the button Let's okay. Now we learn how to live without existence. So we have this generalized existence theorem. Either you have an isomatic sentence you may for a slide of infinity. And now, if we want to complete the proof of the locality, we have to learn how to do the second variation of the Of the area on this limited infinity, but first of all, I mean, we have to understand what is an curvature. And this is actually what we do. This is the main technical part of it. And even in the most setting, if you want to give a proof of the totality of the smooth setting, you have to give a notion of the shape of the limits and infinity, so you are each in space. So let me state this, but this one's for passed here. But this one's for us, and so basically, we put that if you take a rich link space with negative digital, you have a number, negative number, that satisfies these inequalities. So you have distributional bounds on the Laplacian of the distance from the cell. Why is this? Okay, this seems maybe if one is formula, they're not very informative. Informative, but the idea is that if you take a set, a smooth set, and you take the Laplacian, the distance from the boundary, this is computing the mean curvature of the if you take the t enlargement, this is computing the mean curvature of the boundary of the t enlargement. So basically this is telling you how you are evolving inside and outside. Inside and outside, the mean curvature on the P environment. And these are sharp in the sense that this included exactly space 1 sphere hyperbolic. And the idea, how do you get, so basically this is, so if you read with the mind of mean curvature, this is telling you that the mean curvature and distance t outside is less than h divided by 1 plus h divided by n plus 1. one plus h by n plus h one t now this is in the in in the in the smooth setting this is rather plus because the the mean curvature evolves and this becomes this becomes a taffy question and which can be which is exactly and what is it why why this is why this What is why why this is why this is enough? Why should this basically compare so why this is uh why this is okay I I'm I'm hiding here um and this was kind of plus very uh 79 and then by perspective but we are putting a mid-dimensional balance with a function and And but now, yeah, I mean, this is not giving us, this is giving us a surrogate in curvature, but it's not saying anything about the second variation. And here is, I think we really don't need to do the second variation. And this is something that I found when I was working with Sideniko. So actually we added different priorities to this. But the idea is that if you integrate this Laplace, Integrate this Laplace bound, you get monotonicity. You basically get a kind of a monotonicity. You basically get that there is a quantity that you can check from the evolution of the enlargements that has maximum at t equal to zero. Okay? And now, what is the dramatic meaning of this quantity? If you just write that this is less or equal to That this is less or equal to the value of zero, you get that the red function, perimeter of t-enlargement of your isoperimetric set, stays below the blue line. But the red function is also greater or equal than the isoperimetric profile and red column. Here I put the column in the x-axis. So basically, integrating the Laplacian bounds will give you a line extracting from about the x-primatic file. From about X perimeter to 5, this is enough to get back. This is somehow geometric, simple and magnetic geometry. And yeah, here, maybe I didn't say, but the idea, the idea is that if each weever, so if you now remote card, so you have to send your manifold with the second variation point by an estimate. Otherwise, you went down to the negative infinity. Now, so another application of, so we saw that this concentration compactness principle about either you have existence of many or in a minute at infinity has this nice application of gravity. Now, let's see when we can extract the generalized existence to the existence. So, actually, then let's see. Then let's see. So, since most of the results I'm going to explain, were also in the non-negative sectional temperature case, even in the most setting, I drew a simple picture here to say what is the definition of the negative sectional terms. So, this is a dating regard to what actually got into the form. You basically have a comparison between triangles. Comparison with triangles. So you have a, if you take a geodesic complete and locally compact space, you can see that this has non-negative sectional curvature in the big sense. If for every geodesic triangle, and like another geodesic connecting it to a point there, if you consider the comparison prediction on R2, you get that D is greater or equal to 25. So you define an excellent space with anxiety. We define an excellent space with negative exceptional curvature. We're saying that triangles are a factor. And when can you bootstrap existence, non-generalized existence for existence? So let me tell you like one example. Um we can put back two dimensional negative metric spaces ever much barometric sets for everyone. I should very much exist for everyone. And after this generalized result of Tore submits a different viewpoint on how to get existence in the two-dimensional setting, because the property is that now either you have existence of space or you survive of infinity, but there is this property that we kind of realized when we were working on this problem. When there are negative sectional curvature, and you did limited And you take limited point at infinity, you split the line. So, this is basically a splitting theorem for spaces at infinity. This spaces proves none given none. So, now you do the generalizing system. In case you go at infinity, this lemma here is telling you that space at infinity splits a line. So, since you are in dimension two, we only So since you are in dimension two, we only have four counts. You have basically to create an existence by finding something isometrically convenient in your space, either both or some level of sense of some functions. And this simple idea can be generalized to other settings. And now we come to the answer question. Question, and I just want to say now what happens when you have maximum volume growth. Okay, so maximum volume growth for a space with a negative curvature, it means that if you take this isoperimetic, if you take the Bishop-Cromo ratio at infinity, this is strictly positive. So, this is equivalent to saying that if you take an asymptotic. Uh, if you take an asymptotic point, any asymptotic point, your manifold space is uh has the same dimension of your digital space. Okay, um, so this is uh proved in a generality for the first time by Baroque study. If you have a space with money, even very general CB centric, and you have medium point growth on the general bonds, then you have this sharp isotopic quality. is equality, which is exactly the same that you have in Rn, but with a different constant here, that is ABR, which is this number, which is less than one. So when ABR is equal to minus, you start to displace. And this is a picture. ADR equal to zero, ADR positive, dimension is a two. So ABR equal to zero, you can imagine something that is an infinite infinity. If you are positive, something is compact. Okay? Theorem. If you have an n-dimensional, non-compact, non-negative decrease space in the sense of a lexical with positive APRs or non-degenerate central decomposes, then a superimatric sense exists always for sufficient production purposes. So this is why there we get existence production purposes. What is the idea behind? What is the idea behind this? The idea is can be said in a picture. So you have your manifold, your space with your negative section and curvature. And now you have the asymptotic code X and C. Now what happens if you without If you, without loss of generality, you can assume that your space doesn't split. Since you have no negative sectional curvature, then also the asymptotic form doesn't split. So if you get a point at distance one from the paper, the density here will be different, slightly greater, uniformly than the density here. Otherwise, you split the line. What does this mean? This means that if you take a limit of infinity space, Infinity space. This opening at infinity will be extremely greater than the opening of the asymptotic form. So this ADR means extremely greater than the ADR. But now here in the symptom, if you have, if you don't have an experiment here, Here, you get one here by the generalized existence. And then the volume is E, then the isoferimetric profile of the pure man for E, volume of E. So this is by the generalized assistance, but by the sharp isopherimetric equality, this is up to a constant the idea of x in t and And this is strictly greater by the one of the asymptotic significance. And this little bit of this is contradicting the Shape's parametric inequality for a battery model. And yeah, because I didn't say this, but the constants didn't get. Constant that you get here is sharp, sharply realized by the positive. So this is why it's a contradiction argument. It tells us nothing about the structure which should be undesirable. And now let's start with the more spicy part of this talk discussing. Start discussing future directions and new results. So, and now I want to talk about more negative scalar functions. There is this beautiful result by Schoder Schweitzler Schuyler 1 that tells you, okay, if you have a sufficiently fast-to-paradise flat dimension, it has no negative scalar curvature and strictly positive idea. And strictly positively here mass, so it's not between, then there is some threshold about the threshold that we get in the weak experiment. This is a rather fine result, which is linked to the existence of correlation stable C in the spaces with the negative scalar curvature with the scalar curvature integral bounds. And the pioneering The pioneering one by Miskeyl, where they proved that when you have C4, then you have foliation of volume that certainly stable CMC. And then there has been a lot of research and understanding this foliation in weaker assumptions. And support with tight-medic maths here, support maths. And then how to make this is pragmatic, there are pragmatic properties, because now you have a solution before that this makes solution that is pragmatic set. And example, the Schwatschin cases have been done by Ray and by Schotter Scheichman and Folkman in an asymptotic and economic case, which is not about in the scalar. Why this is also physically important. Also, physically important because these isopymetric sets of the ADM loss. They also prove in this paper, and it has also been proved by the Nantes by New York CM, by John M. P, that the avian mass is covered by the standard shift of the XP. Now, first thing that I want to comment on, here we are image. Here we are in a theorem. So we have we can see a lot of this exponential kind of canonical formation, and those are isometrimetic sets for large volumes, and they are also recovered by the alien mass. Now, one wants to weaken the assumptions on the asymptotics and maybe ask more, maybe ask the negative niche structure, and try to get some foulation. Get some Fourier at infinity with isomagnetic sensors. This is an going work with Jeffo Emma set type set up. And when you have no negative reach, you have to be very careful. Because you can, when you have just non-negative reach and mild controls at infinity, you have to be careful because you can. You can rather easily construct examples really dimensions in which you fail to have the need as for a larger and larger product. And so somehow we should realize that the best that you can expect is something the uniqueness for a lot of volumes whose density is going to one. Point one. This is what we are able to prove. We are able to prove that if your manifold doesn't speak, you adjust non-negative reach, you degenerate as infrared point and the curvature decay, we have to ask something otherwise there we even know how to, because this decay curvature is at least telling you that the cross-section of the asymptotic constant have a C1 alpha curve. Okay? Even if they are, they can be there as an example. They can be there as an example better, but at least they have sufficiently speed. And this is something we can start with, and we can prove that there is a unique experiment with this density, bigger and bigger sets of products. And this is also somehow sharp. We can start some examples in which this is not equal to one, basically. And now. And now let me finish with. So, I have discussed some technique on how to find isotary metric sets on many for mega-mission curvature and so on and so forth. And now, with this generalized existence theorem, now one can try this is like this is a future direction, like a point with a One can try to understand what this technique can give is the existence of isoprimetric sets in a weak setting of negatives character curvature. In my setting, none scalar curvature is just in significant methods. There have been several definitions. There is a broad definition about non-existence of a Non-existence of quantitras, more quadras in many forms satisfies assumptions. There has been a study by the approaches to find spare pushbacks figured by the collection. And then we scan, as we should heat, the definition using the volume of volts because the scalar curve should be. Because the scalar term actually gets like a big span. And then there is this convention by weak scan that this should be somehow the C0 part of the C0 of positive stellar. If you have this C0 with the notion of negative stellar curvature, you can decide why it's not going to be there. Then it's a very metric mass, which is the Isuperimetric mass, which is defined as the spring on perimeter divergent sense of this is the this is the exoperatory data shape that you call the scale b and mass when you have sufficient density. And yeah, this is a kind of interesting technique. Or even like if you ask single sympathetically flat, if you can see this quite automatically. If you can exist this quite a pragmatic set, which is more than a self-internet strong, and um, yeah, so I would love to say anything more about this. Thank you a lot for your attention.
