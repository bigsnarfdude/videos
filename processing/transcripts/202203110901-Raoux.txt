yeah okay all right um yeah so thank you to the organizers for the invitation um i i'm kind of sad that i didn't get to come in person um i've never been to vamp but hopefully i'll get the chance at some point um but for for now um today i'm going to talk about four-dimensional aspects of of tight contact three manifolds um and the goal And the goal, I guess, of this talk is to present some conjectures and theorems that relate three-dimensional contact topology to smooth four-dimensional topology. Yeah, so to kind of start out, I want to let Y C be A. Be a contact three manifold. And then there's this kind of fundamental question that comes up at the beginning of every talk about contact topology, which is, is the contact structure tight or over twisted? Or over twisted. And over twisted just means that there's an embedded disk in this contact three manifold that has characteristic foliation looking like this. So something. Something sort of like this. That's an over-twisted disc, which I'll write O as OT. And another way to think about this disk is a disk whose boundary is a very important thing. Is a Thurston-Bennikin number equals zero, Legendre and unknot. So TV equals zero, Legendre and unknot boundary. Okay, and tight, everybody just says, means not over twisted, but this dichotomy. But this dichotomy kind of fundamentally comes down to the Eliasberg-Bennikin inequality. So what does this say? It says that this contact three manifold is tight. Manifold is tight if and only if, if we look at any embedded surface, its Euler characteristic is bounded by the Thurston-Bennikin number and rotation number of its boundary. So whoops. Hold on, let me write this a little bit smaller. So, Tv of boundary F plus rotation is less than or equal to the minus Euler characteristic of F, where here F is a surface embedded in the three-manifold with Legendre. With Legendre and boundary. Okay, and sort of in particular, if I look at an over-twisted disk like the one that I drew on the left-hand side here, it violates this inequality. And so we get this dichotomy between tight and over-twisted contact structures. And maybe for the sake of history here, I learned that Bennikin originally proved this for the standard tight contact structure on the three-sphere. And this kind of his work, I think, predated this tight or over-twisted. Predated this tight or over-twisted dichotomy. He was just trying to show that the three-sphere admits more than one contact structure. And the dichotomy and this more general theorem for any three-manifold is due to Elie Yashberg. And the proof techniques here, at least, Elias. At least Ellie Ashberg's technique is to study characteristic foliations on surfaces and count singular points of those foliations in some way. So, it's a geometric proof. And as far as what I've written down so far, the Elyasberg-Bennekin inequality is really about three-dimensional contact manifolds. So, and it's really a three-dimensional theorem. And sort of not long after, so I guess Ellie Ashberg was working on this in the early 90s. And not long after that came sort of important work happening in gauge theory. Things like the local Tom conjecture and the adjunction inequality were proved. And this And this allowed Rudolph to prove a four-dimensional version for contact structures on the three-sphere. So the slice-Bennikin inequality is a sort of four-dimensional version for S3. So this is due to Rudolph. So, this is due to Rudolph. And it says that contact structure is the standard contact structure on S3 if and only if Tb plus rotation number is less than or equal to the negative. Is less than or equal to the negative Euler characteristic of surfaces, where now we're looking at surfaces in the four-ball that are sort of properly embedded with Legendre and boundary in the three-sphere. And kind of, if you think about it, the difference between this and the Elyashberg-Bennekin inequality for the three-sphere is now we're allowing more surfaces. So this is a stronger theorem, at least for the three-sphere. And the proof here relies on gauge theory. But in essence, this is a four-dimensional characterization of tightness for the three-sphere. And so the work that I've been doing with Matt Hedden, Matt Hennen has been to kind of think about are there four-dimensional analogs for other three manifolds and like what can we say about those? So we have the following conjecture. So our conjecture Is, I mean, it's really like, let's copy and paste just the first part of this. So, our conjecture is that Is that a contact structure on a three-manifold is tight if and only if this bound holds, but now not just for surfaces in the three-manifold with Legendrean boundary. We want this to hold for surfaces. Actually, let's call our surfaces here sigma instead of f sigma is a Sigma is always going to be a surface in a four-manifold. So here I want sigma and boundary sigma to be embedded in the three-manifold across an interval rel whose boundary lies in kind of one. In kind of one side of this product. So here's kind of a picture of what I mean. These are the kind of surfaces that we're going to allow. So this is supposed to be y cross zero, one. And here's a surface sigma. And I want Sigma, and I want boundary sigma to be Legendrean with respect to the contact structure. Okay, and so this is the conjecture. And I guess one thing is that we don't know how to prove it. So that's why it's a conjecture and not a theorem. But I think what would be so a question that I have is whether there's some way to prove this using geometric techniques that are kind of along the lines of Elie-Aushberg's proof of the Ellie-Aushberg-Bennikin inequality, the three-dimensional version. I think if you, yeah, if you could prove something like that, Yeah, if you could prove something like that, that would give a completely new proof of something like the local Tom conjecture that's that's like more geometric. But I don't really know how to do that. And Hedden and I, Matt Hedden and I have approached this problem from kind of a Hagard Fleur perspective. And so I'll tell you what we started with. I'll tell you what we sort of what we can prove. And it kind of comes down to like what we can prove using Hagard Fleur theory is related to how much of tightness Hagard floor theory can see. So this has come up in some of the other talks. There's, yeah, the basic problem is that Hagard floor theory doesn't completely see tightness. Completely see tightness. There's an invariant, however, called the contact invariant that's important for the theorem that we can prove. So let me tell you just a little bit about the contact invariant, and then I'll tell you what we can show. So the Hager floor contact invariant. And Boulant talked a little bit about this yesterday. So, this is a class in HF hat of a three-manifold with its orientation reversed, which you can also think of as the Hagarthloh cohomology of the three-manifold. And some facts. And some facts about this contact invariant are: first of all, if the contact invariant is non-trivial as an element of this group, then the contact structure is tight. And if the contact structure is over twisted, then the contact in The contact invariant is always equal to zero. Okay, um, but like I said, we don't have a complete invariant here, so there's there exist contact three manifolds where x is tight and the contact invariant is zero, okay? Zero. Okay. So this is this is, I guess, work of Paolo. But there's sort of lots of examples like that. So what can we prove? The theorem, this is going to be theorem one. So we can prove that if we have a contact three manifold with non-vanishing contact invariant, then Tb plus rotation number is a lower bound. Is a lower bound for the negative Euler characteristic of any surface embedded in the three-manifold cross-interval with Legendrean boundary. So this is the same setting that I was talking about before. Okay, so that's the first theorem. Are there Are there any questions so far? Okay, so I want to. There was a question in the chat, Catherine. Oh, sorry, I missed that. The question, do we know any such examples with twisted coefficients? I'm assuming that means examples of tight contact manifolds. Contact manifolds with that's what that means. I don't know. Maybe someone else in the audience knows the answer to that. I thought there were some examples where, I don't know if it's written, but there should be examples where the Taurus, there's an incompressible Taurus and the Taurus is homologically true. I think that's written down. I think that's written down, right, in this paper by Jeremy and Carlo, isn't it? Maybe I wrote something to do, but I'm not sure. Oh, did you do it? Okay. So those are examples where the contact invariant is with any coefficient. I see. Okay. Yeah. So I guess the answer is yes. There are separating torus, for example, when you add your retortion along that, then the twist and contact invert zero. Then the trust in contacting round zero. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. So what goes into the proof here? The basic idea is that we want to use a Hagard-Flohr tau invariant associated to this contact invariant. So if you saw Bulin's talk yesterday, he talked a little bit about this. He talked a little bit about this, but I was going to say in a little bit more detail how that works. So let me just start by saying something about tau invariance. Oops. So if I have a knot in a three-manifold, I can. I can produce a Hagard decomposition or a Hagard diagram, let's say, that sort of encodes how the knot is embedded in the three-manifold. So I have some doubly pointed Hagar diagram where the sigma alpha beta is a Hagar splitting for y. For y, and these base points are encoding how the knot is embedded in that three-manifold. And from this, I can build a chain complex CF hat of the three-manifold where the generators are intersection points of alpha and beta tori in the symmetric product. In the symmetric product of G copies of the Hagard surface, and the differential is a count of pseudo-holomorphic disks. Okay, so this is kind of the basic setup of Hagard floor homology of the three-manifold. And then the not, the sort of important part that I really want to focus on here is that the NOT filters. That the NOT filters this chain complex. Maybe I'll call it CF hat of H. The NOT filters this chain complex. And specifically, if I have a disk between generators X and Y, we say that the filtration level of Y Level of Y is greater than or equal to the filtration level of X if the sort of domain associated to that disk intersected with the NOT is greater than or equal to zero. Okay, so there's some this is giving you a filtration and it really depends on the knot. That's kind of the key here. So So then we can define an invariant in terms of this filtration. And let me run out of space. Let's see. I'll just, yeah, I'll do part of it here. So I think I have enough space. Definition. If alpha is a class in hf hat of y, hf hat of y, we want tau alpha of k to be the minimum n such that alpha is in the image of I n where where I n here, this is the map induced on Hamal. On homology by just including the nth filtration level into the whole complex. And because this filtration depended on the knot, this is a non-invariant. Okay. And maybe, actually, let me bring this definition with us. So, the kind of annoying thing here is that the contact invariant lives in the Hagard-Fleur homology of the three manifolds with its orientation reversed. But we can kind of define dual tau invariance. In dual tau invariance. So if phi is a class in the Hagard-Flair cohomology, which you can also think of as hf hat of minus y, then you can also define something called tau dual of k. And this is the minimum n such that there exists some beta. Some beta in the image of I n such that the pairing of beta with phi is non-zero. So, this here, this is the pairing. Between HF hat, sorry, cohomology and homology. Okay. And that in particular gives you now, so in particular, we're sort of interested in tau dual of the contact invariant. The contact invariant of a knot. And depending on where you read about this, sometimes this is written just as tau C. Okay, so those are those are the same. Okay. And some previous work I've had in. Shows that if I have a Legendre in that k tilde, Tb plus rotation number of this Legendre knot is a lower bound for twice the tau invariant of the contact structure. Structure for the underlying knot type minus one. So here K tilde is a Legendre rep of K. Okay, and so to prove to prove the theorem, we want to combine this bound. Combine this bound with a genus bound involving tau. So, this and this is what I'll call a relative adjunction inequality. Adjunction inequality, this genus bound. So I'm just going, so Matt and I proved a more general version of this statement, but because in this talk I'm just interested in three-manifold cross-interval, I'll just focus on that specific case. So our relative adjunction inequality for Um, for for y across zero one um looks like this if I have um if I have a surface embedded in y across i whose boundary on one end is a not k zero. A not k0 and whose boundary on the other end is a not k1, we prove that for all alpha in hf hat of y, tau alpha of k1 minus tau alpha of k0 is less than or equal to the genus of this surface. Of this surface. So this is the surface sigma. And this is y cross 0, 1. And we prove a dual statement also. So for all cohomology classes, we get tau star of phi, phi of k1, minus tau star. minus tau star v of k0 is also less than or equal to the genus of sigma and so in particular if we kind of if we kind of apply this um for for the contact invariant we get that tau of um the contact invariant The contact invariant is less than or equal to the genus of sigma. And then combining this with Hedden's previous work that I mentioned, we get the theorem, the theorem that I talked about. Okay. And let me just say, so, so. So the theorem, as I stated it, is true for surfaces whose boundary is a link. And so one additional thing we do is kind of extend this idea to work for links as well. Okay, questions? Okay, questions? Catherine? Yeah. Stanny. So just so is I maybe I missed something somewhere in the middle of all that. What was your assumption on Y? Is it a rational homology sphere? Is that or is and is K null homologous? What was the yeah, okay. So let's let me go back up maybe to the statement of the theorem. Theorem, which is here. So Y is any three manifold and K should be null homologous. Okay, fine. So not rationally null homologous, but null homologous. Right. So yeah, these the invariant like the tau invariant is defined for rationally null homologous knots, but it's not clear what. It's not clear what kind of surface you're looking at in that case. So, yeah, so this is just for null homologous. Yeah. Yeah, I may have asked you that question once or twice before. Thanks. Yeah. Okay, so I think in the time that's remaining, I want to describe. Want to describe two more conjectures that are related to this one and try to, I guess, explain how they're related to this one. So to related conjectures. Related conjectures. So, one thing that's kind of strange or maybe interesting about the proof of the slice-Bennikin inequality is that it sort of relies on the truth of, at least Rudolph's proof relies on the truth of the local Tom conjecture. But it also implies the local Tom conjecture. So, in particular, if I look at So, in particular, if I look at a torus knot, this has a Legendrean representative where TB plus, let me write this carefully TB plus rotation is equal to Is equal to P minus one times Q minus one minus one, which is twice the three genus of that knot minus one. And so for these knots, We kind of get a string of equalities between this TB plus rotation number is equal to twice the tau invariant minus one, which is equal to twice the four genus minus one, which is equal to twice the three genus minus one. And like in general, these are These are inequalities kind of here, here, and here. And so these particular knots are getting equality between all of these things. So, and something else. Yeah, so how is this? I guess how is this related to contact structures and like what I was talking about before? Well, in general, or maybe first I want to say, like, one thing that's kind of Like, one thing that's kind of important here about torus knots is that they're fibered. And in general, if I have a link in a three-manifold that's fibered with fiber surface F, then this gives me an open book decomposition of Y. Of Y, where the link is the binding and the fiber surface is the page or the pages. And then from that, you can construct a contact structure C sub L. So this is the thirst. Of L. So this is the Thurston Winkle and Comfort construction. And if we go back to thinking about torus lengths, torus knots, or torus links, I guess, these, through this kind of construction, torus links always induce the standard type contact structure on the three-sphere. And sort of more generally, all And sort of more generally, all fibered strongly quasi-positive knots induce the standard tight contact structure on the three-sphere. And so you might expect that the associated contact structure is going to be tight whenever the fiber surface. The fiber surface is not just three genus minimizing, but also sort of four genus minimizing. So, in other words, this is the second conjecture. So, let's suppose that L is a fibered link and the in And the induced contact structure is tight, then the fiber surface, we expect that the fiber surface is, let's write it as maximal so has. So has maximal Euler characteristic over all surfaces in Y cross 0, 1 with the same boundary and carrying the same homology class. So the same classes as F okay and what can we prove? Well, we can prove the theorem. If the contact class is non-zero, whoops, and we still need L to be fibered. We still need L to be fibered. So if L and Y is fibered and the contact invariant is non-zero, then we get this conclusion. Okay. So So I think we have time. Let me tell you how the proof goes. So L is a fibroid link, and it's naturally transverse in this. In this context structure coming from the open book decomposition. And there's sort of two important things here. So one is that the self-linking number of this transverse link is equal to the negative Euler characteristic. The negative Euler characteristic of the fiber surface. And the second thing is that we can approximate L by a Legendrean where this self-linking number The self-linking number is equal to TB of that Legendrean plus rotation number. Let's just keep that there so we don't forget. And so now if the contact invariant is non-zero, then then TB, so then theorem one Tells us that T V tells us that this less than or equal to the negative Euler characteristic of any surface. Of any surface in y cross i with the same boundary link. So this is a surface in y cross 0, 1 with boundary sigma equal to this Legendrean whose homology class is the same as the homology class of the fibers. As the homology class of the fiber surface. And then, kind of stringing these things together from one and two, you get that this is equal to the negative Euler characteristic of the fiber surface. So that negative Euler characteristic of the fiber surface is the smallest possible thing. Okay. Okay. Questions? Okay, so now there's sort of one more theorem and one more conjecture that I want to talk about. And I'll state the theorem first and then try to tie this. Yeah, tie this back to the other things that I was talking about. So here I'm three here. So suppose suppose that I'll That L embeds as a separating curve of or let's say on the page of Of an open book decomposition for y, whose associated contact invariant is not equal to zero. Then, the Euler characteristic of this subsurface Is maximal over all surfaces in the three-manifold cross-interval with boundary equal to L and And end in the same homology class. So here's kind of a schematic picture of what's happening here. So suppose there's some open book decomposition for Y whose fiber surface looks like this. Looks like this, and this link L embeds as a separating curve on there. Then S is this subsurface over here. And we're saying that the Euler characteristic of that subsurface is maximal overall. surfaces maximal overall surfaces and y cross i with the same boundary okay so um so why this condition this seems like kind of a weird condition um and and the motivation gets back to um sort of work of rudolph and and studying Rudolph and studying quasi-positive, strongly quasi-positive links. So Rudolph says that a link in S3 is strongly quasi-positive if and only if it embeds as. As a separating curve on the fiber surface of a torus link, which remember, torus links induce the standard type contact structure on S3. Structure on S3. And more generally, you could replace Taurus links here with any link inducing the standard tight contact structure on S3. So this kind of embedding as a separating curve on the fiber surface is supposed to be a kind of analog of strongly quasi-positive links. strongly quasi-positive links for links in other three manifolds. And then the sort of expectation is that if you embed as a separating curve on some page of an open book decomposition that induces a tight context structure, then that Then, that subsurface that you bound should be minimal genus, not just in the three-manifold, but in three-manifold cross-interval. So, this is the third conjecture. So, why see is tight if I only If and only if every subsurface of the page of an open book decomposition of sorry of If every subsurface of the page of a supported open book decomposition is minimal complexity over all surfaces and why And a y cross i with the same boundary and same homology class. Okay. So I think I'm just So, I think I'm just about out of time, but I think. Sorry, there was a question that I think I missed a while ago. Oh, you have you answered that. Okay, yeah, sorry. Okay, so let me kind of just wrap up by giving the proof of theorem, the third theorem. So So let me maybe bring it down here so that we have it again. Okay, so I just want to talk about the proof kind of in the last few seconds here. So what's the idea? So, what's the idea? Well, we have this fiber surface in our three-manifold, and the first thing we want to do is push it into the three-manifold cross I in a nice way. So, the picture we want looks something like this. Actually, let me use. Actually, let me use other color. So here's the fiber surface. And here is the separating curve that I'm interested in. And I want to do this so that the separating curve lives in some Y, like vertical slice of this product. So. So this is this is L over here. We have boundary F and S is like is that is that subsurface. Okay, and now I want to apply I want to apply I want to apply this sort of relative adjunction inequality that I mentioned for this y picture, and I'm going to apply it to this piece of the picture. So we get a bound involving talent variance where we have the contact. The contact invariant of boundary F minus tau dual of L should be less than or equal to the genus. Let's move this over just a little bit of F minus. F minus S. And if the contact invariant is non-zero, then previous work of Hedden tells us that this tau invariant of the boundary of The boundary of F is equal to the genus of the fiber surface. Okay, and now we kind of rearrange things to make it look like this. So we have the genus of F minus the genus of F minus S should be less than or equal to tau of the contact invariant of L. And now, if we think about it, this is just the genus of that subsurface. And the tau invariant of L is less than or equal to the genus of any other surface in Y cross I who has the same boundary and carries the same homology class. So I won't. So I won't write all of that in that little, in those parentheses, but that's the proof now that this the genus of that is smaller than the genus of any other surface there. And now I'm really out of time, so I should stop there. Any questions for Heather? Do you have any idea how to extend to general tight structures? Yeah, that's a good question. I don't. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it just seems like. Seems like you probably can't do it with Hagard Floor techniques. So, yeah, I don't, yeah, I don't really know. I yeah, I guess, yeah, one of the reasons that I wanted to talk about this is to kind of put it out there and see if anybody else has sort of ideas about how to approach this, because I think it would be really interesting. Catherine, thank you for a lovely talk and let's thank the speaker. So we have a 20-minute break here and then the last talk is in person. I welcome all the virtual participants to come live. Participants online and that collect. So, Ryan Pudney will be giving a talk on Tom Parallel. And what I'll do is I'll mute the room so that those on the video call can chat among themselves. But I should point out that the room is muted, so you can't hear us, but you're still piping in, and I don't know how to mute your conversation. How to begin your conversation. So, anyway, so we're actively listening, but we can't help but hear what you say because it's very loud here. Nice talk, Catherine. Good to see you. Thanks. Thanks. Good to see you too.
