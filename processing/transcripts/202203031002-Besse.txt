The objective of these results is to extend the generalized Cauchy-Nariant equation, which is a Lagrangian formulation for Hamiltonian heat transport to a dissipative transport. So we will obtain the same kind of generalized Cauchy invariant equation, but at the price of a Equation, but at the price of a statistical average over an ensemble of a random realization. So this is, in fact, the matter of the first point, which give a general framework. Next, we will apply this general framework to obtain a Lagrangian formulation of non-hydal hydrodynamics and magneto-MHD model. Model and finally, if we have time, we applied also we use this stochastic Lagrangian formulation to make the analysis of the non-lidal incompressible extended energy equation. So, to start to describe the general framework, we must recall results about stochastic. About the stochastic flow. I don't know if you see about the stochastic flow. Maybe I have a problem. We do see the screen. It's just not full screen anymore. Now, Nicola, you're back. Okay. So to describe my results, I just need to record some known results about Results about the stochastic flow of deferred morphism, which you can find in, for example, Qnita in 82. So we consider M as a smooth closed manifold of dimension N. XT of X is a map which denotes the position on M at time T of a stochastic flow or stochastic particle, if you want, which is at the position X at time S. X denotes XKA denotes the Sika vector field on the manifold, that is to say, first order linear differential operator with a Sika coefficient. And so we consider Ft to be a continuous in time, a stochastic process taking value in the vector field on the manifold. So this stochastic. This stochastic process is divided into parts. A first part given by the vector field V0, which is a deterministic part, and a second part, which is the sum of vector field VL, which are weighted by a one-dimensional Bronel motion W. So, of course, this vector field are smooth in space and continuous in time. Then, cunitas. Then Cunita says that with this hypothesis, the stochastic flow XT, which is the unique solution of the forward Stratonovich SDE, given by the following equation, define a continuous in-time stochastic flow of smooth diffeomorphisms on the manifold, so in space. Moreover, the forward flow CST has a unique analysis. A unique indius CTS, which satisfied this time a backward Stratonovich SDE equation. So for to fix the notation, the at notation over D means the backward stochastic differential or integration, and the circle denotes the Stratonovic integrals. So now we So now we state our results. So we call these results the statistical generalized Cauchy invariant equation. I say I give the results after the presentation of these results. So we still consider M a smooth closed manifold of dimension M. We consider V naught a smooth vector field in space and continuous in times and also a sequence of the vector field. A sequence of the vector field DL, smooth in space and continuous in times. So CSTL of X is a solution of the forward Stratonovich SDE, as we see before, and its inverse CTS is a solution of the backward Stratonovich SDE. So by the previous proposition, the forward flow XT and the backward flow XTS. The back work flow CTS exists, are unique and are continuous and define continuous in time, stochastic flow, or smooth diffeomorphism of the manifold or in space. Moreover, we consider beta as a time-dependent family of exact p-form, which are given by the differential, the exterior differential of a p minus one form alpha. P minus one form alpha, which are also enough smooth enough in space and time. So the result is the following. So beta, the p form beta satisfy in the classic sense the following dissipative equation if and only if beta is given as the expectation of the backward generalized Cauchy-invariant equation. Cauchy-Nariant equation, which is right in the brackets. So, in this equation, the pound notation or sterling notation denotes the lead derivative, and the expectation is a standard expectation with respect to a Bayner measure. So, this first corollary, a straightforward corollary from this theorem is a statistical Kelvin. Statistical Kelvin circulation theorem for the P minus one form alpha, which is given by the first equation. And the second equation defines statistical Almost flux conservation theorem. So the proof of this theorem is quite obvious from the stochastic generalized Cauchy invariant of the previous theorem. Of the previous theorem, and you just need to use change of variable and stock store. So, the proof of the theorem one, in fact, rely on a backward generalized Cauchy-invariant equation, which is now setting in a completely deterministic framework. So, as before, we consider V naught as Consider V naught as a smooth vector field on the manifold M. And now CST is just the solution of the forward ODE where the vector field is given by D naught. And the inverse, of course, X CTS is a solution of the same but backward ODE generated by D naught. So from a standard Cauchy-Lipschit speaker theorem, the forward and the backward flow Forward and the backward flow are exist, are unique and smooth in space and time. We also give we consider also a family of time-dependent time-dependent family of exact P form as before. And now beta satisfy in the classic sense the following Lee transport equation, which is an Hamiltonian equation now completely deterministic. Of course, if an unknown Of course, if and only if beta is given by the following formula, which is in fact a backward generalized Cauchy invariant equation. So the proof of these results is similar to the proof of the theorem one of Best Rich in 2070s. But in this paper, this theorem was setting forward in time. So it was Forwarding time. So it was sitting in the forwarding time direction. So to obtain the first theorem, we need the same kind of formulation, but backward in time. So the proof of theorem one, in fact, is relies on this backward generalized Cauchy invariant equation and also on stochastic on Stochastic on Ito calculus. Maybe I should say some things. So, of course, from the deterministic Cauchy invariant equation, we also obtain completely a deterministic failing circulation theorem. So, now the proof of the theorem one, so about statistical generalized Cauchy and equation is Generalized Cauchy invariant equation is based on this backward Cauchy invariant equation plus Ito calculus. So in fact, the proof of this theorem is quite simple. Okay, maybe I will skip it to gain time and I will come back to this proof if you want. So it is not very complicated. So what is more interesting maybe is some Interesting, maybe, is some application of this general framework. So, the first application is to obtain a Lagrangian formulation for dissipative hydrodynamics and dissipative MID. So, the problem now is to link, you see in the dissipative equation, which is deterministic, you have this kind of dissipative term. The dissipative term where you have a sum of a square of the lead derivative. So now you have to link this term to a convenient diffusion operator on your manifold. So to do that, we need to introduce the concept of gradient-brownion system and diffusion by embedding. So we consider M as a smooth closed manufacturer. The smooth closed manifold of dimension M and I is an isometric embedding of the manifold M into a larger Euclidean space R M. This embedding always exists because of Whitney or Nash embedding theorem. And we denote by P the orthogonal projection of the Euclidean space RM onto the tangent space. Of M at the point X. In fact, this orthogonal projector can be completely determined by using the transport of the tangent map of the isometric embedding. And in fact, the vector field P L of this vector field P L coming from this orthogonal projection is just the gradients of the component of the L component of the isometric. Isometric embedding. So the system PLWL is often called a Granien-Brunian system. And to give an example, I consider the sphere for which we have a completely explicit formula. So the standard embedding of the sphere of dimension N into the Euclidean space of dimension N plus 1 is characterized by the following. Characterized by the following orthogonal projection of Rn plus one onto the on the tangent space of the sphere. So, of course, this projection is completely evident or you can visualize it in 3D easily. So, now that we have defined P, this orthogonal projector, we can express the Hoge-Durham Laplacian in terms of isometric embedding. So, this is a Embedding. So this is a result obtained by LWorthy in 92. So in fact, for any smooth P form, the old Laplacian of this P form, which is given by delta underscore H subscribe ih, is in fact now is given by the sum of Now is given by the sum of the square of lead derivative, where the vector fields are given by the orthogonal projector coming from the isometric embedding. So this way is one way to define diffusion and manifold, but there exists other ways. There is another way that we call Or another way that we call also entrax sync representation, which just use local coordinates. So the difference between isometric embedding is that isometric embedding is global, whereas local coordinates are local. So it's more useful to use isometric global embedding. So this extrinsic intrinsic representation is useful, in prioritized. Presentation is useful in prioritized for analysis and also numerics because you have to explicit all the calculation. And so, when you do numerics, you need to explicit all calculation. The drawback is that the Bordian motion is not an n-dimensional object and also it depends on the isometric embedding. So, as there exists another representation which is equivalent to this representation, To this representation. But maybe I will skip, it's not the point here, so I will skip just to say that there exists another way to represent diffusion on manifold. So now with this lemma and the theoretical one, we can now obtain a Lagrangian formulation of the Nadi-Stokes equation on manifold. For first, we apply it on a flat. First, we apply it on a flat torus, and of course, the result will be simple. So, on the flat torus, the Lagrangian representation of Nadi-Stokes equation is given first by a backward stochastic differential equation in which you see the vector field U and the viscosity mu. So, this equation determines the backward flow of CTS. X CTS and this equation is coupled with the statistical Cauchy invariant equation which give the vorticity in term of the backward flow and of course you recover U from omega by standard formula and in fact this formulation is completely equivalent to the Constantine Eager formulation given Eager formulation given by the following two equations. The first equation is exactly the same, and in constantine ER formulation, there is no need to use the vorticity because the vector field is directly determined as the expectation of the LoRay projection of the quantity in the bracket. But if you take the curl of view to a Take the curl of u to obtain omega after some algebra, you see that in fact on the right-hand side you recover the Cauchy invariant equation, in the statistical sense, of course. So of course the corollary expressed before apply and you have a statistical velocity circulation, a conservation theorem and also vorticity flux conservation. And also a vorticity flux conservation theorem, of course, in an average sense. So now we can easily extend the formulation of Lagrangian formulation of nadi-stocks on a manifold M. So the Lagrangian formulation is given by the following backward Stratonovic SDE. So you see that now the vector field VL are replaced by Field V L are replaced by the vector field P L, which comes from the orthogonal projection of the space, the bigger space, Euclidean space Rm on the tangent space of the manifold. This equation to determine the backward flow is coupled with the vorticity, with the equation, with the statistical Cauchy-invariant equation, which give the vorticity. Equation which gives the vorticity in terms of the backward flow. Of course, omega here is a two-form, U-flat is a one-form associated to the vector field U. And of course, you still have Kelvin circulation theorem for the one-form U and the two-form omega. So you can also apply this formalism. Also, apply this formatis to obtain a Lagrangian formulation of the non-ideal incompressible extended MHD equation. So, we start with a flat torus to fix the idea. So, there is two magnetic fields, B plus and B minus, which satisfies this transport equation. So, the first term, the second term is a D transport and the third term is the diffusion. So, the velocity V plus and V minus are given in terms of B plus. Argid in terms of B plus and B bindness, thanks to Biotsavar type law. And you can recover the potential, magnetic potential, vector potential, magnetic vector potential from the magnetic field by the standard definition. So using the general framework, the Lagrangian formulation of this dissipative dissipative MHD is given by the backward SDE in Ito sense because as the diffusion here is constant Ito and Atanovich is the same of course is the same the same thing so this equation is coupled with the statistical Cauchy invariant equation for the magnetic field so you see Magnetic field. So you see inside this equation, you see the magnetic field, the magnetic vector potential appear. And of course, the velocity and is as for the velocity, we keep the same formula. Of course, as a corollary, we have a statistical Alven theorem about the conservation of magnetic flux and magnetic circulation. Magnetic circulation. So now you can easily about 10 minutes. Yes, you can easily extend this to a manifold. So this is the first three equations is the extension in a Larian framework. But what we are interested in is the Lagrangian framework. So now the backward flow satisfies the backward Stratonovic equation, SDE. SDE, you still see here the vector field, which gives the projection on the tangent space of the manifold. You have this equation is coupled with a statistical Cauchy-variant equation. And of course, V plus and minus are given by the same equation. So there is other model, there is other freedom which enter in this. In this backward in-time framework, so there is, for example, non-idal fluid equation, non-idal inertial electron MHD, and in fact, every system which can be recast as a lead transport equation plus diffusion. So, there is related and connected forwarding time results to our results. So, in 2009, EDINC obtained in the Eclidean framework. In the Euclidean framework, there are three similar representation but forward in time by using the Constantine Iyer 2008 framework and the Cauchy formula. And so the Cauchy formula is not exactly the Cauchy invariant equation. Of course, it's equivalent, but the real relation between these two formula is the Haus duality. So in fact, Cauchy invariant equation is the Haus dual of the Cauchy formula. Cauchy formula. Also, I think we use the Kuznetsov Ruban-Lagrangian decomposition of vorticity and magnetic field to give the Lagrangian formulation of standard MHD. So, our work is also linked to stochastic PDEs for modeling stochastic free dynamics. So, this formality is developed by Ulm and his collaborator, like Chrisan van der Ulm and Rivas Holm. As all. But we must emphasize that their formalism concerns stochastic PDEs, whereas our results is only for deterministic PDEs. So this is not the same thing, not at all the same thing, but there is a strong connection too. And there is also several works which deal with random diffeomorphisms. Deal with random diffeomorphisms equation. And maybe the work which is more related to our results is a Rapopo paper of 2002. Unfortunately, I try to read this paper, but it's very hard to read because first it uses a very complicated geometric tool such as the Riemann carton veil geometric. So it's quite difficult to see why they use this complex geometry. Moreover, the theorem and their proof are very evasive, and sometimes there is no proof at all. So it seems a very interesting paper, but difficult to read. And at least I don't know if it's correct or not, but I think it's an interesting paper. Okay, maybe I have. Okay, maybe uh I have uh four minutes to uh the second application. I I will uh maybe skip it uh say just few words and skip uh so the idea is uh to now use this stochastic Lagrangian formulation to make the analysis of the non-ideal incompressible extended MLD equation. So this equation takes the following form. So here we The following form. So, here we integrate between time between zero and t the backward stochastic differential equation to obtain the backward flow from t to the time zero. Now the statistical generalized equation is expressed at time s equals zero. So it just Equals zero, so it just involves the backward flow plus the initial condition on the vector potential, and the velocity is the same. So, the idea is to analyze this system, and we can show, in fact, local well-posedness in time. We can also show the non-resistive limit toward the incompressible extended MHD, so without diff resistivity or yes. Or, yes, without resistivity. And we can also show global in-time well positions for small initial data and large resistivity. So, I will skip the results and maybe go directly to some interesting perspective. So, by using this Lagrangian formulation, we can also make, we think that we can also make easily make the mathematical analysis. Make the mathematical analysis such as local and global well-course nets on smooth manifolds. Indeed, since the orthogonal projection of the manuscript is a smooth map, there is a priori no problem to make the analysis, but the calculation, of course, become easy. We can also use this stochastic Lagrangian formulation to derive the large deviation estimates for Estimates for such a stochastic flow in the spirit of many papers on the subject. We can also extend this formulation to bounded domain and manifold with boundaries. We can also explore this stochastic Lagrangian formulation with a Brunier generalized flow solution for EDL freedom. So, without any dissipation. And of course, there is also a very And of course, there is also a very challenging point or a way to design new numerical backwards and Lagrangian schemes to solve deterministic dissipative PDE by using this stochastic Lagrange formulation in the spirit of a Cauchy Lagrange method for lit transport or without dissipation. Without dissipation. Okay, maybe I am in time now. Is okay? Yep, great. Thanks. Thanks for that. We do have maybe time for a couple of questions. Or certainly, we will be coming back for questions after. Uriel, go ahead.
