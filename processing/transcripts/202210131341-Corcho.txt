From Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and he'll talk about Undecuci Problem Associated. Thank you, Vadar. Go ahead. Thank you, Luis, for the introduction. Thank you, the organizers, for the kind invitation. It's a pleasure to be here online. Online. It is a work in collaboration with Ishin Hahaye from California State University. The idea of the award is to understand the dynamic of the solution as society to the Cauchy problem of the generalized Euro-Pitajevki model introduced by Worcesters and Kuras Tot in this world. And Kura started in this work in order to explain the dynamics of an equilibrium boss and condensate. The mathematical model for this system is given by these two equations. The first equation for psi is a non-linear HOD equation. And the second component of the system is a dissipative equation for eta r. eta r here delta is the laplaci operator in euclidean domain all the all the physical parameters are real and in particular the parameters n g r g are positive and gamma r gamma r are different to zero the function p the function p is a real function psi is a complex function and eta r And eta R is a Freedom function. From the physical point of view, ψ is the condensated wave function, gamma is the momentum independent loss rate, GR is the strength of polariton-polariton iteration within the condensate, and eta R is the local density of the reservoir. And polaritons are pumped into the reservoir alpha P. The reservoir at rate p and relax at rate gamma r. Okay, if we change in the scale of the system, we can rewrite the GP1, the original system, in the following way. Using this change of the variable, we obtain a more simplified system where the parameter alpha, beta, and the function p are related with the. P are related with traditional parameters in this way. In our work, we consider the more simple case that is the case in what the function p is a constant function. In this particular case of the system, we can use it again another chain of variable and we the system gp2 becomes in The GP2 becomes into the system GP3 for solutions U and B given for this equation. An important remark for this system, for system GP3, is that if we omit these rect tense, these four rect tense, this system remains the classical Schrodinger device system, which is a model and important. Which is a model, an important model, in non-linear optical. The exchange device system is a more simple system because consists in two equations. The first equation is an exchange equation with this quadratic open term, and the second equation is given by this simple dissipative equation in the case gamma r positive. Okay, the shortening. Okay, the shotgun device system was studied by several authors from different point of view, for example, web closeness, blowback phenomena, and scattering. For instance, BD Garai established weak local solution in H1H1 in Euclidean dominance, antimension two and three, bidegaraya and Bidi Garaya and Vese in 2001 established a numerical simulation of robot solution for the component U of the system in L infinity space in the case the dominion space, the dominion domain and dimension two. Join Quinlinaris in 2004, we obtained local well-positions in H1, H1 in Euclidean domain for dimension one. In Euclidean domain for dimension 1, 2, and 3, global in the case of dimension 1, and global well-posnessing L2L2 in Euclidean domain in dimension 1, 2, and 3. Later, VFT and Mateos in 2008 established global well-positions in HSH for periodic domain above 122 in the main. Above 2L2 in dimension 1, Above 2 energy space in dimension 2. Join Mateo's in 2009, we obtained local and global well-posings in AHAK, and we noted that we considered different sobolex index for the component of the solution of the system. And we trade the case both Euclidean domain and period. The Euclidean domain and periodic domain, but in dimension one. And we noted that in this work, we obtained resolve for negative regularity. Later, joined with Oliveira and Romón Silva, we proved global well-positing H1L2 in Oclide Domain Dimension 2. And this work in particular shows that the children device system does not present the Device system does not present the formation of singularity as to model limits given by qubit Schrodinger equation. In this work, Albajala Gamboa show a global well-posing for small data using the local solution we're tinning in this work in the previous work. Join Coinferreira, we delivered global well-positions in week LPN. Possessions in weak L finite space in Euclidean domains and dimensions between one and six. Later, during weak silva, we obtain global well-posing for small data in H1, H1, now in dimension three and four in Euclidean domains. We prove growth of the sovereign with respect to the parameter deli, given by tau equal to one over gamma r when this parameter goes. When this parameter goes to zero, Correa and Oliveira obtain scattering and remote solution for initial data in several options of space, in dimension one between one and four. And lastly, in this world, joint with Cordel, we prove that a solution of the Schoden device system converge to the cubic knowledge in the Shodi equation. Cube acknowledging the show equation E L to L2 when this parameter deli with the delight parameter going to zero in dimension one and in included species. The ideas, what can we say about the dynamics of GP3? GP3 is more complicated than the Schrodinger device because the system has this term in the second equation. A Schrodinger device is basically Is basically given by a coupling with the quadratic square of the solution U, but GP3 has this complicated QB term. Okay. The first stick in that direction was given by Antonelli, Markovi, Sobermeyer, Sierra, and Esparber in this world, in a recent world, and they show a global wealth positive in Asia. Show a global well-positions in H1, H1 in periodic domains. This is the only one word that we know about the GP3 system about the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. The starting point to obtain our resource is that it's easy to see that this system, the GP3 system, The GP3 system has a solution for high regularity. It's easy to see because for regularity above a dimension half, that is regularity where the solar pay has algebra structure. In box case, in Euclidean domains and the periodic domain, we have solution in a certain time in a certain interband time of existency. Certain interband time consistency with the time depending on the size of the data, which flow locally leaks, and in particular satisfying the blob of alternative. This is the starting point. The idea of the proof of this type of result is simplest because you consider the formulation of the system to study the internal operators, a society of the system, and you use the properties of the The property of the family of operator u lambda. U lambda is given by the multiplication of this connection function by the classical Schrodinger free group. Lambda here is given by this relation of the parametric, of the physical parametric of the system. And then we use the banner fixed point theory to obtain a fixed point of the solution in this over space with high filiality. With high fabularity. And an important observation remarked to obtain this is that it is possible because the non-linearities of the system are polynomial. This is a simple result, but it's important because we have solutions with high regularity that are important solutions to other dynamic properties that we obtain in the world. We obtain the work in this world. Following the same idea of the proof to get highest regularity solution, it's possible to, in this case, assuming that gamma r is positive and lambda is positive, we use the exponential decay of the second equation and the exponential decay of this part of the family of the operator u lambda to get. To get solutions, global solution in HX above the average modularity in the case of initial data is small. In dimension one, especially in dimension one, it's possible to understand the solutions in L2, L2. L2L2 thanks to the trisha heptimetics associated to the unitary growth for the Schrodinger group. And then it's possible to attain solutions in L2, L2 in the space of continuous functions, obviously, but satisfying this extra condition for regularity coming from structured estimates. Coming from strict estimates. In particular, when you consider the physical case R positive and gamma R over P positive, local solution can be extended globally in time. And if the physical parameter satisfies this extra condition, lambda and gamma are positive, we have the potential decay for the solution. So there are two, the total The total electron of resolution can be estimated for the initial data and this exponential decay function in time. Okay, the idea of the proof is the same. We use it trichire estimatic, fixed point process and the property of the polynomial structure of the non-linearity tweet to get. between to get to get a good estimators for the fixed point of the operator. The problem is actually, noted that our turning is in dimension one, but in higher dimension we have a problem with this non-linear term because non-linear term work in dimension one because Trisha estimates. Because trishial estimators help to obtain a good control for the solution that. But in high intimation, we cannot control in good space the evolution of the solution of the system. Another important point in this result is that to extend the local solutions globally in time in the case R positives are In the case r positive and gamma r over p positive, and to get the connection decay with extra conditions lambda and gamma r positive, the k lemma is that we derive it, we obtain an a priori estimate for the total mass, for the functional mass, the mass function for the system given by this sum, the L2 norm square of the plus. The plus this term, and we need to consider gamma over p positive in order to give a positive max. Then, with these assumptions, we prove that the max is positive and is controlled by this term in these four case. These four case. In the first two case, when lambda and gamma are positive, we have the potential decay of the mass. In the case, in the other case, in the other two case, when gamma r is positive and lambda is zero, we have the mass is bonded. And in the case gamma r negative of lambda negative, we have a possible exponential growth for the mass. For the mass. But this affirmative method allows to obtain, to extend the local solution globally in time. Okay. An important remark at this point is that local solution and global solution of timing for system GP3 are connected with traditional system. With the regional system via this in this equality. Solutions eta R for the regional system are given by a translation of the solution B for GP3. Then solutions in H for GP3 are in a translation space for this content by this content. Okay, this is an important. This is an important observation with respect to the evolution of the regional system. Then, so now we explain the other important result about the dynamic of the system. The first result says about the blob box solution infinity or infinity time. infinity time for the system gb3 in box case in oclidean domain or periodic solutions and say that if we take initial data in in source space with high regularity our dimension half then we have the following assertion if the initial database is positive and the parametrical fit And the parametrical physio and the physical parameters are gamma, r, and p satisfy this condition, then the solution remains positive for all time, for all values. Its initial data v0 is negative and the physical parameter satisfy this condition, then the solution B is negative for all values. Moreover, in the case of lambda is negative, and negative and in any one of the case i or 2i we can prove that the the square of the l2 norm of the solution have this lower bound by this exponential function in particular in this case the solution lower at the infinity time in the case of the maximum time of extension of the solution are infinity are infinity. Okay, the idea of the proof of this result is that we define w in this way, exponential of the integration of the solution of the query of the solution u, multiplying by v solution. We can prove that the w satisfy the following differential equation. differential equation and then by integration we have that w sat by this integral equation we observe that the sign of the w is the same sign of the v because this exponential is positive then but the sign of the w is obviously defined by the sign of the initial data v0 or the sign of this combination this quasi of decombionation Combination of this coefficient of the combination of the coefficient, the parameter of the system. Then the facts one implies this A and B of the result. For the last part of the theorem, the starting point is that the derivative in time of the square of the solution. The square of the solution satisfies this equation. Now, to see for this integral term, using the sign of the R combined with the sign of the solution B in the case A or B, we have this below estimated for the derivative in time of the query of the solution u. And then this inequality implies, obviously, this. Obviously, this boundary logo for the for this integral. Okay. The last result that we obtain for GP3 system is regarding the behavior of the The behavior of the H naught of the solution of high regularity in the case of periodic solution in any dimension, but with regularity above dimension half. The theorem says the following. If you consider initial data, V0 and U0 satisfying this property, V0 satis this control. This control, the mean of this zero satisfies this inequality, this above bone, and the L2 node in the domain, in the periodic domain satisfies this inequality, then the evolution of the solution V ensures at least one of the following statements. The maximum time of the solution for in this categories Infinity, or the solution best satisfies this inequality, this lower bound for the evolution of the L infinity norm in this domain. In particular, this assertion implies that the sovereign in Asia. Sober f norm in Hs goes to minus goes to infinity when gamma r going to zero. Okay, and this implies that this implies that this result is interesting from the physical point of view because we established the connection between the rate gamma R with the growth of the solo norm for Nor for in high regularity. The idea of the proof is by contradiction. By contradict, we assume that we have the maximal time infinity and the L infinity norm of the solution be satisfying this control for all time. Using the restriction for the physical parameters, For the physical parameters, and using the assumption for the initial data, we can prove that the evolution of the partial max satisfact this identity for all time. Okay. Then we define the function as sigma. Sigma is the mean of the solution V for all positive time, and we can prove that. And we can prove that the sigma satisfies this differential equation, this non-linear differential equation for all time. Then, by integration and using the hypothesis on the data V0, we obtain that the time of the solution is less than these values, but this value is finitted and positively due to the initial restriction. Do we to the initial restriction for the data? Then this is a contradiction with the maximum time is infinity. Then this finish the fruition. This system has many other properties interesting. From the physical point of view, it is important to know. To know if the system has grown state solution. Actually, this is an open problem. Actually, we know that in some regime of the physical parameter, be a possibility identity, we can prove that there is no existence of the grand state, but not in other cases. Another restriction for this system is that we don't. Is that we don't know a good initial functional in H1. I think that this theorem does establish the design of the solution of evolution of the solution we have to uh in the future to obtain a good uh pseudo Hamiltonian structure for the system. Structure for the system. We do not expect Hamiltonian structure because this system contains the Schrodinger device system, and the Schrodinger device system don't have Hamiltonian structure. Schrodinger device system has a pseudo-Hamiltonian structure and don't have traveling wave solution, only has ground state solution and standing wave solution. This is the work where this result were pushed recently and another physical work important to understand the physical of the copy system presented here. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Madam. Any questions or comments? I became curious about the in the slide 15 you state that the in this case R positive, gamma R over P positive, the local implies global. implies global. Do you know what is the physical meaning of this positive term in the GP3 bottle? From the physical point of view, gamma R over P is the physical case. In particular, the constant P in this world, in this world, we consider where we consider this simply this simple situation the p n p n is the ray are the polar eater are pumping the reserver but it's not content in in the in the in the physical model this function is not content we assume that this content in order to simplify the first approach to understand the evolution of the system but Okay. The physical k corresponding to gamma are positive and p positive, in fact. But mathematically, we obtain the result in box k, gamma negative and p negative besides. The important to get a control of To get a control of the total mass, this quotient should must be positive. And I will ask you next. Okay. Okay. Any other questions? So, in the construction of the solution, you mentioned the difficulty is from the cubic term u square v, right? But in the blow-up result, you have the transform to w which essentially eliminates that tau here? Yes, yes. So, so I guess you could use it also for construction. Construction or of high reposness. Ah, yeah. This blob ox solution equal high regularity. For high regularity, these terms are all well defined. That's right. But to make sense of it, you need just L2 in time and infinity in space. I guess for that, you just need h t over 2 minus 1. Minus one. Get out of the view button. Sorry, I don't understand. So if you use the street cards estimate to make sense of that form, the regularity will be T over 2 minus 1 instead of D over 2, right? If you use the strict cuts. Okay, the strict shots are only to obtain solutions that. only to obtain solution that you take the data in L2L2 and the evolution of the solution are in LL2L2 with extra regularity given by stretcher. By this blobot result, we need to consider data with high regularity, but we can prove the persistence of the solution. Solution with more regularity Solutions with both regularity are in L2L2 orderly and respect the same interval time. No, no, I'm asking the boss in L2. Oh, maybe the few I mean say Philippe, Eluis. Hi. Yours. With knife about your result in L2L2, right? Yes. Do you have a result, a well-posed result in L2L2, right? Yeah, yeah. But in dimension one, only in dimension one. I'm asking the higher dimensions, higher dimensions. Higher dimensions, ah, no, no, no, okay. In higher dimension, the problem, the problem, the problem in higher dimension is high-end dimension is due to this turn, this cubic turn. What I said is, you have the transport to eliminate this current. It's possible. It's possible. It's possible. It's possible. It's possible to eliminate this guy with exponential transformation, but we need to be careful with the regularity of the transformation exponentially. This is the problem. I don't know. I am not sure, but it's possible, maybe. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I have a question. Yeah, I have a question about the polariton. Is the polariton the solitary wave or there are different concepts? Sorry? I'm asking if the polariton, because you say that the model comes from polaritons. So, polariton is the solitary wave, or is another concept? Polariton is solitary wave. No, polariton is. Solitary wave. Now, polariton is not a standing wave. Solution of the equation. Yes, solution of the equation. But this system, as a Schrodinger device system, does not present traveling waste. The Schrodinger device system has a pseudo-Hamiltonian structure. Hamiltonian structure. When you assume that the system has solitary waste, this only occurs for velocity zero. So, only stationaries, stationary waves, only stationary waves or only standing waves. Stationary multiplication by rotations in time. Rotations in time. So I'm coming to understand the system. So if you assume that V is zero, as it stays zero. Sorry, Luis, the song is with noise, with noise. Acta, could you put this line where you write the system again? Ah, okay. So, there is this Gross-Pitovsky exciton possession. How can you relate it to this system? How can you relate the mission on you? I'm having fun, hard time. Because he was talking about the ground state, right? Sending waves. So you can, for that, I think you can construct sending waves. In our work, we consider the function p constant, but the physical case, this function is not contacts. Uh, this function, this is a more complicated case. In the periodic case, we can we can assume that this function is compact sport and do it to the in the periodic domains. The capacity of the domain helps you to get other results, for example, in H1, H1. But But in cleaning space, I think that to obtain more general results for this system with P, with P is no constant, we need to establish some regularity condition for P and localized condition, for example. But for example, the problem of the ground stage with peat With p in function of x is a complicated problem. I know that in some regime of the particle physicist, I can prove that there is no exist ground state. I know, but in other regimes, it's an open problem. Thank you. So let's think Adan again. So we have a both braided now. We're resuming. Yes, I know 10 minutes.
