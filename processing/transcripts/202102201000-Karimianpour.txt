Dissection is a technique that is used all over mathematics. It is a useful technique that we use. The topic is very rich as a resource for math circles or undergrad projects or even grad projects. My goal for today's workshop is to show you how I use this topic to put together This topic to put together a Matt Circle activity that is accessible to everyone with a piece of paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. And we don't require any more than elementary geometry, just congruence of triangles. And that's all we require mathematically. Although the topic is rich and it can be looked at from different angles and with different or more advanced. Different or more advanced mathematical tools, but for today's session, we'll just stay at the beginning. And also, I hope that towards the end, we have time to hear from you and hear from your suggestion of rich topics that can be used for math circle purposes. Okay, so let's Let's, as an icebreaker, start with a simple question. I give you a triangle, and we want to find area at this triangle. What would be your approach? How would you find area at this triangle? There's a few of us here, so feel free to unmute yourself if you. It depends on what you tell us about the triangle. Well, I. Well, I just share what I have on the slide with you. What would you do? I think I would start labeling things, assigning names to sides and heights that I am familiar with, and then come up with some algebra to ruin the picture. Sure. What else? What else? Measure some side lengths. Yeah, you might have a ruler in hand. Okay, yeah, that might come in handy. If you have a grid, like on graph paper, you can count the area. That's right. That's right. So that would come in handy too. Well, cut it in pieces. Well, cut it in pieces. Cut it in pieces. Yes, that's the one I'm waiting for. Cut it into pieces. So there are multiple ways of cutting it into pieces into other shapes whose area you might know. So for instance, if I know how to find the area of a parallelogram, maybe I can cut this little triangle on the top and translate it down and get myself a parallelogram. Of a parallelogram, and then sit down and wonder how to find an area of a parallelogram. But why does this work? Why is it that I can cut a region, let's say a triangle, into pieces, and it's guaranteed that whatever shape I make with it has the same area. Why is this a legit move? Congruency? Congruency congruency of triangles or congruency of polygons. Yes, that is a good answer. And we're going to talk about polygons. We're going to talk about specifically polygons. So let me just make sure that we all have the same understanding of what a polygon is. For me, for the purposes of this session, I don't want Of this session, I don't want my polygons to cross themselves and I don't want them to have two collinear intersecting edges. So the pictures in the bottom are good polygons for me to work with. And eventually soon we're going to limit ourselves to convex polygons. And back to my question, why is it that it is legit to cut up my triangle into a To cut up my triangle into a parallelogram. The rationale behind that is that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of the pieces we cut into. And then naturally, if you use those pieces to put together to get another region, that have the same area, that new region will have the same area. And the reason is really how we understand area. I put here I put here the axiomatic definition of area that I took from Roots to Research by Sally and Sally. It looked a lot better resolution-wise on my screen, but it didn't translate well on PDF, so I apologize for that. Yes, so I'm showing you this slide. This is how we understand area. Area is a function. It assigns a positive number to A positive number to each polygon, P being the set of all polygons on the plane. And what I'm really using here is the fact that area is additive. If I have polygons whose interior are disjoint, the area of the shape that I build with those polygons adds up. Now, the reason I'm showing you this axiomatic definition of area is that Is that if you look at the fourth axiom, you might see the fourth axiom stated differently. So sometimes we put for the fourth axiom, we say that the area of a square with edges of length A is A square. And it is a very nice problem for another math circle session. We're not going to think about it. We're not going to look at it this time. Look at it this time, but uh, it turns out that well, we can prove that using axiom one to four, and the proof is not trivial at all, it uses the uh the fact that rational numbers are dense in real numbers. So that's just just one interesting question that will build up its own math circle session. Anyway, so the answer to our question is right in the definition of area and how we understand area. Now, let me just build up. Now, let me just build up some language that we're going to use for the rest of this session. Oh, and by the way, using that note, using those four axioms, we can find the area of the familiar shapes that we know, including the triangle. Now, as for the language, this process of dissecting a polygon into Into polygon pieces and reassembling the pieces into a new polygon is a relation on the set of all polygons. So this process that I called congruence by a dissection is a relation on the set of all polygons. Well, this relation is a reflective relation. Every polygon is in really Every polygon is in relation with itself. It is symmetric, just you can reverse the process. But the transitivity, the transitive property is not that friendly. I would like to have a transitive relation, and that's why from now on, we will limit ourselves to dissecting into convex polygons. So we'll remedy this problem of transitive property. Transitive property, or we would like to have transitive property by instead of dissecting a polygon into any polygon pieces, we dissect it into convex polygons. And if two polygons are in relation with each other through dissection via convex polygon, I'll call them to be Caesar equivalent. So that's my language. So from now on, we'll talk about Caesar equivalency. Talk about Caesar equivalency, and that means you can take your polygon, you can cut it into pieces, and each piece is a convex polygon. You don't need to start with a convex polygon, but each piece that you cut into is a convex polygon, and you reassemble your pieces to get another polygon. The axiom of area tells us that when we have two Caesar equivalent polygon, they have the same area. The same area. Now, the question we're going to think about is that what if I give you two polygons of the same area? Could you start with the first one and cut it into convex polygon pieces, rearrange the pieces, and get the second one? Are these two polygons Caesar equivalent? Okay. Okay, so that was a little introduction of what we're going to do the rest of the session. Now, let me start the hands-on part of our workshop. So we're going to answer this question. This is a question asked in, it was answered in early 19th century. And we're going to start by thinking about a very simple case. Very simple case. I will give you a triangle, or I will give you two triangles of the same area, and I'll ask you if you can cut one into pieces and reassemble it to the other. The first step is to start with your triangle and see if you can cut it into pieces and reassemble it into a rectangle. Now, I suggest that you all get yourself That you all get yourself a piece of paper, and if you have a scissor, get yourself a scissor or a ruler. That'll do. Now, the way we do it, we are about 15 people or 13 workshop participants here. Maybe we can go into two or three groups. And we're going to work on this problem together. I am going to share a link with you here that we use to work on this problem. So I just put a link in the chat, and if you open that link, you will see. You will see a Google Document page. Please just click on the left on the show document content. And after you're in a breakout room, you want to click on the group you end up in. And we're going to start doing the activity one. Activity one is that you're given a triangle and Triangle, and you're asked to draw the triangle on a piece of paper that you have and cut it into pieces into a rectangle and rearrange the pieces into a rectangle. So, we're going to have about five minutes to think about this problem. So, does everyone have the link? Does the link to the Google Doc works for everyone? Yes. Okay. So, I'll ask Zora to please put us into groups. Please put us into groups. Thank you so much. So, once you're in the group, please click on the group number. There is also a Jamboard if you want to share your work with your other group members. All right, it seems that we're back here. At least one of the groups are back. Which group were you in? were you in? I was in group four. You were in group four. Okay, let's see what you have here. Okay, all right, that sounds good. I forgot to tell everyone that there is a there is a Jamboard for each group that you can go to and share your drawing with others. Okay, so we're still We're still waiting for one more group to come back. Okay, I think I believe we are all back here. So I apologize for the waiting. We were done pretty quickly in group three. And one thing I forgot to tell everyone is that there is a Jamboard link here under each group that you can use to share your construction with your group. Share your construction with your group member. Now, let's go back to our next step. So, that was our first step. Now, we know that every triangle can be dissected into or is Caesar equivalent to a square. Our next step is a lot more interesting, and that is our activity two. And this is well, this is this is my idea for Having a triangle Caesar equivalent to a rectangle, and I believe everybody has that by now. The next step is: we're going to start with our rectangle and show that it is Caesar equivalent to a square. So, that is our activity two that we can now go ahead and start doing. Zori, can we go to the same break? Zori, can we go to the same breakout room for the activity too? I think you're mute. Do you want me just to do now? So going through the... Yeah, if you have the same breakout rooms open, I just want to start looking at the activity too. So everybody under their group have the activity too, and you can share your work in the Jamboard. And the purpose. Board and the purpose is to cut this rectangle into a square. So I can open the very cut rooms one more time. Hopefully this is going to be the same people again. Open all things. Yes, we're going to, I think we're going to the same one. So we'll come back. We'll come back immediately after you're done. We had a great lengthy discussion in group three and Group three, and so the idea is: I gave you the hint here. It took us quite a bit of time, we're still not done, but we'll end up seeing that the triangle GZF and YBC are congruent, and GY, there's no name here. That's my bad. GY, no name, and ZB, no name are congruent. And from there, you can cut the pieces. From there, you can cut the pieces of your square, of your rectangle into a square. We are running out of time, so I just want a little rush here to finish the discussion. And so so far, if we believe that we can cut our rectangle into a square of side square root of the area of the triangle you started with, you start with a triangle and the area is A. And the area is A, you cut it into a rectangle, and you cut that into a square of area A, and you can do the same thing with the other triangle of the same area. So that tells you any two triangles of the same area are Caesar equivalent. And how do I go from here to the next step? Well, you want to say this about any polygon. Triangulate your polygon. And you go through this process. And you go through this process for every single triangle. Well, I was looking around to find a nice visualization for this problem, and I found this one. I put the link here on the slide, and I can also share it on the screen. So they have found this beautiful visualization. The method is slightly different from what we did. But just a second, I'll share it with you. All right. So this is beautiful code written by Dima Smirnov. I also put the link into the Google document for us. You can start with any polygon you want, any two polygons. Any two polygons and the code first make sure that they have the same area and the method is slightly different here. They're cutting each triangle into rectangles of a fixed side and then go through the process backward to put it back on the second polygon. Second party there we go. So I put a link to this in the Google document. Now we are one minute over time, so I won't take more time here, just that I wish we had more time to talk about, to discuss the To discuss the topics that you think would be worthy of a Matt Circle session. There is a page at the very end of our Google document. Do you have any Matt Circle ideas to share? If you have any idea, I'll ask you, I invite you to share your idea in the end of that document and I will give that to organizers to share to everyone else. Thank you so much, Muchamilio. Please feel free. Tamil, please feel free to ask questions or send comments to Tamil, and you can also use a Slack channel for further discussions. Thanks again. Thank you for coming to this session. Well, can I ask a question? So, have you done it in a mass circle and how it can you tell about the experience, how your mass circle students, how Math Circle students, how they reacted and what they were doing, and what were your successes and difficulties? So I didn't do Math Circle in online setting yet. I will be doing that in a month. So that was this, this setup was what I am hoping to have in my Matt Circle online session, having a Google document and a Jamboard shared with my groups. But I have Um, but I have I have worked with this topic, this exact topic, uh, back two years ago in a um more of a high school reach out activities. It wasn't the traditional math circle, it was an activity for high school students in a less privileged area. And uh, my experience was very nice. Students, uh, high school students are not very strong with uh Strong with geometry. They don't learn enough geometry in high school. So there was a little bit of hiccup with deciding triangles being congruent. But other than that, I found this pretty accessible, especially when you ask them to cut pieces of paper into pieces and check that physically, check that it works physically. Physically, are there other quick questions that we can have from Camilia? Our next session, the mini course, starts a few minutes, 11 o'clock, mountain time. If there's no more question, you can enjoy a little break.
