Okay, thank you. So thank you for the invitation. I'm sorry I'm not there in person. I'm going to talk about causality constraints in I would say a proto QFT, a sort of simplified version. The simplified version from an operational perspective. And I'm going to use pen and paper, so I hope that works for people. If you have questions, please interrupt. And if you're in the room itself, maybe speak loudly because the microphone is very quiet. Okay, so first of all, let's So, first of all, let's imagine a situation where we have a bunch of qubits, and some of them are moving from left to right. So, here they are. And some of them are moving from right to left. Okay, and I'm just going to draw, imagine this grid is actually much bigger than I've drawn. I'm just drawing part of it. And everywhere you have two of these. everywhere you have two of these qubits intersecting every vertex in this in this diagram here corresponds to a so anything like this corresponds to an operation okay this is a two qubit in two qubit out quantum operation and you can associate with these operations you can associate Operations you can associate operators. So I'm thinking in terms of the operator tensor framework, which I've developed, but there's many other frameworks out there that do the same thing. And now, if you have two operations and you join them together like this, and you And you associate an operator with each of these, A, B, then where you have this wire that connects the two operations, you take the partial trace. I should say the operator that's associated with one of these operations is something that acts on a Hilbert space. Which is determined by the labels on the legs of this operation. So, associated with each leg, there is a Hilbert space, and then you take the tensor product of all those Hilbert spaces, and then this operator acts on that Hilbert space. So, if you look in here, we have this physical situation with the qubits, and then you can associate with each of these vertices an operator, and then. Operator and then these operators where they're connected, you have the partial trace. Okay, so one thing you can do now is you can draw arbitrary shaped regions. So here's an arbitrary shaped region where you cut through the wires, not through the vertices. There we are, there's an example of an arbitrary. There we are. There's an example of an arbitrary shaped region. And associated with this is one big, is one operator. Let's call that A now. This region here has an operator associated with it. And the Hilbert space associated with this operator is the one left by all the legs that stick out of the region. Okay. And then Okay, so that's a sort of motivating situation. Now you can imagine taking some kind of limit where you have more and more qubits and you ultimately approach some kind of continuum. And I don't want to talk about the mathematics of how that's possible. I'm just going to assume it works. So now you have a region. Okay, I'm not able to reproduce exactly. Okay, not able to reproduce exactly the same shape as before. You get some region here, and it has an operator associated with it. And then the Hilbert space is attached to this boundary. So there's a Hilbert space attached to this boundary. And of course, this is very reminiscent of Robert Urkel's general boundary formulation. General boundary formulation and also his, and even more reminiscent of his positive formulation. He'll be speaking about that in the next talk. So for me, this is motivated from this kind of circuit picture and imagining taking a limit. Now, if you look at this boundary, look at different sections of this boundary here in this discrete case, and you'll see that as you sort of And you'll see that as you sort of go along, there are places, well, let's see, there are places up here on the boundary where there are just outputs. So here, there's just wires coming out along this part of the boundary. Okay, so here, just outputs. And that will be the same in this continuous limit if you look at, say, this part of the boundary here. This would have just outputs. And then there's places where there's just inputs. So, here, for example, if you look along here, you can see there's just inputs. And that would be like here, it'd be just inputs. And then there's places where there's a mixture of inputs and outputs, like here. So the places where there's just outputs. Where they're just outputs are sorry, I do forget to time myself to keep track of where I am. Okay. The places where there's just outputs, just just, sorry, the places where there's just inputs would be sort of places which have a space-like surface associated with them where you only have where it's. Have where the normal is to the past. And then places where there's just inputs would be where there's a space-like hypersurface, where the normal is to the future. And the places where you get a mixture of inputs and outputs, this would be something like this, would be where you have the surface is time-like, and so the normal is space-like. And so in these places, you have a mixture. So the Hilbert space. Mixture. So the Hilbert space generally will, if you, along a part of this boundary, will be a tensor product of input and output. So here, for example, you have a tensor product of input and output. So let's write that as something like that. Okay, as you go around here. Okay, as you go around here. So, this structure, this structure here, the input-output structure here relates to this grid, which provides a kind of causal structure background. In the continuous case, you can imagine that there is some background metric, and that background metric tells you what kind of causal structure you have as you go around the boundary. Now, just to develop a little bit of Now, just to develop a little bit of notation, so imagine we have some surface, some general region with a boundary. We can divide the boundary up into different bits. Here's just an example where I've divided it up into two bits. Okay. So the bits this bit here I'm going to call that um this this bit here I'll call D from here. This bit I'll call A. This bit I'll call A. And now we can associate with this, we can just write this diagrammatically like this. We can say the operator associated with this is just represented by a circle that has an input A and an output B. And I have a bit more to say about what I mean by inputs and outputs here. And the key point is. The key point is this arrow is just conventional. Strictly speaking, B has a positive output part and a negative input part. So as I said earlier, if you're in a region like this, you have inputs and outputs. So you can regard this arrow here as comprising of an output part, which is B plus, and an input part, which is B minus. Input path, which is B minus. As a matter of notational convention, if the arrow is pointing the other direction, then it's kind of the other way around. Sorry, this should be minus. So here, the A plus part is in the direction of the arrow, so that's actually an input, and the A minus part is an output. So the convention is that the plus part is in the direction of the arrow, and the minus. In the direction of the arrow, and the minus part is against the direction of the arrow. That convention is useful when you join these things together and you want to take the partial trace over input-output matching pairs. Okay. And then in the case like this, the total Hilbert space, you can write it like this: B Cross A, or you can expand it out more as B plus B minus. Okay, so that's because we're done there. So I've just expanded it out more. Okay. So that's the sort of setup I'm considering. So now let me. So now let me raise the question I want to ask. And the question is: if you have a region like this and you associate an operator with it in the way that I've described, so you have some operator associated with this region, then you want to constrain this operator that you associate with this region in such a way that if you send some input into one part of the region, Input into one part of the region, say here, then you want to be careful. Imagine this is a light cone. You want to be careful that there's no influence coming out at a different part of the boundary over here, say, which is space-like separated from this bit. Okay. So if I send some information in here, I want to have conditions on this operator so that no information can come out over here. Okay. And the question is, how do we impose that kind of constraint? That kind of constraint. This question is related to a question raised a long time ago by Raphael Sorkin. And the question has gotten attention recently in the algebraic quantum field theory community. And in particular, there's a paper by Ian Jubs. Talking about that. And if instead you just want to watch an online talk, you can find a talk on Purser that he gave on this subject. And then also, I wrote a paper on this in the context that I'm speaking about at the moment. It was in an appendix to a paper I wrote a few. It was in an appendix to a paper I wrote a few years ago, and I think I cited that paper in the abstract for this talk. Okay, so how do we go about answering this question? And the approach I want to take is to use what's called the quantum combs framework. So, quantum comes. So, well, I've already told you what an operation is. This is this, something like this. We could have more wires going in and out, but you can always collect them. And out, but you can always collect those wires together and represent them by a single wire. And then here's a slightly more general object that you can consider. So this is an object which has a gap here where you can put an object like this. Then you can also have some preparation going in and you can make some measurement at the end. So this is an object where it's a bit more general than. It's a bit more general than just an operation like this. And it can keep going, you can consider more and more teeth on these combs like this. Okay. And now, okay, just these gone. You can have as many teeth as you want. And so now. And so now the question is: if I associate operators with these objects, with these combs, then what are the constraints on those operators? So, this problem was considered by Kirubella, Dariano, and Perinotti and so I'll And so I'll describe how their solution works. And the constraints on these operators follow from two things: they follow from wanting the probabilities to be greater than zero, and also from not wanting to be able to send information backwards in time, which is the causality constraint. Okay. So, first of all, let me start by talking about what this guy has called the deterministic effect. So, this is an effect that has only an input. Okay, the wires in this square box, in this boxes, in these diagrams that have just boxes rather than circles, any wire coming in from the bottom is coming in from the past. Bottom is coming in from the past, and any wire going out from the top is coming out from the future. Okay, so this has only an input, and I want to consider what they call the deterministic effect. This is the same thing that Robert Urkel calls the non-selective effect. And I think that's actually a better name, but I'm going to stick with deterministic. What it means is if this box has outcomes, you ignore them. You don't look to see what the outcome is. So you're basically tracing over all the possible outcomes. And actually, this thing does correspond to the trace in quantum theory. So you have a box and incomes comes in here, and then you don't care what happens. You ignore whatever happens afterwards. Okay. You could imagine. You could imagine having two of these boxes that you got, you had different apparatuses, so the same kind of system comes in, say for A, A could be an electron, for example. But the box itself is something different. So it could, for example, be a Stern-Golach measurement, but the two ones correspond to Stern-Golach oriented at different angles. So operationally, there's Angles. So operationally, these things are different, but the causality constraint says that the mathematical objects associated with these objects, the operators associated with them, have to be equal. A different way of putting that is that the deterministic effect There's only one way to ignore the future. Now, let me explain why that corresponds to not being able to send information back in time. So, imagine you have an experiment like this. So, I have some preparation, some transformation, and on this transformation, I also have an outcome, maybe a particular light flashes, and then I have a deterministic effect. Effect here. Okay. And I'm going to calculate the probability that I see this light flashing. Well, I could do the same thing, calculate the probability instead, where I have the same thing here, but the deterministic effect is a different one. You get it by having a different apparatus and ignoring the outcome and that different apparatus. So, for example, a different spin measurement. Different spin measurement. Okay, so this is debt, this is debt prime. But, and I'm interested in the probability of seeing a particular outcome here. But these two probabilities should be the same if it's impossible to signal backwards in time. Okay, because if I'm ignoring the future, let's imagine these two things were different. That would mean that the probability of this outcome depends on whether I have one apparatus in the future or a different. One apparatus in the future or a different apparatus in the future. Okay, so the fact that the probability should not depend on that means that the effect associated with deterministic case is unique. And then there's one more thing you can say is if you consider a debt effect that has two incomes. Two incomes. Well, one way to realize that is just to do a debt effect separately. I didn't need the error. Sorry. On each of the two systems separately. Okay. And so, and that's one way to realize this, but since the And that's one way to realize this, but since the debt effect is unique, that means that this is an equation. It doesn't matter. If you can realize it like this, then any other debt effect, however realized, is equal to this case where you do it separately on the two systems. Okay. So once you've got this idea of the deterministic effect being unique, you can use it to impose recursive conditions on a quantum comb. So let's see, do I have room down here? Yeah, I can start. I can start. Um, yeah, I can start. I can start down here. Um, so um, let's consider um simplest quantum comb, which is just the operation. And now we're going to put a debt effect after it. Okay. And let's consider the case where this is the deterministic, this operation itself is deterministic, so it has no outcomes associated with it. Okay, so it's not selective, you're not, you're ignoring what happens here. Selective, you're not, you're ignoring what happens here. Well, then you can see this block is just another way of realizing this debt effect. So, this is A, this is B, this is just the deterministic effect on this income. Okay, so here you have equality. There's another property that you have, which is that the debt effect, sorry, which is, well, sorry. Which is any operator like this has to be has to, if you associate an operator with this, it has to have a certain positivity condition. So I don't want to get sidetracked into what this positivity condition is, but it guarantees that the probabilities that you calculate are always greater than or equal to zero. The t can correspond to partial transpose. To partial transpose. You take the partial transpose over the Hilbert space associated with either the input or the output. It doesn't matter which one you do. So there's a certain positivity condition. And once you have this positivity condition, if you take this equation here, well, we know that any deterministic effect, sorry, any deterministic operation like this is equal to a sum of non-deterministic operations, so ones that do have outcomes. So, ones that do have outcomes. And we can use that to show this equation. Okay. So, I'm just mentioning this. If you understand the Yes, if you understand the deterministic combs, then you can always understand the non-deterministic combs, the selective combs. So I'm just going to focus on the deterministic case because they're simpler. And then the non-deterministic case follows, but I won't talk about that. So, what happens if you have a comb like this, the next one up? What are the conditions on this? Well, there's two conditions. One of the conditions is the positivity condition, which basically says if I take this. Basically, says if I take this, I just get an operator which acts on the Hilbert space associated with the inputs and the outputs, and that operator has to have the same positivity condition I talked about before. And then the second condition is more interesting. This is the condition that follows from the causality constraint. So, let me draw it again. So, what I'm going to do is put on the end here a deterministic effect. And I'm going to assume that this itself is deterministic. Like I said, if you understand the deterministic quantum combs, then you can understand the non-deterministic ones, the selective ones. Okay. Well, we can look at Well, we can look at this and we can see that we can simplify it. Well, first of all, let's write it down like this. We're going to assume that this comb can be represented by a natural circuit which has a notion of time in it. So let me draw that. So now I'm assuming this deterministic comb, this very simple case, can be represented by this. And since this comb is deterministic, that means that each of these two boxes have to be deterministic. The next thing I can do is I can just absorb. In fact, what the thing I have here is just a way of realizing the deterministic effect on these two wires. So that's the same as this and then finally, well not. And then finally, well, actually, not quite finally, next step. This is a deterministic effect that has two inputs, so I can just factor it like this. And then finally, I can absorb this box into here, and I have this. Sorry, something has gone wrong here. Yeah, I've missed a wire here there. Okay. Just will that make that up a bit. Okay, so I took it, I took the deterministic. I took it I took the deterministic comb, I put a box, a deterministic box on the end, I used the uniqueness of the deterministic effect to get to this. I used the fact that the deterministic effect factorizes because it's unique to get to this. I absorbed this box into here and now I have this. And this is a condition on these quantum combs. So the condition is that if you So, the condition is that if you hit this quantum comb with the terminalistic box, it has to factor out in this way. It's quite a strong condition. Okay, well, we can keep doing this. So let me show you one more iteration. We can now do it on the On the um let's take the um the comb that has another tooth. Okay, well we have um we have the positivity condition I mentioned before. So this thing, if you bring all the strands or the wires to the top and bottom, this thing has to have this positivity condition. And then the other thing we can do is we can we can We can hit it, so that's one condition. The other thing we can do is hit it with the deterministic box. So let me go through those, that step. I'm going to hit it with deterministic box. I'm going to assume that this thing itself, this whole thing is deterministic. Okay, well, when you do that, you well, next thing. Well, next thing you can do is imagine. I'm going to imagine there's a sort of a, I'm going to call it a space-like hypersurface. I can imagine that I can represent this in a sensible way where time flows forward like so. Okay. And now I'm going to go through the same steps I did before. I think you'll see basically this goes into here, this thing characterizes, one of those goes into here. What you get is this condition. You get that condition. So, what's interesting is if you start off with a comb that has three teeth on it, then you end up getting a condition for a comb that has two teeth. And then we know a condition for a comb that has two teeth, which is the one I just showed you, which ends up going to a comb that has just one tooth. And then we know the condition for a comb. And then we know the condition for a comb that has only one tooth, which is this condition. So you get these recursive conditions. If you start off with n teeth, you end up getting a condition on a comb that has n minus 1 teeth. So this is what's beautiful about the quantum comb approach in the paper by Giulio Kirabella et al. Okay. There's another thing you can do, which I don't think they mention in their paper, but it's useful for our purposes, which is: I'm going to call this the sort of the straight to condition. You could take a three-tooth comb like this, or a comb that has many teeth, even. A comb that has many teeth, even four or five. I'm interested in the general case. But I'll just illustrate it with three teeth. And what you can do is you can hit it with a datomistic effect here and also with a datumistic effect here. Okay. And when you do that, you end up getting a condition. Imagine this is. You end up getting a condition that You end up getting a condition that is which is like that. Hope you can see this. So, what we've done is we've got deterministic effects up to a certain point. We could have had more teeth, in which case the thing left here would have had more teeth. Mortif. Okay. So this condition in some sense goes in a few layers straight away. Okay. So ignoring for a moment this straight two condition, one thing they show in their paper is that the positivity condition and then the recursive conditions that I told you about here are. Here are necessary and sufficient in certain senses. So they're necessary conditions for no signaling backwards in time. Basically, what they mean by that is necessary conditions for there to exist this, what they call a network model, one, which is a time-forward model. And they're actually also sufficient. If these conditions are satisfied, then you can always realize the content. Then you can always realize the quantum comb by a network where you represent the thing flowing forward in time. Okay. Okay, so that was in some sense a long detour. I want to come back now to the situation I started with. So imagine you have some arbitrary region like this, and you Like this, and you have an operator associated with this, and you want to know what are the conditions on operations. Well, what you can do is you can foliate it with space-like hypersurfaces. And now, if you look at this, you'll see that, well, if this one is sufficiently, if this one is If this one is sufficiently, depending on the space-time thing, this thing would have just outputs. This one would just have the inputs. Maybe the way I've drawn it isn't very good. I should have cut this wire a bit higher. But along here, where you've got surfaces that are time-like, you'll have both inputs and outputs. Same is true here. And so this is just like. And so this is just like the quantum comb. Okay, not control of it. So uh each of these so this this corresponds to here, this output here is this. This here has inputs and outputs just like here. Here has inputs and outputs just like here. This one has these inputs and outputs, and so on, all the way through. So we see that if we put a finite number of hypersurfaces down, we get a quantum comb with this teeth. There's a few senses in which the quantum comb is discrete, where this situation isn't discrete. First of all, the quantum combs have a finite number of teeth, and that's important because And that's important because you want to use this recursive technique and you want it to terminate at some point. And secondly, the quantum combs are considered normally for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, whereas here you would have infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. I think the second condition isn't such a problem, it's a matter of then finding a measure associated with the deterministic effects. I don't think I'll have time to talk about that. Okay. Okay. So then what are the conditions on these operators such that we have causality? Of course, I should point out, if this is a hypersurface, if we have an input here, we shouldn't be able to get, we have some information coming in here, it shouldn't be able to come out here. Because if we impose these conditions, then we stop backwards causality. Okay, so one way to think about this is that if you have a foliation of this, then you'll get certain hypersurfaces. Any given hypersurface could appear in lots of different foliations. But if you impose what I call the go-to conditions for a given hypersurface, so for this one, for example, then you get the same condition you would have gotten just by working harder. And so it's enough. And so it's enough to impose the condition for every hypersurface. So rather than considering sets of hypersurfaces, it's enough to impose this condition for every hypersurface individually. So let's consider that. So let's take the region and now draw some arbitrary hypersurface. And now what I want to do is hit this. So first of all, I want this operator to be positive in the sense I was talking about before. In the sense I was talking about before, have this T positivity condition. Secondly, I want it to be that if I hit this with the deterministic effect on the outputs, I'm going to try and represent this diagrammatically like this. This is the best sort of diagrammatic notation I could find. Because remember, as you go along here, you have inputs and outputs, and I just want to hit it with the deterministic effect on the outputs. Then the thing I now get, well, I want to represent it, since this is a space-like hyper surface, I'm assuming that I can split it up and I just have now a Have now a this and if this condition I can go through the same steps as before, which I'm going to do it in a slightly different notation because it gets cumbersome in this notation. And this gives us the condition that we want. The condition that we want. So let me now do this in a slightly different notation. I think I can do it over here. So I'm going to represent this operation like this. And now I'm going to cut it in half by a hypersurface. And I'm going to separate out the B plus and the B minus. And then I want to hit it, just bring it down, I want to hit the B plus. Let's bring it down. I want to hit the B plus part with a, this is hard to write, but I want to hit it with a deterministic only on the plus part. So a deterministic operation only on the plus part. That leaves the minus part unaffected. So that goes over here. And now I can manipulate this using similar steps to before. So, this deterministic effect gets absorbed in here, but then it factorizes because I have two inputs. This B minus is actually an input because the minus tells you it's going against the arrow. Look at this, and then finally, look at this, which is the same condition I had before in the quantum combs, but now it's applying to this sort of general circumstance. And so that is a necessary condition for locality. If this condition is true, then for every hypersurface, then you won't be able to send information backwards in time using this approach. So I think I've pretty much run out of time. There's a problem here, which is to sort of show that it's a sufficient condition that, in some sense, you can always build a quantum. Some sense you can always build a quantum network if these conditions are true for all hypersurfaces, and that's a condition I haven't solved. And it's kind of tricky because you're dealing with the continuous case rather than the finite-dimensional Hilbert space case. Okay, I'll stop there. Thank you, Lucian. Thank you. We have a little bit of time for a few questions, I think. Let me just have a look at the online participants if anyone is ready to hand. Yes, okay. So this is just a question asking if the interpretation of the realistic boxes is that there are Is that they are in the field view and not the filter you can sorry I really can't hear the question at all maybe hello hello okay so this is just the interpretation of this uh deterministic box that is that they are in the future and in the future you are not um are just one measurement. One measurement, but you assume that there are a measurement rich enough that measures everything, and that's why the distinction that you had of the get and get prime didn't matter. They were equivalent because both of them were measuring everything. Is that what you are thinking or not? Yeah, so they're both. At some point, the sound got louder just at the end of your question. Question. Yeah, because in both cases, the deterministic effect corresponds to ignoring the future. Basically, regardless of which experiment you do, you're ignoring the future. And that's why you want to have it unique. Just conversely, the deterministic preparation is not unique because you imagine that you can make different preparations in the past and those things can be different. You can prepare, you know, a spin. You can prepare a spin-up, for example, along the x-direction or along the z direction. But in the reverse time direction, it's not possible. There's only one deterministic effect that you can do. It's actually a very interesting subject. If you start to look at time-symmetric quantum theory, I have a paper on this, then things change. I have a little comment, but you do want to go back to the comments. No question. Yep, go ahead. Okay, I have a little comment. I was very interested to hear your thoughts on this and to see that you're thinking about this because I also spent quite some time in the past on this question. Actually, in this paper that we have with Nicolas Ser, which is called Operational Quantum Theory Without Predefined Time, which basically reconstructs in some sense the positive formalism, is we kind of describe this question about. We cannot describe this question about in a way about the fact that you have these ingoing and outgoing wires, and the question of how maybe you could reconstruct the causal structure, provided that it exists from the correlations on the boundary, essentially. My personal thoughts are that actually I immediately ran into some problems with this. And I think that one could indeed formulate these necessary conditions, but for necessary and sufficient conditions, I think this is quite challenging without additional. Is quite challenging without additional assumptions. One could easily come up with examples of abstract transformations in regions which could, for instance, allow interpretation, causal interpretations in different non-equivalent ways. Okay, yeah, I mean I believe you, and I think it is it is it is non-trivial the the sufficiency part of uh part of this problem. Um Part of this problem. And I mean, just just for for me, like the in in the paper by Kirabella et al., they they use a kind of Steins version of the Steinsprink extension theorem. And everything relies on having a discrete and finite situation. And so it would be very tricky to put strong. So, bootstrap tap into a proof. So, that's interesting. Without any prior assumption about anything like this, distinction between plus and minus, it's quite difficult because if you only use the deterministic effect, then I think one could, in principle, maybe miss some possibilities for signaling that might happen, then maybe only activate it provided you prepare, let's say, in the past boundary, something that's not the maximal limit. But if you don't know. The maximum, but if you don't know where the path boundary is, it's a little difficult to formulate that condition. Okay, not sure I fully understand what you're saying there, but maybe you can tell me offline. Yes, I could tell offline. But essentially, if one wants signaling, basically, or no signaling constraints, sometimes signaling could between certain regions could only be activated provided that you prepare something in the past in the right state. But if you prepare In the right state, but if you prepare it in the maximally mixed state, maybe you can kind of if you don't know actually only what is passed, which part of the boundary is passed or oriented, it's a little ambiguous how to express that. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I think it's quite challenging actually. Okay, I mean, I feel like here, because you have this separation into ingoing and outgoing Hilbert spaces, one should be able to do that satisfactorily. Satisfactory. I mean, um, and so certainly in in the quantum combs approach, where everything is finite, it it's all dealt with very well. Um yeah. Um maybe I'm a bit more optimistic, but uh but I haven't done it, that's for sure. The orientation then, yeah. I was thinking more in the completely time-oblivious approach. Oh, yeah, okay. In the time-oblivious case, then you don't have any structure to use, and then you're kind of a bit more stuck. Stock. I wondered if the time-symmetric kind of condition. So here I used time-forward conditions for causality. So you can't signal into the past. I want to solve this problem also in the time-symmetric case. And that might be easier. That might be more suitable to the time-oblivious situation as well. I don't know. Anybody else? A very quick one? Or go on to Robert Joe? Rafael has a question. Raphael has a question, but uh, we did not see that, so maybe I raised my hand a second. I think we have a little bit of uh yes, uh, Rafael, maybe you can, you can, uh, you can go ahead and maybe we can. Yeah, I just kind of combined question. One is, if you have the complete solution in this comb case, what is it that obstructs you from having, is it just technicalities from having the system? Just technicalities from having the sufficient condition in the continuum case? It's just a question of how to take the limit, or is there something more to it? Yeah, my hope is that it's just technical problems, but since I haven't done it yet, it's possible something more fundamental will come up. I mean, here's one idea that here's one sort of thing that might make it fundamental. Like in the in the, if you have conformal symmetry, if you have a causal diamond, then Then you have the same conditions on this that you have on a smaller causal diamond. Nothing really changes. And that's true all the way down to a smaller causal diamond as you want. And it doesn't seem like anything in the quantum combs formalism is seeing that. So I wonder if there's some subtleties. You know, you want to be sure that information that comes into your causal diamond here doesn't end up leaving over here. And so there may be more subtleties than I'm aware of. Than I'm aware of. That's all the intuition I have on this. I see. I mean, that's related actually to the other second part of the question, which was would it become any simpler if you considered a shape like one of these diamonds which has null boundaries, or you could flatten it out so it looked like a sort of lens, a flat glass lens or something like that. That glass lens or something like that. So it has only a future boundary and a past boundary. Yeah, it might do. Yeah, I was hopeful. That was one thing I was thinking about. And you would get consistent, you get kind of self-consistency conditions. Like this would have to be, there'd have to be a relationship. If you have this conformal symmetry, then there'd have to be a relationship between this one and anyone that's smaller. And that would be an extra consistency condition that you could use in addition to the quantum cone conditions. So that might help you get there. Quick. Get there quite more quickly. And it wouldn't have some analog in the discrete case or the quantum column case. I mean, looking with the discrete case, when you shrink, you're really, yeah, you're changing the situation. So, yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe one could do that. Maybe one could think of an algorithm or something like that. Okay. One other question I wanted to ask is a very general question. I mean, here you're I mean, here you're saying your punchline is that it's a necessary and sufficient condition for having, I think you called it a quantum circuit. I forget what you called it.
