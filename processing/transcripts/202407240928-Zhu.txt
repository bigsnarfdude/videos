I'm in trail for the ICML and I cannot show up in person. And it's a great conference. I love to listen to many of the great talks. And actually, because I used to try to present something on the EHY data analysis, I think I saw the most audience is basically on genetic side. I just talked about something. And I gave the talk to a group of biologists last month. A group of biologists last month and basically looking for some collaborations on that. And actually, I want to talk about something related to the genetic architecture of the brain and the hearts. And actually, the three parts of my talk, first one is the genetic architecture of the brain, and also the second part about brain and heart access, and also the genetic architecture of the brain. Genetic architecture of the brain and heart connections and the genetic architecture of the brain. And I just give you some key ideas of why did I do this project. And actually, and I have been working on the brain disorders for most of 20 years, for more than 20 years. And we mainly use brain imaging for the brain disorder these days. We use imaging. Disorder these days. We use imaging to capture the brain structure and function changes associated with all these major brain disorders and also normal brain development. And it has been very active areas for more than 30 years. And people are developing all kinds of methods to quantify the brain functions and also brain structure changes. Changes. And also, I started working on this genetics of the brain disorders, I think, more than a decade. And the reason we started the brain disorders because most of the major brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, like ADHD, are heritable complex traits and the diseases. And that's actually genetically accounted for more than 50 to 70 percent of AD. 50 to 70% of AD risk, 75 to 90 of the ADHD risk, 60 to 85 sclerophania risk, and 80 of the ASD risk. And actually, the brain disorder is quite complex in many aspects. While the key complexity comes from the fact that the brain disorder is very heterogeneous, and because the disease definition. The disease definition itself is very complex and is keep on evolving across times. And actually, recently they tried to change the diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease. And also genetically aspect is very complex in the sense of this is typical polygenic genetic architectures. That means the genetic signals are non-sparse and weak. And actually, in that And actually, the in that case is, and also that's add another level of the genetic complexity for discovery genetic signals. And this is basically that both two are very important. And actually, I have been working on this area for almost 20 years. And actually, almost 12 years ago, I started to basically go to the different public domains to connect to these kinds of connect these kinds of assemblies all these different imaging genetic data and together and basically and and also process all these data and these days people are not just interested in the brain imaging imaging genetics and also interested basically because these days we have the imaging data across the lifespans and people are interested see how does the brain see how does the brain and changes in across lifespans from the even before the birth you know among the tombs in terms of both structure and functions across time even in the normals okay in the normal subjects it's very there are two years ago there are natural papers just talking about this it's a very um important topic because we we have little understanding about Understanding about the brand in general and in many aspects. And also, we also develop tools to harmonize and the tools and the pipelines to consistently generate the full spectrum of neuroimaging features. And unfortunately, because I've been working on this area almost 20 years. And we call it, and because for in particular for UK Buy Bank, we call it imaging traits, all kinds of. Imaging traits, all kinds of imaging traits, where you can structure it basically from the MI data sets. And we have these structural images like brand volumes and also have the functional connectivity and structural connectivity. And for the UK by bank data set, and also the actually we can correlate the imaging and those genetic markers together because both imaging and the genetic traits are extremely high dynamic. The traits are extremely high-dimensional. And actually, we at the beginning, we do a lot of basically a dimensional reduction method for doing that. Recently, we also developed another method, basically you can do the voxel-wise approach. And actually, this is APOES. We pick up the APOEs, and the APOE is one of the well-known genetic markers for the Alzheimer's disease. They colour for, I think, around 10%. And the heritabilities for the ADs. I think a line or eight some percent. That's the most significant genes. And actually, one thing we did in our paper, so we correlate the LEE genes with all these major resting functions and the tassel function for my for characterizing the functional connectivities. And actually, we see this basically, this is enriched. Basically, this is enriched in secondary visual and the default mode network and also strong connections in the function FMIs and the structure MIs. Actually, this is the right side is the structure MIs. Actually, this mainly connections on the functional side. This is quite interesting findings compared with the existing literatures. And this is very strong basically MOEs associated brain functions instead of the brain structure. Okay, instead of the brain structure. And also, we have a series of papers on this topic, and also we share these kinds of general summary statistics on this. And also, we created these larger portals and they share the findings with the community, and the people can search our website and basically are looking for significant association between the genetics and also imaging trace. Imaging trace. And one thing is, I actually, it takes many years to understand why we should do it in what sense. And actually, for most of the brain traits, brain disorders, the imaging of the disease phenotype is very heterogeneous. And there's clinically defined disorders. And that's the reason the diagnosis basically measurement diagnosis. The basically measurement diagnosis, the definition of the diagnosis for all these major disorders are consistently evolving across years. And if you work on mental health, you know that the diagnosis kinds of the manuscript evolve across tries. And that's quite a lot of problems when you really carry out GWAS analysis based on the binary trace because the phenotype itself is very Very, it's not very homogeneous. And that's the basically for many of these psychiatric diseases and the findings. There's a lot of things going on that side. Another thing is, why do we care about the imaging trace? And because one of the key things is because the imaging trace is a direct measure from the organs and not from the brain. And it's supposed to be closer to the underlying biology. And that's the basic key thing. That's the basic key things. And there's another several factors quite important. The first one, you wanted to the imaging trace or other trace is reproducible and heritable. That's the one thing, the very important factor when you choose the imaging traits. The second thing is you want to be informative about the disorder risk. Okay, that's also very important because that's the reason we're using imaging traits instead of other traits. And also, you can provide a mechanism. And also, you can provide mechasmific connections and link the genetics and variance to the clinical measures. Because urine, we think about the organ traits or like imaging traits sitting between the genetic markers and also clinical measures. And also, some imaging traits may be treatable because when we're talking about the treatments for the brain traits, gut brain disorders are some. Glad brain disorders, and sometimes these days we develop a specific treatment for some of these kinds of brain functions. Most of the time, people care about the brain functions and they can develop some therapy and basically we call this brain circuits and they develop some specific treatment for those kinds of for that. And that's very important because otherwise, and actually like Because otherwise, and actually like AD and also Alzheimer's disease, that's the basic A beta toys basically is also the brain trait. And actually, you can develop a drug specifically to target to these brain circuits or brain traits. And that's basically very important. And also, there's increasing the power of the genetic search for genetic architecture. That's one of the key reasons for that. And I think that's the For that, and I think that's the main purpose is why do we do imaging genetics? That's the some of the five of the main factors besides the genetic the heterogeneity on that. And also, this is the basically the reviewabilities and heritabilities of the different imaging traits, in particular most of the other related to brain and also and also the heart. And this is basically give you And this is basically to give you a big picture of what's going on, why do we do it? And also, in general, all these things is a part of this brain imaging genetic paradigms for the brain disorders. We try to characterize from genes, molecules, and to brain cells, the structures, brain function structures, and to brain disorders, and not confounded with all the environmental, social, and psychological factors. And also, this is basically And also this is basically the brain hydro access. And actually then because of UK Bank Bank has all the both imaging traits for the brain and the heart. And actually almost four or five, six years ago, I told my students, Bin Shin, and actually, how about we work on basically link the brain and heart together? Because we know that there's a top kinds of organs in the body, like the brain, heart, the kidney, liver, and also, and also. And also, and all these major organs, then the first thing we start with is the brain heart. And basically, this referred to the bi-directional basic communication between heart and the brain. And it's very important regulating the physiological functions and maintain the overall health. And actually, there's the three major things. One is neural regulations. And the second one, the endocrine and the pathways and also blood flow and oxygen supplies to link the brain and the heart. To link the brain and the heart access. And this is basically, I just highlight some of these major relationship between the communication between these two. And then this is basically, and also disease from disease aspect, they are highly related. And the most important thing is the cardiovascular disease. And in particular, like stroke, dementia, and dementia, and the cognitive impairment. The cognitive impairment. And also, the mental disorders and like also related to increase the risk of the cardiovascular disease. And also, this is basically the like acute mental stress is so very important disease and they also have major impact on the cardiovascular health. And also that's the reason this research significance is integrate the treatment of treatment. The treatment of treatment for neuro disorders, and also this comprehensive studies and to have a big picture about link this brain and heart together. That's why we started to work on this project almost five or six years ago. And on this, at the beginning, because we just know there's the data over there, we just do this joint analysis. And besides, we are working on the hard. We are working on the heart and also the brain. Also, work on the retina. We have a recent papers a few weeks ago on this natural communication. You basically try to correlate retina with the brain and also the kidney and the other different organs. We try to link the different organs, the organs in the body, and also try to link the different disease across the EHR kinds of the Kinds of the data. That's the basic, we try to link a gene genetic architectures for the organs and also to the y-join. That's the reason we spent almost two years on the y-join data analysis. And this is the basic UK Buy Bank. You know, they have all different data types and many people already familiar with this. The better thing is because the UK Buy Bank is going to put on the AWS, that's going to be a disaster for us. And actually, there's a lot of. For us. And actually, there's a lot of complaints about this. We are trying to form a community to fight for that. That's basically something the journey can interview us basically to talk about all the issues. But I think that's the best thing for the community in general. And actually, this is generic, the brain heart connections. And you can, and this is basically our science paper two years ago. And last year, basically, you can look at basically the genetic basic. The genetic basically, the left side is basically some major heart kinds of imaging features. And also the right side is basically the major brain basically features. And actually, we tried to, this is the whole design of the studies. And we first step basically, we try to understand phenotypical heart and the brain connections. And basically, there's And basically, there's card traits and the brain traits. What are the relationships? And we consider the three major analyses: univariate association, sex-specific analysis, and also canonical coordination analysis. The second study basically will do harder GWAS, and basically we identify the, we structure this genetic architecture of the CMR, the traits. And the third step, we're doing the genetic heart brain connectivities. We are looking for the Connectivities. We are looking for the shared burn risk, NOSIQ EQTL, and the conocalidation, and also looking at the genetic correlation, the PRS and the Mandani randomization. And also we did this basic joint prediction by combining the genetics, the heart, and the brain. Then this is basically the overall flow of the science paper on that. And this is some of these key findings for the These key findings for the phenotypic, the harder brain connectivities. And this is basically you can identify a lot of basically the connect the association between the imaging, the brain traits, and also heart traits. And also this sniper header beats 82 CMR basic traits. And for some of the CMR traits, highly headables, but there are some, many of these are reasonably high. Are reasonably high, and for that. And also, these are genetics of CMR basic traits in the UK by bank. And basically, there's the different genetic regions associated with CMR traits. And some of the well-known basic chromosome regions. And also some of these synected genetic loci associated basically both the heart MI and also brain MI traits. And also, this is the genetic correlations. And also this is the genetic correlations among the different diseases and also the human intelligence and also the heart traits. And this is the MI also carrier MI analysis is a causal, we link this heart and the brain relationship because the different cardiovascular disease and all the heart, the brain disorders and the basic will carry out two-dimensional basic MR analysis across the set of the basically outcomes. Of the basically outcomes, and this is the basically the potential and basically heart and the brain relationship. And this is basically how we list all these major brain-related disease and the heart-related disease and then get them together to establish this shared genetic and general factors associated with the both and their relationship. And you can find out most of the information in our papers. You can just look at it. I don't go through this, the Go to this imaging processing pipelines. I have a review paper posted on our website. You can take a look at it, but I just don't go to the details. And finally, I want to thank all my collaborators and mostly important things to Bing Xin, Tenfei, Yuen, and also Jason Stein and Patrick, and also my heart-basic collaborators Xinhua and other members of my lab. Thank you.
