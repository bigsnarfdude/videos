Okay, so yesterday we had some discussion of the causal paradox, of the surrogate paradox, and I think with Tyler in particular. And I think he indicated that sort of ways of assessing this directly may not be out there yet. But I would respectfully disagree. I'm going to present some work here. I'm going to present some work here, which is part of a broader set of work I've done to try and, building off of his paper, to be very fair, which got me interested in the area, to try and assess this issue from data. So, okay, so let's see. Is that because I can just page down? No, I can't. Sorry. Sorry, so these are all people that have worked on this project with me. And okay, so a little bit of outline. I'm going to describe this surrogate markers and the causal modeling framework very briefly because we've seen a lot of this already. I'll spend a bit more time sort of reviewing the surrogate paradox, which again, we saw, but just to remind everybody. And then get into the beat of the talk, which is basically some proposed measures of the surrogate paradox and the meta-analytic framework. And the meta-analytic framework, and then extensions to assess subgroup analyses and some simulations and applications. All right, so surrogate markers, the notation here. I'm going to use S for the marker, which of course is some sort of intermediate indicator of disease progression that we're hoping to use in lieu of the true endpoint T, and which ideally should be involved in the mechanism of the disease and the intervention so that. Intervention so that we can, if not fully replace it, at least get a good idea of what's going on with respect to the treatment and the final outcome early on. So just some examples here, of course, progression-free survival and cancer, talked about a lot. Blood pressure as a measure for our treatment of wall thickening and heart disease. Glaucoma, basically, same measure, glaucoma is a problem. The same measure of glaucoma is a problem with pressure buildup in your eye, and whether sort of early versions of this can work as a surrogate for later measures. So the goal is really to understand how this pathway from the treatment Z to this outcome goes through or bypasses the surrogate marker. And one of the key problems is that confounders can bias estimation of these pathways. Randomization helps with. Randomization helps with the pathways from Z out to S and T, but the surrogate marker itself cannot be randomized. So a little brief bit of notation here. I'll be using the sort of parentheses with the capital Z to indicate possibly the value of the marker under different treatment arms. And then the I'm just going to briefly highlight because I don't have time to get into all of the different approaches here to this, but the most general formulation of this sort of causal inference in the direct indirect effects setting is to consider the potential outcome for T as a function both of the treatment and then the surrogate Mercker value potentially under other outcomes. Potentially under other outcomes manipulated independently. So when these Z prime and Z's are equal to each other, then we can kind of just collapse and think about the potential outcome under Z. And similarly for S. So I'm going to consider settings where Z is binary and that S and T are continuous. Although the work I'm going to, it could certainly be extended in other directions. So I'm going to. So, I'm going to concentrate on the meta-atlining approach, which again, we saw a little bit of background on here. So, basically, this potential outcome for both S and T are considered to be functions of basic means. And then we're letting, I'm going to let I index a trial here and J index an observation. So, in this metalytic approach, we have, we're considering a situation where we have multiple trials with Of multiple trials with similar outcomes and marker measures and potentially heterogeneous treatments, although not always. So I indexes our trial, J indexes our individual within the trial. We have random effects at the trial level for both the marker and the outcome. And then random effects again at the trial level. Again, at the trial level for the effect of treatment and then of residual here that's that's individual level. So we allow these random effects here to be correlated. That's pretty important because that's going to basically be how we assess surrogate effectiveness. And of course, then we'll allow these counterfactual or these potential correlations between Potential correlations between S and T within the within the given individual to be correlated as well. And one thing to point out here, because we have multiple individuals and multiple trials, all of these quantities can be estimated. When working in a single trial setting, we often have measures that cannot be directly estimated. So that is one advantage of this approach. So the goal here. So, the goal here is we're going to try to focus on particularly ultimately the sort of function of the proportion of the variance of the total effect that's going to be explained by the trial level random effects associated with the surrogate. And of course, if everything here is known, we can compute this conditional variance then as this total variance minus this. This linear transformation of the correlations between this the surrogate marker and the sorry just to bounce back here right so these s sub a's is a correlation between the uh Between the trial level overall mean measures, or if you want to think the control level variance, and then S sub B then becomes the correlation components between these means for the means for the control and then the random effect means for the for the intervention so all these things can kind of get boiled down to this uh sort of coming right out of this sort of standard normal distribution theory and uh we then can um consider this this our trial measures essentially we sort of think of the piece here that's getting subtracted off relative to the overall It off relative to the overall variance. Then we get this R-squared trial measure, and the bigger that is, the better the surrogacy is, right? You're sort of getting these things, sort of the treatment effects on the outcome. Now, given these pieces here are going to be very well known, and so you're sort of getting this very nice by low of correlation. High-level correlation. Okay, so that's just a quick background on Surrogue and Mars surrogacy marker assessment in the meta-analytics setting. So the surrogacy paradox, again, I think Tyler talked about this yesterday, but just to remind everybody, there's of course a notorious real-world example where medication to control ventricular arrhythmia was developed and approved based on. And approved based on basically controlling ventricular arrhythmia. But then on the actual death, it turned out to be when there were actual finally clinical trials that were conducted, waiting for the final outcome on cardiovascular disease, it turned out that they were actually harmful. So this paradox can basically manifest itself. Manifest itself when the direct effect of the treatment on the outcome was in the opposite direction, right? So that's what was happening in this example. When there's unconfounded, uncontrolled confounding between the surrogate and the outcome, I think maybe some of the stuff that Mark presented yesterday might have some evidence of that in these sort of, I'm sorry, I forget the acronym, but the driving the tumor loads down to zero seems to not as To not necessarily be a great surrogate for survival. And there are possibly three, right? There's a sort of a lack of transitivity. So there are subsets of individuals that are not positively affected by the surrogate for the same individuals where the surrogate positively affects the outcome. And this last approach is actually really what I'm going to focus on here today because you can get at this, I believe, with an analytic setting. So again, melolinic approach. If we want to look and see our effect of the treatment on the surrogate mercker and the effect of the treatment on the outcome, we can compute these at the trial level as this quantity is here. And then, if we think about the conditional expectation of this effect on T given S. Effect on T given S. Yeah, for a given effect on S with an individual, then I think that might be a typo, but essentially this quantity here, you can compute these quantities in terms of, again, of these regression coefficients and correlations. And correlations. And basically, if this theta two is positive, right? So basically, whenever there's, we're assuming here positive is good. Just flip it around if you want the reverse. That whenever there's a positive effect on the surrogate for the treatment, then that positive effect carries through to the effect on the outcome. If that occurs and you have essentially a perfect surrogate, so this RHAT trial is one, then there's no way this could ever be done. Then there's no way this could ever be negative. So these theta hat, there's no way this can be negative as long as, sorry, there's no way that the expectation can be negative as long as the effect on S is positive. So you avoid the surrogate paradox. They're always going to be in the same direction. And I should add, too, I'm sort of defining surrogate paradox as arguably simplistically, but basically, if the effect, overall marginal effect, Overall marginal effect on the outcome within a trial is in a different direction from the overall marginal effect of the surrogate than we have the surrogate paradox occurring. If we don't, it's avoided. And I'm doing this all at the trial level. So, of course, it's a bit extreme conditions, right? So, particularly this perfect surrogacy. This perfect surrogacy, um, you know, it's going way back to the sort of beginning discussion about surrogates, um, is kind of an unrealistic condition. But you can do a few things, right? You can assess the probability that a future trial will yield treatment effects on the MERCA and the outcome in the same direction from this, from the fact that these are fully identified. And basically, you sort of want this product of these things in the same direction, right? Of these things in the same direction, right? So this whole thing is positive. So I'm calling this sort of surrogate paradox 1, 3. If you think about the, and I'll show a picture of this in a minute, but if you think about essentially the Cartesian space divided into the four quadrants, this is sort of the first and third quadrant where the effect of s and the effect of t are in the same direction, whether positive or negative. And you can compute this as a function of sort of parameters. Of sort of parameters from this joint distribution. And of course, a particularly dangerous situation might be in the setting where they're in opposite directions, and particularly where the surrogate looks like it's working well, but the actual outcome is bad. So that you can think of that as a ventricular arrhythmia setting. Right. And you can compute again these quantities in the same fashion. So So, a couple more approaches that we can look at here, I think, to assess this sort of measure of surrogacy paradox risk is to sort of determine what's the minimum observed positive treatment effect for a marker that can reduce the probability that the true treatment for the outcome is negative to a small level. And essentially, that boils down to computing this probability here, which, given that you've got some. Given that you've got some treatment effect for the surrogate marker equal to little s, what's the probability that that expected value on the treatment is going to be negative? And again, a lot of this is basic sort of some sense probability, I don't know, 601 Michigan work here. Work here. So, nothing terribly fancy. I think it's the conceptual part, I think, that's somewhat novel here. And so, once you have that, you can sort of do that in one of two ways. If you've actually collected data to determine this quantity, you can compute the probability alpha, the true effect, and the outcome for the trial will be non-negative by estimating this piece directly. Otherwise, you might determine the value of SMA that will ensure the probability. That will ensure the probability that the risk of this paradox is going to be less than or equal to some cutoff alpha, which basically can compute it in the same way. Again, now you're assuming some quantity for our future trial that has a certain sample size. So, and then again, you know, you can sort of use a linear VIX model method, you can use either frequentist or Bayesian approaches. Or Bayesian approaches. It turns out the Bayesian approaches probably have some advantages here because these trials aren't necessarily gigantic. And so there are stability numerical issues that sometimes pop up the frequent study. But either one can be used. So again, here's some pictures, which I think may help illustrate the idea a little more clearly. So this x-axis here is basically the effect of the treatment on the sorry. On the surrogate marker, and the y-axis is the effect of the treatment on the outcome. And we're basically having different trials sort of populate this space. And if we sort of think of, you know, over many, many trials, we have some sort of joint distribution of these delta S's and delta T's. We can compute then the probability, the sort of CDF, that this distribution lies in one of these two off quadrants. So these are the situations where the paradox occurs. Situations where the paradox occurs, and I guess I'm thinking of this as a particularly bad situation. Again, without loss of generality, thinking the positive outcomes is good, that where you look like based on the surrogate marker, hey, this treatment's working great, but oops, now we've looked at the actual, how come, not good. So these are actual true values here. I just sort of picked some different ones, sort of based on how tight the correlation. Sort of based on how tight the correlations are and how variable they are. So, obviously, if you've got, it also is a function of how effective the treatment is, right? So, if you've got a really effective treatment and things tend to go up into space here, it's like say this example down here, there's very little risk of the paradox occurring. Conversely, if you have a weak treatment, in this case, maybe a little more highly correlated, but still not a real powerful outcome, you sort of increase that risk substantially. Substantially. And of course, if this were wider, then this quantity would get even bigger. And if you're in a situation where you're sort of centered down in this space here, then that's really not good. But I've looked at what I think are sort of more realistic situations here. So, okay, so that's just the sort of very high-risk setting, right? So see, maybe some that are, maybe a 6% chance of this is not great, you know, but maybe a 0.03% chance is. Maybe a 0.03% is okay. So, all right, so we just did a couple little run simulations. Basically, the quick takeaway here is that more trials, the more accurate this gets. And I believe this is all in using the delta method frequent estimation approach. So, bias shrinks away and coverage gets to be good. Generally, not too bad. The 10 trial setting is a little marginal for some of these measures, but 40. For some of these measures, but in 40 and 100 trials, we get pretty good estimates. So finally, the last little extension I'm going to discuss here is basically considering incorporating patient subgroups. So we might imagine that this, let me just go back a second. Oops. Oh, there we are. Sorry, wrong button. Right. So if we sort of think about If we sort of think about this setting here, this is an overall marginal distribution, but maybe this sort of in some, of course, normality assumption would be a violator to some degree, but you might consider the setting where if we condition on X, these sort of pieces move around a little bit, right? So it may be for some set of individuals, we get very little risk of surrogate paradox, but possibly for others, maybe more. So that's basically the game here. And there's sort of a couple of approaches. One is that the effect of the covariates on the surrogate outcome are constant across trials. So there's no random effects related to the covariates. And then where you may have effects on the surrogate and the outcome non-constant across trials. So in scenario one, basically that's meaning you're adding a sort of a fixed effects for the Fixed effects for these control and treatment settings, right? The random effects piece stays the same. So you basically now sort of create these delta s and delta t measures now as a function of a particular set of covariates. And so now the joint distribution. Joint distribution, the variance covariance beast doesn't change, but now we have these addition of the coefficients that are associated with the different covariates for the mean. So it's basically a mean shift from the original distribution. The variance, the sort of correlation remains the same as before. So basically, we can sort of update these measures. It's not too deep. Measures, it's not too deep here. You're essentially getting summations, and you sort of add on to these different effects here. So you can kind of now your sort of measures of the risk of the surrogate paradox are a function of just of these X's. So scenario two gets a little more complicated because now we're essentially adding in random effects for the control and treatment. For the control and treatment at the trial level for both S and T. So now we get a little sort of a little bigger. You know, we're basically gone from a 4x4 to an 8x8 matrix. And your delta S's and delta T's now will include random effects that are a function of the trial and the X-lowable variable, as well as the sort of fixed effects component. The sort of fixed effects component. So we can kind of work out this joint distribution. It's a little more complicated, right? It involves pieces of these additional variance and covariance components. And so we still end up ultimately, of course, with a two by two covariance matrix, but they're now functions of these other factors. So basically, you're getting that same shift. Basically, you're getting that same shift around that Cartesian space, but the various covariance matrix could, you know, could shift as well, depending on X. So, right, so that's basically what that's saying there, these measures one and two. And I think I've got a little typo here. I think these stars should not be in here, but they should be down there. Okay, so. Okay, so I don't have time here. I do have a bunch of simulation studies that we're sort of finishing up. I haven't quite gotten done with them, but it generally works pretty well. For some of the settings, the frequency approach becomes more problematic as you sort of add more covariates in here. So the Bayesian piece kind of saves us here. Um so I'm just going to talk a little bit about our example. I mentioned this briefly on earlier on. This is a uh it's a somewhat older study now, but but we've used it and can sort of for various applications here. This was a multi-celler randomized clinical trial that was comparing the effects of surgery versus drug for reducing interocular pressure in glaucoma patients. So we, this, this IOP was measured at three-month intervals, going out up to, what, I guess, eight years. And so our spheric, we're going to consider is the sort of year and a half measure with the outcome being at eight years. And I don't really have specific trials here. I think Mark sort of talked about this idea and the more general issue and these metalytic approaches. I, you know, I think it's an open. Approaches, I think it's an open, some thought, probably more thought could be given to exactly how we're considering the sort of trial or the differences in trials. Here, we're basically just going to use the centers as a bit of a trial setting. I think you do have to have real different, it allows for some variability, right? If you were just to take a single center and randomly subdivide it, I think you mentioned that. I think that at least. I think that at least at the superpopulation level, it sort of sets the variance to zero. So it wouldn't work in that setting, even though you might empirically get some number that comes out. So a little bit of missing data here that we imputed, which is a linear mixed model. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that, but a lecture trick. So here's actually a plot. So here's actually a plot of the posterior estimates of, and this is now without any conditioning. So basically, this is a plot of basically that's a plot of these. That's basically a plot of delta S versus delta T, the actual using, you know, having plugged in, you know, the predicted values here from these with the fixed and random effects added together. So and see, so again, just to sort of highlight the basic concepts, the more tightly correlated The more tightly correlated these are, the happier you are as a surrogate. And then, to the extent that the sort of underlying joint distribution over an infinite number of trials stays out of these corners here, the happier you are about avoiding the surrogate paradox. So, looked at these sort of different measures that we proposed. We can generally see there's sort of little risk of Of surrogate paradox, maybe not, it's more than trivial, though. And in particular, an observed treatment effect of a one millimeter of mercury pressure reduction at 12 months should avoid the sort of negative treatment effect with a 95% probability. In terms of the overall surrogate quality, it was sort of modest. You know, this is not super tightly correlated. This is not super tightly correlated. So good to avoid surrogate paragox as the surrogate marker itself may be pretty modest. So then we went on and did sort of a breakout by gender and then by age. Here we hadn't used the Foley-Bayesian approach because there were convergence issues with the Frecotist approach. There does appear to be some impact of gender and age on this risk of surrogate paradox with men and older individuals being a little more likely to present with the paradox. There seems to be a bit of a There seems to be a very little risk of the sort of dangerous paradox. You might be making the assumption that it doesn't work when it does, which isn't great, but not the converse. Okay, so just to wrap up, we've developed measures of surrogate paradox risk that qualify risk treatment assessments on marker and outcome being in opposite directions in this meta-analytic setting. In this meta-analytic setting, I should add we actually have some for single trial settings that require stronger assumptions, including parameters that are not fully identified. It's also, I mean, it's somewhat constrained, obviously, in that I've got this bivariate normal assumption, but I think that's doable. We've done some equivalent work in other settings to extend this with copula models, which I think would allow for a larger range of marginal distributions to be considered and actually this. Considered, and actually, this analytic stuff's anticipated that in general. So, multivariate markers and outcomes, I think, is also an interesting idea, right? That whether you can sort of think about this sort of paradox in this setting, and that would be another piece of future work. So, okay, so I think, yeah, which references now. So, okay, thank you. I know we have an open discussion after this, so maybe we'll keep things moving. And the next talk is from Anne van den Bosch, who will give us an industry perspective.
