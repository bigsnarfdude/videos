So, Matt, Matt will tell us about on Mora Sugi Sun and not floor homologies. And I think you have to speak. I don't know how we get. Yeah, no, I'm not muted. So, yeah, thanks a lot for the invitation. And I was really disappointed not to be able to join you with my Matt. To join you with my matter, but very much appreciate this opportunity to participate within the kind of digital spirit world. So as anyone who's been to Banff with me knows, and I'll tell everybody every time there, Burrs and the beautiful setting where it resides has really played a very special role in my career and probably without a doubt my favorite place to travel for mathematics. For mathematics. I think, like, the phrase inspiring creativity has been for myself and many others more than just a slogan. And indeed, it's really very much the lived experience of BAMP and the station. And so my hope for those of you who are there this week is that you'll find similar inspiration and take peace in the mountains and the mathematics during these continuing, very troubling. Very troubling and difficult times in the world. And so, finally, I also want to thank, give really heartfelt thanks to Hans, John, John, and Liam, and the Urswile organizers, Denis and Olivier, for continuing to organize the Interactions Workshop. As Hans mentioned, this workshop has a long history and it's really played a very important role for many of us in our community. And I, and those others who have had the good fortune to participate, are really grateful to you all for your efforts to keep this wonderful tradition alive. Okay, so with that said, let me share my screen if I'm able to, and let's okay, is it sharing? No. Okay. Okay, so right, so this is so it's a it's a pleasure to talk to you about some joint work with Zach. With Isashi Cheng and Shudrich Barker. And the kind of overarching realm in which this work takes place concerns operations on knots. And so this is kind of an area. That I've found interesting throughout my career is just, you know, how to, you know, what sort of algebraic operations or semi-algebraic operations do knots, say in the three-spheromor and general manifolds, possess? And clearly the most well-known such operation is the connected sum. Which I'll denote hashtag. Which I'll denote hashtag. And the connected sum operation is quite well known. It's a monoidal operation on the set of knots. The unknot plays the kind of unit with respect to this. And it has two natural generalizations. First is satellite operations. Which is something I'm, you know. Which is something I'm you know found fascinating throughout my life. But it has another generalization called the Murasugi Sum. Throughout the talk today, I'm going to denote by star. And this is what I'll focus on today. But I want to just begin with the well-known observation. So, anybody that starts learning not to That you know, starts learning not theory or takes a course in a subject begins by proving following well-known results that the genus of knots is additive under connected sum. So that's to say, so the genus being the minimal genus of any ciphered surface or oriented surface whose oriented boundary is a given knot K, is that sort of complexity of knots is additive under the operation of connected sum. And one immediate consequence of this fairly easy to prove result is that knots don't have inverses. That's to say that because the unknot is the unique knot with genus zero, that you can't find given a knot with non-trivial knot k, some other knot k prime, such that when you connect something together, you get the unknown. But you know, if you know, there's kind of a natural thing to do anytime you have a monoid for which the knots are an example. Knots are an example with respect to connected sum is you can take the Grotendie group of this monoid. So one model for this is we can just denote it by k of knots. And by definition, this is the Freebian group on the set of, let's say, isotopic classes of knots. Modulo, the relations that, you know, anytime I see a connected sum, I'm going to set that equal in the free abelian group to the formal sum. So I quotient by the age relation. So this is the Grodendi group of knots. And but you know, you think maybe, well, maybe this is a way to get some kind of interesting algebraic operation on knots, but this group. This group by Schubert's well-known prime decomposition theorem for knots says that this is just isomorphic then to the Freabian group on the set of prime knots. Now, so it's still not very interesting, but one thing that Is still not very interesting, but one thing that turns out is that you know, there's a submonoid in the set of knots under connected sum, and this is the set of slice knots. And so it induces a subgroup of this of this Grotoni group. And so basically, you can take the quotient of the Freebian group on the set of prime knots by the set of prime slice knots, and then you get the well-known concordance group, either in the smooth or topological setting, depending on what type of slices you're allowed. You're allowed. And this group is extremely interesting, as many of us know. It's very well studied. And indeed, the other natural kind of generalization of connected sum, namely the satellite operations I mentioned above, satellite operators act on the concordance group by endomorphisms. And so I think this is a very interesting topic. It's not the topic today, but I think we will hear more about it later in the week, looking at some of the abstracts. At some of the abstracts. And so today, though, I want to focus on Marasugi-sum, the other generalization of connected sum. And so let's just begin with a very well-known special case of this called plumbing. So plumbing arises quite naturally in the context of contact geometry. Context of contact geometry, a focus here. Where contact structures on three manifolds are equivalence classes of fiber knots or open book decompositions of three manifolds modulo the equivalence relation of this operation of plumbing with positive Hofbands. And so, what is it? So, what we do here is we have, say, two surfaces, and on each of these surfaces, I see a square where two of the sides of the square are on the boundary of the surface and two of the sides of the square on the interior. And what you do then to form the plumbing of these two surfaces is we just simply identify the squares so that the interior. So, that the interior edges of one are identified with the boundary edges of the other. And so, I should probably something like this, indicate that this is going over. Okay, so this is the plumbing of two right-handed or positive hoffbands, and you can check then that the boundary of this. That the boundary of this is the trefoil, the right-handed trefoil. So, Murasugi-sum is a kind of a natural generalization of this plumbing operation, which probably many of you are using on a semi-regular basis. So, let me now talk about Murusugi sum. So, suppose that I have two links, L1 and L2, and they're equipped with ciphered surfaces, which I'll denote by F1. Which I'll denote by F1 and F2. And on each of those cipher surfaces, we have a subsurface, which is a polygon, P1 and P2. And those polygons have the same number, the same even number of edges. So we have these links equipped with ciphered surfaces, and we have these two ingons on the ciphered surface. And what we want is just similarly in the case of plumbings, we want that the edges of the polygons. Edges of the polygons alternate between interior and the boundary. And so, what we can do then is we can form this new surface, which I'm going to note by F1 asterisk F2. And although I'll suppress it typically, it really, it's important that I have that polygon there, P. And I'm going to identify the two surfaces in the following way. So, here I have two surfaces or pieces of surfaces, F1 and F2, and I have some yellow shaded. And I have some yellow shaded octagons that are embedded in the way that I mentioned. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to just take one of the surfaces and I'm going to identify the octagon on the one surface with the other. And so now I get a new surface and the polygons have been identified. And the surface is now, I'll do note by F1, F2. And so the surface, I'm going to call the new surface. I'm going to call the new surface. I'm going to say it's the Marasugi sum of the two surfaces I started with, and I'm also going to refer to its boundary as the Marasugi sum of the two links. So I'll say that the boundary is L1 Marissa Gi-San L2. Okay, so it's really important to note here that That you know, this operation depends on many things. So, this is not just a well-defined operation on links. But one, even before that, I need to know, I need to orient, and I'm going to assume throughout the talk that everything in question is granted. And even if you have these polygons, once the edges are more than, you know, once you have enough edges, you're also going to have to specify some kind of ordering on the edges. I mean, there's different ways you can do this, but you need to specify how you're going to identify those polygons. I could have, you can imagine when I formed this, I could have rotated the surface by, you know, 2Ï€ over 8 or 2 pi over 4. Um, and uh, gotten a different identification. So we need orientation of everything and an ordering, say, of the edges. And of course, it depends on the surface. So you can take different ciphered surfaces for the same links, or you can take different polygons on given ciphered surfaces. And so you can get many different links out of a pair of links. out of a pair of links by this operation. So this implies it's not, so this is not well defined on links. Okay, so one of the places that I, you know, where I first encounter this outside of contact geometry is through this kind of beautiful results. It's through this kind of beautiful results of Gabai from the 80s. So Gabai showed this remarkable two theorems that if you have F1 and F2 as above, these are surfaces. And so suppose F1 and so F1 and F2 are minimal genus, or let's say instead of genus, if you have link. Instead of genus, if you have links or surfaces with many boundary components, the kind of natural complexity would be the first Betty number. I'll get to that in a moment. So if F1 and F2 are minimal complexity for their boundaries, well, that implies that the Murasugi sum is as well, right? Murasugi sum is as well. So, if you know that you sort of have minimal genus surfaces for a given knot type, then you can form the Marasugi sum and you can correspondently get a minimal genus surface for the Marusuki sum. But this goes both ways as well. So indeed, F1 and F2 are minimal complexity for their boundary if and only if the Marusuki sum is. And closely related in the proof is that F1 and F2. That F1 and F2 are fiber surfaces. So they are fibers in a vibration of the exterior of their boundary if and only if the Murasugi sums is. Okay, so this is a really beautiful result, and it's kind of, you know. You know, highlight maybe, or one of the highlights of Gabai's work on sutured manifold theory and taut foliation. So, somehow, you know, Thurston showed that if you have a taut foliation with a compact surface as a leaf, then that certifies that that leaf is minimal complexity in its homology or relative homology class. And then Gabay used the theory of suture manifolds to certify. To certify, given a minimal complexity surface, that it is minimal complexity, he adapted a foliation or a top foliation to such a surface. And the key idea behind these results is that, say, coming back up to this picture, that if you have a suture manifold hierarchy for F1 or F2, it naturally induces a sutured manifold hierarchy for the Marasugi sum. For the Murasugi sum, because you think about these surfaces, and the polygons is living on part of a two-sphere, and then there's a complementary polygon on that two-sphere, which I'm shading in pink, along which you can decompose the Murasugi sum to split the corresponding complementary suture manifold into a disjoint unit of two suture manifolds that are themselves the complements of the cipher surfaces that you see. Complements of the ciphered surfaces that you started with. And so there's sort of a bijection between the suture manifold hierarchy theories for the complements of F1 and F2 and that of the Murasugi sum. Okay, so I just want to point out a definition though that his results motivate. You can define B1 min. So this is sort of like the genus for a knot, but for a link, I think this is a very natural notion of complexity. This is the minimum. Of complexity. This is the minimum rank of H1 of sigma, where sigma is a ciphered surface for L. And so a corollary of Gabay's work then is that much as the genus was additive under connected sum, which I should probably mention is the case of Marisugi summing along a bygon or along a two-gon. Something along a bygon or along a two-gon, that the minimal First Betty number is additive under general Murasugi sums. So that's to say that B1min of L1 Murasugi sum L2 is equal to B1min of L1 and L2, respectively, added together. But I should make the caveat: this is if star, the Murasuki-sum operation, is performed along minimal surfaces, minimal complexity surfaces, not in the geometric sense. Okay, so. So, right. So, this is, I think, quite interesting. And, you know, this caveat here that I have to do this along minimal genus surfaces or minimal complexity surfaces is quite important. So I just want to point out this recent result of Jared Abel, one of my students, and Mikami Hirosawa. And what they show is that given any three knots, there exist ciphered surfaces, say for the first two, F1, F2, such that the third knot, K1, can be obtained as the Murasugi sum of the first. The Murasugi sum of the first two, K1 and K2, along the cipher surfaces that they produce. And of course, the way for you to reconcile this with Gabay's results is to observe that, you know, that means that these surfaces that they have are not minimal genus. And so, maybe, yeah, I just want to point out. So, maybe, yeah, I just want to point out. So, this result was inspired by a very short paper of Thompson, or inspired the question of whether or not such a theorem could be true. So in 94, she showed that you can take the plumbing of two figure eight knots and get the unknot, or you can take the plumbing of two unknots along, say, genus one ciphered surfaces for the unknot and get the trestle. For the unknot and get the trefoil. And so, yeah, I think, yeah, so Gabai's results were contained in a paper called the Murasugi Sun as a Natural Geometric Operation, I believe. And I'm talking to Abby about this at some point. And she, I think, had, I don't know what the title of her paper is, but she said that she had considered entitling it, The Mariski Seven, Not a Natural Geometric Operation, which I would have liked. Which I would have liked. Anyway, so maybe, you know, since I'm talking about kind of the history of this a little bit, I also want to point out, you know, where does this, you know, why is this name attributed to Murasugi? And this stems from his results maybe 20 years prior, where he introduced this operation in pursuit of the In pursuit of the following theorem. So if L is an alternating link, what he showed is that the canonical surface or the ciphered surface produced from the alternating projection is minimal genus for its boundary. And that in the way that he certified this genus minimality of these surfaces was by showing that it equals the degree of the L. Of the Alexander polynomial of the length. And so, in general, of course, we have this inequality that the genus of a knot or link is bounded by the degree of the Alexander polynomial. This is what happens in general. And so there's some special class of links, including, as we see, alternating links for which this inequality is sharp. And so his proof relied on, you know, in a kind of quite complicated inductive type of argument. Quite complicated, inductive type of argument that decomposed the surfaces for alternating links into Murasugi sumands. Coupled with a relatively different Coupled with a relatively easy exercise, which says that if we consider the Alexander polynomial of a link, and I express it as, you know, some leading coefficient, which I'll denote AI for the ith link that I'm dealing with, times B1 of Fi. So this is the cipher surface. So, this is a ciphered surface that you use, for instance, to compute the Alexander polynomial. So, if I write the Alexander polynomial as its leading coefficient AI plus low order terms, then one can show that if you Murasugi sum L1 and L2 along surfaces F1 and F2, that the leading coefficients are multiplicative. Okay, so basically what this exercise allows you to do then is it says that, you know, if you have two knots equipped with ciphered surfaces for which the Alexander polynomial inequality is sharp, then there seems to be some along such surfaces. Along such surfaces will also have the property that the Alexander polynomial certifies genus minimality. Okay. Right. So at this point now, we have these kind of two realms in which Murasuki-sum naturally plays well. Namely, you have some kind of result about one piece of the Alexander polynomial, the kind of extremal piece of the Alexander polynomial. And in Gabay's work, you see that it. In Gabai's work, you see that it interacts very fruitfully with suture manifold hierarchies. And so, for those of you who have seen not fluorhomology at all in your lives, this should ring bells. So not fluoro homology and fluorhomology and Hagar fluorhomology, or essentially any version of fluorhomology for three manifolds at this point. We know to play well with sutured manifold hierarchies. Sutured manifold hierarchies, and we also know also has a very close relationship with the Alexander polynomial through its other characteristic. So if you have a knot in the three-sphere, let me just recall then, or in general manifold, we have these bigrated collection of abelian groups, not floor homology. So they split. Over two gradings that take values in z. And from this, you can take the PoincarÃ© polynomial, which will be convenient for us. I'll regard this as a polynomial on two variables, t and z, and this is the rank of. And this is the rank of HFK. This is the hat version times T to the A Z to the M. So I record the A grading or Alexander grading with the variable T and the homology. And the homological grading or Maslov grading with the variable z. Okay, and so some kind of key features about this are that this is a so-called categorification of the Alexander polynomial in the sense that if I take that homological variable and I plug in negative one for it, so essentially I'm taking the Euler characteristic of this theory, then I recover the Alexander polynomial. The Alexander polynomial, and this is a result of Oshvat and Sabo and Ras Newsen who introduced this invariant. And the genus of a knot can be recovered from the t-degree of this polynomial. So, this is a result of Osvat and Sabo. And K is fibered if and only if this PoincarÃ© polynomial is monic in t so that the highest coefficient, you know, the coefficient of the highest power of t is plus or minus one. And so this is a result of. And so, this is a result of me. And you can see Juhas for a different proof. And so, I should say that these results, these results about detecting fibrations and certifying or detecting genus, these rely on Gabay's machinery. So, they really make use of the existence of future manifold hierarchies that they could be. Existence of future manifold hierarchies, I think it'd be very interesting to have an alternative proof. I don't know where it would come from. Anyway, so this is sort of, you had these kind of this homological theory that is reflecting many of the properties that we discussed above. And so you can naturally ask whether or not fluor homology or not fluorhomology behaves well. And it would be reasonable to think that maybe the top group or the extremal group of not fluoro homology would behave well in immersive. Would behave well in a Mersigi sum. And this is precisely the content of a theorem of Eni from 2005. And he proved that the rank of the top group, so the top group here means highest Alexander grading multiplies under Murusugi sum. So that's to say that, so you can interpret this as that the top group of the knot K1 and K2 behave tensorially under this operation. And I'm going to just And I'm going to just put this, I mean, you know, maybe in quotes. I mean, so this is, you know, this is essentially what he showed, but it's a very weak form of tensor product. I mean, when you think about chain complexes and you say tensor product, you typically mean graded tensor product. And here, tensor product is an ungraded in any sense. So, it's not even clear, I guess, from his proof whether the sort of mod two grading or the parity of the grading is preserved or interacts well with this theorem. And so, really what you should interpret this as is the kind of content of this theorem is that the rank of the top group is multiplicative, and there's not really more content beyond that. But you know, somehow I was really struck by this. Somehow, I was really struck by this result when you proved it. I thought it was just really beautiful. But it also just kind of bugged me. I just, like, why doesn't he know that this is a graded tensor product? I mean, it seems quite unnatural that he would just have this kind of ungraded tensor product. And so it kind of got under my skin. And I really read that, his argument, and tried pretty hard for a while to extend it and argue that, well, it's really great. And I was unable. It's really graded, and I was unable to do that. Um, you know, I should say, I mean, why would I even care? I mean, part of my motivation here was I wanted to understand whether or not I could kind of generate all knots under the operation of Murasugi sum by some reasonably small set. So the fact that the rank is multiplicative tells you that you need an infinite set because you have an infinite number of primes that could serve as the ranks of the top. As the ranks of the top group. And so you need to have at least knots whose top group has rank of all prime numbers. But you know, maybe you could hope that, like, oh, well, the twist knots have that property. Maybe you could produce all knots out of twist knots through the Mersuki sum operation. And having a graded sensor product would allow you to examine that type of question. And so, yes. Do you mean, Murasiki sounds? I mean, the theorem that you mentioned earlier. I mean, the theorem that you mentioned earlier says that if you start with the unknown and you know some surface surface, you can get any knots. But you mean under when you look at surface surface with minimal genus? Yes, with minimal genus. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And also for when you say it's when you want a graded version of tensor product, you mean with respect to Maslow grading? Yes, with respect to Maslow upgrading. And so I noticed that I'm good. Uh, that yeah, and good genie. Is this what you're pointing out, Ina? This is for the genus one case. Um, right. So, okay, so the theorem I want to tell you about is today is kind of this is like a quite long-term project. I mean, Shutri and I were thinking about this as early as, you know, I think around this time. And at some point, we got together with Sheti, who was thinking about. We got together with Sechi, who was thinking about similar things. And the content of theorem is that indeed this is, you can take this to be a graded tensor product. So if you look at M and the Maslow grading, then for any given Maslov grading, and this holds for links as well. For links as well. I mean, I said it for not for Yi, but I believe his also holds for links. So if you look at the top group of the Nopular homology of a link obtained by Marasugi sums, then this decomposes as a graded tensor product. So you look at all possible ways to produce M out of pairs M1 and M2. Okay, so that's our first theorem. And so the course of our proof, which turns out to be maybe similar in some sense in spirit to Yees, but quite a bit different in practice. But quite a bit different in practice, particularly, you know, it's a lot more detailed. But in the course of our proof, we get some more information beyond this. So there's this integer-valued invariant of the concordance group that I mentioned earlier coming out of Naufler homology called Taus. It's due to Oshfat and Sabo and Ras Newsen for the case of knots. And then Alberto Cavallo and myself and Catherine Rayox and Stipsitz Osvat and Stipschitz, OSFAT, and Sabo, you sort of extended this to links in various capacities. But what we showed here is that this Tauin variant of links is maximal in the sense that it equals the biggest it could be, the sieper genus of the length. So this is saying that, you know, if you have that tau of a link is equal to the genus of a length, that tells you that four-dimensionally, you'll get no better surface. Dimensionally, you'll get no better surface in the four-ball than you have in the three-sphere. And so, if you have a so our theorem says that this tau invariant is maximal for a link, if and only if for a link obtained by Murasugi summing, if and only if the tau invariants of both of the sum ends have this kind of maximal tau invariant. So, you should compare this. I mean, so this is. So, you should compare this. I mean, so this is saying that, you know, for some, this is like maybe a partial four-dimensional analog of Gabay's DRMA that I mentioned above. But maybe a better comparison point would be to think about Rudolph's work, for those of you who are familiar with it, on what's called strong quasi-positivity, which I'll denote SQP. So, strongly quasi-positive surfaces in the three-sphere are, are those ciphered? In the three-sphere are those ciphered surfaces for lengths that can be properly isotoped into the four-ball to be a piece of an embedded complex curve. And so, if you have such a surface, then the sort of local TOM conjecture tells you that it'll be, that the four genus will be equal to the genus of that complex curve and hence equal to the three genus. And Rudolph had a corresponding result for these quasi-positive Seifert surfaces. He showed that such a surface A surface, if you take the Marusuki sum of two such surfaces, it's also quasi-positive. And conversely, if you have a Murasuki sum of surfaces, which is quasi-positive, then both those sum ns are. Okay, so I want to point out a couple corollaries of our work. And there's kind of a natural, there's a nice algebraic receptor for this theorem. Yes? So theorem two is known for. So theorem two was known for fiber knots. Right? Theorem two. Oh, yeah. Theorem two was known for fiber knots. Yes. I think that, yeah. I think that you can see that a number of different ways. So what we can do is we can form this kind of algebraic object. So, you know, like I mentioned, you know, the Mercy sum operation isn't well defined. It's not a monoidal operation on knots. So there's no monoid. So there's no monoid, you know, it's definitely not a monoid operation, at least in any kind of obvious way, because it depends on so many things. It depends on the surfaces, it depends on the polygons, et cetera. But I can still nonetheless form a type of Grotendiek group of links under this operation. So I'm going to take the free abelian group on the set of all isotopic classes of links. And I'm going to, as before, quotient by this operate. By this operate, by sort of equating any two links, by equating the Murasigi sum of any two links with their sum in the Priabean group. And here, as I want to continue to point out, this has to be done along and now any minimal genus or minimal complexity surface. In any polygon. So, this gives us a lot of flexibility for producing lots of links. So, you might hope that this group is sort of small-ish. And so, a corollary of our result of our theorem one is that the PoincarÃ© polynomial that we have. That we have from earlier. So the PoincarÃ© polynomial, if I restrict it to the top Alexander, you know, so just look at the polynomial in Z that I get by looking at the highest coefficient of T that occurs, the highest power of T that occurs. I'll denote that this will be what I'd say is the PoincarÃ© polynomial of the top group of not fluorhomology, is that this invariant coming from not fluorhomology descends to a homomorphism. To a homomorphism, which I'll denote P top from the Grotendiek group of links under Marasugi sum. And where does it land? Well, it lands in this kind of, you know, it lands in the multiplicative group of rational numbers that are positive. So this is in, so it lands in this kind of. So it lands in this kind of rational functions in a variable z with positive rational coefficients viewed multiplicatively. And so maybe to, you know, where does Yi's result fit in? If you set Z equal to one, so this corresponds to just adding up all the different Maslow's gradings which are being recorded with the variable Z. Recorded with the variable z, then you get a homomorphism to the multiplicative group of positive rational numbers. So, this is, so we factored Ni's homomorphism through this corresponding group of rational functions. And so you see, you can see a lot more information then with the target of this homomorphism than you can with just the rank. So, maybe some corollaries of that corollaries of the corollary. So, suppose that this top PoincarÃ© polynomial is irreducible. Over the ring of Laurent polynomials, then if L admits a splitting as a Murasugi sum of L1 and L2, then one of Li is fibered. So somehow the only way they're So, somehow, the only way they could split as a Mersey sum is if, like, you're splitting off a knot whose top group has Point-grade polynomial, which is a unit in this ring, which are just the kind of monic polynomials. Another corollary: suppose top groups. Um is supported in more than one grading then this works for links as well. Everything I'll say works for links, then L isn't Then L isn't a Murasugi sum of alternating lengths or thin lengths. And kind of even more, you know, even stronger, nor is any link which contains L. L as a sum end, as a Murasugi sum end. So I don't know. I find these corollaries quite interesting because, you know, from my perspective, I find Murasugi-sum to be just a really mysterious operation. I mean, I don't have a good sense of how to identify whether or not a given length splits as a Murasugi-sum of two sub-links or two other lengths along minimal genus ciphered surfaces. Gene ciphered surfaces. I mean, even this, you know, as for those of you who have worked with open books enough, well, I hope you'll sympathize with me that I, you know, even in the special case of fiber links, I have a very difficult time trying to identify when fiber links split as Murasugi sums, let alone the kind of stable splitting, which this result for ACE in terms of grotend groups is providing. So I wouldn't know how to prove any of these corollaries using topological methods, but I. Topological methods, but I think it would be maybe illuminating if one could do so. And maybe, as a final corollary, is that which I won't write down, is that we also get a formula for the top group of a cable knot, an arbitrary cable knot. It's isomorphic to the top group of the not your cabling with a shift that's determined by the cabling parameters. Okay, so maybe I'll just say a couple words about the ingredients in the proof. A couple words about the ingredients in the proof. And the kind of first key ingredient is explicit Hagar diagrams adapted to the ciphered surfaces in question and the polygons. And so these are very similar. So Andres Juhas and Shuchri Starkard. So, Andras Juhas and Sutri Sarkar and I, you know, in a paper where we use suture fluorhomology to distinguish ciphered surfaces up to up to isotopy, we constructed a couple different algorithms for producing ciphered surfaces or producing Hagar diagrams adapted to ciphered surfaces. And this is a refinement of what we did. And it's a refinement not only in kind of, you know, exactly how these surfaces are produced, but also that it incorporates the polygon. The polygon. And one of the key features of this is that the polygon is encoded with zero, three stabilizations in the sense of Hagar diagrams. So these zero, three stabilizations are really what give us increased control beyond what Nie's proof was providing. And then we've murdered Sugi-Sum, the Hagar diagrams. And from that point on, then, because of this kind of tight control over what's happening near that polygonal region where the Merisogi sum is performed, we get filtrations of CFK of Li and the Murasugi sum that sort of come from, that invoke or involved. That invoked or involved the surfaces in question. So there's the obvious filtration, the Alexander filtration, and you can interpret that in terms of these diagrams, in terms of the number of intersections of a particular Hagar Floor generator in the Seifert surface. So the Seifert surface lies on the Hagar diagram, and you can count the number of intersection points comprising a generator for Hagar floor that lie within that cipher circuit. Floor that lie within that ciphered surface. So, this is the Alexander grading. But we also have a sort of secondary filtration that's weaker in the sense that it lumps more things together that counts the number of intersections in the polygon. And so, this is kind of a key feature in our proof that this. Proof that sort of isn't present in a kind of general Hagar diagram adapted to a surface equipped with a polygon. And so then finally, we use sort of an analysis of this diagram, which is fairly detailed and technical. But one of the key points in that analysis is sort of filtered chain maps respecting these two filtrations. Which are associated to isotopies of curves on the diagram. So basically, you know, this is a sort of multi-pointed Hagar diagram for a knot or link in the three spheres. So we forget the base points, half of the base points. That allows us to reduce the diagram to something which is just a more apparent Hagar diagram for the three sphere. Apparent Hagar diamond for the three-sphere, and we kind of can keep track of the filtered chain maps that arise from those isotopes. Okay, so rather than say any more about the proof, I just want to conclude with a few questions, which I think are quite interesting to me, and which I hope that maybe some others would be interested in attacking as well. And so, I think to me, the character. And so, I think to me, the kind of most important and pressing question that our work raises is maybe not so much about fluoro homology, but about this group, which I think is worthy of further study. So maybe the most pressing problem is to determine the isomorphism type of this Grotendiek group of links. And so, you know, I don't know. I mean, topologically, like I said, to me, Merci B-Sun is just a really mysterious operation. I mean, and fascinating because of how difficult it is for me to understand. So I don't have any clue how to do this from a topological perspective. But there's sort of some theoretic questions that are raised, which might be helpful in attacking this problem. And so the first is, what is the image? Of our PoincarÃ© polynomial homomorphism in this algebraic group, not algebraic group in the technical sense, although, yeah. Okay, in this group of rational functions. And so maybe more specifically, is every, can I ask, is this surjective, for instance? This is surjective, for instance, or is every polynomial in Z, which lives in so the polynomials that you get from actual knots have natural number coefficients because that's recording ranks of groups. Is every such polynomial realized by a link? If so, then I guess that the answer to this question would be that that. The answer to this question would be that the image is the whole group, it's surjective. So, this falls under a realm. So, this is a geography question for not length fluorhomology. And while there are results of sort of non-existent, you know, bigrated collections of abundant groups in terms that don't arise from non-fluorarhomology, these come out of some work of Baldwin and Vilovic and Watson and I and others. And I, and others, I don't know of anything that's really specific to the top group and that can sort of rule out anything from occurring here. And so, maybe to conclude with another question here, as I'll note that Gabai's result shows that the first betting number, the minimal first betting number invariant of number invariant of a link that it's multiplicative under or sorry it's additive under um under under murasughi sum and so that tells you that it descends to a homomorphism on the grotendie group uh so and the grotendie group of the of the natural numbers additively is isomorphic to z To z. So we get this homomorphism, the second homomorphism, in addition to a Poinc-Gray polynomial homomorphism coming from Nopular homology. And as another question is the direct sum of this Poinc-Gray polynomial homomorphism and the first Betty number homomorphism. And isomorphism. So, this would be, you know, if you could say yes, then of course this would answer the kind of overarching problem at hand of what the isomorphism type is. I mean, you know, I'm not advocating that the answer is yes. I mean, you know, just even phrasing such a question seems sort of absurd because you would just think, well, there's no way that not floor homology detects all this stuff. But kind of a curious fact, which follows from this deep work in contact geometry. This deep work in contact geometry, the Giroux correspondence, is that it restricts this pair of homomorphism restricts to an isomorphism on the Grotendy group of fiber links. So, fiber links, you can look at just the corresponding group that they generate within this Grotendy group and this. And this group by Giroux or Giroux and Goodman is Z plus Z. And so this is the Betty number. That's recording B1. And this is recording the power of Z coming from the Maslow grading. Z coming from the Maslov grading. So for fiber knot, it's monic, so you just look at where the Maslov grading of that Z summand lives. And so this Z, this, you know, this Maslow grading is also known as the Hoffman variant of the two-plane field of the associated contact structure coming from that open book. And so the fact that this is an isomorphism in this kind of restricted setting coming from contact geometry just kind of makes me wonder whether or not there's some sort of bigger geometric picture at play, which Picture at play, which might explain and help classify this food. So I'll end there. Thanks. Hi, Bob. So this might be related to the second question, but if you know, if the top group in natural hormones has ranked, let's say, two or less, then the minimal genus ciphered service is unique. Services unique. So if you have two such links, and you take your reverseum, these results say that the doctor for that sum has rank four. In that case, the minimal genus cyber surface doesn't have to be unique. But can you say something about uniqueness using not photomology or anything else? Well, I mean, I think you can say something about uniqueness using suture philorometer. So, you know, there are different ways to form such Murasugi sums. Like, one way is to kind of Like one way is to kind of reverse the orientation or the normal orientation of the polygon. And this is kind of a technique that's been used in the suture manifold and sort of isotopy classification of cipher surfaces literature pretty extensively. So you can sort of Murasugi-sum like, you know, if I have two surfaces and I'm imagining one of my hands is the top poly is one polygon and the other is the other, you can murasugi-sum like this, or you could Murasugi-sum like that. So you could change which one's on top. And that would ones on top. And that will often and typically produce different surfaces up to isotopy. And you can distinguish those surfaces frequently using sutured fluorhomology and the sutured fluor polytope. I don't know if not fluorhomology on its own can do that because you lose all of the sort of additional information about the sutured fluoropolytope. But that's something that was kind of the purpose of that paper or one consequence of the paper that I wrote with Juhaas and Starkard years ago. Than Starkart years ago. So I don't have a great answer to your question. I don't know. Hi, Matt. Let me smell this up. Is it easy for you to write down to sort of describe how divert matrix of L1 and L2 are affected under a more stretching sum? Like, how do you combine the matrices? Yeah, I mean, that's. Yeah, I mean, that's the nature of this proof of this exercise here. You know, the only place where the two matrices interact are with, you know, the only place where things could go, you know, in the case of a connected sum, of course, like, you know, it's just a block sum of two cipher matrices. But, you know, in this case, you have these curves, which might, you know, these homologically essential. You know, these homologically essential curves here, this is for like L2 that sort might run through that polygon. And but accounting for that, you can sort of say, well, those are going to lie deeper down with respect to, you know, once you ultimately take the determinant of the cipher matrix minus t times its transpose. So I don't know, like, I don't know, like, I don't think there, well, there can't be a general formula for like how the Alexander polynomial behaves, but like you can sort of argue that. But, like, you can sort of argue that the Cyprus matrices look, they're not quite block sum, but they sort of can only differ from a block sum in sort of a small subset of the columns and rows. Okay, thank you. Yeah. I have a question for you. Is the is the Morris DP Sum operation at all well defined under um Defined under if you passed a link importance? Yeah, I think that's a great question. I mean, that was another sort of if I had had another, you know, five minutes to go over. If I went over another five minutes, I might have raised such a question. I mean, I think like there, I think it would be really interesting to sort of, you know, especially in light of our results on Tau and some of the things involving quasi-positivity that we've seen, like, you know, if there's some way that you can track this. Way that you can track this four-dimensionally in an algebraic setting. So, I mean, maybe a possible result would be to say something like, well, if you consider some kind of variant of concordance that's generated by like, you know, you think about that, you know, if you view concordance as a quotient of links by slice links, you could think about, well, what about the slice links that, for which you can find, for which you can verify sliceness by, you know, slicing along like what's often called a, you know, a A set of derivatives or something in the concordance literature. So you find a slice link on a ciphered surface for a link, and that slice link has the property that sort of has a lot of components and it's sort of framed accordingly with the ciphered service. If you have that, then you can use that to slice the link. And maybe for knots that bound, that are slice that bound ciphered surfaces for which you can find these derivatives with which. Derivatives with which to slice them, then maybe you could that would maybe be well behaved under these types of operations. But yeah, I've tried a couple different times throughout the years to find a meaningful thing. And so far, it eludes me. So what I was thinking of, that's great, but what I was thinking of, there's this notion of concordance of cipher services. Oh, oh, okay. Sorry, sorry, I misunderstood. Yeah. No, no, I think it it's a vague and open-ended issue because Issue because Morsugi sum is not canonical to the link, right? It depends on the two, but I thought, well, maybe there's some hope, and that might help shed light on this rook and beat proof construction. Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't know. It's interesting. I guess, are there any other quantities that are that you can compute for the Murasuki sum based on the two inputs, like crossing number or I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe in special, I mean, I think for subclasses, maybe, but I don't know of like, I don't know of any other general phenomena that are sort of on the nose, like well-behaved under Meristogi's sum. And the talent variant only is if it realizes the genus, right? Oh, well, actually, I mean, our theorem holds. I mean, in the case that, you know, even if you don't use an. Even if you don't use a minimal gene deciphered surface, but somehow then, like, you know, the top group is zero, and so it's kind of vacuous. I think that's so additivity of tau is true if tau equals genus. Yes. Okay, but not without that assumption. Yeah. I mean, maybe you can, you know, we wondered whether or not, like, if you can just say how tau behaves under plumbing, positive, and negative Hoffbands, and maybe this would give some recipe for computing. Maybe this would give some recipe for computing tau of fiber links or computing just its effect under plumbing. But we so far haven't been able to achieve anything. Do you want to explain your blue comment a little bit more that those two results are all on the bio machine? Oh, yeah. So, right, so the So, right. So, the way that Ospot and Sabo proved that the genus of a knot is detected by the highest Alexander grading of knot plural homology that supports non-trivial homology is, you know, is they use the fact that Gabbai says that, so we know, so suppose you have a minimal genus surface, then Gabai gives you a taut foliation with that surface as a compact leaf. compact leaf. And that topallation can then be capped off to give a top fallation on a zero surgery. And then that zero surgery then can be, it has a top fallation, it can be perturbed to a fillable contact structure. This relies on work of Etnier, Elie Ashberg, Thurston, and Elie Ashberg to perturb the foliation. And so now you get this embedding. And so now you get this embedding of the zero surgery into a compact, closed, symplectic four-manifold for which you can show the corresponding Hagar-Fuller four-manifold invariant is non-trivial. And then somehow this non-triviality of the four-manifold invariant implies non-triviality of the three-manifold invariant for zero surgery, which implies non-triviality of the not-fuller homology via a surgery formula. Via a surgery formula in the Alexander grading corresponding to the genus of that surface. I mean, I guess there's also another proof using just from a more purely three-dimensional perspective using Juhas' work in sutured floor homology that says, you know, sutured floor homology is some invariant associated to a knot or to a sutured manifold. So if you have a knot, you can form a sutured manifold by removing its neighborhood, taking two meridinal sutures. You can decompose that sutured manifold. You can decompose that suture manifold along a ciphered surface and use Gabay's existence of hierarchies adapted to the minimal genus ciphered surface together with Juhas' formula for how his invariant behaves under these types of decompositions to produce a non-triviality result. And I guess that's kind of the right way to think about this in the case of knots and also for the case of detecting vibrations. Okay, thank you. Yeah. All right, if there are no more questions, let's thank Matt one more time. Thank you.
