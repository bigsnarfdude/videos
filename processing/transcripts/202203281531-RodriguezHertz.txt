Thank you very much. So yeah, let's continue. Uh so I said I was going to put our default on the silver code. Let's go one and it's essentially very much the same as the linear. It's very much the same as the linear automorphism from lot of perspectives, so uh but I will have to go to inverse limits to to really make the complete analogy about this being an automorphism of the compatibility group. So I will not do it, just with this as the near automorphism, but for this guy some things are a little bit simpler to write down. You have one half, you have zero, you have one which is the same as zero, and this is the half of the. Any two points get separated and you can then imagine that essentially there is almost no stable set because every two points are being separated, though there is stable set. Being separated, though there is a table set, and we are going to complete in a second. But uh just here, so this statistic discontinuity is not a discontinuity, but we are in a circle, so everything is and good. We have a fixed point here, this is the same fixed point, one half is a perimeter from zero, so when I So when I iterate one half, it goes to zero and they is zero. So this is L2 and you can do m2 square which is m4 and this moment that you have, which are the four branches and if you do uh the n iter is you have two to the n branches. Of two to the n branches two to the n. So, this in a sense makes life simpler, but it does not, but still that's the formula for the iterate. Uh from there, okay, you can find easily if you want some periodic points or Periodic points, so you just want this to look at the pegs, or you want to look at the images of zero, meaning that this guy becomes an integer. But then if you really want to take x equals to one over pi and start multiplying by two and try to know where this point this is, and actually, it is very highly general, so not that I have an answer in any other format of what would do one over power. Format of what would do 1 over pi when you would say pi over 2. Actually, it is one of the obvious theory to know what 1 over pi would do, what pi would force, a signal. What's specifically the problem? Let's say I think that's one of the problems, if you can correct me. So you take pi that's the problem, but pi is not. Probably pi is not increasing 0 and 1, but divided by 4 and then it becomes increasing 0 and 1. And just look at this sequence of points interval. And then there is some series of questions you can make, and some of them probably are known, but some I think they are not. So is this set dense? So is this orbit closure dense? Or you can ask whether it is equal distributed. It is X distributed, then I should define what does meet this thing. The very precise guy, so I can answer this question for lot of X, which lot may mean lot of things, but not for any precise guy as well. But anyway, so let's then go on to that. So let's first compute here what is Here, what is a stable set of zero is a fun dx such that equal to the n of x goes to zero in this case of this difference in series of x points. And as I said, this guy is expanding all the time, so whenever you get closer, you will get out of it. So by doing the very same argument we did for the torus. And we did for the torus. So that there exists an n such that L2 to the n of x is less than epsilon, minus epsilon, or n larger than n. You see that the only way this would happen is if 2n of x be actual x, that's x, 0 and then 1. And then when it reaches zero, it stays at zero forever. So this table set then is on the point x such that L2 to the n of x equals to zero for some and all the preimages, the eventual pre-images of zero, which are all dyadic numbers. Dyadic right and rational numbers. I'm going exactly the same thing. Yeah, because all these things I only understand because I'm thinking of. Oh, but this, okay. So. I mean, these things are very easy for if you just look at the same standard. I fully agree. I'm going there, actually. Sorry, can I just ask a question before? Sorry, I can't ask a question before. What exactly did you say about the orbit of pilot orbit? So, what I meant is I'm trying to assume here. I hope I answered correctly the question. So, what I'm saying is that whenever you have a point x here reiterated, it will have to go to 2x and then to 4x, and then it will start escaping from 0. All right, so I've asked them specifically about five report, right? About five or four, I don't know, because oh, my god, four. These I'm not sure, I think one knows better than I whether this is normal or not. Whether it stands, that's what you're talking about, right? Right, yeah, that's what I'm just going to say. I'm going to go. And if it stands, is it diagonal strict? I'm referring to the question, right? Yeah, it's it's easier about the dyadic expression of pi. About the dyadic expression of pi. How many times 0 and 1 appears, so they have the Euclid distribution and also whatever string of zeros and ones. Yeah, so this times to map and then we go directly to symbolic stop. So this is the coding map for dyadic. Is the coding map for dyadic expansion of a number. So let's actually do this diagram expansion and at the same time decoding. So you call this guy zero, you call this one guy, this guy one. Of course there is some problem and uncertainty in the point zero and one, and there is also some sort of uncertainty in the point one half whether it should be pro to zero. The point one half, whether it should be equal to zero, one. But let's forget about these three points, which are very important to define the integral, but for the coding, they make lens. And so when you write the expansion of the point, x i equals equal to the i, i x dar s equal to 1, x i x r 1. And again, here is always uncertainty for the i. Here is always uncertainty for the numbers. Let's forget about these uncertainty sometimes. So the x1 is just being 0 if you lie in this interval and is being 1 if you lie in this interval here. This is the x1. Then how you recognize x2? Well, you apply 2x, you remove the x0, so you mod one. 0, so you mod 1 and this is sum, and now I sum from the next guy. From here, so the xi plus 1 is the x2, is asking me where the image of the guy lies, whether the zero or the one reach. Or the one breach. This interval I know, this interval I want. And what is important for these intervals is that the image are everything. And I'm just putting bracket, but don't take the brackets as if it were really brackets, so it's just they could be open, closed, because I never said whether the integrals here are open or closed. Intervals here are open or closed, and I don't want to discuss any points, it's just to make sure they go where they have to go. And this is again the same for the other guy. And so, what we are saying is that xi equals to zero if when I apply uh i minus one times, I guess, let's give it. You want to the integral is 0, and this 1 is by 1. So that's the dyadic expression of a point. And again, the problem with dyadics is that they eventually land into 0, and before landing into 0, they land into 1. To zero, they land into one-half, and so you have the problem here of whether you were belonging to zero or one. This is the answer that they but this of course gives you as well the failure coding, which is 0, 1 to the end into the circle. They are the projection, which you can define two ways. One is this sequence, and the other is this way. So, not this way, but almost this way. I have to take the eta. I have to take the intersection of the corresponding inverse branches. So if I call words, but you take this inverse branch here, T0, and this inver branch here, which is one half or one half, and then you do the intersection of all the corresponding intervals, which are determined by this. Maybe spend two seconds on that. So I've given this exam. We are doing this xi and then we do the x i of the r E x i minus one corresponds I x i, if I did it correctly, so you define this. Actively outdated. I x0 is i x1. I may have a shift of i plus 1 or i minus 1. Problem there. But you define essentially that depending on the sequence, let's say the sequence starts from 0, then you take the integral and you bring this. One to here i zero, then if your so this is you start with x y equals zero, then the x to k equals to one, then you apply this interval to t1. So applying this interval to t1 brings you here by one to x and so on. So I always miss Always mess up with that. Maybe I should have not for the color, I'm sorry. This should have been a subset of this guy. The other direction. So the DX1 tells me that I am not like this, then I take the second guide this, I take t x equals 0 1 and then t x down and then I And then I keep on doing this procedure dx n dx 1 flag number 1. The point is that this is the inverse branches. When I take the inverse of this guy, I get exactly L2 to D. So, this is a sequence of intervals which are one inside the other and has lengths 1 over 2 to the n. So, in the limit of the time which is 5 degrees. And again, the try to say the gun how it is. Definition, so you want this to be true. Start from your xn look where the xn tells you where to map this t, and then you keep on going back. xn minus 2 minus 2, xn minus 2, minus 2, x1. And this will determine an interval somewhere of size 1 over 2 to the n, where all the guys in this interval. Where all the guys in this interval will satisfy that they lie, where the x1 is the same where you lie, then the x2, when you iterate one, you will have the x2, you iterate twice, x3, and all the way up to x1. This interval is doing the same thing as this sequence for the first n internals. And then, of course, we don't know more. More? Just go and delete it. Okay, so this is what is called a Markov partition, and essentially the only thing that was needed in order to define something like this was these two properties, plus one more that it's important or not important depending on what you really want. So I said that this guy has length going to zero and so this goes to a point. And so this goes to a point. And for this, I require that the derivative of these guys are always one-half, which means that the derivative of L is always larger than one. But if I don't require this length to be smaller than one, then this is still a nested sequence of intervals and it will have a limit, which will be an interval. Then, of course, pi of x. interval. Then of course pi of x is not the point, it's just an interval of points where I cannot much. So what I mean with this, I mean the following. So take E any map from the circle into the circle, monotone, strictly monotone. Degree D, which let's say larger than equal to 2. Oh, this is the same as saying it's a covering map, essentially. And the circle. Oh, something like that, which after all was not exactly times two, something which So, this map is compute. We have a fixed point somewhere, so let's put it at zero, the fixed point, fix not much harm. This fixed point will have deep re-images because it's degraded map and it's monotone, so it has exactly the re-images. Also, it has exactly the three images. So if you put them here, here is the fixed point, so this is one of these three images. Of course, one is the semi-zero. And since these are the three images, you have that your guy with your passion for this of all these branches. Where C one essentially derivative has to be less than or equal to zero because of monopolicity typically. Because of monotonicity, typically you will want derivative positive state, like simple inverse branches to be differential, but it's not really necessary because it's a polo construction. And if you want a little bit more, you will ask these derivatives to be larger than one, so that when you take these matches, you are contracting all the time. But again, this is a topological construction, so I have this sort of coding. This sort of coding. Now we go between this I naught, this I naught, this I d minus one. And then you have this sort of not very well defined map, which does the same as I did before. Take of all these branches, the For this branches, d i from 0, 1 into 3 i exactly the same definition. And now the limit, of course, is And now the limit, of course, is an interval. That's why I put this quotation here. Because I'm not really mapping into the circle, I'm mapping into some intervals on the circle. I could collapse these intervals on the circle, I still could get a circle dynamics. Or I could ask that the lengths or diameters of this. Lengths and diameters of these intervals go to zero, so that be a pi of x. This is, I will not write the propositional theorem that essentially will say exactly what I said. If I have such a monotone map and these diameters go to zero, then you have this coding quality. Okay, and now the point is that I didn't need any mod D X mod one, so no. X mod one, so no isolated notion, it's just a purely topological description of the dynamics. And the only thing you need if you want to make your life even nicer than what I got is that this EI primes is assumption. Then his length will go to zero. Less than lambda less than lambda. I'm sorry, I yes, I I missed the relation between T and the T so these are so this is the transformation T and this is the branches of inverse of T i's right inverses of the data. Here the point is the non-invertibility. So that's experiment with T and then you discover what the T i T i is. The Ti the T i's are all these branches of inverse. So I I would take the inverse, but I don't have an inverse. Or you were assuming things like you take it strictly monotone, so it exists. But in general, yeah, for any measurable or all that you see worse. Yeah, but no, then, well, yeah. Oh, the way I also have a question. So, this is one transformation T, which is monotone? Yes, yes. So, monotone on the circle, meaning that So, monotone on the circle, meaning that you keep on going around. So, this really looks like this. The covering map, if you want the topological. Yeah, because you have always to go. It's not one-to-one, so then what do you do with a little last priority? No, no, no, you're assuming it's finite. You're assuming it's finite. It's the 3D map, continuous map, covering map of the circle. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, that's. No, what you are saying is much more complicated dynamics that exist and is very well studied, or maybe not very well, not as well as it should. Beta H1 and then render somewhere here. Then then, well, there are some situations. There are some situations, which is called one beta is a piece of number, where you have a partition like this that works, and then pretty much you are fine. But here is a nice coding, so it's a full shift. This map is one to one now. You can check essentially the same way you could do with The same way you could do with WexMod 1, that this map is 1 to 1, unless you have this uncertainty of two guys that has the same pen point. Guy being 0. Let's just change the basis from your two equipment. Yes, essentially that's it. But the point is that this is defined for any covering map of the circuit. I need to assume anything other than if you want this derivative to be possible and you can write it in a multiple project. In smooth dynamics you want to do a little bit more than just the linear maps. So and okay, now you just do the same as with the linear maps and you get description of every covering. Description of every covering map of the silicon of degree larger or equal to rule. If the degree is less than or equal to minus 2, essentially you take the square of the map which have positive degree, and there is still some uncertainty from the first iteration or the odd iterates that you have. It's not uncertainty, that you have to play it. And if degree is one and it's covering, then it's a homeomorphism, so then you treat them as the rotation. Then you treat them as the rotations. I didn't point a theory I plan to do, but there is a theory attached to it. And if the degree is minus one, then it's also a homeomorphism, but reversing orientation, then it has a fixed point, because reversing homeomorphism has a fixed point, and then you take again the square of the map, and it will be a homeomorphism of the circle, but with a fixed point, which are much nicer. So really these pictures essentially give a complete topological description and to some extent of covering maps of the circuit from the purely topological point of view. Okay, so you you got that as uh you take space right there and then you Space there, and then you start applying this sequence of intervals, and then it goes to a point under some hypothesis. So, sure, it goes to an interval because it's a nested intersection of intervals. So, you just need to make sure the length or diameter goes to C. And then you put some hypothesis that make it true. Or option number two, you collapse these intervals and then you you again get a circle that is a different dynamics. Well actually so it may not be a fixed point because it could be the preimages of fixed points as well but certainly it can be an attracting fixed point and that's the part of the problem. So if you had a point x x let's say p of 0 by 2 by 2 times 0 is less than 1 then yeah when you are looking at the 0 0 0 sequence these intervals will not be shrinking so there will end up being some fixed interval which is what is called the basin of attraction of of the 0 0 0. Um uh whether it has to go with periodic identity. Unless you keep it as an exercise in my answer that they have to always be a periodic or quantitative they can be really monetary. I'm quite sure that a little bit of smoothness is only periodics. Okay, so that's the topological description, and I did. Description, and I didn't finish my description of the partition into stable sets, but you know it. Your E-naut partition, no? Your E-naut equivalence relation. By the way, I was going to say that I forgot to say no this coding is exactly the same thing you do slow. Uh what Slavo did for us uh to show that every polished space every polished space is the image of n to the n. What we just did was not with squares but with segments, just cover our guy by segments and then each of the guys in the cover will sub cover by segments and then we keep on doing that. The very same proof is simply. The very same proof is simply a dynamical proof, and so you get the dynamical as well. So and an analysis summarize well okay, let's summarize you're given T Let's ask for definiteness. So let E So let P be C1 knock D prime of X larger than 1 for X larger than 1, which by compactness implies larger than constant larger than 1. Then, I'll degree Of the quality D, which has to be positive because the ribotic is positive, then there exists a dma from 0 minus 1 to the n circle continues onto On to I open is given by this procedure. Moreover, Moreover, there exists an edge from the circle to the circle. Signals the shift map, right? Signals the shift map, no, I should proceed. And a homeomorphism just has an orientation. There's an orientation such that H compose T is equal to the multiplication by D compose H. And not only that, so this homeomorphism is essentially the dyadic coding for multiplication by D modulo this pi. Okay, so if I do pi and then I compose this pi with this homomorphism, this is the So this is for the size of text I divided by the size of the map. Pi is given exactly by this formula, but it's also given by that nested sequence. I got a lot of Xi are the boundaries between these. Xi is a sequence. Oh, better, okay. As the upshot, you get this previous symbolic representation. Yeah, so that it means that the age, so the device is symbolic representation. So the device is a symbolic representation of this T, and this is the same symbolic coming from the object, essentially. The the the the pi? Yeah. No, the pi is not injective, but is essentially exactly as non-injective as the dialectic H because the H is homeoscope. Because the age is homeos or really it's difficult. So phological nerves are fit to be expansion of points. Lossality expansion. Okay, now I should go on to one more example before I try to extend this to Extend this to the linear automorphisms and description for the linear algorithm so what the so this is the this precise proposition, but let me remind you that the key key observation Observation was that you have this device of i sub j j 0 to p minus 1 such that the union of i sub j is e to the power 0 1. Interval 0, 1. Now, just for the finishedness, let me assume they are closed. Interval 0 ij intersecting ik is contained in the boundary of them. So that should mean that they are either disjoint or the intersection is one point. Is one point, or in the degree two, it could be two points, but no more than that. So they have empty, the interiors are disjoint like that, and such that when I apply P of each of these ij, this gives me the whole circle. Are the main properties of the guy, and this is an example of the Markov partition. Did you define Market partition? No, that's why it's just not the definition because you want more. Definition because you want more freedom for the Markov partition. So this is the ultimate nice Markov partition. And where does that get out there? Delta and gamma. So south boundary, yeah. Delta south boundary. Okay, let's be sad. And so this is the key observation, then the derivative larger than one, or the fact that the inverses has derivatives smaller than one is what makes things like a majority. Let me now move one more statement. Let me not go to the outer morphisms of the torus. Let me go to Snayde's function, which is simpler to describe from this point of view. Now it's an invertible system, but let's Now it's an invertible system, but let me start with the symbolic type. So you take 0, 1, the z, and you have the shift again here, but now it's in vertical, so it goes both ways. And let me separate, repeat a little bit what I did for the degree 2 map. For the degree two map on the circle, but in the slightly different version of it, which is duplication by three, that I remove the identity. So now this is the transformation which goes from the union of these two intervals Now, of course, it doesn't map into itself, so I cannot iterate every point. But there is a larger set, which is C, which are the points you can iterate infinitely times. That x belongs to the set, t of x belongs to the set, and so on. And this is the standard middle cell counter set. Ratios, but as before, what is really important is that this derivative be larger than 1, and this derivative be larger than 1. And other than that, the rest is good, so I can. The rest is good, so I can call this I0, I can call this, we call it I2 instead of I1, that is thing. And you have now this map into this counter set pi defined exactly the same as before, with the advantage now that this is a advantage now that this is a common morphism. So now this is invertible because there is no uncertainty. Because the intervals are disjoint closures. Yes and we have this equal to C and so we have here the diagram. Shift the D C But now, as I said, I want to move into invertible system. So, what will be my invertible system? What is the causal? This was not the causal. Now, we have got to the cortex. Let me draw the picture. Coursewho, let me draw the picture of the coursework and then I explain what's the point of the discourse. So, this called Corsa, because it's supposed to look like the course room. But to be more precise, what is important is that it looks really like that. Rectangles, R1 and R2, R0 and R1. And then the vertical direction will look like this. And the horizontal direction will look like the inverse of this. Means that the vertical direction will look like the future part of this, the horizontal direction. Part of this, there is something of the negative part of this. So I really think of this guy as being 0, 1 to the minus n times 0, 1 to the n, and then the 0 should go to some of the guys. Let's put it here. So it's a product space of two copies of that guy. So w how is this map T now defined? T now defined. I take the R0, I contract, and I map it and drop an R0, which is not a rotation by 90 degrees. So it's a linear map, if you want, contracting in this direction, expanding in this direction. If I wanted to be a lidar map, I should have made the corners coincide. I'm doing some sort of extension. Extension. R1 and R0 are subsets of the line. Rectangles of the plane, of the plane. So R0 and R1 are rectangles. I could be more precise, but I have two rectangles, so not homomorphic. You can do machine learning. And you're taking some association of that rectangle with this. Of that rectangle with this image? Yes, I will. You mean this one or that one? To that one. To that one. No, this is just the graph of a map. So it is some association which the horizontal. So the segment is a different. No, no, it does not take it. No, no, it doesn't rotate. It does not rotate. It does not rotate. It constructs and it expands. So if you want that maybe, let's do it 100% precise. Oh, sorry. I understand. R naught is so minus epsilon, one plus epsilon. 1 plus epsilon times times epsilon 1 cell plus epsilon, so just here a bit of room there for this. Horizontal rectangle, far one is pretty much the same. F naught plus the vector 0 to third. Shift it up directly. And then you define air pressure. And then you define f restricted to R0 is at the point x is the labs 3 x 1 1 so x 1 x 2 okay. Cannot write the matrices as linear maps at the same time. matrix like that. x is x1, x2 and then f restricted to r0 is essentially the same guy, but there is f of r naught, which is now a little bit more painful. You see that Now, a little bit more painful, it's still a linear map, but then I translate it so that it that. So it would be lit x1, one star x2 plus some translation that you will have to guess. Really interfere exactly here. Freshman student complaining. You want to reverse the 3x no one? Okay, you're right. The vertex. The vertical. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Sometimes one server, I'm sorry, it's just my get it gets worse, if any. So there is something you squish in the vertical you so it's as I said, this So as I said, this interval is the vertical interval and in the horizontal you have the inverse of a negative guy, so it it's you essentially will do you take your rectangle here, you bring it to zero, you multiply it and then you translate it over there. So that there is a issue. But essentially if you want uh Basically, if you want, let's say L1 is this, over here will be the point first coordinate 0, second concoordinate 1 third, or second coordinate 1 if you wish. The exact formulas are natural. Okay. Gone. Okay, important is this. That you have plane contraction and plane expression. Plane contraction and plane expansion, and here the vertical lines are mapped to vertical lines, the horizontal lines are mapped to horizontal maps. Actually, the verticals in a very nice way, because any vertical is shrinked into some vertical, some other place, like into some verticals. Now, for the horizontals, they get expanded, so it will break for the definition, so then it will get too long, so some part will. Then it will get too long, so some paragraph is here, some paragraphs here. But in any event, if I go to the inverse of this map, on the horizontals it will be shrinking. N miss vertical which also tries. On the horizontals are contracted, the verticals are expanded, so the verticals are contracted for the inverse. So every vertical will go either here. So if I take this So if I take this segment over here, will go, since it is there, this segment will go somewhere here. 30% will be like that. And for the inverse, something like that will become more or less the middle. Perhaps that you can iterate. Again, yeah, you have the same problem as before. So you cannot iterate everything, but you will have two sets which are useful, C plus and C minus. So C plus are the points that you can iterate infinitely many times from the future. C minus are the points that you can iterate infinitely many times from the past. And you have And you have intersection, which is the guise that you can draw infinite number for the function of the past. And you have your map, homeomorphism, from your column 0, 1 to the z here, where r0 and r0 are your column 0, 1. So pi of x, so this pi will be defined. So this pi will be defined the same as in one def in one dimension. So pi of the sequence xi is x if f n of x belongs to Use this to define map property, you use it to define the map and you have to show it's a well-defined map. These are for positive. This is for every entity. For every entity. I should stop, actually, but just do essentially the same you did before. That's why it is important to have a C plus and C minus. So So you can forget the horizontal direction. Why? We know that horizontals are mapped into horizontals. You can't quotient by the horizontal direction. Get a map from the interline. And then you do this actually. So then your arrow pi here, pi goes from the intersection of C plus C minus to 0, 1 to the C minus 1. No, it's from the sequences to going out. These two going up. I take a sequence, pi of a sequence of xp. I take a sequence of x pi's of x n f of p, yes, okay. But I let's talk, maybe I'll start. Let's talk. Maybe I'll start tomorrow. Questions about this? This is the horseshoe. And the point is that the horseshoe is the same because if you look at who was mapped here. The horseshoe is supposed to be a map? Yes, the horseshoe is this. This map that takes the rectangle and map it which sends this horizontal into here, this vertical into here, and then the sides. And so you can see that there is a rectangle here that is mapped exactly. That is mapped exactly into this rectangle, and there is another rectangle here, which is mapped exactly into this rectangle. And then there is an assumption that on these rectangles, so on these horizontals and on this vertical, the derivative is contracting in the horizontal a lot. You have to make some definitions and then it's expanding the verticals or contracting. Expanded the article, so contracted the particular uh red camera is this part you mean of the the third red camera that you oh yeah yeah yeah reverse orientation yes you're right yes in in the standard horse there is a orientation reversing uh issue yeah and so yeah this this guy and this guy depends on how I draw this should be recognized property. Any questions? Okay, let's make any time now. We're a bit behind schedule, but let's set one out five minutes, so that would be starting again at 4:32.
