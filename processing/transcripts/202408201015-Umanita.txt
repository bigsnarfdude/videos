But I'm pleased to not get out of the way. The next talk, Veronica, Decoheritz, Bries.algebra for uniformly used quantum computing. Okay, thank you for your introduction. And I'd like to thank Jorge for giving me the opportunity to take part in this project. And this is my first time in Mexico. My first time in Mexico and so in Oaxaca. This is a beautiful place. And the talk I'll present give an overview on the coherence topic and in particular the results I'll introduce are done in collaboration with Franco and Emmanuela. Emmanuela, and they are about the structure of the Lecoherence-free sub-algebra for uniformly continuous quantum Markov semi-rule. And also about the crucial role that this algebra plays in the study of these things. The plan of the talk is the following. After introducing the general definition of environmental Of environmental the coherence and the coherence piece of algebra. I'll restrict the study to the case of uniformly continuous quantum Marcosim groups and I'll present the structure theorem for atomic the coherence principle algebra. And then I'll explain as this structure theorem changes changes. Theorem changes changes in the not necessarily atomic case. And in the final part of my talk, I'll assume the existence of a Facebook normal covariance state. And I'll establish that in this case, the decoherence piece of algebra must be atomic. And so this fact has very important consequences on the environment. Environmental the coherence and on the structure of reversible and environmental. So let me begin by introducing the setting and motivation. We know that a closed quantum system behaves in a unitary way, but when it interacts with the environment, the phenomenon of the coherence The phenomenon of the coherence takes place, and it is manifested by the loss of star automorphic properties of the roof. As a consequence, the system evolves in an irreversible way, and this evolution is approximately described by a quantum microscope. On the other hand, it is known that the coherence is The coherence is the mechanism responsible for the appearance of classicality in quantum measurement. And because the coherence practically destroys the quantum inferences among states. And so it forces the system to carry only classical information. And so this leads to an information loss. To an information loss to the impact. And since in different applications this is a problem, it is important to minimize the impact of the decoherence. And two approaches have been introduced to design. On one hand, the theory of the coherence-free sub-algebras consists in identifying In identifying maximal sub-algebras undergoing a star automorphic evolution, and this notion is related to the so-called environment-induced decode, introduced by Blanchard and Orkievitz and then generalized by Almik, Rafaela Carbone, and Emmanuel Armet. On the other hand, the theory of the query and spring subsystem is the counterpart in the Eisenberg picture. In the Eisenberg picture, in the sense that its aim is looking for portions of the full system on which the state components evolve unitarily, regardless of the rest. And in this talk, I consider only the first approach. So in the following, I denote by M a von Neumann algebra. A von Neumann algebra acting on a complex separable in the space H and by T a quantum Markov semi group on M described its reversible, the irreversible evolution. A quantum Markov semi group is simply a weakly star continuous semi group of linear bounded operators defined on M such that every map is identity V and means that T is Markovian. T is Markovian. Every map is completely positive. That means that these inequalities have been filed. And finally, is normal. And normality is the continuity with respect to the real start topology on the algebra, since every fundamental algebra is the dual of a band. Algebra is the dual of a Banach space called the perdual. So the perdual semigroup of T is the strongly continuous semigroup defined on the per dual space in this way. And it gives the evolution of space. In this setting, we say that there is environment-induced decoherence or environmental decoherence on the system if we can split. On the system, if we can split the algebra into the direct sum of two parts, an algebra M1, which is the maximal von Neumann algebra, undergoing star automorphic evolution, and the remaining part, M2, non-zero, which are closed and invariant with respect to the evolution and the action design. And moreover, this action vanishes in time when T. vanishes in time when t goes to go to and one is called a coherent space of algebra while m2 is the space of not detectable of them and so when the coherence takes place we have that after a sufficiently long time the the system behaves as a closed system and precisely as the closed system described by Described by the coherence principle. So, unfortunately, it is very difficult in general to realize one such decomposition, of course, also because spaces M1 and M2 are not unique determinant. And we have two natural candidates that are and T. that R and T defined as the biggest polynomial algebra on which the semi-group acts as a star homomorphism and the space we denoted by M0 given by operators on which the semi-group goes to zero and they will start to m0 is a norm closed end star and it invariant but it's not in general necessary weak star close moreover they Moreover, the intersection between N0 and T is not in general trivial. And finally, Nt is preserved by the semigroup, but the action of the semi-group could not be justified. When this happens, and we know that there are some equations in which it happens, then NT is the unique coherence principle for the system. This budget of the system. For example, this is the case when there is a staff full normal invariant state, or when T is a uniformly continuous semi-group on B of H, or again if T is the minimal quantum Markov Semil loop generated by a GKS alphon. So for example, the Gaussian quantum Marko Semi loop satisfies this condition. Satisfies this condition. And so for Gaussian-quantum-market symbols, and T is the coherency. Moreover, in these cases, we show that the space of not detectable observables is exactly n-zero if its intersection with an issue. But when we can say that these are, for example, in this. For example, in the finite dimensional case, the intersection is always trivial. And so we can conclude that in this case, the coherence takes place if and only if we have the decomposition given by NTMF. And this is the unique way to realize the decomposition demanded by the query. Moreover, we obtain another asymptotic decomposition of the full algebra using Of the full algebra using the Jordan decomposition of the generator, since we can write the full algebra as a direct sum of the so-called reversible space RT, which is simply the vector space generated by eigenvectors of L corresponding to purely imaginary eigenvalues. while the remaining space B corresponds to the principal spaces associated with a game value with strictly negative real part. And we showed that V is exactly M0, but in general the reversible space is strictly contained in the decoupled space value. However, one resistor However, one resist of F-pull normal and involved invariant state, these algebras are the same. And so we can conclude that in this case the coherence takes place and the decomposition is unique. Moreover, we can realize the coherence piece of algebra as the image of a conditional expectation, namely a normal projection, having as kernel mz. So this conditional expectation allow us Expectation allows us to recover the decomposition given induced by the coherence in another way. And this result completely solved the problem of the study of the coherence in the finite dimensional. But I'd like to highlight that the Jordan decomposition of the generator is simply a Of the generator is simply a particular case of the so-called Jacobs-DeLuck clickbait splitting happening for the quantum Markov semi-group with a faithful normal invariant state acting on an arbitrary vonoma. This splitting is given by the reversible algebra, but in this case it is the weak star closure of the space defined in the finite dimension. In the finite-dimensional case. While the stable space becomes the space of all operators having zero as weak star cluster point of their orbit. And we have the natural inclusion FT contained in the equivalence piece of algebra, NT, while M0 is contained in the stable. In the stable. And further, NT is the irreversible algebra is the major of a normal condition expectation that it is compatible with the state, that means that it satisfies. And we is a very good idea. It is easy to see that there is a strong connection with the coherence induced by the decomposition induced by the coherence. And in the final part of this talk, I'll show that these decompositions are exactly the same when T is uniform. So now I consider only uniformly continuous quantum Marko semi-groups. continuous quantum Marko semi-groups for which the operators T T are null convergent to the density for the time goes to when the time goes to T. And in this case the generator is a linear bounded operator and can be represented in a GKSL form in this way by means of a family of operators LK. Operators L K called Kraus operators and an Hamiltonian operator H, sub adjoint operator. Krauss operators give the dissipative part of the generator due to the interaction environment and the amylonian gives the amylonic. As I said before, in this case, Before in this case, and T is the biggest phenomenon algebra, which the action is star automorphic. But the action of the semigroup is even unitary, unitary and associated with the Hamiltonian in any GKSR representation. Moreover, we can characterize this algebra in terms of limbled operators. Through this expression, the component of this. So now I consider the atomic case, and I call that a von Lehmann algebra is called atomic if every non-zero projection majorizes a non-zero minimal projection. And it is equivalent to require the existence of a family, I, countable family. Of multi-orthogonal minimal projection in the center, summing up to the identity, and such that every algebra is a type 1. A factor is an algebra having a trivial center, the center here, this way, and a type 1 factor. Type 1 factor is a factor with a minimal projection. Project and if the algebra is atomic, we can write it as the direct sum of the algebras Pi and Pi, simply because every Pi commutes with every element in M. But it is known that every type one factor is isomorphic to B of. To B of Ki with a suitable multiplicity space I. And so we can conclude that atomic algebra, the equivalent space of algebra is atomic if only if you can write this as the direct sum of these type 1 factors according to the decomposition of the inverse space, the direct sum of this tensor. And this means, for example, if you consider the finite-dimensional case and we take as a countable set i, the set with two elements. If you write T7 in this way, so as the sum of the tensor. The tensor space C2, tensor C2, and C3 tensor C. The previous result says that every matrix in NT can be written in this way as a block diagonal matrix. Here we have exactly two blocks since we have two factors, type one factor, and each block is itself. And each block is itself a block diagonal matrix. For example, if you consider the first block, since the multiplicity of the space C2 here is two, we have two identical diagonal blocks. And so in general, we can see every element in and t as a block diagonal matrix with this property. And the important thing is important thing is that the limbled operators in an indicator representation inherit this block diagonal form. So we can write these in. As a consequence, the system splits in the sum of its noiseless parts and its decadence affects. The credence affected part in the sense that we can write the fact we can factorize the semi-group as composition of two homogeneous quantum markers in group that are essentially independent. And the first part is called the coherence free semi group and it describes a unitary evolution in accordance. In accordance with this Hamiltonian. Okay, while the other semigroup called the coherence-affected semigroup has the generator given by this limbled operator. And in addition, if you consider the action of the semigroup on BKI times B of I, we have that every factorized operator. factorizing operator evolve unitally as the first component the first component evolving unitally and the second one evolves in according with the TMR the same happens for the state indeed if you consider a factorized state raw the component its component component, its component supported on Ki about units according to Ki. And this is exactly the definition of the coherence-free sophistication. Now I present an example in order to show that not all the coherent space of algebras of uniformly continuous quantum Markov loops are. forming continuous quantum market semi groups are atomic. I consider the group, the free group on n generators with n is greater than 2 and I take as a base space L2 of G and with the orthonormal basis 1 of G where 1 G is the characteristic function of the singleton G. And for every U in the inverse space In the Hilbert space, we can define operators U and R U which are exactly the left and the right convolution with U. When U belongs to the, is an element of the orthonormal basis, these operators are bounded and also unique. For example, they are joint of Of the last multiplication by the one of G is exactly the last convolution with one of the inverse of G. And moreover, it is known that the von Reumann algebras generated by the left and right convolutions are von Neumann algebras without minima. Algebra without minimal projection, and so these algebra are not atomic by definition. And we have that the common term of graphic G is exactly the calligraphic R. So we can, if you are able to construct a quantum Marto semi-group having Rg as the coherence piece of algebra, we are to this end. To this end, we consider a summable sequence of 50 positive numbers lambda g and define the operator L on V of H in this way. We can immediately see that L is a stressive image case L representation with null Hamiltonian and the Kraus operator L of 1G. And so it generates a unique. And so it generates a uniformly continuous quantum Markov semi-group having as the queer space of algebra simply the computant of Graus operators that is Rg for the previous slide. And so this is an example in which the decoding split subalgebra is not atomic. So the question is what happens in the general case? Can we obtain some decomposition of the decomposition? Some decomposition of the coherence piece of algebra. And moreover, in this case, this decomposition has some influences on the form of the genetics. And the answers are all positive. And to obtain this decomposition, we make use of the direct integral field. direct integral u the result the final result result is the following we can obtain an integral decomposition of nt where each every component nt is no sorry not every component and t gamma is a factor for almost every gamma and so graphistic we replaced that sum of type one Direct sum of type one factor with the direct integral of factors and the limblad operators inherit these direct integral presentations. In this way, finally, if you denote by T gamma, the control marker semigroupus generator is described by the gamma component of H and L case. H and L case, the gamma component of NT is exactly the decoherence free to algebra of the semigroup gamma. Now I don't spend any time on the mathematical details of this result in order to skip of introducing the heavy theory of Using the heavy theory of direct integrals. But I just to point out that the integral decomposition of NT can be written in equivalent way in this way, as there are sum of two algebra Q and T Q and the sum of a countable family of two algebra Pi and T P I, where P where P, Pi and Q give a countable family of mutually orthogonal projection in the center, summing up to the identity. And moreover, we have that every algebra Pi and T P i is a factor. Pi is minimal in the center, while Q and T Q either is zero or is center is without minimal projection. In this line. In this last case, we can say that also Q and T Q does not have minimal projection. This result can be obtained by the integral decomposition of N T simply splitting the measure space capital Gamma, which we integrate as a union of its continuous. Union of its continuous and discrete part and the Q is the orthogonal projection the corresponding continuous part of the base space while HPI is the orthogonal projection on the space H gamma okay now in this last part I I assume the existence of a faithful normal invitation. Then, under this condition, we were able to prove that the projection Q is zero. Otherwise, we can find a minimal projection in the corresponding algebra. And this is not possible for this. So, q zero, and then we put zero and then we prove that every algebra pi and t p i is type one and so n t must be atomic this is the main result the the query principle algebra of a uniformly continuous quantum microsimi group having stateful normal invariance is necessary so we have the block diagonal Block diagonal structure of NT that I described before, and also they actioned the semi-group given in this way. But we can prove that every T y is irreducible and it has a unique faithful invariant state τm. And as a consequence, the decoherent price of algebra of this semi-group is trivial. So we can So we can say that the action on BKI tensor BMI is unitary on the first component and purely dissipative on the second one. Because TMI, there are not operators acting on MI that evolved in a star automorphism and And as a first consequence, we have that the coherence always takes place if this decomposition induced is unique given by nt and zero. But moreover, nt coincides with the variable algebra and n0 with the stable. And so the decomposition demanded by the coherence is the same of that one given by the Jacob the U need. And so we can say that the result obtained for uniformly continuous quantum microsembles are the same given in the finite dimensional state. Moreover, since I see Since Nt is the image of a normal conditional expectation E, we can consider the predual map of E, obtaining an operator from the space of trace class operators, which is the predual of H, to the predual of N T. And we showed that the predual of N T is given by And T is given by reversible or rotating states. That is, this space we denoted by T star is the closure of the vector space generated by a vector sigma associating with modulus one eigenvalue. Moreover, every rotating state is the same. Rotating state is diagonal with respect to the block decomposition of the decoherence piece of algebra, and it is given by the convex combination of diagonal states at high tensor tau of mi for any normal state supported on KR. We can, in addition, We can, in addition, specialize these decompositions for invariant states, since every invariant state is reversible. And we obtain in this way that a normal state eta is variant if and only if it is a convex combination of the agonal states, tensor, type, and i, but in this case, eta i commutes with the corresponding Hamiltonian. Corresponding Hamiltonian capital Ki of the same group tau. And this form of invariant states, I recall that one introduced by Federico yesterday for the Gaussian state. But here we have the assumption of the existence of a petronormal Manian state. So maybe there is some Maybe there is some connection, but we have to explore this. So I conclude here my talk, and thank you for your attention. Thank you for the talk. And when you mentioned the freight group, When you mentioned the freight group and the generators that you have, were you able to, because you have this assumption about the faithful normal concurrency? So can you explain a little bit more, like why does it, it doesn't work in that case, and if there is an unerr, let's say, not a dealing group for which these conditions work in this case, I think. In this case, I don't know if there is a faith from variance state. This example is only to show that the coinspace of algebra of the uniform continuum quantum market group is not necessarily atomic. I don't know if there is a free convalescent state. Maybe. No. Ah, no, yeah, sorry. Yeah, it does not exist. Otherwise, the algebra. Otherwise, the algebra is atomic story. Yes. What about for their non-abelian groups? Do you have for abelian groups that you have? I don't know. No. And then we also have a key that we have to collect. Yeah, so we can advise this. So we need to automatize the decays of an ambiñago. Oh, the online person. You're speaking, we cannot yet hear you. Alexander. Excuse me, may I ask a question? Yes, yes, go ahead. If you see the work, possibly recent work by Hessenor and Carl on the generators of quantum dynamical semi-groups with invariant sub-algebras. They discuss also atomic algebras, but not only for Neumann, but some algebra atomic algebras without units. Atomic algebras without unity. I don't know. Do you see these results there in a certain sense very close to discussion of the De Gorgian free atomic subalgebras? But they also consider not only von Neumann atomic subalgebras, but how these results related or not, or possibly don't not or possibly don't see these results i don't know sorry how these results is related yes related to your results i mean i mean uh why why do in some people have this uh atomic subalgebra without unity uh for quantum dynamical semi-groups and and you are not i i try to understand what why what is the difference or what is the problem here So every one algebra are the unit. Yes, yes. And I saw the works where they consider the coherence-free subalgebras which are not for Neumann, but for algebras without unitary, but atomic. They nevertheless call them atomic. No, in certain sense, they are something, they add some zero blocks to the Zero blocks to the your block structure, something like that. I mean, do you know this works or and how why they need it and you did not need this kind of algebras? No, sorry, I don't know. Okay, uh also this very complicated question. I Question. Thank you. Any other questions? All right, then let's thank our speaker again.
