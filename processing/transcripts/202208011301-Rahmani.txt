Yes. Okay, thank you so much, Mayang. So, as you said, yes, this topic is a little different from all the other talks that have been discussed, but well, I hope that it would interest still the community. So, this was a work that was done in collaboration with Akanksha Gupta at IIT Kampur. At IIT Campour, which was a PhD student, I'd be supervised, then Luis Joffre from a technical university of Catalonia in Spain, who's my collaborator. And so, unfortunately, let me figure this out so I cannot. Sorry, something went wrong. Oh, okay. So I'm going to give an over. I'm going to give an overview of the talk first. So, I'll talk first about the problem of plastics and particularly microplastics in the ocean. And then, I'm going to talk about the core of our study, which is the DNS of aggregation of microplastics and biogenic particles, the collision models, and the problem of settling. And also, finally, the conclusions and the many open questions that exist in the area. So, I don't know if you can see me then. So, I don't know if you can see me when I turn pages because I think it didn't work in the beginning. So, please let me know if it's just stuck on the first page. But so to give a quick review, okay, so it works. So, to give a quick review, the problem of plastics in the ocean is a very recent problem. So, if you look at these two figures, which I personally like them very much. Like them very much. So, the problem: the huge or massive production of plastic just dates back to 1970, where we suddenly started to like plastic. And they anticipate that the growth will increase exponentially. And also, if you look at the other plot, the amount that we're actually recycling is very small. And even out of the ones that are recycled, a lot of them end up going back in the landfills or, well, sadly. Landfills, or well, sadly and unfortunately, in the oceans. So, microplastics now, so this is a plastic in general. So, microplastics are plastic particles that are less than five millimeters in size, which to me, it can be a little confusing because we call them micro, but they can also be of orders of millimeters. So, their sources, they have a secondary source of microplastic, which is Microplastic, which is under the environmental impact, such as shears in the ocean and the UV rays, they can degrade into smaller pieces and they can form microplastic. But primarily, what they come from are these plastic particles that were produced as microplastics, such as the scrubbing agents in our health products, our tires, and our clothes that are shedding fibers that have plastic in them, and so on. So the list goes on. And so on. So the list goes on. And the problem, the particular problem with microplastics is that they very easily can enter the food chain. And there's an estimate that an average person could be eating five grams of plastic per week. And so here's the crucial problem. So what are the consequences of ingesting plastic? So the answer, the short answer is that we don't yet know. But if you search in the But if you search in the literature, there could be some really serious and scary potential health hazards. So, this is a recent review article. So, this is a problem. This is a threat to human beings together with the climate change that must be addressed in the next decades. So, now, in terms of how much plastic in the ocean and their budget, in terms of their size, so they again, what I'm showing here is the estimate. What I'm showing here is the estimate of the number of microplastics, which are these are plastics that are less than five millimeters in size, and these are macro or mesoplastic, which are greater than five millimeters in size. And you can see that they're very more numerous, these microplastics on the top compared to macroplastic. And the problem with them is that they're invisible and they're also unremovable. And the other problem is that's the focus of actually this study is that. Actually, this study is that a lot of studies have shown that these microplastic particles somehow vanish from the surface of the ocean. So, if you look at their density, so this is the density of the seawater, this is the density of plastic that we're producing, but most of the time they're in the range closer to a thousand, which they should technically be lighter than the seawater. But they're settling, and while they have to be from a scientific point of view, they have to be floating on the ocean. Point of view, they have to be floating on the ocean surface. So, there are questions about what are the mechanisms that cause this settling. So, a very plausible explanation is that microplastics in the ocean become very sticky and then they form aggregates with these other particles. These are called biogenic particles that are denser than the seawater. They're also larger than the microplastic particles, so they can be orders of one centimeter. So, they're pretty much the zooplanktons, phytoplankton, then they're dead, and then they Tones, then they're dead, and then they start to sink, and also their what they pass. So now, in terms of the flow features in the ocean, so this is let's say the point of entry of microclassics. So the upper ocean turbulence is driven by wind, and then this wind effect decays as we get closer to the pycnocline, where we have a sharp density interface. And then we have this deep ocean where we have the boundary layer. Ocean, where we have the boundary layer, and eventually we have this porous media on the bottom of the ocean. So, what happens is that microplastic enters at the surface, then they aggregate with biogenic particles, then they sink through this density interface, and then they find their way to the bottom of the ocean, and they are even trapped in the porous media. So, these are all backed up by evidence, by measurements in the ocean. So, we know that you can even find microplastics. That you can even find microplastics in really deep layers and in on the bottom of the ocean. So, what we're doing here is now we're focusing on this upper ocean. So, this is where we're looking zooming on a small box and we're assuming an HIT in that box. So, I should also apologize that this is also might be very different from all the other talks in this workshop that I'm going to talk about everything in the many. Everything in dimensional units because, again, I'm talking about these very applied problems. So, again, excuse me if these are not properly non-dimensionalized. So now we're looking at this box and then we're creating an HIT and we're assuming that this is a 0.5-meter box. So, when you compare it to the orders of magnitude of this upper ocean, Of this upper ocean depth. So it's much smaller. So we can, therefore, for now, just ignore the background shear. And that's why we're using an HIT. So we seed them with microplastic and biogenic particles by which. So let me first, sorry, talk about the turbulence. So we chose our Taylor Reynolds number to be 60, which corresponds to a wind speed of four meters per second. So I should also say that this is in the intermediate range of. The intermediate range of wind speeds. So, in reality, it can be much lower or much higher than these wind speeds on the surface. And for the microplastics, we're assuming that they have a range of six micron to 100 microns. And for biogenic particles, they have a range of 20 microns to 400 microns. And their density, well, the microplastics are lighter, the density water and Dense sea water and the biogenic particles are denser. So now for our fluid phase, so we're solving the important principle Navier-Stokes equation where, well, the Stokes numbers are pretty low. So we anticipate that they should be tracers. Our volume fractions were also very low. So these are very dilute regimes. And for the particle dynamics, we're assuming a Stokes-Drag law. Stokes drag law. And we're for so here's also another important piece of modeling that for the particle contact, we're just using a simple conservation of momentum. So we're assuming that there's no dissipation when the particles collide. But there are two things that can happen. Either particles are perfectly inelastic or elastic. So when they're perfectly inelastic, it means that they just stick together. And when they're perfectly elastic, they just bounce. Then they're perfectly elastic, they just bounce back. So, for this study, we assume that they're perfectly inelastic, which means that upon collision, they'll just stick together and we consider them as a new particle and then they reaches an aggregate, and these aggregates can again form aggregates with other particles. So, our computational domain, so this is just a brief summary of it, that we're gonna, we have a box and then we're putting up to millions of particles in that box. To millions of particles in that box, and we're using point particle models. So, now let's look at some of the collision models first. So, the collision model rates are generally described by this equation that if you want to know the rate of collision for a single particle diameter, then you have to integrate it over all the range of other particles in the domain. And then there's this collision kernel that depends on. That depends on the size of the two particles that are colliding and also the flow features. So, the biggest challenge, actually, although this is a very simple equation, the biggest challenge is coming up with this collision kernel. So, a model that's very widely used again is this model that we're assuming that the collision kernel is equal to this surface area of the sphere that. Surface area of a sphere that has a radius of RA plus RB multiplied by a relative velocity multiplied by a function that measures the local concentration. And there's also this one half here because most of the time when we use this distribution for this relative velocities, like a Gaussian distribution, for instance, half of the particles are only approaching each other, the other half are going away. So we need a one-half coefficient. Half coefficient. So now the mechanisms in the ocean that can induce a collision are, for instance, differential settling or simple shear or these hyperbolic relative velocities that we have in the straining regions of the ocean. And so now we're still, let me first say that we still don't know what this relative velocity is. So there's in the limits where the stock In the limits where the Stokes numbers are very small, so we can assume that the particles are following the streamlines. This Saffman Turner model is again very commonly used where they're replacing the velocity gradient, the velocity, the relative velocity by a velocity gradient, and then assume that that velocity gradient happens at the scale of the diameter of the particle. So they increase the power to three here. And so this is the model for it. Is the model for it, and it and still we don't know what this du by dx is, but assuming that the du dx of the particles are exactly the same as the du dx of the flow, and assuming that this is an isotropic turbulence, then you can write, you can link this together and come up with this equation for the rate of collision or rate of aggregation, where these are also for a monodispersed particle. So we were assuming that. Particles. So we were assuming that this is just a single diameter. But the important message is that this rate of advective collision scales with dp cubed. So that's the scaling of the Saffman in the Safman Turner limit. So the other mechanism in the literature are the caustics. So I'm not going to talk about this in detail because these are not really relevant to our range of Stokes numbers, but caustics are the effects where are the effects where when when particle stokes numbers are high and then one particle when particles are not following the streamlines so then one particle is very inertial and then it collides with the rest of the particles because again it's not following the streamlines so there are some ways again that you can start from stokes drag law and then you can derive an ode and from there you can And from there, you can find the rate of the collision. So, again, I'm gonna skip this because these are not really relevant to this work, but the important message is that this rate of caustics collision rate is proportional to RP squared. So, this is a different scaling compared to the advective rate of collision. And in the end, the total rate of collision will be the sum of these two. Collision will be the sum of these two. So, depending on which mechanism is dominant, one of them will be larger. So, now let's look at some of our data. So, for the first data set that we performed, so we just assumed that we're having a diameter ratio between the particle, the plastic to biogenic particles of one fourth, which means that biogenic particles are four times larger. So, this is again a common, this is realistic. And this is realistic in the oceans, I'd say, and their number densities are equal. So, for this range of, or for these two assumptions, here's the Saffman-Turner limit, and here's what we observed. So, these are four of our data points, the DNS data points. And we also had to introduce an average mixture diometer, which comes from this equation. So, there are two important things here. First of all, Two important things here. First of all, we didn't have any aggregation or collision at all for the average DP diameters that were less than 40 microns. So this means that for particles, for biogenic and microplastic particles that are really small, there would not be any aggregation and there would therefore be no settling at all. So there's a threshold. And also what we observed was that our DNS aggregation rates were lower than this Haffman turner limit, which Than this Halfman turner limit, which we're going to propose a correction for it later. But now, the next thing we did was we picked one of these data points, which is this one right here, that actually does have an aggregation rate that's not too far off from the collision, from the Safman-Turner collision rate. And then we looked at four different cases. And then we looked at four different cases. So this is the case that now we're assuming that, so this point A is your original point. And now we're assuming that the diameters are equal. So we see that when the biogenic and plastic particles are, they have the same size, then the collision rate is enhanced. So this is an important result that means that when they're of the same order of magnitude, then Of the same order of magnitude, then, or not of the same order of magnitude, or exactly the same, then we will have an enhanced collision rate. The other result is when we're keeping biogenic particles four times larger, but now we're making the biogenic particles four times also more numerous in terms of the density number. Then, our collision rate also increases compared to the original one. This one is. As compared to the original one, this one is not surprising because when you have more of larger particles, then the collision rate on average increases. And the other result is that if we now assume that the plastic particles are four times larger with the same number densities, the collision rate does not really change much. And this one is also not so surprising because the model really doesn't care what you call your particles, right? So if you just keep that same density ratio. Keep the same density ratio, then they're going to have the same more or less collision rate, although their densities are different. Now, I want to talk about now about the models and then how we can actually propose a model. So, let's first look at radial distribution functions. So, we did it for different cases. And for, so here's, for instance, an example of the cases where our average or our biogenic part. Our biogenic particles were 100 microns. And then we just observed that there was no preferential concentration. So there's no effect because of the preferential concentration of particles. For the case where our biogenic particles were 200 microns and our plastic particles were 50 microns, we were getting a very slight preferential concentration, but in the end we decided that we can simplify this and assume that there's no preferential. Assume that there's no preferential concentration in the model. So, now let's also look at the colliding, actually, colliding particles. So, we looked at all the particles that we have in the domain. So, we looked at all the pair particles that we have in the domain. And at a time, we identified all of them that would collide potentially. So, these are not actually colliding particles. This is a method to just increase the number of sets. To just increase the number of statistics that we have for colliding particles, because the actually colliding particles are not that many. So we define this criterion where these are, depending on their radial and tangential relative velocities, you can come up with a condition where whether they will, if you freeze the flow field, whether they're going to collide or not. And so then we collected all of these particles. All of these particles, so all of these potentially or potentially colliding particles, and we went back to our collision grade model. So, what we want to do is now to come up with an estimate for du by dx, the relative velocity gradient for based on this, not all the particles in the domain, and not the velocity gradient that comes from the flow field, but these potentially colliding particles. So, we plotted the So, we plotted the PDFs of their velocities. So, you can see that, depending on if you look at all the particles, so this is the PDF. And I also want to emphasize that this is a log scale. So, these are not Gaussian distributions. So, these are going to have long tails. And so, these are microplastic, biogenic, and also we're plotting microplastic versus biogenic particles. So, you can see that the Particles. So you can see that the PDFs are they have different shapes, and these are normalized by the number of them that you have. So this is not like a number effect. It's more of a size effect, I'd say. But the interesting thing is that when you plot the averages of them, all these PDFs have really close averages that we can take this back. So this is like a velocity gradient normalized by the Taylor time scale. And you can put it here. Taylor time scale, and you can put it here in this and come up with an estimate for this du by dx from DNS. And now, the other thing that we had to do, because we have bi-dispersed mixture, is write the collision rate for each of these particle sizes and average them based on their number and come up with a new collision rate. And then the kernel was estimated from the velocity gradients that we had before. Velocity gradients that we had before. So, once you combine all of these together, so we came up with this line, with this red line, that was much closer to our DNS data compared to the Safman-Turner limit. So, we just concluded that although our particles are very small, but the Safman-Turner limit might not be giving us an accurate estimate of the velocity gradient still, because they still have a small amount of inertia of the particles. Mount of inertia of the particles. So now let's talk about the more interesting problem that I think I might also be running out of time. So the more interesting problem from a practical point of view is that how many of these aggregates will actually sink? So we have so far only talked about the aggregation rates. So now let's look at a case where we're having we're keeping this density, we're keeping Density, or keeping their number densities the same, but the biogenic particles are four times larger. And so, this is just like a visual approximation of seeing how many aggregates we will actually get. So, these are microplastic particles are green. The sorry, biogenic particles are green, which are larger than the red microplastic particles. And these black dots are the aggregates that actually contain both biogenic and Uh, biogenic and plastic particles, so these are candidates for settling. And um, and now once we find the average of average density of all the aggregates, we just observe that it's very close to the biogenic particles. Well, again, because the biogenic particles are four times larger. And when we also looked at the PDF of the probability of finding plastic in all the aggregates, we just observed that. We just observed that this is a fairly steady state process and almost 20% of the aggregates were microplastic. So now let's look at the next case where we're now this time saying that their number density, their diameter, sorry, are the same. So this time again, we observed that the aggregates on average have a density Have a density ratio to the seawater of 1.2, it means on average again the aggregates will sink. And now this time we observed that 60% of the aggregates on average had point four plastic in them. And finally, when the plastic particles were four times larger, but then we observed that on average, they're lighter than the seawater, and also 90% of the aggregates were. The aggregates were composed of microplastic. And on this plot, you can also observe that not too many of them have both biogenic and plastic in them because it's mostly plastic particles aggregating with each other. So now, if you want to put all of this together, so these are all the cases that we have simulated. So this is the average diameter of the mixture, and this is the percentage of microplastic. The percentage of microplastic that settles in the time that we have simulated our flow. And we just observed that the percentage of microplastic that actually settles will increase quadratically with the average diameter of the mixture. And this effect is more important than the effect of other parameters, such as the density rate, such as the diameter ratio, and also the number. Also, the number ratio. So, these are those few cases that we did for the diameter and number density ratio. So, you see, these effects are small, although I should say that we're still running some cases for these other average diameters. So, when you have a higher aggregation rate, you will have also more diverse types of aggregates. So, I'd say that this will give us a wider range of percentage of settling particles. Percentage of settling particles. So things might change if we run things at these data points. But so far, we have observed that the average size of the particles is the most controlling parameter. So now with that, I would like to summarize, because also I don't think I have too much time. So we, in terms of the aggregation rate in bi-dispersed mixtures, we just observed that DNS can help us come up with the velocity. Velocity gradients. And for the range of Stokes numbers relevant to microplastics, we just observed that advective collision is more relevant. And in terms of microplastics, we just observed that, as I said, particle size effects are the most important ones. So I'll just leave the rest of the conclusions here. But let me also talk about open questions. Talk about open questions, which are again many for practical applications. So, first, we didn't really include the more complicated flow features that we will encounter in realistic situations, such as stokes, shear-driven turbulence, or these language cells that create these converging cells where plastic particles can be preferentially concentrated. And also, we did. Concentrated. And also, we didn't have any disaggregation. That's important for future studies. That we also have to look at the efficiency of aggregation, that if they collide, would they actually aggregate or not? Is there any energy dissipation? So these are the points that we just simplified in this study. And finally, as this was the topic of many talks in this workshop, we just assumed that we have flexible, we have spherical particles, which is. We have spherical particles, which is not true for the case of plastic and biogenic particles. All right. So, with that, I would like to thank you for your attention. Okay, before we close the session, we have time for a few quick questions. So, let's start with Aaron first. Well, thank you for your presentation. So, this might be a naive question, but I guess if I'm understanding correctly, so the biogenics aggregate onto the plastics and then cause the plastics to sink. But if the biogenics are denser, do they, would they, I guess, why wouldn't they settle out and sink first? That's a very good question. The reason is that these are phytoplankton. Phytoplankton and zooplankton, and again, what they pass. So, they're fecal poets. So, what happens is that while they're alive, they're active swimmers. So, they will not sink. So, they will sink when they die. And also, it could be that they enter the ocean with a plume or from a river or from some parents. So, it takes some time for them to settle. So, there are different mechanisms. To settle, so there are different mechanisms. I think there could be, so this is not just limited to biogenic particles, there could be some clay or iron particles that are of micro size and they're just transported from somewhere else, but they're denser and they will eventually sink. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Emre, you had your raised hand, so you want to unmute yourself and ask a question? Okay. Yeah, yeah, sure. Very nice. Yeah, yeah, sure. Very nice talk, by the way. Just you know, maybe I'm going to scatter shoot three questions. First, regard related to the collision efficiency and just, you know, whenever they collide, they stick to each other. How realistic this is? Or did you do any sensitivity tests in terms of changing that coefficient of restitution or things like that? Second one, most of the time, these five. Most of the time, these fibers are, I mean, these, you know, the microplastics are in fiber shape. And can you comment? Can you comment on the effect, possible effect of it? And I guess, you know, the third one is going to be, yes, you just, you know, you mentioned at the end, but can you comment on how shear can change the dynamics of these aggregates? Uh, aggregates. So, please, Ketter shoot questions. My apologies. Yeah, sure. So, yeah, these are all very good questions. So, the first one was the efficiency of aggregation. So, yes, I agree that this is a very complicated problem. So, there's this coefficient of stickiness that they introduced in the literature that if the particles collide, what are the chances that they aggregate? And well, unfortunately, there's not, this is like an empirical coefficient that you have to just tune. Of coefficient that you have to just tune it somehow in the model. But no, for this study, this is a work that we've done recently. So we haven't yet run any simulations. So this is on our to-do list. But it can, yes, sure, it can change the results significantly. And the second question was: I believe that the disaggregation, right? I think, yes. I think, yes. So, if they have fiber shapes, it's going to be a totally different problem, and the aggregation models will be much more complicated. And also, in terms of simulations, since these are all point particles, so simulations, we can just zoom out a little bit and look at the interaction of turbulence with the point particles. But then they're fibers, so we have to use some IBM methods and we have to resolve them. So, unfortunately, We have to resolve them. So, unfortunately, we'll lose some length scales. And, but, but in reality, they're fibers. So, I agree that this also has to be addressed, but we have not done it. I think their aggregation models will be very different than just the simple model that they have used. And the last question, which was regarding the shear, so that's also very important. I think the major effects of the shear would be Effect of the shear would be that they will contribute to these aggregations because under shear, these aggregates can break up. So I think that's also some topic that must be done. It's for future work. One quick additional questions, just quick. So did you have any data to validate your simulations? That to validate your simulations experimental? No, again, unfortunately, not because we didn't, no, we have not, but I know some groups that they have started working on, you know, really simple experiments that they have a settling tank and they look at the settling of fibers, for instance. But we are starting to Starting to do a campaign for doing some field work to actually see that whether if we can find any of these aggregates in the field, because I believe that in doing aggregation in the experiments can be a little challenging, or maybe I'm ignorant about that topic. So if there are any suggestions, I'd be happy to hear about them. Yeah, I'll, you know, yeah, I'll talk to you. I'll send an email. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you so much for your comments. Okay, great. Thank you so much for your comments. One more question from the audience in the room. Huna, hold on. Yeah, sure. Very interesting talk. Just a quick question, because you mentioned in the very beginning that the dimensionless number is not used here, but I'm just curious if you know the Komograph scale in your simulation. Yes. So the Komograph scale was, again, I'm talking everything dimensional here, was Dimensional here was about one millimeter, and our particle sizes were ordered micron size. So that's why we can use point particle models. Okay, so that means your Stokes numbers were small? Yeah, our Stokes numbers were 10 to the negative fourth or the fifth. Yeah, so our Stokes numbers were very small and our particles, even when they form aggregates, they're still order of magnitude smaller than. Of magnitude smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale. So that means the differential settling is more important, or no, for this case, we're not really looking at differential settling because we compare the time scales of, so for this problem, the main mechanism that brings these particles together is turbulence, not differential settling, because these particles are so small that if you look at their settling time scales, it's much longer than the turbulence. Longer than the turbulence time scales. So, a differential settling would not be relevant really to this type of range of particle sizes. Okay, thank you. Okay, perfect. There are no further questions. Thank you, Mona. Thank you, sir. We're going to close this part of the session. We'll take a lunch break, and I hope you guys also get a good lunch and we'll resume. And we'll resume with a keynote talk by Professor Ray.
