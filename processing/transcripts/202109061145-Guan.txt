Aha, now is yes, yes, perfect. Okay, okay, so our next speaker today is Professor Peng Fei Guan from McGill University, and the title of his talk is Entropy Quantities Associated to Gauss-Curvature type flows. Please. Thank you, Yuga. Thank you, Yuda. I want to thank the organizers for inviting me here to speak. As title indicates that I'm going to talk some of the function, geometric functions associated to Gauss curve jet flows. Let's start say we have a bounded convex. Bounded convex domain in IN with smooth boundary. Now let X denote the position factor and K the Gauss curvature. The Gauss curvature flow of this form was introduced and studied by William Faroje in 1960. In 1960, in 1980s, Kai-Sen-Chao improves existence and convergence of this flow to a point at finite time. So that's everything eventually shrink to a point. To a point. And the main point here is want to address what's the shape of the distinct point we call C infinity. So that's one of the problems that has been of interest for many people in the field. But to understand the shape of the sting point, I will normalize the equation so that the volume is of constant. For example, let's assume volume is of the same of the unit ball. Then if we write Then if we write equation, then this equation can be the main term still the same, due to the Gauss curvature. And then we have actual term here, that's the U. And that is the support function of the body of omega. So here, function of omega So now volume is fixed, then we want to understand what's going on, what is the limit, or if we know then from this rescaling argument, we have a long time existence. The question is about convergence. So, when the case n equals 2, that was the work of Andrews in 1999. He proved that the flow converges into a unit sphere when n equal to 2. When n large then or equal to 3, actually large infogena n in the In the work of Nile and myself, we prove that it converges to a solid. And solden satisfies the following equation. The Gauss curvature of the boundary of the convex domain is exactly equal to the support function. Then, afterwards, it was a very important work by Brendo, Choi, and Tasukoponov certain in fact actually is a unisophere. So that is the story in general, for the general solution of the standard gauss normalized of gas curvature flow. Now I want to say a few words about what's involved and then I will move on to other type of type flow and some of the problems still open. So now in the study of the normalized auto flow and then there are two There are two entribute functions play very important roles. One function is E omega. That's defined to be of take you take support function, you pick any point inside omega. So now you have omega. So now you have omega, and you pick any point that zero, and then you integrate of the log of that one, and then you take a spring of all those points inside of this convect domain omega. And that's entropy was originally introduced by Ferry when omega is symmetric. And for general, And for general was generalized for general omega by Andrews. Another entropy also plays important role is Ben-Chaus entropy. And that entropy then is the Gauss curvature times the local curvature, the integral over of Sn. Now that's not M. Snettles on M that's equal to 0. And then that will be equal to of the log of just curvature and Sn. So those are two geometric quantities which turns out play very important role in the study of the Shoraton. Study of the Soraton and O convergence. So, regarding these entropies, then we have certain low bounds of entropies. This E omega is bound below by a volume function, nature volume, and also it's bound above by E omega, bound above by C omega. By C omega, expand charge and p and g. You call it hold if and only if u is equal to k. And if you recall u equal to k that's related to the certain and then by workout, Brando and Troy and Task Rover, and that's equivalent to say that is unisophia. So, in other words, we already see some certain kind of optimal inequalities. And this also the same thing. Equality holds if and only if and this depends, okay, that if and only if and it's a sphere. So that gives us the low bound of the entropy from the From low bound attributes, then we get so-called no-corruption estimate. That means that the all radius is bound above and the in radius is bound below. That indicates then that indicates That indicates then and so then along the flow, normalized flow, then the convex body is not degenerate. Another important point here, entropy, if we recall, is defined taking of E and entropy taking the supreme of all Or point C0 in omega. And that should be can be achieved at a unique point on certain way of E. So we call this entropy point. So that is, this point can be achieved and it is unique. So those are the basic property of entropy. And the most important part here, then not its interior, but you can have a very effective estimate of this entropy point, the distance to The distance to the boundary. The is delta, which depends only on the diameter or out radius, depends on volume and dependent dimension in. Then you have this estimate, which can be bound from below. So now you have a body, and then you have an entropy point of it, C of E, and then it And then it is the distance to the boundary. This is bounded by delta. And that delta depends only on the diameter, the volume, and the dimension. Okay, those are the basic Okay, those are the basic properties on entropy, and then associate to the flow or normalize the flow. And those two entributes are monotone increasing, no, no, no, decreasing. From here, immediately you can get then because you see that we know that entropy now is decreasing. Entropy now is decreasing, therefore entropy omega t is always less than entropy omega 0. So entropy is bound from above, but we know that entropy is bound from below, just at the very beginning of the property of entropy. And because volume is the same thing, because we normalize that this equal to zero for one point two equation. 1.2 equation because we normalize volume equal to the volume of omega volume omega equal to volume of unit ball. So entropy is bound from below and because homotonicity entropy is bound from above. From here then we get the inner and outer bounds. And outer bounds for the inner bound for the inner radius and outer bound for the outer radius. So that's and that is one of that related to the C0 bond. And regarding CZR estimate, actually this estimate was proved before For harmony using our bench entropy. So those are the two different proofs, but essentially the same results. Now, the key part here, we can prove then. Here we can prove then this u along the flow, u is bound from below for some c0 positive. And that's the key. From here, then we get consequence. Then k is bound from below. So k bound from above. That again the work of Hamilton. And what form K bound from below? That is work by myself and Delaney. So once you have U bound from above and below and K bound from below, then you can pull and U of C L is bounded from above for all L. For all L. So you can, that is coming from the standard elliptic regularity theory follow the Kriloff estimate. So once I have that, then you have long-time resistance and the regularity. Compare this regularity with the regularity proved and before And by Kejin Cho, because Kejin Cho proves the regularity for and normalize, but when his regularity is made, it won't be uniform when you normalize in general. So that's the difference. Okay, with all that, then once of that then you can prove that you can prove then it is converging so that's again it is related to this entropy and quantity so in fact this normalized equation if we recall is actually causing normal grading flow. Cause a normal grading flow that relatives of this entropy T once you have that then you prove must be converging and the convergence you can show then must be of this satisfy this equation and of course again same thing you can also can see the also can see the third one as the critical point of the entropy functional and the contrained UVU normalization. So that's a brief and one of the story for the Gascovitro. And the same argument can push forward Can push forward to general so-called flow by power gauss curvature. Instead of gauss curvature flow, then you look of this by power of alpha. Here, alpha is positive. And then you can see then associated to this flow, they are corresponding to Corresponding two entropy quantities and that one is of entropy of this for K and that entropy for E so that again just normal and that trick here so here alpha not equal to one that's right on that and then alpha go to one then take limit you get is that the same entropy we just discussed before. We just discussed before for alpha equal to 1G. So those are two entropy, and then by the work of Andrews, Leni and myself, then we can s save some of the following very similar and uh properties of those entropies. Those entropies. First of all, these entropies are continuous and increasing in alpha. Recall here, this is related, this everything in alpha here. And if we normalize then, okay, that is a very important assumption. I will come back to you here when alpha is tricky larger than equal to. than equal to of 1 over n plus 2, then entropy is positive if you normalize the volume. If alpha equal to of n over 2, then equality holds this still true, equality holds if and only if omega is ellipsoid. So that's related to the affine case. And also, there is a unique entropy point attained the maximum. And that point can be characterized using this quantity. Again, when alpha is larger than one alpha in one two, then we also have And we also have the node collection estimate, very semi-developed and finally the key important part is then the distance of the entropy point to the boundary can be estimated from below by some constant delta, which only depends on the diameter and the volume. Of course, here we have. Volume, of course, here you have alpha and the dimension n. So those are the basic properties, and of course, that is for general omega. Then, if omega or omega t satisfying the normalize the flow, now if we normalize then, there is a quantity, no local property, a quantity. Involved if alpha is not equal to 1. So, this quantity is involved. Now, this normal quantity will be involved and then when you rescue, then you get this normalized flow. So, along this normalized flow, then those entropies corresponding entropies are taken. entropies are decreasing and the entropy the limit of entropy also exists when alpha larger than or equal to n plus 2 and then you can estimate exactly what happened to e alpha infinity and of this you can exactly write on this identity Right on this identity, of course, you get monotonicity, and this quantity eventually will help us to get certain. So, this is related, of course, you can see immediately that's related to this holder inequality because normal antenomid has this holder relationship. So now we can deduce the convergence of the flow. So the T is then you estimate U from below and then you estimate gas curvature from below and above. And here, from here, get all a priori And the regulator for solution of this for 1.4 Just I know that 1.4 is the equation of the form xt equal to minus k of alpha over alpha over integration of S n k alpha minus 1 then plus u over mu and similar because of entropy and so here you can see that the important role play by entropy because that more or less like quality grading flow so I want to see a little bit thing here because Think here because this equation this equation is fully nonlinear is fully nonlinear so in general cannot be a grading flow of some function but it is you can see it is positive grading flow so It is positive grading flow. So, in a sense, when t large, it behaves like grading flow. So, those are the stories about direct curvature flow and by power. And then, the important classification here: so, when alpha of this in ellipsoid. In ellipsoid, then the solids are ellipsoid, that's by angels. When alpha larger than or equal to n plus 2, and that is work of Brando Troy Dascales, and it is as field. I want to say here, alpha equal to 1 alpha in plus Q is critical. So in this case, So in this case, actually, the super critical is better. So now, if alpha less than of n plus 2 is a supercritical, then in general, you don't expect the convergence overflow. And you even don't expect the no-class estimate. If you can take sequential convergence, then this may be degenerate not to a point. degenerate not to a point, uh no no no degenerate to some of uh degenerate to some of unbounded convex and set in R n plus 1 for the numerous flow. So that is difference when alpha less than one of n plus 2. So that's one of n power 2 is a critical value. Okay, now I want to move on and to so-called anisotropic flows. This time we are interested of a flow of this form. Instead, then we have a fact here is some f which f which f as a function is positive and the C2 okay C2 defined on the outer normal of the body so of course then you can prove then this flow converging a normalized converging to a point so extinct to a point of course we are interested Of course, we are interested about the shape of the point. Well, then again, we normalize the flow. After normalization, then you can see here very similar, okay, and very similar to the previous cases, then you have and then a low local version coming out. But this time seems a little more complicated. A little more complicated. Of course, we can define and two entropy functions. So those two entropy functions are very similar to this factor F. Origin here, then we put instead of looking originally, then we look integrate over of Sn then we integrate over the weight volume of S n. The weight volume of Sn. So here F is the weight. So now we assume here then and we may assume F is a property measure. On SN. Just makes things a little simple instead of restanding as a scale. So then from those two, we can define those two entropies. Then again, those two entropies can give us so-called non-correction estimate. And then you can write down and you write and write down of this from here, maybe I should here. I just jump a little bit and then this entropy is E alpha. Is the alpha of F omega T is decreasing along the normalized flow. Around this normalized frame Along this normalized flow, and you can write down exact quantity. So now from here, if we know, okay, from here, if we okay, this I just mentioned here, because it's decreasing, therefore you can have this flow. So then, omega, because we normalize Because we normalize omega t, the volume omega t, which equals to the same volume of volume on the unit ball, then we can get the no-corruption estimate. And then going back to the unnormalized flow, that means an in and out radius ratio is bound from above. And we can also have the gas curvature, which is Which is born from above. But what's missing? Two things. One is an in this case and you point below Q dash curvature bound from below. That is missing. Okay, why we are not so far at this point, we cannot do anything about this, except in the case. So, what is known? It is for the flow of x. For the flu of xt equal to minus fk alpha integral of f k alpha minus 1 of s n plus of u mu when alpha less than equal to one of n larger than equal to one of n plus two that is known. That is known. Then we can prove U is bound from above and below. And then from here, we can prove that K is also pointed from above below. And then this will, of course, that is worked by any. That is work by angels. And we can also use entropy and quantity. So if we go back to in the previous case without effort involved, what the key part is the entropy point estimate. That is the key. That is the key in the approach we had. If we have F involved in general, for the entropy, if F is not equal to 1, in general entropy point May I call at the boundary here again when and alpha is larger than n verse 1. So for alpha between of this, then this is also no problem. So entropy point. Also no problem. So entropy point is on in the in the interior. So that is one thing what we are not able to do at this point. So now let's go back to So let's go back to this equation. I think my time is almost up. So I want to say a few things about entropy. So we are not able to do the two, but we still able with this no clashing estimate and with estimate of gas curvature bound from above, we can show the following here. So you can still prove then You can still prove them maybe not convergent, but still sequentially convergent. Q of this solid. And if we notice then for Jana F, then you take P equal to one of alpha, then that's exactly associ related to so-called the L P Ming Gautier problem. LP me go to problem. And for that, and you can arrive at the general solution for mu keeping for gift. So that is the joint work with okay, that is I need to put on my collaborative name. So that is the joint work with Andrews Carlo let me see Okay, I'm sorry, I got stuck with my friend's name. Okay. Friends name, okay myself, Dani, and myself so Karoni that's a Hungarian name. Okay, probably I will just leave that. I will try right. I want you to find I have to spell out his last name anyway. So that is uh one of the key uh the the worker I jo joined with Join with let's join with four of us together. And we could do more about this to work on so-called LP Mingawki problem, weaken the regulatory assumption. But I think my time up, I will stop here. Thank you very much.
