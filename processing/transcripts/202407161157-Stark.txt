Yeah, I also want to thank the organizers for inviting me to this very nice place. And we have And we have also been doing work on elastic turbulence, but I decided that this title, this work, is a bit more fitted for this workshop. And I want to stress that Arkas Chaudari, who was a postdoc with me, made by the Alexander von Humbert Foundation, was doing the main part of the work I present. Okay, so active motion, we heard already a bit about it, means that you have constituents which consume energy. Constituents which consume energy and thereby move forward. And this can happen through different mechanisms in different environments on different length scales. But all what I'm doing mostly in my group is on the micron scale. And we heard already micro swimmers move at small radiance numbers, so inertia is negligible. But, and we will hear about that, thermal noise is important. So one part of my group focus. One part of my group focuses on active motion, and I give you just a few examples what we have been doing in the past, and still doing. For example, we model bacteria. We already heard Zargas talk about bacteria. So they'll move with this rotating bundle of the channel, then they tumble and move in a different direction. And the time between two of these tumble events is called the mean run time. We'll come back to this later. To this later. This is something maybe the most complicated thing I have been doing, not me, but my collaborators. Here we model the African drompanosome. The African drumpanosome is the causative agent of sleeping sickness, which is a severe sickness syndrome, for example in Africa. Recently, we also started to design active flow. So, when you take a lot of these bacteria, so we have a whole collection of So, you have a whole collection of it, then they show this signature of active turbulence. And this is what I wanted to say about it. But you can modify these bacteria, genetically modified, that by switching on light, by shining on light locally, you can actually make them active. So, you now have the idea or the possibility that you can create these activity patterns. So, these dark spots, these are inactivity spots. Inactivity spots, and then by tuning this lattice, you can go from this active turbulence to a real delayed flow state, which I found interesting. And we had some fun explaining or understanding this flow. Okay, but this is here in the workshop about viscoelastic fluids. You heard already about honey. This is my favorite viscoelastic fluid, cornstarch. This is the most fantastic video I Most fantastic video I most in show. And then we have, of course, biological fluids which are visculastic, blood, and we heard already about mucus, a typical polymerous fluid. So microswimmers move in the fluid, and at least for a Newtonian fluid, we have to solve the Stokes equation at low Reynolds numbers. Microswimmers are forceless, so the Are forceless. So, the best what you can do is to model them as a force dipole, a stress LED. So, you have two opposing forces with the distance of L and they create the flow field of a force dipole. It goes like 1 over r to the squared and has this, in the far field, of course, has this radial flow field. And P, the force moment, determines if you have a pusher, that means this direction, that is this vector E. That is this vector E. It pushes fluid out along the axis of the swimmer and pulls fluid in. So, this is a typical microswimmer we treat in the active metal field. And the E. coli bacterium is a typical swimmer which is a pusher. And then, if p is smaller than zero, we have what we call a puller. It pulls fluid in and pushes fluid out to the side. And this is And this is an algebra called Claminomonas Linhaldi. This is a typical polar swimmer, and you will hear about them later. So what I want to do in the next 20 minutes, I want to explore how microswimmers swim in a viscoelastic solvent, but I have to admit, only for weak viscoelasticity. So that's my constraint here. I will show you a bit about the ureology of active. The ureology of active suspensions, and here actually diluted active suspensions. That means we are concentrating on single swimmers. And then I will tell you a bit about swimming with a reciprocal stroke. Okay, so I come to the first part here, and this is really the work of Akash. And in my talk I cannot really show you all the work he has done on this, on the complicated calculations and all that. Calculations and all that. If you want to know about it, you have to go to this article and go to the method section and also the supplemental material and see all these things you have to do to come to the results which I show. So the motivation for this is our experiments done in the group of Avonzon and also in the group of Eric Gl√©mois in particular. So they were measuring suspension of E. colizers by. Of e.colias bacteria, and they found when they looked at the rheology of this fluid that viscosity is reduced. So swimming bacteria reduce effective shear viscosity. So this is viscosity versus shear rate. At low shear rate, you see with increasing the volume density or the volume fraction of the bacterium, the viscosity goes down. Goes down and then increasing the shear rate, then you go back to the viscosity of the bare fluid. You can plot this plateau value over volume fraction, and then you see very nicely for hyperactive bacteria. So in their paper, they write they feed them very well. I thought hyperactive mainly supplied to children, but okay, also bacteria can be hyperactive, and then you find that. And then you find that shear viscosity actually goes down to zero. So that means you have a shear flow which is sustained by the bacteria themselves. You don't need any external stress to sustain the shear flow. This I found an interesting effect, and for me it's one of the most interesting effects in the active matter field. So this superfluidic material suspension. These were for bacteria, but if you take Glamidomunda Spein Hardy, so Eige, so you see the dead cells, they have an increasing shear viscosity with volume fraction. But now when you switch on activity, if you have swimming cells, you further increase activity. And we will hear about it and learn about how it goes. So to understand all this, let me give you the basic mechanism. Give you the basic mechanism where this comes from. And so basically, the basic mechanism is going back to work in the group of Srila Maramaswamy and then later Santiaga did a lot on this. So you know that linear shear flow, you can decompose this in rotational flow and extensional flow. And if you put particles in it, elongated particles, they perform Jeffrey orbits. Jeffrey orbits. And these particles have an aspect ratio or ratio of long axis to short axis. And then you can construct this asphericity. And when you now look at the dynamics of the direction vector of this particle, it has two contributions. This is the rotation in the vorticity, that's clear, but also in the shear. In the shear flow field, in the extensional flow, you have an alignment of the Of the rods. So we have two contributions. For spheres, you have just the tip of the orientation vector, just circles around in the shear plane, and all these trajectories, they are mutually stable. When you elongate your particles, you get these distorted circles, and the particle spends more time along the flow direction. This is not all because we This is not all because we have microparticles, so thermal noise is important, but also tumbling, for example, for bacteria. So you have to describe the orientation of the bacterial particles by such an orientation distribution function. So this is also what you would need later. But when you take all this together, you can calculate the viscosity, the effective geo-viscosity, and then you understand. And then you understand the following. If you have a passive rot, it will more or less align along the extensional axis of the shear flow, and then the viscosity increases. But now, if you have a pusher swimmer, so an E. coli bacterium, you see the E. coli bacterium generates the flow field which is the same as here, so it supports the extensional flow, and that means that. Flow and that means that shear viscosity decreases. So pushers support shearing and that's why viscosity, shear viscosity, effective shear viscosity decreases. On the contrast, puller pulls fluid in, so it acts against this extension of flow, that means viscosity increases. And this more or less explains these experiments I have shown you, but of course, not the superfluid. Was not the superfluidic transition. I will not touch actually this machine. For this, you need actually denser suspensions of active E. coli, for example. So we want to treat this with weak viscoelasticity. So fluids which show weak viscoelasticity are typically called Hoca fluid, and we had the nice introduction yesterday. We had the nice introduction yesterday by Vivek. So we use a second-order fluid, that's the Stokes equation. And this is then an additional stress tensor. Wi is the Weisenberg number, which I don't have to introduce here. And the polymeric stress tensor, the important part, it has nonlinear parts. It's second order in E, but also this lower convective derivative has nonlinear parts in it. Non-linear parts on it, as you certainly know. And then there is this parameter delta, this metric parameter seems to be constant around minus 0 plus 6. And all what we are doing now is we do a perturbative analysis around up to first order of the Weisenberg number. And this is where the hardware comes in, and which I will skip completely. So the result of this analysis. Of this analysis, but also by symmetry argument, you can show how Jeffrey orbits are modified, how the equations for the Jeffrey orbits are modified. And what you see here, these first two parts, this is the traditional Cheffrey orbits, or these are the traditional terms of the Jeffrey orbits for neutronic fluids. Then you have this part which comes in for viscoelastic fluid, and then if you And then, if you still, in addition, have activity, activity couples via this visceralistic properties also to the Jeffrey orbits. So, this term, this is where the activity of your swimmers come in. So, it's a scalar term. And how you determine these parameters, you do this with a perturbative analysis in several. Analysis in zero of order, you have to solve the Stokes equation. And V is the disturbance field of the rod generated by the rod. So passive rods, you have this typical flow field, which we know from Einstein, at least for spheres, and then you have to extend this for rods. But in addition, when you make your microsperma active, or your rod, you make it active, you have this for cycle flow. This force cycle flow field, which is the important part. There are other multiples which you can look at, but it turned out that this is the most important part. And then you can go forward and say, okay, now I look also at higher order flow fields. We don't do that, but we use what is called the Lorentz reciprocal theorem to calculate now these corrections here to the equations for. To the equations for the Jeffrey orbits. So this omega p. And this is how you do it via the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. You always have to use a known problem where you know the solution. This is all the star problems here. And then you can calculate this rotational velocity. So S0 is some sort of a stress tensor, which you can calculate via this disturbance field. And then you And then you get these parameters, and it turns out that alpha1 is the important parameter. That means extension of flow will be the important part in our work, or was the important part. So when you now analyze the swimming orbit or the Jeffrey orbits of the rods, you find the following. For the passive rods, you find that these rods don't circle around, but they circle, circle, and then But they circle, circle, and then they ultimately end up in the knock-rolling state. So they are aligned along the vertical axis. So, and this is, of course, what's known before us, and I guess Quinn has done some work on that. So, if you now introduce activity, if you now turn activity on, so let's concentrate first on the pusher, you see that these trajectories got more elongated, but in the end, you But in the end, you for weak pushes, you end up in the lock-roning state. But now you increase activity, and then what happens is that the state which you end up is an alignment state. So you align in the shear plane in a certain angle with respect to the x-axis. And this happens, this is interesting, and we can show this with a dynamical analysis of our equation when this effective. When this effective asphericity, so this is the term which we have here, this is an effective asphericity, if this becomes larger than 1. So please remember that lambda itself is between minus 1 and 1. So when it is larger than 1, then something happens to your equations. Then on the other hand, you can go to polars. You see that these circles, they are more circle-like. Are more circle-like. So the asphericity is here reduced, is here reduced by the active activity, sigma, and then we have a reduced prolate swimmer, so to speak. But when this becomes now negative, when this effective ace fluoricity becomes negative, the swimmer starts to circle and it starts to circle in the shear plane. So there's a transition from not rolling. Transition from lock rolling to circling in the shear plane. And if the aspiricity, the effective aspiricity becomes smaller than minus one, so it goes beyond this limit here, then you align the swimmer in the second quadrant of your space, so it points against the gradient of the floating. So this is the phenomenology we get out of this investigation. This investigation and this shows you how even weak velocity with some activity changes the typical chapter orbits. This is just a collection which I don't have to go over now. So now comes the second part. This was all deterministic, but we know that the motion of E. coli bacteria and other swimmers is very much stochastic, so we have already So we have orientational noise, tumbling, and diffusion, and we describe this stochastic motion now by a Smolophovsky equation. This is a standard Smolikovsky equation, but now in the orientational space. And this is the Smolochovsky equation. We have here this typical drift term. So people who have worked with Smolihovsky equations, they know these terms. So this is a typical These terms, so this is a typical drift term, which comes from the deterministic drift I have calculated. This is orientational diffusion, and this is tumbling, meaning that the system wants to go to a perfectly uniform or isotropic distribution, and if you deviate from it, then you have an addition here, and tau is the mean run time, which I explained to you before. Which I explained to you before. So, now to understand what the influence of stochasticity with respect to deterministic motion is, you have to introduce two quantities, Peclet numbers. The first one is the activity itself. That's the active Peclet number. u is the swimming speed. I use it here instead of sigma, the activity. Tau is the tumping time, or the mean run time. And then we have the flow. Runtime, and then we have the flow's strength. So, this means how strong is the shearing flow with respect to tumping. Give you an impression, E. coli has a value of tau times dr of 0.1. That means that the this tumbling uh contribution uh is much more important than that this uh rotational diffusion. And the Peclet number, the active Peclet number, is around five. The active peculiar number is around five. Is there some water on you? No, I guess not. Okay. So these are the results. And I tuned the parameters so that the passive rods and the puller rods, they do lock rolling and the pusher rods do aligned, they align in the first radar. And so if you have, thanks a lot. So, if you have a weak flow field, remember then stochasticity determines everything. Then, your passive rods, they are basically determined by the extension of low in the line here along the diagonal. Pushers actually enhance this effect, but pullers they decrease it, and this can be described. It and this can be described by an analytic formula which describes the deviation from an isotopic distribution. If you now increase your flow field, so you go to these flow Peglin numbers of five, then what you see, so now the Jeffrey orbits become more relevant. You could say, why is the passive particle pointing along the log-Rolling state? This is the reason is the log-rolling state. Is the lock-er rolling state? This is just a single direction in space. And remember, we still have the tumbling, so whenever they align along the rock-rolling state or on the way of aligning here, they are pushed out of this state because of tumbling. And as a result, you have this maximum here close to the flow direction. Push us onto a line here along the diagonal, and this is what you see here, and pull us behind. And pullers behave similar to the passive rocks here. If you use non-tumbling bacterium, then the Peclet number, the active Peclet number is very large. So remember here we had around plus minus 20, but here we have plus minus 100. And then you see very nicely how the pusher aligns along the diagonal, along the extensional axis, and the puller aligns in the other quadrant. So it aligns on the Quadrant, so it alias along the compressional axis of the order. So you see, there is a whole zoo of phenomenology you get out of this. Now comes the last part. I go very shortly over it. Now you have to calculate the shear viscosity. And people working on colloidal suspension, they know all this. I also had to learn this, or we had to learn this. So there's a party contribution to the stress tensor. Partic contribution to the stress tensor, which more or less averages the particle stress lead over all the orientations which the particles can assume. And in our case, we have three contributions. We have contributions from the deterministic shear flow. This is what Einstein calculated for passive spheres. Then we have a thermal contribution and we have an active contribution. And we did that, but what we need for the shear result. What we need for the shear viscosity. So, we have the bare fluid viscosity, and we have this contribution from the particles, which comes from the stress tensor, the deatoric component of the stress tensor, divided by gamma naught. And all what I show you now is this mu k, and remember you have to multiply it with the volume fraction to get the absolute number of the correction. The correction. So these are some slides and some graphs, and I try to walk you through. So, what you see is this particle play, this particle contribution to the shear viscosity versus the flow pector number. So, the black curve is the dashed one, is the Newtonian fluid, and the black, the solid line, this is the viscoelastic fluid. They don't differ so much and they enhance the shear. And they enhance the shear viscosity. Pushers, as you might guess, decrease it very much compared to the Newtonian fluids. So already we know now that elasticity decreases viscosity further for pusher suspensions. And for pullers, you have the same. This is what you get for a Newtonian fluid, and then it is decreased in a viscolesic fluid. And if you now increase the Pecker number. And if you now increase the Peclin number, the fluid or the flow Peckland number further, they all decrease and or decrease or increase and go to the zero value, that means to the bare fluid flow. That means activity does play a role when you shear your fluid very strongly. This is a part which shows you the three contributions to the stress tensor, the flow. Stress tensor, the flow part, the thermal part, and the active part, and what values they have. And you see that the active part, this is the most important part in all of this. And you already see it here. Yeah, and this is just some further analysis. And what happens is that activity increases car particle contribution to viscosity. So this is the main message. The main message is also a bit. Message is also a bit unspectacular. So, compared to a Newtonian fluid, when you look at the shear viscosity, nothing dramatic happens, but it might be useful to look at these bacterial suspensions in a viscoelastic fluid because you might obtain the transition to a superfluidic behavior earlier than in a simple Newtonian fluid. This is somehow what we learned from this study. So, let me So let me come now shortly to my second part: swimming with a reciprocal stroke. One of the paradigms, and this is work by a master student, one of the paradigms for swimming at low Reynolds number is the Purcell-Scallop theorem. When you do a reciprocal motion, that means under time reversal, the motion looks the same, you cannot swim forward. When the fluid flow is governed by the Stokes. And the fluid flow is governed by the Stokes fluid. But you swim forward in a viscoelastic fluid, and this is, for example, what was demonstrated in these experiments with these larger swimmers here. So what we did is we have a simple reciprocal swimmer. It consists of two spheres, and the distance between the two spheres oscillates. And we want to understand or want to investigate this swimmer now with the ultra-B fluid. Now, with the ultra IB fluid, ultra IP fluid, we heard already about it. We have an additional stress tensor, and this stress tensor has this contribution or base this equation here. This is the upper convective derivative. So, let me go. So, somehow you have to break this reciprocity of the swimmer, and how do you do that? And how do you do that? So, when you look at a particle and you drag it from the fluid, you can show analytically or you can calculate the flow field initiated by this particle to first order in the De Borough number. You get the Stokes flat. This is what you have in a Newtonian fluid. And then a term which goes like 1 over R squared. And when you look closer at it, this is a force dipole flow here. And the force dipole is. Float here. And the force dipole is always contractile because you have a negative sign F, the force is quadratic here. And why is it a contractile force dipole? Because when you track a particle, it starts to shear and stretch polymers, and these polymers want to actually go back to their original configuration. And this is how they introduce this contractile force type one. And obviously, you see now. And obviously, you see now why here you have a foreaft symmetry, the dipole here breaks this foreaft symmetry. And this is at the core of how you break reciprocity here. Just when you oscillate your two spheres, you pull at the spheres and you push them apart, and this and pulling is basically harder than pushing. Harder than pushing. So, now to handle this, all you have four unknowns and four equations. These are the four equations, and let me just point out: this is, for example, the fluid, the velocity of particle one. It is dragged by force F1. This is all non-dimensionalized. And then we have this hydrodynamic interaction with the second particle. And so, this is what you have to produce here. And you just solve these. And you just solve these equations, and then you get up basically to all this material. But what you will find is that the viscoelastic part to the displacement gives you a continuous propagation in one direction.
