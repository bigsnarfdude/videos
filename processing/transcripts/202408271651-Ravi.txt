It's an old theorem, more than 50 years old, and it's a very important tool that encumbered with geometry. So it goes back to ruthlandic and Baum-Filton-Mexico. And it relates basically the K-group, which now groups rationally and has some nice functorialities. Has some nice functorialities. So it says the following. So for a finite type, secreted scene, let's call it x. There's our transformation. There's a map which is denoted by tau x. And it goes from g0 of x. This is the rhythmic group of. This is the rhythmic group of cohesion sheaves on X and maps to the rational chow groups of X, Q. So this is Chow groups and it has several nice properties. So the first one is that if x is a point Then tau x takes the class of O x to the fundamental class of x inside the chow groups. And second is that it's a K0 module map where we look at the child groups as a K0 module by the churn character. So basically, for if you have a K-0 class, however. Tau x of V and anything else is just turn of V times tau X. Yes? But if X is a point, you have Z mapping to Z. Yeah, sure. There's a one for one. Yes. Yeah. So that's the one, and this is the one. Awesome. Okay. And then it's covidian for propomorphisms. So power x is. So tau x is covid for propomorphisms. So if you have a propomorphism of schemes, then if you push forward and take this transformation or first take the transformation and then push forward, you get the same thing. And Verdier proved that if you have a L C i map, so if F from X to Y L C I, then you also have a continued functor reality up to the top. Continued functory up to a top twist. So in fact we are y and our x, f of this graph, this was top class of the relative tangent under the of x over y and then cap with f of the sheet of y. And finally, if you put these together you get that and you take G theory and also G-theory and also it can survive Q, then this becomes an isomorphism. I see, so in 2, the V is in K0, which are vector bundles, but the dash could just be. Yeah, it's something in G0. So V tensor, it makes sense to do the tensor. You'll land inside G0 again, and then it's a module map up to the chunk line. Up to the terminal. So, what is the assumption for phi? It's always true. This is the assumption. So, it's a finite type separated scheme. So, it's true. Okay. And the corollary of this is the Hizzepro-Kri-Manner theorem, which is true before, but you can get from this. And it says that if, let me just stick to this case where it says smooth projective variety over C, then if you take V and K0 of X and compute the Euler characteristic, then this is the same as integral over X of over x of turnoff v times charge x. So you get this nice integral formulation for the Euler characteristic of any V over X. And you can also do more if you're not in the smooth setting but or in the L C I setting but in quasi smooth setting then you still get Then you still get this formula, and this is called the virtual secondary bug rock. And it's you to find the keyoshi and also have shortened function and copper. And in the form that I'm going to state it as due to the hand, it says that if f is a quasi-smooth morphism of derived schemes. you can take that tau x and then it makes sense to talk about f upper shriek because it is still just f upper star it's derived that I'm gonna drop all the derived functions but that's what it is and then f to f tap with f of the shrie of pi 1 and if you're more used to thinking about instead of quasi smooth morphism if you want to think about x some classical scheme and f is some relative purpose Theme and f is some related perfect abstraction theory, then you can just put virtual everywhere in that, put it in the formula, and you get the same one in this case with respect to the perfect abstraction theory. Just going back to the really classical application for a second, do I read this right that if X is L C I and just Y is a point, then the same usual Hertz-Agreement formula holds for X being L C I. Yes, yeah. But this comes. But this class would be the fundamental class, which is how defined as a pullback of the path from the smooth. So you put, or you can put here. So it's tau x, f of a star, is just tau virtual, and then f of a sheet. Okay, so yeah, maybe let me not do this and let me. Let me not do this and let me just put virtual here and it makes sense. So I can just do this and then this on the this. And this V itself has to be pulled back towards much more than that. Oh. Okay. Can I ask something quick? Sure. So what I am familiar with is that the churn character only exists on K0. Yeah, it's only on K0. We are only applying churn character at all. We are only applying certain character at all points to things in case you go. Right. But um how come but this tau the usual way I know to define tau x is to take germ character and multiply it multiple. Right, that's what happens for smooth. And then when you do it for finite type separated at a singular thing, then you can give an extension of that tau to G0 and at least on K0 classes it's still turned, but otherwise you have to do something. But otherwise you have to do something more complicated. That's basically this bound for my person's improvement on classical thing is to define as how singular thing is. Is it somehow related to the fact that f upper street is defined on call? Well f upper star is only defined on sometimes related sometimes, yeah. Okay, uh so in particular this says that if you take the virtual class of O X, this maps to X, virtual class and Chang group, capital, retard. Alright, so that's how you get this virtual version of the task. Okay. Okay. And using this, what you can do is using this kind of virtual Riemann graph, Fantaki and George give this definition of all the characteristic which works not just for X smooth but even for quasi-smooth things. So they generalize this definition of Hisabrugg's pi Y genus to the quasi-smooth case and then using that to find a Using that, definitely Euler characteristic in the virtual case. So it goes as follows. So this is due to fact being Libertarian. So if x is quasi is smooth, they do this with perfect abstraction theory, but you can make sense for any quasi-smooth directly, direct scheme over say the square of k, where k is the field, then Then time minus y of x is defined as the Euler characteristic of lambda minus y of the cotangent components of x. So lambda minus y is defined as summation minus y raised to the power n and then you take the nth exterior powers of the quota complex, which is a two term two term complex or the perfect complex in degrees minus one and zero. X n degrees minus 1 and 0 and then n greater than or equal to 0. So this a priori is something the integral of power series in y. But then when you apply the Hisabruk-Riemann-Rock theorem to this, you get a formula in terms of such an integral, and you can conclude that this, in fact, belongs to a polynomial. No, because I'm just assuming x is smooth, and this LX is just the potangent complex of the derived scheme. So then I can just draw the virtual everywhere and just write it this way. So here it's derived. But if I were to do it right in the language of Fantasian Girche, then I'll put up how to do it. Okay. So it's a polynomial, and then polynomial and then what you can do is you just define the Euler characteristic pver of x, the virtual Euler characteristic of x classical, the underlying classical condition to be chi minus 1 of x, the x is derived and this is now an integer. So you get some deformation ingredient integration Integer invader. Yeah, it's alternating some bitter, yeah. It's just easier to do it with minus and put it plus and then make it minus. Is there a meaning for chi one? Chi one is the signature. It's called the virtual signature of x. It's called the virtual signature of x, and it's also an integer because all of these are polynomials of integers. So you can apply one. And that's what the integer is. And it's also some kind of a topological kind of invariant? So if x is smooth, then obviously it's the usual Euler characteristic, but if not, then you get something else. But you can still express it as integral of the top 10 class or the vertical. The top turn class of the virtual proper, one of those is topologically invariant. Is the other one a topological invariant? Okay, so this is the story for schemes and it also works exactly. And it also works exactly the same for algebraic spaces as well. So, let me now tell you what happens beyond spaces. So, by that, I mean what happens for algebraic stacks. So, the problem is that for algebraic stacks, it's no longer true that the rational G-theory is isomorphic to the rational. G-theory is isomorphic to the rational child root. So for a right stack, G0 XQ is not isomorphic to child structure XQ. And a sort of philosophical reason for this is that you can define cohomology theories for stacks in two different ways. You can extend from schemes to stack in two different ways. So one is Different ways. So, one is genuine cohomology theory, or if you are thinking for quotient stacks, then this is what is used as Radon equation homology. And you could also do the Borel typing or what we call this extended cohomology theories. So, basically, you just can't extend. So basically, you just can't extend any cohomology theory from scheme to stacks. So this extended, and for quotient stacks, this is the Borel equilibrium cohomology. So stack is autistic for now, also. Yes, for now, X is just some out in stack. And G theory or K theory lives over here. So K theory or G theory of an algebraic stack. Or read theory of an algebraic stack, which is defined just the same way as you define for schemes using the perfect complexes, is a genuine theory, whereas child groups are defined using the relevant character. So for doing month stacks, which one of these involves the inertia stack? And which was the. Yeah, that's the main story for us. I've come to that. Okay. So for algebraic stacks. So, for algebraic stacks, it's or even for Denny Nonflex tracks, K-theory or G-theory is the genuine cohomologic theory, and Chalgrou is Borel equivalent. So, you should not expect that they are isomorphic because they capture different kinds of information. So, this has more information than the Borel diagram. So, what can we do? So, let me give you the first solution. So, we can make both our theories for real-type, right? Like, instead of defining G-theory of a stack as the original G-theory of stack, you could also have defined it as this extended G-theory of stack. So, make one theories. So, for Childrop, it's already a period type and It's already per type. And what you want to ask is: so, is this exchange G-theory of X is it isomorphic to homology because I want to compare it at the spectrum level, so star of X. But you can think about this groups, and then this is just the child groups. And you can ask, are these quote isomorphic? So let me first write for this as. So let me first write what this is. So this is the homotopy limit over G-theory of schemes, rational G-theory, where T maps to X, T is some scheme, and this map is some scheme functor. But it's also just isomorphic to the eta G theory of X. And this is just the eta geometrication of G theory. Of GT. So, we want to ask are these two isomorphic? And it turns out that these are indeed isomorphic for all Adam's charts. It's a theorem to edit in Graham if you're working with potion stacks and I can find more generally for all stacks that there is indeed such an isomorphism. So G at R Q is isomorphic to HQ for the normal. Yes. What is your HQ? It's the motivate bullet mode rush. Is it the thing that comes from message? Sorry? Is it the thing that comes from SH From this extended SH Okay, so this map is an isomorphism and we know that g of x naturally maps to this because it's just Because it's just a dultification of that. So I can say that, okay, I don't know if these two are isomorphic, they are not. But can I just work with this map, right? I have a map, and if you want to do Hezekrook-Riemann Rock or something, it's good enough that you have this map and you ask that it has good something properties. But unfortunately, this map is no longer, it does not have, it does not commute with respect to proper non-representable. To proper non-representable push-forwards. So that's the problem. So this. Yes, this one does not commute non-retrosentable push forwards. So as long as your uh morphism looks like a morphism of ski. Looks like a morphism of schemes. That is, whenever you have a scheme mapping to xy, where xy is a map of stats, and if you base change, you get back a scheme, then it's called representable. Otherwise, it's non-representable. And for such maps, it's not going to commute. What happens if we just take the g to a multiplicity to define its commute by multiplication? Yes, we'll do that, and it doesn't commute. So the list connects to. So the disk kind of extended SH, right? Yes. Does that push forward the long non-representable? Yes. It does. But that's like non-formal. What do you mean non-formal? It's very easy to shape. It's same as the usual one for representable. Otherwise, you just take a proper cover and use that with a formal. That will cover all kinds of things. Is it what? You saying Olson's result that Argens? Subway arguments. Is it Olsen? Is it all size? Okay, yes, yes, it's all. So it's not all signs? Okay. Yeah, well, I mean, if you're, so if you're proper, then you can use all signs. Proper. Yeah, and that's the only case we are going to do. So for Delhi Mum for stacks, you just take a proper cover by a scheme. You can push forward from the schemes to the stack because that's representable and G at L would be same as some checker. Okay, so that means in particular we cannot push forward. In particular, we cannot push forward the point, and in particular, this means that you don't have piece of rootri-man rock for the stats. So, let me do the example of markers. So, let's do this VH mapping to some spec A where H is just some finite group. And let's take on one side this g0 of ph and you're pushing forward to a point, so g0 of spec a and this is popping to g0 et al of dh and again this is just an isomorphism, g0 et al of h, let me put the rational everywhere, then it's just isomorphic. And then I can take this G0 et al of spec A here, pull back all the way to that. So there's a map from spec A to B H as well, so I could pull back to that and then do this. And this map is just identity. What happens now is that if you take some say non-trivial, so all this is just k0, we are. Trivial, so all this is just k0. We are in the smooth setting. So, this is some say non-trivial irreducible representation, and I take its class. Then, when I push forward to the point in a genuine wave, what I get is the invariance of V, which is 0, because I am taking a notchively reducible representation. And then, if I do this, pull it back, so what I get is rank of V, and then when I push forward, it's rank V push in. It's frankly quotiented by the order of eight because this mark from is going to be proper and detailed. You can check that it's just multiplication by order of eight. I'm going to do this as time of order of eight. In any case, this is zero and that is rand v times something and so even in the simplest really mumford case it's not true that that map from G to the Chubb proof is The child group is not going to commute for problem representative push forward. Are there any questions? Okay. But as long as we only want to work with, say, representable morphisms, then this is good enough and you can put forward, you don't have an isomorphism, but you have some kind of functorial maps. Kind of functional maps. So the map works well if we work only with only in the representable word. So for example, if you're working with quotient stance or you want to do invariant things and you want to push forward to just BG and are happy with getting some invariance in the representation ring, then this is. Presentation range, then this is good enough to do it. But if you want to push forward to point and do actual enumerative geometry where you get some numbers, then you want to not just have this, but also have computativity for proper non-representable push formats. So that's what we want to do. So our first solution was somehow to make G-theory a little less refined. So instead, now what we are Less refined. So instead, now what we want to do is make child group more, have some more data. So this is what we want to do. We want to enhance our child groups instead. And we don't know how to do it in the most general setting, that is for algebraic stats. But at least if you're daily monkhood, so for DM stacks, by enhancement, I just mean consider the child group of the inertia status. Of the inertia surface. So inertia stack is just a double diagonal of your stack or point-wise, if you want to think about it, it's same as the stack, the points of the stack along with the choice of automorphism. Okay, so now what we want is to construct a is to construct an isomorphism or a map from the G-Tary of X. So this is the term root of the inertia of X. And we already know by solution 1 that you have rationally, you have a map which goes from g tau ix cube to this. So the problem really is to construct this map. So do this again for me. So if you use the input from VH is just H, yeah, H times H. Outros is just the point of stack is H times VH. Outros would just be H. 0 would just be H. Okay. So we want to Okay. So we want to construct this isomorphism from G-theory to the et al. G-theory of inertia, and this is what the rest of the talk is going to be. And let's see how to do this. Let me first do a BB, please. Some gradient shift that you want to put, some BH grading, or anything that comes up in this one. So this is just the direct sum of all my child groups. The direct sum of all my child groups, and what I'll actually do is just construct. So, this map itself is at the level of, so this is actually, and then it's at the level of spectral chain complexes. I mean, I'm just usually in the orbifold cohomology, you have the cohomology of the inertia stack, but with like shifts to the grading on in the twisted stack. I'm just wondering if this shows. Yeah, yeah, there would be a twisting, yes. Yeah, yeah, there would be a twisting, yes. We'll do that. There will be shifts. But it would already come up here. There would be there. Here there's no push shapes. Okay. Okay. So let's do this. So I want to consider the case of the Delhi Northwest track, which is given by y model H, where y is a separate scheme and is The steam and the edges just supply like white. And in this case, it's a theorem of Dispoli from 91 where he constructs this isomorphism. So first if y is regular, so y is So, y is f, so if y regular, there is a isomorphism of rated algebras which goes from p k star of x, so k star of y mod h, tensor q. tensor q and it goes to k star of y sigma tensor with q tensor with r tensor sigma and then you take a I'll explain what this means and product over so this sigma is a cyclic subgroup of H and you want to take products over conjugacy classes of these cyclic subgroups so sigma containing H cyclic subgroup Cyclic subgroup and you wanna take one for each computer. Okay, and what's that r tilde sigma? So r of sigma is just the representation rate of sigma, so it looks like tensor with q. So it's q t mod t power n minus 1, where n is the order of sigma, and r tensor sigma is by definition just sharp. Definition, just Qp and the quotient by the nth cyclotomic polynomial. So just so if you were to put all the primitive nth roots of unity, then it's just that many copies of. So this is the case when it's regular and in the general case, he also constructs a morphism for G-theory. For G theory. Ah, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Then maybe I should also put this here, but I'm gonna do everything at the, I'll construct it at the whole G-theory spectrum. Are these also K-theories? No. These are K-stars. No. It's a case. This is just all K groups, and this is also all K groups. What is W of sigma? This is N and yeah, this is the normalizer of sigma n. So N of sigma is by definition the normalizer of N of sigma. Okay. And more generally, there's a map. So let me close this slide. So you have a map. This, right? So you have a macro, and this one is just given by pullback y sigma, and then you do a bunch of things, and you say that you land in here, and then this is a mass map. So this is a good statement. And for G-theory, now you have a map which will go the other way because you have push-forwards. So at delta sigma, normalized of sigma, where the product is up here over the same as above, and you have a map to. And you have a map to G t of y mod h. And this is again a misometism. And if y is regular, then this is the inverse of that map up to some Euler class of the normal bundle of y so. How much? If by regular, then phi x equals x, this was and this is invertible. Sigma minus one of the normal bundle of both uh sorry, normal bundle of this is the normal bundle of y sigma over y. Y sigma over y. Y sigma over y. So y sigma is the fixed points for the sigma action on y, and then it's a closed inside y, and we want to take the normal button. Y is the diagonal inside of y? No, it's the fixed. What is y? Y is just this y. It's what x is the quotient stack of y. I know, I'm just sorry. You have a map from y sigma to y. So this is the sigma fixed point of y. Lambda minus one means the operating sum of 60 rows. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so what does this have to do with the inertia stack? So let's just take lambda equals q to infinity. Then I adjoin. Infinity, then I adjoin all roots of unity to q. And then this thing is same as if you tensor q mu infinity everywhere, then this side is same as the k theory of the inertia stack of biomarkers. And the reason for that is, first of all, you can take the centralizer of sigma, and then if you look at the centralizer fixed points of disk, by descent, you know that it's the same as K theory of Y sigma mod the centralizer of sigma. Not the centralizer of sigma, but rational KTV. And then you have this tensor beta tilde sigma, and you would be left with the while group of sigma over here. But instead of taking product over cyclic subgroups, if I were to take product over all conjugacy class of elements of it, then this would correspond to just putting those classes together. And the final statement is the following that is also true for TTD. is the lambda tensor tilde sigma to the power normal sigma is the same as product over h continuous class of elements g t y h. So the sigma will correspond to taking the cyclic group generated by h and then since that started by h. Art is by H. And you could bring this down here and put a eta here. So this is just the eta of inertia. Inertia. And because for this case, the inertia is just the disjoint union of things of this form. Are you working with characteristic zero or that's not right? So I'll make the assumptions clear when I do the actual case. But what you need is that, so characteristic zero is good. Otherwise, what you want is the characteristic should be coming from the Should be away from the order of all the automorphism groups. Or in this case, just the order of the it could be smaller than the dimension of finite. It could be smaller than the, yeah. But you tensor everything with Q but he's she's tensor everything with Q anyway. Okay, so let me do the daily comfort case now. Okay. So in this case, so what I want to do is the case of Delhi-Mumford stacks, which are not of just the form y mod h, where h is a finite group. And it was proved by Toin that if, first of all, if x is smooth and dn. Smooth and dead, or it's a joke, or a joke. So in these cases, basically, your inertia of X to X is a etal morphism. So for smooth, it's L C I or in the jerk case it's etal. So you do have that kind of pullback maps, and you can construct this isomorphism as follows. Construct this isomorphism as follows. So you have a map from k of x lambda to k of the inertia of x, which is just the pullback by this pi episode. And then you can. General reflection. Yeah, I'll just use that so gerbil reflect And then And so if you have a general, so x has say resolution property, which means basically that it's a quotient strap, but then in Mumford, so then possibly projector cost modelized space. Then you can, then he constructs this chow hyper envelope of x. I turn the log of x so x dot to x such that each of these x n's are job x n is attributed to scheme. Yeah, you do need two observer schemes. Okay, so if you have such a hyper end, So, if you have such a hyperinfilop and all these xns are gerbs, and you can construct it for gerbs this way, and you can put it together to construct a map for g-theory of x to g et al of ix. So use this to construct this also works for G, to construct G takes. So construct J and then it's same as this morphism psi x for x dot. So you can reduce to the local situation and say that it's an isomorphism by just using this space to this result. And this map corresponds to, so this is psi x basically in the non-space case. And also in And also in some unpublished work, he shows that more generally for any DM stack, you do have such hyper-envelopes, and then you can use this to construct such a nice morphism. And the functoriality properties that this would have are the following. So, first, yes, it has, yeah, it has good dissent properties for child group. I think it's proper, subjective, and something. Sejective and something more, which I'll cut. But it's not. Oh, it's different. Charles. It's a Charles lemma. Yeah, it's a different lemma. Sorry. So the good thing is, you don't need to know what this is because I'm going to get rid of the structure now. So that's why I don't know what that is. So, okay. And it would have put forward functor reality. Could have put forward functoriality for all proper maps now. And it also has pullback functor reality for et al. functor reality octo twist which I'll also Which I'll also make clear what this twist is in a moment for et al. representing the mark. Okay, and then what can we say about the hizoprocremal rock? So, this is one It's a theorem due to Kawasaki, and that's why it's also called the Kawasaki-Vimondrop theorem if you do it for Delhi-Mumford stacks, that if X is smooth, so smoothly in quotient stack, then you do have a theorem similar to before, which I'll write down in a moment, but instead of integrating But instead of integrating over x, you have to integrate over the inertia of x, and then there's also some twist. You have to twist the turn character by some eigen spaces and also have some quotient by the third class of normal benefits of eigenx. So potion stack means what? A global quotient? Yes, it's a global quotient stack. So it's a global you can think of it as g acting on x with a proper action. But it doesn't have to be finite, you know. No, it doesn't have to be finite. No, it doesn't have to be finite. Okay, and then this was extended by Tonita to the case of embedding inside smooth. And we also have a full joint work with Shiga where we show this for perfect abstract equity and perfect. Perfect abstraction. It could be imperfect abstraction to use percussion stacks. So all these are cushion stacks. Okay, so now let me see the theorem. Maybe I want to keep this. So I'm going to take Saki and Manrock for doing monthly charts. So this is what we are going to assume. So assume that the base scheme is notidion, scheme S is noiter. And X over S or D abstract. Then we want to assume that our S also contains, so N inverse belongs to S for all N which occur as automorphisms of points of X and equals R to L. X for all X next. And we also want to put some primitive energy so until X. So you can assume that it's Q mu infinity or something of that form. Okay, so once you have this, what we can prove is the following. So if X is finite type, so So, how much time do I have? I think we have at least 15 minutes, if not 17. It's very five. No, ten is what we aimed for. Okay. So, fifteen minutes, is that certainly okay, certainly it's fifteen minutes. I tried to end with one. So, okay. So, okay, so if you have finite type separated derived d abstract over S, then first of all, there exists a mark which I denote by theta rho sharp of x from the g eta of inertia of x to g of x. And this lambda was q u. And this lambda was q mu infinity, so you're tensoring this. So you meant to say zeta n is in lambda? Uh q mu infinity. Zeta n is in s. It's in the base. I want my base also to contain primitive networks of unity. So what's the assumption of lambda? Lambda is. So lambda is a coefficient ring. This is not the base, so it is union. Alright, so you have a map of this form, and the point. And the point is that it's an isomorphism such that triple fixed is an isomorphism. And her model is by construction we'll see that it has push forward, it commutes with proper, all proper push forwards. So commutes with proper push forwards. And we can also do a virtual statement. Statement: that if you have a quasi-smooth morphism from x to y of finite type secret derived d and stacks, then you get a commutative diagram with pullbacks up to some twist. So if f from x to y cross i is smooth, where x and y are above, then if you take the induced morphism on the inertia, so you want your inertia. So, you want your inertia to be derived, and the derived structure that we take from this is by identifying. So, this is disjoint union of map from dz mod nz to x and greater than or equal to 0. So, then you can just take the derived mapping stack from dz mod n z to x, then x has a derived structure already because it's the derived stack, and then this would also be derived. And the point is, this map would because I speak. And the point is, this matter because I smooth it is. So similarly, phiy. Right, so note that ix to iy is not a pullback of x to y in general. So that's why I need to specify what it is. It's not just going to be quasi-smoothed by some base region. It's not a base change. Okay, but it would just be that, but otherwise, I need to put a union. If I take this joint union, I have to put representable, or I could just take all union and then it would stay here. But yeah, that's the inversion stack by is just the means. So BZ mod NZ is the same as BμN in this case? Yeah, sure, but what? Why is this the inertial shear stack? Why is this the inertia stack? Just some finite group inertia. So x, all the finite, so okay. So what's the inertia of x? So you have on points, ix of t is going to look like, so t is some scheme, so you have some point in x belonging to x of t, and then you have alpha, some automorphism of x of finite order. Of finite order. So you take the cyclic group which is generated by alpha, then it would be this. And also, the point is that if you take the inertia stack and you take the morphisms in the inertia stack, then it would correspond to all of these. And not just the. So that's why we need to see more than C. Thanks for that. Question. Okay, so I did not. So this is what we have, and then we have a community with that. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So it's not the drive limp stack. No. No, it's not. That was our first guess, but nothing works with that. Yeah, I just have to do the care. Or the social market. You want to get the same thing for scheme, so it's for this map. Okay, great. So if you take that, then you have this map, g et al of you know g of y. innovative of y mapping to et al over sharp of y to g of y lambda and this maps to f upper sharp g etal i f upper star g etal of inertia of x lambda and then et al sharp of x and this is g of x lambda this is f of a sharp and it commutes almost so what I need to do is I need to cap the To do is, I need to cap this by lambda minus 1 of n and some twist rho x, which I probably won't have time to explain. But this is, so if you take lambda minus 1 of n, then you can split it off locally as a direct sum of some eigenspaces, and this rho x basically adds the character corresponding to that eigen space, the inverse of that. And then you cap it with this. Then you cap it with this. So, what is n? n is the fiber of the map from the cotangent complex of Iy over Y to the cotangent complex of Ix. Okay, so okay, so the reason, yeah, so let me just keep that still there. And the corollary of this is the Kawasaki-Riemann block. So now we can construct this map of X orbifold which goes from G the of X lambda to G etal of the inertia of X and then you have this tau Ix which we had before from the etal. Before from the etalgy theory to the child rule or maybe hq star of inertia of x lambda and this was an isomorphism this we already saw and this map is going to be the inverse of people inertia of x and this is also an isomorphism. And the point is that if you apply this commutativity and the commutativity This commutatives and the commutativity that you have from G and L to chop group for all f quasi smooth, then you get the formula that we want, which is called the corresponding formula. So if f from x to y is quasi smooth, then tau x all the flows of composed f opposite is just talking about the inertia. The inertia If, so it's a map from Ix Yy, capped with f equals 3, and then quotiented by the turn class of, again, the twist of lambda minus 1 of n, and then you calculate how y bare n is over there. Right, so if your x was quasi-smooth over. If your x was quasi smooth over a point, then you can use this to say what happens to the fundamental class and you can write down the issues. So, in particular, if x to spec k is proper quasi smooth. Then if you take any alpha in k0 of x, then the other characteristic of that the other characteristic of alpha is the same as integrating over Ix of turn of rho x of alpha restricted to Ix and then you cap it with the fourth class of Ix and then coshi by churn of rho x of lambda minus one okay
