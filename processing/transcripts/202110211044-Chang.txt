Inviting me and also just putting on this meeting in fairly difficult circumstances. I'm really enjoying all the sessions and hope to see all you guys next time in person. Okay, so today I want to talk to you about a fairly new project in the lab, which is on the question of how is the size of the nucleus actually controlled. And we have this new model in which osmotic forces might be responsible. Forces might be responsible. So, this is work that is done by a very talented postdoc in my lab, Joel Lemire, along with a student, Paula Real, and he's teamed up with a modeler, Thomas Fay. And all three have been participating in this meeting. So, hopefully, you got the chance to talk to them. Okay. Okay, so. Okay, so sorry. So my lab has been interested in many things over the years, but one thing recently is we've gotten very interested in the cytoplasm and addressing the question of how do cellular processes actually function in this very crowded milieu that we know the cytoplasm is? So how does it affect specific cell biological processes such as Cell biological processes, such as the cytoskeleton, and how is this intracellular density actually regulated? So it's not kept constant, but it actually can change through physiological or developmental cues. And so my lab has a number of projects in this area. So Arthur and Joelle and Paul had been at this meeting. I think you've heard Arthur and Joelle talk a little bit about their projects yesterday. Like Arthur's looking at the property. Like Arthur's looking at the properties of the cytoplasm and how they affect microtubules. Okay. So we study the fission yeast S. Pombi is a great model system for quantitative biology. These are very simple shaped cells. They're rods that grow from their cell tips, and then they basically go through the cell cycle and then divide in the middle to form two cells again. So during this process of the cell cycle, the cells need to grow. Cell cycle: the cells need to grow, double in size, and also double everything else inside of them, double their mass, double the size of their nucleus, for instance, and so and double the DNA, obviously. And so this is a sort of ongoing process, which is keeps on the cells proliferating. Okay, so the cell cycle in Pomby is very well regulated, as is its cell cycle. Um, as is its cell size, and so we're able to deduce a lot just from looking at these cells. Okay, so today I want to talk about the problem of how nuclear volume is scales with cell size. This is something that's been noted over 100 years ago in many contexts, and it's one of these rules of life, which people still don't really understand how it works. So, here you can see data from mammalian cells, worm cells, as well as Cells, as well as in Pombi. So, when we talk about nuclear, this NC ratio, what we mean is the nuclear volume over cell volume. And this is what remains constant over a whole range of cell sizes and is also kept constant as cells grow. So, POMI has a very robust NC ratio that's kept constant. So, here are two cells that Are two cells that with a nucleus labeled? And in this movie, as the cells are growing, elongating, the nucleus also is getting bigger. And so the NC ratio is basically keeping constant here even after division. So basically, for this NC ratio to be constant, the nucleus needs to be growing basically at a rate that correlates with the growth of the cell. And so there have been now many studies showing that this NC ratio is independent of cell size and shape. Here, just a collection of different POMB mutants, which have different cells, shapes and sizes. As you can see, these long cells have big nuclei, small cells have very small nuclei, and even these sort of round cells still maintain their shape. And so it's often been speculated by work in other systems that maybe it's the amount of DNA that determines the size of the nucleus. These are often predicated on models in which you have DNA and then the nuclear envelope forms around this DNA to form a nucleus of a certain size. In Pompey, we have very clear In Pompey, we have very clear evidence that the nucleosize is not determined just by the amount of DNA. And so the NERSC lab has pointed out examples. Here's one which this cell in red has 16 times more DNA than this cell in blue here, even though they're the same size and their nucleus are also the same size. So these cells with massive amounts of DNAs were formed. Massive amount of DNAs were formed by endoreplication of the DNA by perturbing the cell cycle. So, this is consistent with findings that most of the nuclear volume is actually not occupied by DNA, but by other things. So, estimates run from less than 1% of the volume is actually DNA. Another observation that's been rather curious is that the nuclear size. Been rather curious is that the nuclear size appears to correlate with the amount of cytoplasm around it. So, in POMB, we can make these multi-nucleus cells. And if they aren't positioned symmetrically, sometimes you have a cluster here and one here, the nucleus that's sort of all alone with that has access to lots of cytoplasm actually is larger than these ones, which are clustered together. And so, there's been some. Together. And so there's been some thought that maybe the nuclei are somehow competing for some rate-limiting component in the cytoplasm. So what could be the mechanism for this? And so one mechanism could be that nuclear size is determined by a complex feedback mechanism, which there might be a sensor for a nuclear size and for a cell size. Size and for cell size, and through complicated signal transduction pathway involving lots of kinases, they can then act to regulate the size of the nucleus. And I think, so the NERSC lab has gone on a search for such molecules that would make this pathway, but it's the search has been not so successful. They've spent, I think, in sort of heroic screen. In sort of heroic screens, genome-wide screens over a decade has yielded actually very few candidates. So, one message is that the NC ratio is very robust to genetic perturbations. You can mutate almost all the genes in the genome without changing the NC ratio. There are a few candidates when mutated will give slightly, slightly altered NC ratios, and some of these. Altered NC ratios, and some of these are a bit questionable. And many of these are involved in a nuclear transport. So given that the search for molecules was not so successful, we were asking whether perhaps this model, a physical-based model, could explain this NC ratio maintenance. And so there are a few parameters that we think might be important in this. So one is the Important in this. So, one is basically import and export of material into the nucleus through nuclear pores. There's likely to be the nuclear envelope itself and specifically some membrane tension parameters, some lipid flow to maintain the amount of, to allow the nuclear envelope to grow. And finally, we focus on this collioosmotic pressure difference. Call it osmotic pressure difference, basically, where osmotic pressures could be the key thing that's regulating the size of the nucleus. So, what is this colloid osmotic pressure? And this is something that I think is still sort of evolving in our minds as well as in the field. So, we have osmotic pressure, which most of you know contributes to hydrostatic or trigger pressure. And this is coming from. Trigger pressure. And this is coming from small ions and small molecules, so such as potassium or glycerol. Now, and this is what sets sort of the trigger of the cell. So we're talking about colloid osmotic pressure, which is a slightly different thing. This is coming from large macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, other polymers, which conventionally we think of as crowding agents. And these elements can also exert. Can also exert osmotic pressures. They express pressures on other components inside the cytoplasm. So they have effects on phase separations and give crowding effects, stopping from things from moving around well. But then also they can contribute to nuclear size control, as I'll be talking about. So when we're thinking about the nucleus, the nuclear envelope can be regarded as a semi-permeable barrier in which small things In which small things such as the ions can pass through easily, but the larger things such as big protein complexes and nucleic acids have a harder time to go through the pores. And if they do go through, they must be transported by active mechanisms. Okay, so basically then we're left with a picture that the cytop the nucleus, the sorry, the cytoplasm and the nucleus share common Share a common Turger pressure, that's a common concentration of these small ions, but they have distinct sets of macromolecules in the cytoplasm in the nucleus, which contribute to this colloid osmotic pressure. Okay. So at a hackathon, Joel teamed up with Thomas here and started And started writing equations for how this model might look like. So basically, they devise a very simple bag within a bag model where the cell is a bag and the nucleus is a bag, and they're inflated by osmotic pressures. So, in this scenario, we have membrane tension here and both in the cell and on the nucleus. Both in the cell and on the nucleus. We have osmotic pressures, which are generated by numbers of osmotic particles inside the nucleus and numbers of them in the cytoplasm. We have also has this B term, which is a non-osmotic volume. This is basically the dry mass, which takes up volume in the cell that's distinct from water. And then you have your small ions, which don't matter in this, and also. Don't matter in this, and also the macromolecules. So, if we zoom up here, basically, the nuclear envelope is a semi-permeal barrier, which these large macromolecules can't go through, but the ions can. And then you have the plasma membrane. And outside, then you can add osmotic agents, like in our experiments, we add sorbitol, and which will change the osmotic balance of the cell. Okay, so. Okay, so this sort of setup can be written in this very sort of these sort of equations that look like this. They're actually not so complicated. This is banking on sort of Laplace law, but having a bag inside, where the NC ratio is a function of all these different parameters. And we noted there's a special case in which if the sigma n, basically the tension. Basically, the tension in the nuclear envelope is very low or near zero, and the proportion of the dry mass B's are the same. This whole thing collapses into something that says the NCU ratio is proportional to the number of osmotically active agents in the nucleoplasm over the number of these osmotic agents in the total cell. Okay? So, some predictions from the model are these. So, basically, we started then exploring parameter space and seeing what happens to NC ratio when we vary each of these parameters. And so the NC ratio is independent of the sigma C. This is basically the tension on the plasma membrane. If membrane tension is very low, the NC ratio is predicted. NC ratio is predicted to be constant under osmotic shocks. So, this is a graph here which shows the NC ratio as a function of all these changes in the media osmolarity. And you can see that with sigma n equals zero here, that's this blue line that is basically stays constant. And third, we predict that if we alter the number of Alter the number of these n particles in the nucleus and cytoplasm, then this ratio would change and the NC ratio would change. Okay, so I'm going to tell you experiments on these second two points predictions. I'm going to skip the first one, but that is true, that we can show if we take off the cell wall that the NC ratio doesn't change. Okay, so. Okay, so most of the experiments all involve looking at the effects of osmotic shifts on cell and nuclear volumes. And so Joe is a true expert in these type of experiments now, in which he takes cells, these are Pombi cells with the plasma membrane marked as well as the nuclear envelope, and he basically He basically exposes them to different concentrations of sorbitol in the media. So, this hypertonic shock, and you see that the cell shrinks quite a bit, and as well as the nucleus. And you can also do this the opposite of doing hypotonic shocks, and then you can see that the cell swells, and the nucleus actually gets bigger as well. And so we've devised sort of high-throughput 3D imaging and volume analysis. Imaging the volume analysis that's much more robust than what was done before in the field. So he's using segmentation analysis using this program called LIMESIG and doing time-lapse imaging of individual cells, following them in flow chambers. And so this you find in Pombi cells, for instance, that the NCA ratio is very well maintained around this 8% value for 7.6. 7.6. Okay, so the for analysis, then the values can be plotted in these plots, which we call Boil-Van Toff plots. And so basically, this was kind of complicated for me at least. And so I wanted to just go through slowly what this is. So on the x-axis, you have the concentration of Of the osmolarity of the solution that's been normalized. And so this blue regime is hypertonic, and this gray regime here is hypotonic. And then this is the volume that's been normalized of the cell here. And so in hypertonic solutions, you can see that it's low, the cell shrinks, and in hypotonic solutions, the cell swells and is And is and gets bigger. Okay. Hope that's clear to everyone. And so this is predicted that if cells have no membrane tension, that they'll form this relationship, which is a straight line here. And this is indicative of what we call an ideal osmometer, in which the volume of the cell precisely shows you how much. Shows you how much osmotic environment is. Okay. And so these are the experimental results looking at the cell as well as the nucleus. And these are also in protoplasts and whole cells. And so basically the nucleus and protoplasts all behave as this ideal isometer. You can see they line up on the straight line here. On the straight line here. But the cells, the whole cells do not. They have this pattern that's indicative of surface tension, and this is because of the cell wall. Okay, so but in short, though, we find that the nucleus, importantly, is an ideal osmometer. So it corresponds directly to how much is in the osmotic environment. Osmotic environment. And this also suggests that the membrane tension is negligible, so it's very low. Okay, so this makes our analysis now much, much, much easier. If you remember the equation that sigma n equals zero, then all this, the equations all basically collapse down into very simple n over n. Okay, so if the nucleus is an ideal osmonder, the prediction is that the NC ratio should remain constant in hypo and hyper osmotic shocks. So this is just the same experiment I showed you. And basically, if we vary the amount of sorbitol in the media here, you can see that they all maintain the same NC ratio. This is just the same data plotted two ways here. So the MC ratio is basically constant, even though. Constant, even though the cells are being shrunk down into quite small things. Okay. So one thing we want to get at here is that we think that these osmotic pressures are created by macromolecular crowding. So how do we actually measure this? And so we want to do the experiment where we alter the number of osmotically active particles and see how that changes. And see how that changes the nuclear side of Mach ratio. But how do we measure what these big osmotic particles in the first place? And so we turn to using these nanoparticles we call GEMS as a creating sensor. So GEMS are these protein nanoparticles developed by Liam Holt and colleagues, in which these are basically bacterial proteins that. Bacteria proteins that self-assemble into these perfect little spheres, almost virus-like particles. And we can hook up GFP on the outside of them. And so then they form these nice little particles that we can track inside of cells and see how they're moving. And then from these movements, we can deduce what we call defective diffusion coefficients or DEF. DEF here. Stop this. And basically, if you measure diffusions, this gives informs on the crowding and accessible volume in the cytoplasm. So in this experiment, Joe has plotted out basically sorbitol concentrations over and looked at the diffusion coefficient. And you see that there's this beautiful relationship here as the cells are getting. Here. As the cells are getting smaller, crowding is increased, and these particles are moving less well to the point where they almost stop here. Okay. And so we can also then relate then the cellar volume to the diffusion coefficient. And these results, which I find rather remarkably Beautiful is that they really follow this physical model of diffusion in polymer solutions, which the cells are, the cytoplasm is acting very well here. Okay. So, to probe the crowding within the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we've used these gems which are in the cytoplasm as well as ones which go specifically into Well, as ones which go specifically into the nucleus. And we find that the gems do move a bit faster in the nucleus, but also that under osmotic shocks that they really behave very similar to the gems inside the cytoplasm. So it really feels like that the general milieu of the cytoplasm, the general crowding nature of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are pretty similar. Nucleoplasm are pretty similar. Okay, so now we can get back to our prediction that if we disrupt this ratio of N in the nucleus over N total, that we'll see a difference in the nucleoside of Michael ratio. And so we can do this one way by inhibiting nuclear export. So, what this does is that they're normally proteins that are growing in and out of the nucleus. And if we stop the export, then things will accumulate inside the nucleus, and you'll get more and more stuff inside the nucleus. So, and nuclear will go up. Okay, so to do this, we treated cells with leptomycin B, which is a drug inhibitor of this exportin involved in nuclear transport out of the nucleus. And indeed, the nucleus does get bigger. So, these are graphs. These are graphs showing that the cells are still growing at comparable rates, but the nucleus is actually growing at a rate faster than the cell. And so this leads to then an increase in the NC ratio in as little as 15 minutes here. And you can see this is individual cells, and this is for many cells. Okay. And so now we can look to see what's happening inside the nucleus and cytoplasm using these gems. So this is a bit complicated. This purple here is looking at the nucleus. And what happens is that even in 15 minutes, the gems start diffusing a little bit slower. So this suggests that it's getting more crowded inside of the nucleus and they can't move as well. But then it sort of corrects back to itself. Then it sort of corrects back to itself within an hour. Now, if you look at the cytoplasmic gems here, they basically have this trend where they're moving faster and faster, which indicates that the cytoplasm is becoming more dilute. So this kind of makes sense that things are going in the nucleus, the nucleus is getting bigger, and so there's less stuff inside the cytoplasm, and that's why it's becoming more dilute. So we started. So, we started looking to see what could be happening in terms of molecules. And so, indeed, certain shelving proteins, such as ribosomal large subunit proteins, are accumulating the nucleus in these circumstances. So, even over an hour, for instance, you can see that it starts off being very little there into quite a bit is there. And we also looked at whole protein and RNA. Whole protein and RNA by using this FIT staining. It's a dye that stains these. And basically, we can't see much difference there at all. So it's not like everything is going inside the nucleus, but it's more that specific components, maybe a small subset of the total, are actually contributing to these changes in crowding and then nuclear size control. Okay, so next we want. Okay, so next we want to see how this model might handle the fact that cells are growing and also correcting themselves. So how does the nucleus and cell grow at proportional rates? And also, how does the nucleus do homeostasis? So it's been noted that if the NCO ratio is off, that the cell is able to somehow correct this over time. And so we Time. And so we studied this using this POM1 mutant, which is a polarity mutant that tends to divide asymmetrically. So you can see here instead of putting the septum in the middle, it's putting the septum here somewhere off center. And the nuclei, however, don't know this and they're dividing symmetrically. So you have two symmetric, two similar size nuclei, but within cells that are asymmetric. But within cells that are asymmetrically sized. So, this cell then has an NC ratio that's too low, and this cell has an NC ratio that's too high. Okay, so over time, these cells gradually correct themselves. It's fairly slow, but you can definitely see this trend. So, in this graph, we graph out what the initial NC ratio is. Graph out what the initial NC ratio is. So the normal is around eight here. And so if you're around eight, not much correction is going on. But if you're too small or too large, there's this sort of correction mechanism that's trying to get things back to eight. Okay, so we tried to see whether this could be modeled. And so we had. And so we had this very simple growth model based on sort of our osmotic theory here. So the model goes as such: where cells and nuclei are growing the cell cycle by mass accumulation. Mass is consistently, constantly increasing in these growing cells. And the biosynthesis rate is actually determined by the size of the cytoplasm. And this correlates with exponential growth. And then, so we postulate that 8% of the new mass is partitioned into the nucleus as cells grow. So, 8% comes from the NC ratio of 8%. And basically, our osmotic theory says the concentration of stuff inside the nucleus and out then sets the volume of the nucleus. And so, this model has no additional features such as feedback regulation that appreciates. Feedback regulation that previous models had to invoke. And so, lo and behold, this simple passive nuclear growth model then accounts for this correction behavior. So, the blue is our experimental findings, and then this black line here is the model, and there's no free parameters. So, it's a pretty impressive fit. Okay, so just moving. Okay, so just moving on, people have asked us whether similar osmotic forces may be operating in mammalian nuclei, and there's actually not much data for this yet, but there is this one study from Finan et al. looking at chondrocytes, and they have these Boybantoff plots as well. And their nuclei look something like this, which looks like the curve that we have for high tension. So, this plot indicates. So, this plus indicates that there might be nuclear envelope tension that restricts nuclear expansion in these cells. And one potential candidate could be lamins, for instance, that will not allow the nuclei to expand as much as they would like to. But in any case, these nuclei are clearly sensitive to osmotic forces, and it's likely that osmotic Mechanisms are operating, and then you have other things like membrane tension on top of that that are contributing to size regulation in these mammalian nuclei. Okay, so in summary, we're proposing a physical model for nuclear size scaling, which is based on Nuclear size scaling, which is based on colliate osmotic pressure. This accounts for nuclear growth and homeostasis, and notably, there's no need for any fancy active feedback regulation. In POMBI, the nucleus is acting like a perfect, this ideal osmometer. So it's regulated primarily by osmotic pressures here. But in other cell types, such as mammalian cells, there might be additional inputs or factors such as nuclear onlook tension. And in general, And in general, we find this is going to be a very good demonstration of the effects of collierosmotic pressures on regulating intracellular organization. Okay, so I'd like to thank the work. Much of this work was done by Joel Lemaire and Paula Riel in my lab, Joel and Paula, in collaborating with Thomas Fay. And thank you for your attention. Great. Let's thank Fred for a great talk. Great talk. And then I see Ed has his hand up. Quickly, Superjeet had a question in the chat. So maybe, I don't know, Superjee, if you want to ask your question live. Yeah. Can you hear me? Yep. Yeah. So this is a really nice finding that effective membrane tension in the nucleus is held at a very low value. Held at a very low value. So, my question is: Do you think this is due to some passive excess membrane reservoir held at buffer? Or this is because there is some active transport of lipids through because the ERM and the nuclear membrane is contiguous. So, there is some kind of active method of maintaining the low tension homeostasis. Right. So, in our case, it's probably the fact that the ER. The fact that the ER is contiguous with the nuclear envelope, so there is a built-in membrane reservoir that could be doing this. Great. In other systems like mammalian cells, there could be extensive membrane invaginations into the nucleus as well. Great. I think Ed was next. Hey, yeah, great, great talk, Fred. Really interesting. I'm just, I think your model for the correction. For the correction of the NC ratio says that it depends on actual growth, synthesis, and growth. So, the prediction is that if you were to inhibit growth, you would get no correction at all. Have you tried to test that? And also the time scale for correction should be dependent on the time, on the growth rate, basically. Yes, those experiments are on the books, but that's great predictions. Yeah. The current time scale is exactly how the cells are growing. Exactly what how the cells are growing is cool. Melissa? Okay, and then if I understand the model correctly too, so it really depends that resetting really depends on the constant 8% nuclear proteins to 92% cytoplasmic being transcribed. So is that correct? That it's that transcription being constant ratio that would Constant ratio that would kind of set the nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. So I think you mean translation? Well, okay. I was assuming that translation would be correct. But yes, one of those. It's a little right. You can say like, well, 8% of the cellar of the in the cell, 8% goes into the nucleus. There's, you know, there's that much of it. That much of it. Yeah, I'm assuming that it's only proteins that are supposed to be in the nucleus that are going in there. And so that it's really the either transcription or translation ratio that sets that. Yeah, so it's a little more complicated because I think a lot of proteins are going in and out all the time, even like ribosomal subunits. So, and then you also have RNA is probably a large component of this. RNA is probably a large component of this as well. Okay, so you think then that 8% could kind of be compensated for? So it's not just the amount of each type of protein that's being synthesized, but that proteins might move into the other compartment based on osmotic pressure? So maybe what you're asking is like if the NCU ratio is off, is there some massive then reassignment of where proteins are? Reassignment of where proteins go. And I don't think so. Our model is that that doesn't need to happen. It's just like the same bulk flow that usually happened is still happening in that case, but it would be itself correct that way. Okay. Okay. Order, John. Yeah, very nice talk. I have a question about these multinucleated cells. Do they crowd more the cytoplasm and therefore have maybe And therefore, have maybe a different NC ratio, or have you looked at that at all? We haven't looked at that yet. Yeah, that'd be great experiments to do. That's sort of one of the things on the books to investigate those multinucleate cells more. My feeling is that everything, what is being, you know, the sort of the crowding within each nucleus and the cytoplasm, that's what really is key here, that the cell knows how to maintain that so everything keeps on working properly. That so everything keeps on working properly. Jay? Yeah. Do I need to turn on my camera? Yeah, so you showed the volume dependence on the effective diffusivity of gems. I think I just missed it. You just did a single, there's a single Is it single particle tracking? Yes, the single particle trapping. So remember that when you write cell volume, it's not necessarily just any big cell or any little cell, but it's taking the same size cell and making it shrink or swell due to osmotic pressures. Okay, so did you do 2D or 3D tracking? So this is all 2D tracking. We have done a ton. Tracking. We have done a tiny bit of 3D tracking as well that shows that it doesn't affect our value so much. And how would you compensate for the effect of the boundary on your diffusivity calculation? I think that would insert some volume dependence by itself, wouldn't it? You wouldn't want that to. That is a good question. That is a good question. I think we've looked at under normal conditions, we've looked at different size cells and trying to see whether that makes a difference. And I don't think it does. Joelle, are you around? I'm around if you need. Yeah, I think I did the math with the diffusion. And basically, you need to be more than below a micrometer and the nucleus. Micrometer and the nucleus is bigger than that, so we don't have this problem. You need to be below the size of the outer boundary in some sense has to be larger than a micron is what you're saying. Yeah. And the nucleus is bigger than that. So we're not hitting that issue. So do you just like select particle trajectories that you think? Particle trajectories that you think don't interact with the boundary then? Oh, no, no, no, no, sorry. I'm taking every gems that I can, but what I'm saying is like the boundary you're looking at with the diffusion value that I have, you can like have an order of magnitude of what would be the distance where the, how do you call that, the caging effect would happen. And it's basically a micrometer in diameter if you had a Micrometer in diameter, if you had a sphere inside, you know, and so the nucleus is bigger than that. So, even for the nuclear gems, we don't have that issue. And that's why I don't bother. Okay, thanks. I had a hand up again, but first, any other questions from the room? I think we're good for it. Yeah, just I'm trying to think about it. So, do you think that it's it? So, do you think that it's that what a cell cares about is the actually maintaining the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic size, or is it maintaining the size of the nucleus over time as the cell grows and the size of the maintaining biochemical properties in cytoplasm and in nucleoplasm constant as a cell grows, and that this ratio being constant is just an epiphenomenon of that. Epiphenomenon of that. Or that's just, I'm asking your perspective on that, I guess. I think you just stated it well. Yes, I think the cell is trying to keep their amount of crowding their constant. And to do that, it needs to then grow the nucleus to a certain amount. Okay, cool. And I'll ask one more last one if I may say that I was really struck by the multicellular, the multi-nuclear experiments. Multinuclear experiments that suggest there's maybe some local regulation of the colloids. So maybe that cell tells you something about the size of the colloids that are likely to be relevant. Yeah, and see what is responsible for those spatial controls. Yeah. Great. Thank Fred again. Yeah. Thank you. So Maitrey will be telling us about the role of CDC42 in cytokinesis. In cytokinesis.
