I would like to thank Julens and Hom and Laura for organizing the conference. It's really nice. Arranging for that gang of help to come visit us yesterday was especially nice touch. So thank you for that. So I will talk mostly in the second part about representing homology classes of hypersurfaces in CP3. P3, which is, we'll see that that's a very, it's a natural question, it doesn't require much background to actually pose. But I will talk about your presenting in theory, you know, what would it mean to try to find the simplest representatives of Let me check it's just working. Okay. Okay, so the question that I want to talk about is if you have a so if you have an n-dimensional real manifold, this would be very general but now vague at the beginning. So you have an n-dimensional real closed-oriented manifold and you take a homology. And you take a homology class of, so n minus q homology class, and then you want to find the simplest representative of that homology class, the simplest manifold. So before I say, if I forget, so all manifolds are going to be smooth, so it's nothing topological, so everything's going to be smooth except for maybe one cusp singularity just to show off. But and without bounds, And without boundary, and so the nicest thing you can think of, and also compact and so on. So it's not so easy to say what one means with this question, because if you have high dimensions, then there's many things you can say, you can find, you can think being the simplest. And so, for the first part of the lecture, I will. Of the lecture, I will just introduce what specifically we mean by this problem, you know, one way to pose it. So that will take some time and then present the results. And then if I pace myself okay, I give a sketch of the proof. If I don't pace myself right, then I nervously go through the sketch of the proof. So, one of those things. Okay, so, oh, the other way. The other way. Okay, so first of all, any such homology class can be represented by a manifold, because you can think of the cohomology, the second cohomology to be just the maps from your manifold to C P infinity. And you can always deform such a map to be, to lie in the fat for the image to lie in the finite part. Part and then you can also arrange it, it's transversal to the hypersurface, and then the homology class is going to be represented by the inverse of that hypersurface. So you can find a sub-manifold representing any such homology class. So at least in this sense, the question makes sense. This is very well known in if you're putting surfaces inside complex surfaces. Complex surfaces. So then, the question is really very natural because the only thing that you have for surfaces is you want to see what the size is of the first homology, and you can minimize that. And if you have a complex curve inside a complex surface, then you have this adjunction formula which gives you the genus. Genus, and I'll write this down. And because you have, at least for many surfaces, for example, for Keller surfaces of general type, you have the adjunction inequality, which tells you that whichever manifold you put inside I put an n here s plus s squared. Plus s square, so this is this is negative, right? So and if you know, so you have this adjunction formula, so at least in many situations where we have this adjunction inequality, it's obvious that uh complex curves are gonna minimize the genus because this uh with the minus sign here, right, you have uh oh sorry, that's a plus curve. With the minus here, you have an equality with zero, so the only way if you decrease the genus, then you would violate this inequality. So that's, I think the adjuncture formula is probably the reason why complex analysts, like those dealing with Stein manipulators, actually care about these problems. And this was explained a lot in Robert's lecture on Monday. Robert's lecture on Monday. Maybe, just as a side note, the way at least I, or complex analysts, sort of prove this formula is that there's a notion if you put a surface, if you put a real surface in a complex surface, then there's a notion of these degenerate points, CR degenerate points, which are positive, which can be positive and negative, and they can be classified as elliptic. And they can be classified as elliptic and hyperbolic. So I'll write this down very quickly because this is not the main focus of the talk. But for example, if you just standard put a sphere inside the way that you would write it down, first in C2, you will have these two points where the tangent space is going to be a complex line. And at this point, the orientation that you bring from the well From the, well, it depends how you orient it, but at this point, the orientation is going to agree with that orientation which they inherited from the context structure, and at this is going to be the opposite. So this is going to be a positive point, this is going to be a negative point, and this one is going to be elliptic and a little bit bigger. But you can make hyperbolic points also if you just push things down a little bit and you get things that equal cell points. So there's a notion of elliptic. So, there's a notion of elliptic, and elliptic parts are the ballic parts that can be lessened by this positive and negative. And the formula that you can very easily prove is that if you write the index that e plus minus is the number of positive elliptic points, so by sign you can you you get two indices, the code lie indices, and you can calculate how many you have well. You have what these indices are, but actually exactly this formula. So there's a plus, minus, and then C1 and S plus S squared. This is quite easy. And then if you have a complex curve, then you'll have, after small perturbation, you will have no negative points because it's only. Negative points because it's all positive. So we'll have no negative points. So this will have to be zero for the complex curve. So we get this adjunction formula. Okay, so this general stomp conjecture, I've written basically the symplectic and the complex part in the same theorem. This is now a theorem, of course. This is now a theorem, of course, is that smooth complex curves in a Keller surface are genus minimizing in a homology class, and the same holds for symplectic surfaces inside the closed symplectic four-manifolds. As I said, if you have this adjunction equality, then this easily follows, but you don't always have such a nice adjunction equality. So the results were proven, I think, from 94 to the 2000s. I think that the paper came out for the symbol. Came out for the symbolic case by Fitches and Fronheim, Roek, Morgan, Samotau, Souchwetzabo, and this one uses cyber-written theory. Okay, so this is still a vague question, but what I mostly focus is finding simply so are smooth complex hypersurfaces the simplest smooth manifolds in their homology class in C? Manifolds in their homology class in Cpn plus 1. Okay, so again, as I said, I mean, for surfaces, it's very easy to understand what this question means. There's no ambiguity, and everybody would probably agree that you just have to minimize the genus. For four manifolds, so if you put four manifolds into CP3, then also there's a very natural formulation, which means that maybe you just want to look for simply connected manifolds. Connected manifolds, and then you just minimize the second homology. But in higher dimensions, it's not so clear because you have lots of non-trivial homologies, and you maybe don't know what you want. So the next part, I will focus on posing this problem a bit better, and we will try to find the simplest representatives inside some class of submanifolds that Sub-manifolds that mimic what complex hypersurfaces possess. So, basically, the stuff that comes from the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. So, I'll quickly say a few words about the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, mostly because I have to put in some convexity, and there's a strictly Lewis of harmonic function here in the proof. So, I'll go quickly through the proof. So, you start with a complex summation. So you start with a complex sum manifold in CPNs for some large n, for example, and so this manifold m will say it's of dimension m plus one just so that the numbers then don't get get nicer. And you have a hyperplane and then you have the intersection of that manifold with that hyperplane that gives you some smaller sub-manifold. And then the simplest proof that I know of the Lefschetz hyperplane theory. I know of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem is that, okay, if you pick a point that doesn't lie on your hyperplane, and it's just, so then you basically just in CPN, and you take the distance function, you can pick this point so the things will be nice and generic and transversal to whatever you want. And so this function is strictly purely sopharmonic. So that means that if you So that means that if you restrict it to M without K, it will have critical points, so 1 over F. So F would have critical points of index, just n less, and 1 over F will have just critical points of index greater than or equal to N plus 1. And then a small, so this is a small, if you pick a small A, this will be a small tubular neighborhood of K in your. Be a small tubular neighborhood of K in your manifold M. So this is M, this is K. So this will be a small tubular neighborhood. And because this is strictly plurisopharmonic, you will only add handles to this to build then M, you will only add handles of dimension greater than or equal to M plus 1. So you get that all the That all the pi k are going to be zero. So if you take, so if you look at this part and take relative groups, then these are all going to be zero. So all elementary groups are going to be zero. And also, of course, then you get that the HKs are going to be the same for k ma uh less than n and Less than n and in the middle homology against rejection. So from so basically k will have the same homology groups, small ones that m does, and in the middle homology, you will get that k is maybe better. Right. Um so because we will uh Because we will work in CPN, you can apply this Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to get the situation that M is actually CPN plus one and K that you have here is a smooth hypersurface of degree D, basically any hypersurface of degree D. And the way you do it is that you build the there in this map that sends CPN plus one into some CPN, some large n that you can calculate. Some large ends, you can calculate what it is. And so of degree D, this means that you basically just put all the homogeneous monomials and separate them by comma of degree D and you get the map to CPN. And then if you pick a hyperplane in this large CPN, this is exactly going to give you the right hyperplane. This is exactly going to give you the desired hyperplane. Desired hypersurface. So Lefsch's hyperplane theorem then essentially tells you that CPN, again, if you take a tubular neighborhood of your V D, so from that tubular neighborhood, your CPN plus one is just going to be built by handles that are greater than n, n plus one, right? So we'll again get this condition that we had before that Cp n plus one, the fundamental. Had before that Cpn plus 1, the fundamental groups are going to be 0 for K less than or equal to N, and the homology will agree basically up to n minus 1 with Cpn plus 1, and maybe you'll get some, I mean, of course, you will get some more in middle homology because this is this is probably very small. Okay. So the class of manifolds that I don't know how natural they are, but they've been studied, I think, in the 70s a lot, where these tout sub-manifolds that sort of take the Lefschetz-Huperplane theorem, the conclusion of the Lefschetz-Huperplane theorem, and make it as the definition of the manifold. So you will call a sub-manifold of some larger manifold of codimension to taunt if, when you take a tubular neighbor, If when you take a tubular neighborhood, all these groups are going to be zero up to n. So any such, any homology class can actually be represented by a Tausum manifold. So it makes sense to ask a question in this category. And the nice thing then when you try to pose a question about a simple manifold is that, of course, if you have n, then If you have n, then all these Batty numbers to up to n, right, are the same as the one from the larger manifold. You have something more in the middle dimension. And then all the rest of homology is also fixed, just by compared to editorial. So you can just vary inside this class of taut manifolds, you can just vary basically the middle Betty number. You can always increase it by just adding some tribute. Increase it by just adding some trivial handles, you can always increase it, but you may not be able to decrease it much. And what we've shown before is that, so smooth complex hypersurfaces in CPN plus one are taut, right? And now the question that one can now really nicely pose is that find a taut representative of some homology class that has the smallest middle The smallest meaning number. Okay, so we saw one bound is the one coming from the ambient manifold. So the Betty number of the ambient manifold in that decree. But you will try to get better bounds. So these are Thomas Wood bounds from a paper in 74 and it's a It's a bit complicated. I mean, they focused actually on the case that's the complicated one. So I'll present the simpler one when you take n to be even. I think this is probably more well known. So if n is even, then you have this intersection form in the middle homology of your manifold n, and it's represented by a matrix. So if you model torsion, it's represented by a symmetric unimodal matrix. Unimodular matrix. The signature of the matrix is defined to be, so you have a symmetric matrix, it's unimodular. You can diagonalize it, see what's positive, what's negative, the positive part, the number of positive eigenvalues is Bn plus and the negative ones are Bn minus. And the signature theory, which doesn't, we don't care here what the actual form is because we did it in simple cases and you can do it differently. But there is a signature form that tells you that. Formula that tells you that for such a manifold, the signature only depends basically in which class you are and on the ambient manifold. So all are going to have the same signature. All the manifolds that you represent that you get inside. Okay. So these are called Thomas Wood bounds, then in this situation when n is even, that the nth Patty number has to be larger of. Number has to be larger of the signature because the matrix cannot be smaller than its signature, right? So these are the bounds. And much more complicated is in the case when M is odd, because then you have to use Satia-Zinger's G-signature theorem and play around. But you do get bounds of a similar type also for a situation when n is odd. And these bounds are, of course, much better usually than what you get just from the Than what you get just from the Lefschez hyperplane theorem. Okay, so results in CPM. Friedman, I think in his thesis already proved that complex hypersurfaces is not minimal when you take CP2N and N. And M is prime, sorry, again, D is prime, and there are some exclusions here. And the Thomas Wood bounds are almost achieved. So I think this probably Friedman's proof can be generalized to also get the odd case, the odd situation. So Cp 2m plus 1, but we were not able to see how you could get the situation in CP3. So CP3 is a little bit So CP3 is a little bit special and doesn't work with this machine or at least we were unable to achieve the result. So essentially the open problem was then in CP3 and we were able to prove with Danny Gruperman Sachesterle that in CP3, so you will always, as long as you're in a high enough degree, you will always be A high enough degree, you will always be able to find a simpler representative of the homology class. Okay, so I mean, it took me some years to realize that complex things should not necessarily be the simplest, right? I mean, it just says in the word, right? Maybe symplectic things should be the simplest, right? But okay, so maybe these questions. And we have some bound how much we can basically improve. we can basically improve on the we'll see later basically for we can sort of cancel one fourth of the of the homology of the V D for large T okay the construction that we have definitely produces simply connected manifolds but does not necessarily produce touts and manifolds but there's a we couldn't find it in print just by a theorem of Quiddus for It's just by a theorem of Twin as quoted by Friedman, you can re-embed such things to be taunts of nanopodes. So you can have in the end taunts of nanopodes. As we will see, probably the bounds that we have are not optimal. You could probably improve on this. So, since we'll focus on CP3, and CP3 you can calculate everything you want for the complex hypersurfaces. Complex hypersurfaces. I mean, of course, they're simply connected, so there's nothing in the first and the third homology. And you can calculate the size of the second homology. It doesn't really matter what it is, but maybe just to focus that it grows as d cubed, right? The size of the second homology. So if you take the intersection form, you can easily calculate also the genus by the Hitzebruck signature theorem, and you can. Signature theorem, and you get this bound. I mean, you get this number for the genus. So Thomas Wood bounds would tell you that sort of grows with one-third of d cubed, right? So you have some improvements, so maybe two-thirds of d cubed you could possibly improve. I mean, I'll talk about it later. You can also I mean you can this intersection forms, you know what you're actually gonna get. You know what you're actually gonna get. I mean, this is not just because of VD, but we have a classification of such matrices, and you can see that if this even is going to be spin, and it's going to be represented by some minus EA, these are these matrices that are these minus 2s and all the minus above and something on the side. And this H part, so something in H part. So H part is going to be just. So each part is going to be just of the diagonal, it's going to have one and on the back. So two by two matrix that's 0, 1, 1, 0. And these are such that you could sort of think that you can cancel by surgery, the things that come from H. And in the odd case, you just have the plus ones and minus ones of the diagonal, for the intersection form. Okay, so Okay, so we do get this Thomas Wood bound, so that comes from the signature theorem, how much you can improve on the on the submanifold. You also have one more condition that this class, so if you have V and intersected with Cp2, you get some second homology class on V, and this is a positive class. So you always have to have at least one positive class in the second homology. So B plus. Second homology. So B plus has to be greater or equal to 1, which means that you can just improve on this bound by 1, for example. And so as I said, this grows as d cubed, and you could hope for this much improvement. So for two-thirds of D cubed, you can hope for improvements. And I'll explain that you had an extra complication in the even case that you cannot hope to improve for this much. So this, in the even case, So, this in the even case, these Thomas Wood bounds are definitely no, that they are not the optimal things that you can achieve. So, these are the extra complications in the even case that come from Ferruta's theorem. Well, I don't know if I call it complications, just what it is. And so, there's this 11-8 conjecture, it's not yet proven, but so as I said, in odd case, when D is odd, you can basically get perhaps the. Basically, get perhaps the optimal bounds. Because if you look at Friedman's proof in higher dimension, said that basically for prime d's, you can almost get the Thomas Lee bound. But if you have an even D, then the manifold is spin, and you know that its intersection form is of this form. And Faruta's theorem gives that the number of this H The number of this H part, so these H's are gonna be at least, they're gonna be at least as many of these. So, at least 2k plus 1 if you have 2K minus e8. And the 11-8 conjecture says that this L perhaps has to be as large as 3K. So, if you calculate this in, you get that in the even case, maybe by Ferruta's theorem, this would be the best bound. So, they will grow as. Bounds, so they will draw as 5d cubed over 12, or if the conjecture is true, then we will get this number. So I'm saying this also that, I mean, we cannot probably hope here to say we got the optimal result and could not be improved even if we were much more clever to cancel these classes. Because we don't know whether the 11-day conjecture is true, at least in the even case. So if I can. If I talk about the so the low degree, you can basically look at maybe what happens if D is, for example, when D is one, your manifold V D is just going to be C P 2. Fine. So the bound is one that you get and the intersection form is just this one and B two is one. So this is the simplest manifold of B P one. Simplest manifold of degree one. In degree two, you get S2 cross S2 as your V2 topologically, right? Or CP1 blown up at a point. And again, so your P2 is two, the bound will be two. That's because you will have one more, so the signature bound would be zero, but then the bound will be two because you have to have one positive. The boundary two because you have to have one positive class, as we said. And this is also the simplest one. So, in degree three, your manifold is CP2 actually blown up six times. And I forgot to write that the bound here is actually seven because you have to have one positive class. And this is B2, so this is also the C. This is B2, so this is also the simplest one. So you cannot do any better than that. Because you have to have something positive. So when D is 4, you get a K3 surface. The bound that you get by this, either Farruta's theorem and 11-8 conjecture give you the same bound, and the bound is twenty-two. So here, the optimal bound is twenty-two, and B two is twenty two. So K three surface is also something you cannot improve on. Also, something you cannot improve on. But then, as you go higher, you see that there's probably lots of room for improvement. So, I don't know what the manifold is. I don't know if anybody knows what this manifold is when you put d equals 5, but it's definitely not optimal. And when it's 6, I also don't know what the manifold is. I know the intersection form. So, this is the bound coming from Ferruta's theorem, this is the bound coming from 11-8 conjecture, and this is the actual. And this is the actual B2 for the hyper surface. Now, so I paste myself right, so maybe I didn't finish earlier. So I'll do a sketch of the proof. The proof is actually quite simple if you don't take into account some problems in the end that I'll talk about. So what we look first is for some. Look first is for some nice representative of your hypersurface that you can work on. So, what we would like is basically have a representative of this homology class that we can see this part that we will not actually work on. And this is just a nice round ball centered at 1000 and you want to see part of your manifold actually lying inside this S5 in the boundary. Inside this S5 in the boundary. So this thing is going to be your manifold. So this is just simply achieved if you take this singular hypersurface that has the, of course, this Casp singularity here and then just replace this part by the minner fighter. Okay? So we replace this fighter. So we basically will. This fiber, so we basically will get this manifold. But we want to understand what this Milner fiber is. And the way to understand is that we do some branch coverings and try to connect things for the torus knots which have been computed before. So if you take this singular hypersurface intersected with the boundary, you get the Brisbane sphere in the boundary. Okay? And this Brisbane sphere is actually default. Response here is actually default branch covering of S3 over the Taurus node. The whole manifold, basically, this one, right, is the default branch number over CP2 of this singular curve inside CP2. I mean, you just, so you're just adding something here. Okay? And the Milner fiber itself that we would use to replace. Itself that we will use to replace this singular part is also a default branch covering of B4, so you now look in CP2. And you take the milner fiber of the torus nut, you push it inside, and then the default branch covering is going to be exactly the milner fiber of this brisk one sphere. So then, in the end, if we replace this, we're basically working with This we're basically working with this manifold. I mean, this so this is the easiest in parentheses because what's the meaning of this is not completely understood, I think, lately. And the point is that we can then simply work and try to improve on this part FD that we can understand through understanding the cipher surface for the torus, not through the wrench covering. And so using Kaufman's theorem from 37 and Abolut Kirby's results from the 80s, we can connect, if you look at these branched coverings, we can actually connect the Seifert matrix for F D with the Seifert matrix for the so for the sigma D, which is the Sigma D, which is the Milner fiber or the ciphered surface for the torus knot. So this is the ciphered surface for the torus knot. And this way you can then write down the ciphered surface for this Fd, which is the ciphered manifold for our prison sphere. And you understand what the intersection form is also. So if we're able to find So if we're able to find if in this ciphered matrix you're able to find some large subgroups in which the ciphered matrix is going to look like this and this is going to be I plus upper diagonal. This is going to be some so strictly upper diagonal. So, strictly upper diagonal, strictly lower diagonal, and whatever we want here. And these classes have the potential, so these classes have the potential to be actually cancelled by surgery. Then if you write the intersection form, then these classes are actually, they can be rearranged by maybe so just changing the basis, they can be rearranged. bases, they can be rearranged to give you. So this is some number R then these are going to give you R times this H. So I'm going to give you R times 0, 1, 1, 0 in the intersection form. So these are potentially the classes that you can cancel. And so there was a result from Baderfelder, Leverk, and Lichte from 2008. 2018 that identified such a large subgroup for the ciphered matrix of the of sigma d and then we just and this subgroup was of size sorry yeah this subgroup was of size d square over eight okay Okay, and so we get a subgroup of approximately this size for the ciphered matrix. Now, if these classes were represented by spheres, then so you have, so this is a sphere, these two points are a sphere, then you can just surger this out because the so you just take out s2 cross d2 and then you would replace. And then you would replace it by D3 cross S1. You would just replace it here. So this is the D3. And everything sort of works out nicely. And you can do this cancellation. We can do this surgery inside the ball. But the problem is that actually these elements cannot be represented by spheres. There's no way to represent them by spheres. Because this would violate the adjunction we call it. Would violate the adjunction inequality. So that's the main obstacle actually of the proof. And so to solve this problem, use Wall stabilization theorem. So Wall stabilization theorem says that whenever you take some manifold and you stabilize it enough times. So I think in the odd case you only have to stabilize it maybe once, but for even Once, but for even you, maybe you have to stabilize it more times. And here, right? And then in the end, you will get, so okay, you will get your model manifold. So any two manifolds will become the same after stabilization. So instead of this manifold that we don't understand nicely, we can work with this model manifold and after stabilization. And in the odd case, we can work. And in the odd case, we can work actually with this manifold after stimulation. And now you've, of course, artificially added quite a lot of classes that you still want to cancel. So you've added on the second homologue, so it seems that you're going the wrong direction. But all these classes can then afterwards be cancelled out. So you added some classes and then maybe if someone knows you really Someone knows this would be really nice. So we can do so. The problem that we kind of ran into is so you have this nice FD part here, and you can really locally inside S3 you can do these stabilizations. This is not a problem, you can stabilize it just by adding this handle inside uh S5 here. S5 here, but you don't know whether the and then you know that after stabilization you will have lots of spheres inside, but you don't know, I think, even if you do the stabilization here, whether the spheres might escape to this part here. I mean, Lawrence theorem says that you have one manifold as same as the other, as the whole thing, but there's I didn't really find any relative version that would sort of keep the spheres in place here. Keep the spheres in place. If this was the case, then things would be much easier than to proceed. But because they can escape, there's actually quite a lot of work that I don't want to get into to bring sort of the spheres down. Well, we don't bring them down actually. We just figured out that you can also cancel them, even if they escape to that part there. So that way you can just cancel all the I mean the the number of Okay, and actually I am finished. So thank you very much. So are there any questions? So resume. I mean you add if you want or something so I don't know. Perhaps I mean I don't know if I would nicely do the end of the instructions. I mean I know it can I I really read on yeah. I mean it there is like a thing cannot be symplected because it's too large, right? Just a syntactic manifold, not symplectic inside, right? Well either one. No, I no idea. I have no idea. Yeah, wait, sorry, can you say I got you said these submanifolds can be symplectic, cannot be? No, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. The FD plus the average cap, that should be supplied. Before you do the surgery, yeah. Sure, sure. But after you do the surgery, I don't know. I mean, we can. I mean we can it's easy to see well yeah, as I said, it's easy to see the single collected and you can then see that they're taued but more than that I I I have no idea. For the questions, let's thank Mark Aud. I guess we start at 10:30, we stick to schedule 10.
