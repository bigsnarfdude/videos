So uh hi everyone, thanks for uh you know organizing this uh conference in these amazing mountains and uh giving me a chance to talk to you about some of the more recent work in the Schleier-Smith lab at Stanford on engineering entanglement between atomic ensembles with photons. So we've heard a lot of talks about We've heard a lot of talks about calculating things and simulating quantum systems. But if we have a physical system and we want to do some experiments where we look at open quantum dynamics, well, one, we want to have some sort of system with some level of control, and we also want to have some sort of reservoir, and we want to have some sort of coupling between the system and the reservoir that we can control, you know, by like something, some knob we. Some knob we turn in the lab. But on top of that, we also want to be able to measure some sort of dynamics. And so we need to be able to measure observables as a function of time as we perform these experiments. And one thing that I talked about in the first talk today was about some of this NISC hardware, where we've seen sort of really rapid progress in building experimental platforms. Platforms. So the platform I work on is neutral atoms. So these are atoms that have usually one or two valence electrons. And they're sort of very well defined techniques to cool and trap these atoms. And they have a couple nice properties. So the first is that it's a very scalable platform. So just a linear increase in laser power sort of gives you a linear increase in the number of qubits. Number of qubits you could have, say, or the number of spins. And it's possible to image sort of individual atoms or groups of atoms. So, this picture here from 2016, each one of these bright spots is a single atom that's been imaged under fluorescence, and you can do this in a sort of state-sensitive way. But maybe the name neutral atom tells you something. One sort of tricky thing is these atoms don't interact on their own. Don't interact on their own, which makes them nice for studying quantum systems. But fundamentally, we're interested in interactions between these degrees of freedom. So, how do we couple them? The platform I work on is an optical cavity. And so this, in an optical cavity, an excited atom can emit a photon into the cavity. That photon can bounce around and hit any other atom in the cavity. So this gives you a very So, this gives you a very non-local interaction. You have some sort of Hamiltonian that's completely non-local. And this can be used to generate sort of massively entangled states. So, one particular example is squeeze states, where you generate correlations between and allow you to measure one particular observable, say, at better than a Heisenberg limited way. Limited way at the expense of increasing uncertainty in sort of the conjugate quadrature. And so these interactions only happen when you sort of drive the system, roughly speaking. So you can turn interactions on and off. So they're very controllable in this way. You can generate entanglement. And finally, by looking at the light that comes out of the cavity, you can infer what's going on inside. Going on inside of the cavity. You can learn about the state, the collective state of the atoms. So I guess Nicole talked about weak measurements, and this is a very natural avenue to make weak measurements and do feedback on the dynamics. But in these cavity platforms, there's sort of this question of what's missing, why doesn't everyone just make experiments with cavities? And the main thing is that this all. And the main thing is that this all-to-all interaction gives you entanglement between all these different degrees of freedom, but you lose something in terms of structure. Like, to some degree, if you can just define your state in terms of one single distribution, maybe it becomes less interesting. So there's this question, how do we control the structure of entanglement that we're generating? And then the second question is: normally these experiments use the readout of the cavity to tell you about what's happening. Readout of the cavity to tell you about what's happening in the system. But if I have access to only one observable, how can I even detect any type of sort of multi-mode entanglement? So these are sort of the missing parts of Kevin. So today I'm going to tell you about how we, you know, sort of the specifics of the interactions in our lab, how we can detect and measure entanglement, and finally how we can sort of engineer more complicated states. Okay, so let's start with. Okay, so let's start with the lab. And this is a picture of one table of our experiment. And if we zoom in sort of right in the middle, there's this metal vacuum chamber. And if you look in the viewport, you'll see these two mirrors that are spaced by five centimeters apart. So this forms an optical cavity. And the key point here is that we have sort of this macroscopic length scale between Between the two mirrors. So, a lot of experiments will put mirrors close together, and then you can't really take pictures because the mirrors get in the way. There's no optical axis. But we have this macroscopic setup, and we can put an imaging lens underneath. Now, this cavity allows us to have a standing wave, which serves as a sort of lattice potential, and we put ensembles of roughly 10,000 rubidium atoms in sort of spatially separate. In sort of spatially separated sites. Now, you know, rubidium has sort of a simple atomic level structure. For the purposes of these interactions, we're only going to focus on this F equals one hyperfine state. So we have sort of effective Q traits in each atom. And we can use this imaging lens to take a picture, which will look A picture which will look like this in sort of state-resolved way. So we can see four, four ensembles, and each ensemble we can measure the atomic populations. Okay, so to sort of probe the interactions, what we're going to do is initialize all the atoms in sort of the m equals zero projection of this spinal and heat tray and send in some light to the cavity wall. Some light to the cavity. How do you actually place these atoms in the camera? Yeah, how do we initiate customer? Okay, so you can use lasers to cool atoms and magnetic fields to sort of localize them in like one blob. This is a magneto-optical trap. Basically, you can use the fact that if an atom's moving in one direction, it's going to see a Doppler shift in sort of its resonance. Doppler shift in sort of its resonance frequency. And if I send a photon in the other direction, then it'll absorb that photon, you know, more likely if it's on resonance. So if you send, if I say, send in light that's off resonant a little bit, but the atom's moving this way, it'll seem like it's on resonant, and the atom will pick up the momentum of that photon, right? And so when it picks up that momentum of the photon, it's When it picks up that momentum of the photon, it sort of gets pushed in the other direction. And if you do this with two counter-propagating beams, you can slow down. And if you do it in three dimensions, then you have like do this and you localize the atoms basically, like you have a cold group of atoms. And then we can control directions of laser beams basically using the same technology that's in like a barcode scanner. If you want to spatially separate them, you can sort of move things apart. Sort of move things apart by changing what you're sending into your fancy barcode scanner. I don't know if that. Yeah, um yeah. So yeah, so we initialize sort of in this, all the atoms in this zero state, and we start sending in some light to the cavity. Now, some atom can pick up a photon, be excited, and decay into, say, Into, say, either the minus one or plus one state, and then it'll emit a photon back into the cavity. But in order to maintain, yeah, so then that photon can be absorbed by another atom, which is excited and can decay. But in order to maintain conservation of energy, if we excite one atom to minus one, the same atom that picked up the photon given off by the atom that decayed to minus one has to move into the plus one state. So we have this sort of pair creation. So we have this sort of pair creation process where two atoms in the zero state get converted into an atom in plus one and an atom minus one. But we don't know a priori which one of these atoms is in plus one and minus one. Another thing is because it's a cavity, because we have these protons moving, hitting the mirrors, this process can happen on any single pair of atoms. So we have this sort of like val pair kind of state. Sort of like Bell Pair kind of state that you can have on like some single atom level. And it gives you a Hamiltonian that looks sort of like this: an S plus S minus, where one atom picked up an excitation and one sort of lost one. Yeah, but I don't know how familiar everyone is with their atomic physics, but there's not just a linear separation of energy scales in this ground. Energy scales in this ground state. There's also sort of a quadratic shift of the zero state relative to the plus and minus one state. And so in addition to this plus minus, which you can write as like a xy kind of Hamiltonian, there's some additional energy cost given by this quadratic quadratic Zeimon shift of having pairs of atoms. But the main effect of this is if I have some sort of state in Some sort of state that's asymmetric, some sort of squeezed state state, this quadratic Xamon shift acts to rotate this state. So for the, you know, this quadratic Xamon shift, instead of thinking of spin one as just sort of two of the same spin half objects, this slight energy difference means that there's sort of a quadrupole moment. And so Moment. And so the quadratures that we're going to look at are defined by these variables SX and QYZ. So the sigma x, you know, makes some sense. But the qyz is a sort of quadruple operator. For the purposes of this, I'm just mostly going to refer to them as two conjugate observables, x and p. Okay, so those are the interactions, and next I want to talk a little bit how we detect entanglement. Thing. So I mentioned earlier these sort of squeezed states, which have enhanced sensitivity on one sort of observable at the expense of decreased sensitivity on another. And basically, just by turning on the interactions from a coherent state, the sort of generated entanglement should give you a squeezed state. And so what that looks like is if I have this squeezed state, and I can This squeezed state, and I can measure along one basis. So, say I always measure around along the SX basis. If I allow my state to just rotate under, say, this quadratic Zamon shift, at some point I should see low variance, some low noise, and at some point I should see a very maximized noise. And so we can just do this measurement, allowing the state to rotate. And you can see there's some point where we have sort of less noise than you would expect from a coherent state. Noise than you would expect from a coherent state, which is the standard quantum limit, SQL. And at sort of 90 degrees out of phase, we have like some maximized variance, a maximized noise in our measurement. Now, squeeze states are sort of fundamentally entangled. You're using the quantum correlations to make a measurement that's better than a classical measurement, right? But up until now, no one's really been able to say, you know, if I show you this, you can't say. If I show you this, you can't say that each of these ensembles are actually entangled together, or they're just all entangled together. So we can sort of start to use the imaging capabilities to look and see what we can say about the spatial structure of entanglement that we've generated. So to keep things simple, we're just going to break up these four ensembles into left and right. And if we want to see some entanglement, we can look at sort of an entanglement witness, or just a very basic one. Just a very basic one, which says, okay, if I have these two ensembles, and like the left and the right, and they're independent, then the product of variances should be set by some Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If they are entangled in some quantum way, then I should be able to use information that I learn from the left, for example, to measure on the right beneath the Heisenberg uncertainty plan. Beneath the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So that's all this is saying: that I use the information from the right to infer the left, and the resultant product should be less than one. So what we can do is instead of plotting just the sum of all the ensembles, we can also look at the difference between the left and the right. And you can see that this difference, which is in blue, is just exactly at sort of this coherent spin. This coherent spin state level. And if we look at our uncertainty product, if we choose x to be sort of the minimum and p to be 90 degrees out of phase, if we take the product of like, I don't know, roughly a half and roughly one, that's less than one. So this is sort of a witness of entanglement between these two spatially separated ensembles or groups of ensembles. So the next question is: say, So, the next question is: say, how could we control this structure? And so, the key point that we want to look at is: if this is our Hamiltonian, and we have one part generating rotations, if we look at this part here, this is only going to couple to the sum of all the ensembles. What I mean to say by that is if I take, for example, every even i and just switched it to minus si. To minus si, then this term becomes zero. And so that mode with like only even like a negative sign in front of every even part, will only be affected by these rotations. And we can do this very directly by taking out four ensembles and applying sort of two laser beams that shift energy levels. And if you apply for an appropriate amount of time, you can do a rotation. Of time, you can do a rotation that shifts sx to minus sx and sy to minus sy. So you can sort of generate this mode that's now not coupled to the cavity. And so what we can do is say, like, let's turn on the interactions, generate some squeezed state, and then apply these rotations to switch this squeezed state into something that's not going to couple to the cavity. Going to couple to the cavity. And then turn on interactions one more time. And if we do that, you can see that now the sum and the difference are both squeezed simultaneously. And if we think about our entanglement criterion between the left and the right sides, I mean, this is now like a half and times like, you know, seven. That's bigger than one. But in particular, because these two are the same, we can also look at like a superposition of the two, or add these two up. Position of the two, or add these two up, and we can see that the left and right are sort of squeezed independently, which means that there's now no correlation, there's no entanglement between the left and the right ensembles. And now, this is sort of like an example of minimizing entanglement between the two ensembles. We can also ask how can we maximize the entanglement between the two ensembles. So, if we look at this entanglement witness, what we want to do really is minimize. What we want to do really is minimize the variance in the sum and the variance in the difference in a different quadrature. What we can do is make use of these global rotations under the quadratic Zeeman shift. So what we can do is basically in between our two pulses of interactions, allow one of the modes to rotate 90 degrees with respect to the other. 90 degrees with respect to the other. So, to that end, we'll generate some squeeze state, convert it, switch it from one mode to another, but then allow that mode to rotate, and then squeeze again. So if we do that, we can see sort of these two squeezed modes in different quadratures. And if we think about our entanglement witness, we're now taking the product of half and a half in different places. So this is sort of even more strongly entangled. Even more strongly entangled than just this initial all-to-all coupling. So that tells us how to detect entanglement. Now, you know, I've shown you with two ensembles, and we can make use of the whole four ensembles to do some sort of multi-mode state. So this kind of entanglement witness is really a very minimal example of what's called a cluster state or a graph state. State or a graph state, which is sort of a resource for universal quantum computation. And these states are defined on some sort of lattice or graph, where if I have a single site, it's entangled or it has strong correlations with all of its neighbors in a conjugate basis. So in particular, the green site is in, if its value. In, if it's value in SZ will be strongly correlated in, say, SX with its neighbors. And we can write this as the variance of the momentum on say I should be strongly correlated with all the neighbors given by the adjacency matrix A defining the graph. So, for an example, we can make a square cluster state if we take our definition and If we take our definition and draw out this adjacency matrix, we'll have these sort of four modes that should have low variance that should be squeezed. But the cavity is only going to couple to all of the modes at once. And so it's not actually immediately obvious that you should be able to make this state. But what we can do is a little bit of linear algebra and say, okay, we want this sort of equation to be minimized. Equation to be minimized, but A is a real symmetric matrix. You can diagonalize it and you can rewrite like this: your squeezed modes. But you'll notice that the P and X sort of have the same coefficients, and D is some diagonal matrix giving you eigenvalues. And that's just going to tell you the slope in the XP plane of each one of these modes. And all of these modes are orthogonal. So for our example, So, for our example of the two-mode case, you know, we have this adjacency matrix and these two eigenvalues. So, one's the sum, one's the difference. And you'll notice they have eigenvalues 1 and minus 1, the corresponding slopes of 1 and minus 1, which are in fact slopes that are 90 degrees separated. So, if we think about our previous measurement, it's really just the same thing in a minimal example. Minimal example. Now, if we have this four-mode adjacency matrix, we can decompose it into these four modes. So there's like plus, plus, plus, plus, and then plus, plus, minus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus, and plus, minus, minus, plus. And we can squeeze each of these four collective modes at sort of the appropriate floats. And so if we do that, it looks like this. These two. These two guys are squeezed at a slope of zero, and these two are squeezed at a slope of like minus two and plus two. So that gives you that the angles are like minus 60 and plus 60. Now, just from looking at this, I wouldn't immediately say, oh yeah, this corresponds to a square, but we can sort of work backwards and infer what are the correlations on individual sites. Individual sites. And so if we think about sort of the correlations between the momentum on site I and the position on site J. We have some matrix that looks like this. And if we think about what were the initial modes that we wanted to squeeze, you can see that, for example, on site one, we expect a strong correlation with x2 and x4, and that shows that we're going to be able to do X2 and X4, and that shows up exactly here. And you'll see that this adjacency matrix maps very directly to this correlation matrix. Yeah, so in conclusion here, I just want to, the point that I want to make is that these global dynamics combined with local control sort of allow, give you a very strong platform to programmatically generate entangled states in a way that's. Entangled states in a way that's sort of new in terms of the quantum sensing picture. But also, you know, normally interactions are local. And if I have, you know, two superconducting qubits and I want them to interact, I have to put a wire between them. But if I can combine these local rotations with some sort of global interaction, I can very pro. Sort of global interaction, I can very programmatically generate sort of arbitrary shapes of entangled states. And we can even sort of take this to another level and use sort of floquet engineering to generate dynamics by sort of quickly switching between these modes. So to that end, we can sort of scale up and look at a picture with, say, 18 modes. And we can decompose this into 18 Fourier modes instead of just. Fourier modes instead of just up, down, up, down, up, down, and so on. And if we do this, we can look at the correlations, say, between different sites. And in one particular example, we can generate some correlations that look like this. And from these correlations, you can actually back out the effective geometry in which your spins are interacting. So in this case, we had strong interactions that sort of Strong interactions at sort of the nearest neighbor mode, which corresponds to like the Fourier mode of like pi over, or 2 pi over 18, and then also the Fourier mode at pi. So that gives you sort of nearest neighbor correlations, and then at distance 9, say, some also strong correlations. And if you back out the effective geometry that these interactions happen in, it's sort of this. Happen in, it's sort of this Mobius strip, which is something that's very hard to engineer in any other kind of system. So moving forward, I think these cavity platforms, I didn't talk about any QND measurements that we did, but if you have this sort of control of the interactions and you have some ability to do weak measurements and feedback, that gives you a really broad platform, I think, to start. Broad platform, I think, to start exploring dynamics and sort of in a very controlled setting where you have control of the bath system interaction, for example. And we're also looking at extending this to look at some many-body physics and sort of more exotic geometries that are hard for people to realize in other systems. And using these sort of structures of entanglement to do sort of more robust. For more robust sensing in entanglement, sort of a very fragile commodity. But if you can engineer it in such a way that it's robust to other forms of noise, you can maybe do some sort of more interesting sensing. And you know, any ideas you have to use this sort of system are always exciting. Yeah, and I just want to thank. Yeah, and I just want to thank the group, in particular our PI, Monica Blacksmith, and then Philip and Eric, who were also involved in all these experiments. So yeah, thank you. Do we have any questions in the open? In view of the idea of the conflict again, I want to ask the following question. What about What about the noise when you copy to environment? What is the main sense of the query and something like that? Yeah, so there are two, I guess, for us. One is basically when a photon leaves, if a photon excites an atom, which decays, but then leaves the cavity without exciting another atom, that acts as a source of decoherence on the atomic states. On the atomic states. And the other one is just, you know, we're sending light in to the atoms, and that can scatter them to different states. So those are the two, so basically cavity loss and atom scattering are the two forms of loss. I wonder you had your Mobius strip. Is there a benefit? I mean, I think that was experimental in actually whether the shooting is, but is there a benefit to that over just a basic? Basically it's a surface thing, right? Yeah, um I so I guess for that particular case it was just sort of like, oh, weird geometry that it's hard to do. But I guess if you extend that to like maybe instead of like a ladder to like with three you can get like a Taurus. And if you were interested in say preparing like a Toric code state, that might give you a sort of very direct way cool. We heard school. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice talk. Thank you very much. I think these experiments are very nice. I really like them. I'm just confused about a specific point. Maybe you can clarify it. It's that you speak about maximizing entanglement, but you do that by looking at an entanglement witness. But a witness is not a measure of entanglement, right? So what is it that you mean by maximizing entanglement if you're looking at a witness? Minus in entanglement if you imagine a witness. So I mean, I guess you, yeah, you wouldn't say a priority that minimizing the witness is maximizing entanglement. But just unrelated, right? There's entanglement measures and entanglement witnesses. And entanglement witness only tells you whether or not you're entangled, about how much you're entangled. So when you mention maximizing entanglement, do you mean maximize the amount of parties that are entangled? The amount of parties that are entangled? Is that what you mean? No, in this case, I only showed one entanglement witness, but I think it actually is sort of the state of maximal entanglement between the left and the right. So there's some monogamy of entanglement, right? And so actually, like this. Actually, like this particular state is an example of, say, like Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, Steering. So it's sort of you can use information from, say, the right to infer the left at a level that's better than sort of your Heisenberg limit. Limit, and it's sort of like a measure of quantum teleportation. I guess in this particular case, because there's two modes, there's like only so many ways you can redistribute. And as you, yeah, I mean, there's because it's sort of these Gaussian states, there's also some sort of like monotonicity almost, I would say, of how you talk about entanglement. Before we go to coffee break, are there any questions? Go to coffee break. Are there any questions from online? I have a quick one. Sure. Once you create all these different states, how stable are they? Do they exist for a long time or? Okay. So I guess the question, the I actually give you some time scales. So So to create, like, let's say this form state takes about a millisecond with our parameters. And to do this rotation takes also about a millisecond. So I think up to the time it takes, and they're long-lived compared to safely. They're long-lived compared to, say, photonic squeeze states. I think the limits basically come from the quality of your vacuum and noise in your lattice once you turn the light off. So I would say like generically, the lifetime of this staying entangled is probably like order 10 times how long it takes to make it. It takes to make it, but that's sort of a function of our vacuum quality. So it won't be long enough to perform experiments on these things. Oh, yeah, it's definitely long enough to do other manipulations. I've read that you also lose the atoms from time to time, yeah? Yeah, so that's what comes from the. I've often wonder how you replenish them. Do you inject them back into the background? How do you do it? So once they're trapped in the lattice, you basically lose. Lattice, you basically lose them via collisions with other atoms that are in your vacuum chamber. So if you go to, if you, instead of going under room temperature, have something under like a cryogenic environment, your loss rates go down a lot. But then each measurement we do takes about six seconds where we sort of have a chunk of rubidium in a different Of rubidium in a different chamber that's also under vacuum, and there's some vapor pressure, and so there's some just like room temperature rubidium, and we cool that down and sort of funnel it over to the main experiment. So, like this, every time we take an image, we're sort of blowing all the atoms out of the trap. Back here in about 20 minutes for our last talk of the day, but let's thank this awesome talk.
