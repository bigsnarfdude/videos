Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce Natasha Dobrenen. She'll talk to us today about cofinal types of ultrafilters on measurable cardinals. Okay, thank you. So thank you for the invitation. And I'm starting to regret that I didn't go in person because it sounds like you guys are all having a great time. So anyway. Anyway, here I am in South Bend, not in Oaxaca, but I'm glad to be with all of you. So I'm going to give sort of an overview of what we've been doing on Magical Cardinals and Tukey and give lots of places where there's open problems and some fun things where Tukey behaves differently, or maybe the older filters behave differently. The ultra filters behave differently when they're on measurable cardinals versus omega. So, this is joint work with Tom Benhamu, who is a postdoc at Rutgers with Dimasinapova, and he graduated about two years ago with Git. So, let's review Tukey reduction on partial orders. So, a subset X of a postet P is going to be called co-final. Poset P is going to be called cofinal if every member of P is extended by some member of X. Okay, and given two posets, a function f from Q to P is called cofinal if it takes each cofinal subset of Q to a cofinal subset of P. And in the reverse direction, And in the reverse direction, a function from P to Q is unbounded if G takes every unbounded subset of P to an unbounded subset of Q. And we say that P is 2k reducible to Q if and only if there's a cofinal map from Q to P, if and only if there is an unbounded map. There is an unbounded map from P to Q. So, this is sometimes called Galois-Tuke correspondence by Andreas Blass and some others. And this back and forth was shown by Schmidt in the 40s. Okay, and now this reduction induces an equivalence relation. So we'll say that P and Q are two key equivalents. That P and Q are 2ke equivalent if and only if they're both 2ke less than or equal to each other. And when we're working with directed postsets, then 2ke equivalence happens exactly when there's a third directed post set into which they both embed cofinally. So we may call the equivalence class under Tukey reduction the co-final. The co-final type or the two key type of a directed postset. So that's the background in a nutshell. And now, when we restrict ourselves to ultra filters, we realize that these are directed partial orders under the reverse inclusion. And for now, let kappa be any infinite regular cardinal. So a filtered base is a co-final subset under subset under this reverse inclusion. And a filter base equals a co-final subset. And so a map from an ultra filter U to an ultra filter V is co-final if it takes each filter base of U to a filter base of V. So once again, V is 2ke reducible to U if there is a co-found. If there's a cofinal map or a map taking the filter base, each filter base of U to a filter base of V. Okay, so I've just put that here for reference. And we see that 2P equivalence is an equivalence relation on ultrafilters of some fixed base set or base set size. Size and we'll call this the co-final type or the tukey type of U. So this notion of tukey reduction came from topology when people were trying to extend the notion of convergence from general metric spaces to general topological spaces. And so Tukey did this in terms of nets, which are directed partial order. Which are directed partial orders. And in the special case of ultrafilters, so beta kappa being the space of all ultrafilters on kappa, we see that co-final types are exactly neighborhood bases. So we remember that given an A and an ultra filter, A bar is the basic open set of those ultra filters. Of those ultrafilters which contain A. And these are the open neighborhoods of U. So if A is containing B and they're both in an ultrafilter U, we get these, you know, nested open sets around U. Okay, so Tukey corsons are well-known and beloved Ruden-Kiesler order, or in particular, Ruden-Kiesler reduction implies Tukey reduction. Reduction implies 2G reduction. So let's recall that U is Ruden-Kiesler above V if there's a map from the base set of one ultrafilter to the base set of the other whose lift gives you V. So the lift of U under H is the set of those A's which are subsets of kappa, so that H inverse of A is in U. Well, this is, I find it easy. Is I find it easier to think about this in the forward direction. H of U is the ultrafilter generated by this collection of sets. So U is root and Kiesler equivalent to V if and only if there is a bijection which takes U to V. So that's if and only if U and V are isomorphic as ultrafilters. And so Terms. And so we can see then that a Ruden-Kiesler map induces a Tukey map just by taking the pointwise images. And so Tukey equivalence is a coarse inning of Ruden-Kiesler equivalence. So there's been tons of work on Rudin-Kiesler over the years on multiple different, you know, from omega to Kappa measurable to above there. There. And one of the interesting things in this area is to figure out how exactly do Tuke and Rudin Kiesler correspond to each other. Okay, let's start with talking about maximum cofinal type for ultrafilters on omega. We know that among directed partial orders of size continuum, there is a 2ke maximum and it is. The 2ke maximum, and it is exactly this set: the partial directed partial ordering where you have all finite subsets of C and then this directed by inclusion. And Isbel and Juhas independently showed that in ZFC, there is always an ultrafilter on omega, which is to be maximum. And the construction of such an ultra filter starts with an independent. starts with an independent family of size C. So we've got, you know, some A alpha, alpha less than C, A alpha is infinite. And any, if we take any finite collection and we take AIs, I and I, some finite set and some disjoint Disjoint or some different beta j's, j and j, and take their complement. That was correct. Then this thing is still infinite. So that can be used to make a base of size C for an ultrafilter, and it will get you a tooky top amongst extending it. Okay, so Isabel's problem, this was back from 1965, was whether NZFC, all ultra-tilters on omega, are 2B top. So rewriting what it means to not be 2B top, it means that you will have a collection of C-Many sets in your Ultra filter so that whenever you So that whenever you, so that there exists an infinite subset of them whose intersection is in you. So Isbel's problem consistently has the answer of no. And Milovich was the first one to prove this. So using diamond, he did a construction which in hindsight looks very, very, very close to a Founi product. Very close to a Fouvini product of two p points, and he showed that such an ultrafilter is not 2ke top. And then, in a paper with Todorchevich, we showed that in fact all p points are not 2k top, and hence in particular, so our Ramsey ultra filters are not tukey top. Something that we have for Omega that we don't have on Kappa measurable is stable ordered union ultra tilters. So these are ultra tilters on. Tilters. So these are ultra tilters on base set, the finite subsets of omega, leaving out the empty set, so that it satisfies instances of Heinemann's theorem. So these are technically not P points, technically not Ramsey ultra filters, but as As Ragaman and Stefferns showed very recently, there are models of ZFC which have selective ultrafilters but do not have these stable ordered union ultrafilters. And then Houbini iterates and then something called basically generated, which I'll talk about in a minute, oh, probably in 20 minutes, are not too detailed. And then some follow-up work with Follow-up work with Bless and Raghavan showed that certain non-P points, things which are forced by P omega to the 2, mod fin cross fin, and et cetera, which are very different from P points in flavor, they're still not 2P top. So we have a lot of consistent no's, and what's left of Isabel's problem today, which many of you are aware of and have worked on. Aware of and have worked on is whether there's a model of ZFC in which all ultrafilters on omega are 2p maximum. So, of course, such a model cannot contain any p points. They cannot even contain these non-p points, etc. So, that's a very, very interesting problem. Lots of work has been done on cofinal types of ultracultures on a Final types of ultra filters on omega. So, I'm going to give you sort of the way I think about it in terms of categories of results. So, there's finding conditions under which Rubini products are co-finally equivalent of Cartesian products. And we'll see a difference between measurable cardinals and omega in some later slides. And then we have canonization. Canonizations of co-final maps into continuous maps, or things which are presented by finitary maps, which behave like continuous maps enough that they get you the same sort of results that you want. So, there's been quite a lot of work done on those. And then, other conditions guaranteeing that an ultrafilter is not to be top. There's been a lot of work done on that. And there have been embeddings of various partial orders. So we had two of the C-Many incomparable selective ultra filters under covering meager equals C, P points under U equals D equals P. And lines, there were some lines in here and some overlap of lines in here. And then this really nice result of Raghavan and Stela. Nice result of Raghavan and Shaylaw, where they showed that P omega mod fin embeds the partial ordering into the P points of ultracultures on omega. And then some even more recent work on very long lines and the maximal long line that you get of P points. Then there's other things which are finding conditions under which Tinky reduction implies root and keys or rooten blast. BLAST. This one is the one that we really don't have any analogs at this point for Kappu measurable. The other ones we have some starts on these. And then lastly, exact co-final types. We know nothing about this on Kappa. There was this seminal result showing that Ramsey Ultra filters are. Filters are 2ke minimal, and then some other work finding initial structures inside the 2ke types. And none of these results extend none of them extend at face value because we don't have the same sorts of Ramsey theorems on fronts and barriers. So I'll talk about that a little bit. So, I'll talk about that a little bit more later. Now, we'll get into why this project got started. So, Tom came to UIC last fall, and I had just moved here. And so I invited him to give a talk, and he was talking about Galvin, Galvin, Galvin, Galvin property. And I thought, oh, well, I like Galvin stuff, but it turned out I was interested in a different Galvin. I mean, same Galvin, but different. Same gallons, but different properties. So he explained to me what he was working on, and then I went, wait a minute, that's like the same thing as Tuki Tops. So then we started pulling our resources and did this project. So let's review now some special ultra filters on kappa. Here, except for normal, kappa can be omega. So an ultra filter. So, an ultra filter is going to be uniform if it's non-principal and if kappa is uncountable even more. It's lambda complete if it's closed under intersections of less than lambda many members of U. So less than omega one complete would be, sorry, yeah. Omega one complete would be sigma complete. complete would be sigma complete would imply a measurable measurable cardinal already and then normal is is I was going to say super strong but it's just measurable normal is if your ultra filter is closed under diagonal intersections so given any kappa many members of your ultra filter this diagonal intersection This diagonal intersection is again a member of U. So the diagonal intersection is made by taking more and more intersections up to new of this sequence in U. It's Ramsey if it has the Ramsey property for functions on pairs of kappa. It's selective if for any For any function from kappa to kappa, there's a member of your ultra filter which is so that f restrict to it is either constant or one to one. So those these are just like the same definition as on omega. And then normal implies Ramsey Ramsey equals selective and a few others. So p points in the general So, p points in the general realm of kappa have to do with almost one-to-one functions. So, an almost one-to-one function is bounded to one function, meaning that the pre-image of any singleton is, sorry, not the pre-image of any singleton is going to have size less than capo. So, a p-point is an ultra-filter such that whenever you have Such that whenever you have a function that's not constant on some member of u, then it is almost one-to-one on some member of u. And then q point is if every function which is almost one-to-one on a member of u is then one-to-one on maybe a smaller member of u. So normal implies selective, which is equal to p point plus q point and so And some important things here is that selective is equal to being root and keesler minimal among uniform ultrafilters. And when kappa is measurable, it's the same thing as being root and keesler equivalent to a normal ultrafilter. Okay, so there are selective ultrafilters on measurable cardinals, which are not normal, but they will be root and keysler equivalent to them. Equivalent to them. Okay, so let's. Okay, so the following are equivalent. Kappa is measurable. There's Kappa complete ultrafilter over Kappa. There's a Ramsey ultrafilter. There's a normal ultrafilter. And the one that people who work on large cardinals like is that kappa is the critical point of some non-trivial elementary embedding. Okay, and then I. Okay, and then I just put up the definition of normal again because maybe some of you don't work with them very often. I know some of you work with them all the time, but okay. I'm gonna mention because I'm not giving any proofs today. I'm gonna mention here while this definition's up that some of the ways that our proofs Of the ways that our proofs went about used variations of this diagonal intersection. So, for p-points, we could take diagonal star intersections, which are with respect to the minimal function that determines kappa in the range model. And even if we're not on Even if we're not on P points, if we have a Kappa closed ultra filter, we can still take some weakened form of this, which makes some of the proofs work. Okay, so what is this Galvin property I mentioned? It is this. So kappa, lambda, nu are all cardinals. Cardinals, you may assume they're regular for today. And Galvin property on an ultra filter U on some kappa cardinal and then lambda new holds if and only if for every sequence of sets in U, sequence of length mu, we can find a lambda size. We can find a lambda size subset of them whose intersection is in mu. So this should tip you off to not being tukie top. So Galvin showed that if kappa to the less than kappa is kappa, then every normal filter on you satisfies this Galvin property, even with this being kappa plus not two. This being kappa plus not two to the kappa. Okay, and so one of the first results in our paper shows that if we have lambda less or equal to kappa, lambda inaccessible, and you a lambda complete ultrafilter on kappa. Then we have you being tugged top with respect. Top with respect to the lambda-directed partial orders if and only if it does not satisfy this Galvin property with lambda and two to the kappa. Okay, so in particular, what follows from this is that if kappa is measurable, then the kappa complete ultra filters, which are tukey top, are exactly those for which Are exactly those for which this Galvin property with 2 to the kappa fails. Okay, so we have now put Galvin in terms of Tukey or more like being Galvin means you're not Tukey Top, being Tuki Top means you're not Galvin. Okay, so this is a repeat of this definition. And a repeat of these basic results, linking Galvin property and not being tuky top. And then a question is what guarantees Galvin ultra filters? And well, this was this property that Tom and some others have been working on for a while. They've done many. Many, several papers in various combinations of these authors finding models or conditions under which there is an ultrafilter which fails the Galvin property, meaning that it's tukey top. So a lot of those models are involved with creating certain types of independent families with some nice strong extra property so that they can scoop up Isbels. Soup up Isbel's and Juhaas's constructions. And then on the other side, there was this proof by Tom and Giddick that showed that p points are Galvin. So they got p points are not 2p top. And then, moreover, that p-point limits of p-points are still not 2p top. And then some of our work allowed us to strengthen this side of these. This side of these results. Okay, so now we'll go back to Omega for a little bit. So, continuous co-final maps on ultra-cultures on accountable basis was what opened up a lot of the investigations to getting some nice structural results there. And this began with this theorem that p-points have continuous co-final maps. continuous cofinal map. So this theorem really says that if you have a so if you have u is 2p above v, u is a peak point, then we know that given any monotone cofinal map from u to v, there is a member of u in which the restriction of that is actually continuous. So it's not just that you have co-fined the existence of continuous cofinal maps, but you actually get that every map Actually, get that every map canonizes with some restriction to another member of you into a continuous cofinal map. So, for capital measurable, we obtain a similar theorem, but the proof is slightly different, and we actually do obtain something a bit stronger. So, in the following, we're going to consider 2 to the kappa as a generalized bear space with the topology. With the topology generated by basic open sets, basic open neighborhoods, so the box topology, right? So segments of size less than kappa, and then every function that extends it. Those are our basic open sets. Okay, so our analog of the theorem with Todorchevich is that if kappa is measurable and we have p point u on cap. And we have p point u on kappa and v some ultrafilter which is uniform, and v is 2p below u. And then for each monotone cofinal map from u into v, there's actually a member of u so that a restriction is continuous and cofinal. So, so far, this looks like just the analog of the Analog of the theorem with Tadorcevich for p points on omega. Fine. I'll get to, but what we really get is this. So this is stronger. So if we let pi take kappa to kappa be the minimal non-constant function mod u. Then, and we fix rho to be the these. row to be the these ordinals which are given to us by the pi function, right? So these guys are fixed. I'm gonna highlight that. These guys are fixed. Then we have for any strictly increasing sequence of deltas, there is going to be an x and u so that for every alpha and kappa this This for any a below x, this value up to delta alpha depends only on a up to rho alpha. Okay, so delta alpha can be really, really, really large with respect to rho alpha. And this tells us we can actually we can actually, you know, You know, get that much, get up to delta alpha much of f of a only from knowledge of a on rho alpha. So this is going to tell us that there's a monotone function from that's a subsets of kappa size less than kappa into itself, so that for any a in there, there's going to be club many. There's going to be club many alphas for which these are actually equal. Okay, so in particular, we get back our function a by taking the union of these approximations, and then we can expand this to a g function on all of power set of kappa to power set of kappa, which then reproduces f on u restricted to x. So this is our stronger form for kappa measurable. For kappa measurable and p points. Okay, so visually, what this looks like is we've got, you know, here's our row sequence, right? These are fixed at the beginning, given pi, given mu. But then this delta alpha sequence could be as fast growing as you wish it to be. And we find this x so that below it, So that below it, given this little teeny amount of information, we can correctly guess this much of f of A. Okay, so that's very different from omega. And then for normal ultra filters, we get something even better because we get that this rho alpha is actually alpha plus one. So just from alpha plus one, much information from some member of you. From some member of u, and then the tail of x, that fixed member which we're below in u, we get exactly the right approximation of that, of w. Okay, so we're hoping that this might be useful in solving a problem that I'll get to at the end of this talk. But some immediate corollary But some immediate corollaries of these theorems are the same as the immediate corollaries of theorems on omega, which are that there are only two to the kappa many ultrafilters, which are two g below a p point. Just like on omega, there's only two of the many, two to the omega many ultrafilters, which are two g below a p point on omega. And moreover, every 2G chain of p points on kappa has order type at most. has order type at most two to the kappa plus rather than what you might think two to the two to the kappa, right? So if you're not used to working with two key types of ultrafilters, let me recap. When you start out, we have a cofinal map from U to V. There are a priori two to the two to the cap of many of those maps. Finding the continuous cofinal maps brings that down to two to the kappa many. That down to two to the kappa mini-maps that you only need to work with. So that brings two key classes of P points down to two to the kappa, whereas the maximal class has size two to the two to the kappa. Okay, and then using the Heidel preset lemma, we can show that if you have more than two to the kappa plus many p points, then you can find a subset of the same size. Subset of the same size such that they're all incomparable. Okay, and then in the Kuhn and Paris model, where you can make 2 to the kappa plus really large, we can get that many normal ultrafilters where they're all 2p incomparable. So, this genre of results is along the lines of what's consistently true, what sorts of partial order. True, what sorts of partial orders can we embed into the two p-types of p-points on kappa? Okay, and then this one's maybe not so lovely to read, but it's just saying that for p points taking their actual products, their Cartesian products, you can still get cofinal maps which are continuous on those. And this might not look like anything at the beginning because like. Look like anything at the beginning because, like, well, who cares? We don't care about Cartesian products of ultra filters, we care about Cabini products of ultra filters. But something funny happened on the way to the forum. And you find out that for cap immeasurable, we get something very nice. So that's going to be in a few slides. So let's recall what a Fubini product is. Fubini product or use. Fubini product or U sum of ultra filters is the product on the base set of U, and then the ultra filters going this way. And a set A is going to be in your Fubini product or Fubini iterate if for U many Z's, so U is going this way, for U many indices are intersection. Our intersection with that ultra filter, our intersection with that set is in that ultra filter. Okay, so I see these probably should have been V's instead of A's. We'll let that be. And then u dot V is going to denote the Fubini product of U and V, so that's where all of these slices or Slice slices, ultrafilters are the same V. Okay, so in the paper with Shidorchevich, we showed that if U is a rapid P point on omega, and V is any ultra filter, we actually do get to the equivalence between the Cartesian product and the Fubini product. However, there are also non-rapid P points. Non-rapid p-points for which we proved that u is 2p strictly less than its fubini product. And actually, then we asked a question about u.u.u and Milovich and I think independently BLAST showed that it stops. That should be equal to there. There. We thought maybe this would be a way of getting some chains, but it actually stops at three. Interesting. So, with Tom, we showed that funnily enough, if kappa is measurable, so of course that's very strong. But just let kappa and let U and D be kappa complete ultra filters. That's it. The complete ultra filters. That's it. No p-point, no rapid, nothing. We still get u dot v equals u cross v in terms of their cofinal type. So now that theorem that I put on a few slides ago for the continuous cofinal maps on the products is actually applicable to getting models with certain toky structures. Okay, and of course it extends to And of course, it extends to finite products. So, in particular, what we get out of this is that if you have a Galvin ultra filter on a measurable cardinal, meaning not tukey top, then all of its Fubini products are also not tukey top. So that you didn't have to be normal, didn't have to be p point, nothing. This just gets pre- This just gets preserved by being not to be top. Okay, so basic and basically generated ultrafilters came from a notion that's Lesky and Tadorcevich of basic posets. And it was extended to notions of ultra filters in this paper where we showed p-point equals basic and basic. P point equals basic, and basic has a formulation which is really close to the Galvin property. So you already sort of see why Galvin property should imply not top, then p point should imply not top. And we also showed that these relevant iteration properties were preserved under Fouvini iterates. So we defined, oops, where did I go? Somehow, did that just jump? Somehow, did that just jump? That did. I'm so sorry. I don't know what I pressed. You get the movie version. Um, okay. So, yes, there we were. Okay, so a Kappa complete ultra filter we'll call basic if. If every sequence of length kappa of members of U has that has a limit in U, then there's a sub-sequence also of sides kappa whose intersection is again in U. Okay, so then in this paper we show that P point implies uniformly basic, which is a little bit of a beefed up or souped up form of basic, and then that implies P point. And then that implies p points. Okay, so we get a simple proof that p points are Galvin, which had already been proved before in the literature, but this gave us a quicker proof of this fact. Okay, and then basically generated means that you have a base which acts as a basic ultra filter. And these are preserved under Trubini iterations. And they also imply Tupini. And they also imply to be not top. And we showed then that if you have basically generated ultra filters, this class is closed under Fouvini iteration. This was done in a paper with Tadorcevich for ultrafilters on omega. Basically generated can be sort of a little bit of a red herring because it's not known if there's any basically generated. If there's any basically generated ultrafilters which are not actually Fubini products, the P points. Okay. And so this is still open on Omega. This is an interesting question. But on Kappa, it may just be that the answer is no, because there are models where the only ultrafilters you have are Fubini products of P points. Core models with. Core models with ultra filters. So, this is one open problem. Is it consistent over measurable cardinal that all ultra filters which are not tuky top that there are there is an ultrafilter which is not tukey top but is also not basically generated. That's an open problem. We know the answer is yes for omega because we've Yes, for omega because we've showed it in multiple ways. But on kappa measurable, it's open. Okay, and then models with various co-final type structures. So these results, some of them I'm calling corollaries because they're depending highly on other people's previously proved theorems on Rudin-Kiesler and then adding in our theorems on continuous maps. Theorems on continuous maps or product equaling, Tukey equaling the Fubini product. But we get that in L of U, where you use a normal ultrafilter on a measurable kappa, there's no Tukey top. There's no Kappa complete ultrafilter that's Tukey top. And moreover, these Kappa complete ultrafilters form a single Tukey class. A single 2K class, which is the union of the powers, the Fubini powers of that normal ultrafilter. So this follows from some of the facts I already went over. And in contrast with omega, right, such a theorem is totally open in Omega. It's still open whether in L of R. In L of R, after forcing with the infinite subsets of omega mod almost inclusion, what is to be in there? This was a question Stevo asked me probably in 2009 or something like that, and this is still open. So, this is a very, very interesting question. Now, if you have the Mitchell order at your disposal, which use Mitchell below W, if it's an ultra filter in the ultra-power by W. Then we have a collection of results where we understand some things about the two key structures. So if you have U Mitchell below W. U-mitch will below W, and they're both kappa-complete ultra filters, and W is a P point, then we know W cannot be 2P below U. And so if you have a Mitchell increasing chain of normal ultrafilters, we know that each one is not tiki below the product or the Fubini product of its predecessors. For chains of length omega, we can make a 2P chain of order type omega or something less. And then if we have the Mitchell model where the Mitchell order of kappa is omega, so there's omega many of these Mitchell increasing normal ultra filters, then Then this sequence is going to be strictly increasing. So we get a cofinal and omega class of Tukey types of kappa complete ultra filters. And there's no maximal Tukey class. So this is like the opposite of Isbel's Tukey top, always existing. Tookie top, always existing in ZFC. Here's something where it just does not exist. And then some other models with various cofinal types. We have under GCH, kappa measurable in this Kuhn and Paris model. We can get a Tukey chain of normal ultrafilters of order type omega plus one. I'm hoping that we can get more than that. That we can get more than that and some other structures, but that is some things we've been working on with Andreas. And also, we can get power set of kappa under, sorry, that's a K. That's a K. Power set of K under inclusion. So some Boolean algebras, mod minus their minimal element can be made in Tuki classes. In Tuki classes of models. CFC. Okay, so now I go back to that comment I made about Ramsey ultra filters on omega being tuky minimal, right? So that theorem that's in the paper of Regeman and Tadorcevich 2012 uses fronts and barriers on omega. On omega, Fudlock-Rodel theorem canonizes the continuous cofinal map into a really nice map, and then shows that everything in the Tukey class of that Ramsey ultrafilter is actually a Fubini iterate of that Ramsey ultrafilter. We conjecture that That the same ought to be true for normal ultra filters. What could possibly be below a normal ultra filter in 2P if it's not, you know, it's Ruden-Kiesler minimal, right? But the proof is remaining elusive. And it's remaining elusive because we cannot actually just go ahead and blindly extend the techniques used in this paper because. Paper because once you get to subsets of kappa of size omega, we have the Sierpinski coloring, which tells us there's no food log rotal analog. So for lack of methods, we have an open problem. And solving the open problem, you know, maybe would give us some interesting methods. Okay, and then to finish off, there's some theorems of Gabe Goldberg with his. Of Gabe Goldberg with his ultra power axiom, which this ultra power axiom holds in all known core models of ZFC. Well, assuming it and assuming that Kappa is a measurable cardinal with a nice Mitchell order, then every Kappa complete ultra filter is Ruden-Kiesler equivalent to a finite product of normal ultrafilters. And that's super interesting. And also, And also, under the ultra-power axiom, the Mitchell order is linear on normal ultrafilters. So, using those theorems and some stuff I talked about already, if we assume this ultra-power axiom and that normal ultrasultures are 2p minimal, then under this condition, we can get a model where, well, we just Model where, well, we just get all models with these assumptions have two key classes isomorphic to this partial order. Okay, so that's something that's not a chain, not just a bunch of things that are Tukey incomparable, and we can get that. So, this contrasts with the wide array of two key structures on ultra soldiers. Of two key structures on ultrafilters, the difference, I mean, one of the main differences is that all of the forcing constructions or MA constructions or CH constructions that we have for ultra filters on omega, we just don't have those for kappa measurable. So the question is, what do we use instead? Or, you know, what's the difference? So thank you for sticking out with me to this late end of the day. And if you're interested in the paper, it's on our In the paper, it's on archives. I don't know how well you could hear, but there was lots of clapping, Tasha. I couldn't hear a thing, actually. Oh, okay. It happened. Okay, any questions? Oh, it's it's up. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. So I just want a confirmation from you. Is it, am I right that it is conceivable that it is a theorem of ZFC that all uniform ultrafilters on omega-1 are of the same Tukey type? So, as far as I know, I know nothing about work on ultrafilters on omega-1. So, you mean ZFC results, omega-1? Uniform? I mean, I think it's unlikely. I think it's probably consistently false. I mean, maybe it's consistently true, but so what would be the candidates? So, what would be the candidate for a model for consistently false? I mean, yeah, I don't know. I mean, you'd have to like construct something by forcing or collapse a measurable cardinal. I think that's wide open. Okay, thank you. So, there are some interesting things about measurable cardinals. You gave us a whole list there, but it seems to me the question would be more natural at the Ramsey Cardinal. Isn't that the case? Because of the importance of the Ramsey ultrafilters on Ovaga in this whole story. Yes. Um, yes. So, I mean, for sure, that's that would be a really great thing to investigate. Um, a lot of the times we used we used the ultra power embedding or facts about it using normality. So, yeah, like if you could pull those techniques down to approximations of them because of SRAMC, maybe. Of 3MC, maybe that would work, or maybe you can come up with some completely different methods. Okay, well, that's great. I also, maybe I missed because you had so many results, but there is this result of Friedman and Magador about the consistency of the measurable cardinal only having two normal measures or something like that. Is that model of any interest in this investigation? Yeah. investigation yes um yes yes yes it is i don't think we proved anything about it um or or you know i'll have to get back to you on that um because we do know that like under the mitchell order the smaller one is not um above to be above the larger one um but what we don't have a proof for is whether there Have a proof whereas whether they're still in that order or whether they're just incomparable. Okay, thank you, Beto. Other questions, any other questions or comments? Okay, let's thank Natasha again, but we got to be really loud so that it goes through. Anything? No, but I. We've got lots of witnesses that it was a very loud applause. That's good point. Good point. Okay. All right. Thanks very much again, Natasha. Thank you. Thanks so much. And we brought. And we break now for something.
