And he will talk about stembolic dynamics for the prisotropic and center problem. So, thank you. Just a minute. Okay, can you hear me? I hope so. And thank you, Marcel. And thank you, Marcel, for the introduction. And I also want to thank all the other organizers for this possibility to give us all here. So today I'm going to talk about joint work with Evina Barrutallo and Susanna Terracini, which has been mainly, let's say, the most important part of my PhD thesis. And the work I'm talking about is this. this first sorry is uh this first one this uh first uh paper and but i will also i will also mention the second paper that you can see here which is uh minimal collision access in topic to central configuration or sorry i don't know why i am so stressed i'm gonna wait a minute okay so Okay, so yes, I'm going to talk about symbolic dynamics for the anisotropic and center problem at negative energies. And so, as you probably know, when we consider, sorry, I don't know what's happening. It never happened before. Can I have a glass of water? You don't know my sub chats away. I don't know. Yeah. The starts the same, maybe. I'm very sorry. It never happened before. Okay. Yes. So, when we consider dynamical systems and especially natural dynamical systems like the nbody problem, we know that they are characterized by a series, a very huge set of non-linear interactions. And so one expects this system to display a To display a complex and rich dynamics, which may be chaotic sometimes, but proving rigorously the emerging of cows is always non-trivial. So one can try to prove some necessary condition. And one of these conditions is symbolic dynamics. So I will define rigorously the symbolic dynamics because it has been defined before. Defined before, and I would give you my definition. So, we introduce the Bernoulli-Reich shift, which is a discrete continuity discrete dynamical systems, which is defined on a metric space of B-infinite sequence of symbols, which are chosen on a discrete and finite set. And the Bernoulli shift is the archetype of chaotic dynamical. Chaotic dynamical systems. And following the definition of Devaney, we see that the Bernoulli shift, in the Bernoulli shift, periodic points are dense, the shift is a transitive map, and it has sensitivity with respect to initial data. So the Bernoulli shift is chaotic. Well, for me, symbolic dynamics is defined as follow. You take a continuous dynamical You take a continuous dynamical system, and we say that these dynamical systems admit a symbolic dynamics with set of symbols S if it is semi-conjugate to the Bernoulli shift in a sense that there exists an invariant subset of this dynamical system and a projection map which sends initial condition of this subset to the B-infinite sequence of the Bernoulli shift. So for us, it's just a semi-conjugation. It's just a semi-conjugation. And when you have this property, you expect that you can encode periodic orbits of your invariant subset through sequences of symbols. And you also expect the emerging of very complex behaviors in your subsystem, in an invariant subsystem. So we will talk about the n-center problem, a particular case of the n-center problem, but I want to talk before about the classical n-center problem, which you can imagine. Problem, which you can imagine this system as a particular case of the n plus one body problem, in which the first n bodies are very big, so big that we can imagine they do not move. So we call them centers. And the remaining body, the n plus one body, is a particle of mass equal one, which moves under the attraction of these centers. So basically, we reduce to just an equation of motion and And this system is Hamiltonian because the total energy, the sum of kinetic plus potential energy, is conserved. And the potential is singular along every center. And there are a lot of results since we can study the problem in energy shell because the energy is conserved. So we have just a space of dimension three. So there are several results concerning the. Several results concerning the non-integrability and the presence of symbolic dynamics in fixed energy shells, both for positive, negative, or zero energy, and both in the plane and in the space. I have put in red this result by Nicolas Raven and Susanna Terracini because it concerns the negative energy case. And they proved that this system actually used a more general homogeneity degree alpha. And they proved that this system admits symbolic dynamics in a negative energy shell. And this was our starting point. And we plan to consider a more general potential associated to the centers, which is an anisotropic potential. And so to understand what it is, suppose that we have just one center and let's place it in the origin. So we reduce to the Kepper problem. problem and on the left you have the classical cabre problem when you consider this potential which is just one over the norm of x and you know that the energy is preserved and also the angular momentum is another first integral of motion we are in the plane here so the problem is uh is integrable solution are connect sections and and also they are connect section depending on the energy as alberto said and also in this setting collision can And also in this setting, collision can be regularized, as Ivin explained, and using Levisi-Vita transform, but also using instant surgery methods of regularization. But if you consider this other potential, which is the potential introduced by Gus Willer in the 70s and then studied by Devani, the anisotropic capral potential, and with this parameter mu big and the one, the situation dramatically. Week under one, the situation dramatically changes because you lose the rotational invariance of the problem, angular momentum is no longer a conserved quantity, and also losing the symmetry, you have that homotic orbits, so one-dimensional collision orbits or ejection orbits, they happens only along some preferred directions, which are the critical points of the restriction of the potential to the sphere. So, this fact together with the This fact, together with the lack of regularization method in this situation, destroys the integrability of the system. And actually, Devani and Gutzwiller, the first analytically and the second numerically, proved that the system is chaotic. It's chaotic. Actually, it's chaotic when this parameter mu is over 9 over 8. This is quite weird, but this is what they prove. And so for me, anisotropic. Anisotropic potential means that the potential is a non-constant angular part. So, indeed, this kind of potential arise also when one considers some particular reduction by symmetry of the n-body problem. Probably the most famous is the planarized oscillatory body problem, which was studied by Devani again in the 70s, if I'm not wrong. And so we also have this other. We also have these other examples of particular reduction of the four-body problem. And in all this situation, basically, the authors studied collision or rejection and near-collision or near-ejection orbits. And it has been done using McGee coordinates. And one sees that when one reduces the system through McGee coordinates, a potential of this kind comes out. This is just the angular part of the original potential. Part of the original potential. So you see that this is not constant, and for me, this is an anisotropic potential. So we plan to consider a more general case of anisotropic potential and to associate to every center in the plane just an homogeneous potential with its sorry with its great with this homogeneity degree, which is alpha j. So So, introducing polar coordinates, you see that every potential vj of x, which is singular in the origin, can be splitted in a radial part and an angular part. So the angular part for R is non-constant. This is our definition of anisotropic potential. Then you introduce the centers in the plane and you consider this total potential P of X. And you see that the potential is singular on the center. So if you take the position, So, if you take the position of the particle, these are the motion and energy equations. And the energy is still conserved in this system, so it is Hamiltonian 2, and we require the energy to be negative. Okay, so our idea is to find a huge set of periodic solutions for this system at negative energy, and then to see how we can prove that having this big set of periodic solutions, the system. Solutions, the system admits symbolic dynamics. So, as a first non-dramatic assumption, we assume that to put an order on the homogeneity degrees of the potentials. So, in this way, you can write the potential V of X like as like you can isolate the first potential V1 with the lowest homogeneity degree, which is naturally the one which leads the motion when you are very far from the singularity set or close to the boundary of this region. The boundary of this region. So basically, when the modulus, when the norm of x goes to plus infinity, the old potential reduces to the first potential. So you can already see that the older problem approximates minus alpha one, anisotropic problem. So this already suggests to employ some perturbation methods when we are far from the singularity set. And also, I recall you that a central configuration for a potential VJ. Configuration for a potential VJ is nothing but a critical point of the restriction of the potential to the sphere. So, clearly, for the Kepler problem, classical Kepler problem, every direction is a central configuration, but in the anisotropic case, we just consider global critical point of the angular part U in polar coordinates. And I remark that when you consider just one center, as I told you before, also this kind of anisotropic Also, this kind of anisotropic potential admits homostatic sorbits along central configuration. This is very important for us. And indeed, our first hypothesis is this one. Briefly, we required that the first potential, the one which lives at plus infinity, admits a finite number of globally strictly minimal central configuration. We will see why. And with this hypothesis, we prove this result. So assume that you have at least two central. So, assume that you have at least two centers and at least two central configurations for the first potential, then you can find a range of negative energy and an invariant subset of this energy shell for which the anisotropic and center problem admits a symbolic dynamics. And I write here possibly collisional because the invited subset in which are contained initial data could contain some initial data which Could contain some initial data which lead you to having collision. So here we are talking about generalized solutions. And in this case, the symbols are just the minimal central configuration of the first potential. Okay, now to do more, we need further hypotheses to have a non-collisional symbolic dynamics, and we have to consider these results from Vivina Barrutalo, Susana de Rascini. Vivina Barrutalo, Susana Deraschini, and Gianmaria Verzini, which is about just the one anisotropic one-center problem. And so they proved that imagine to refer this problem to every of our centers. So you require that every potential associated with every center has at least, let's say, two strictly minimal central configuration, but they can also coincide. Can also coincide, you see here, then you can find a threshold on the homogeneity degree of this potential for which if you go over this threshold, then you study boundary value problem. So you fix x1, x2, and a fixed time t. Then, if you define an angular sector by these two minimal central configurations, such that the minimizer, you have a topological constraint. You have a topological constraint that the minimizer has to be for all time inside this sector. The minimizer is collision-free. So, this is true also if you consider the same central configuration. So, indeed, for us, the situation will be this. So, assume that this is your central configuration, then you can be required to have just. Just let's say at least one minimum central configuration for every potential because this result is also true if you consider sector of this kind, theta plus, theta plus plus a 2k pi copy of theta plus. So let's say that if k is equal to one, this is the sector. It's all the disk. So for us, this is the non-collisional hypothesis. The non-collisional hypothesis. Okay, with this hypothesis, and I want you to remark that here we require just at least two centers at at least one minimum central configuration for the Lydic potential. And with the non-collision hypothesis, we have that again, our problem admits a symbolic dynamics in negative energy shells, but this time is non-collisional. So, all the initial data of the invariant subset are non-collision. If you compute the flow on that initial data, you find a non-collision solution. And in this case, the set of symbols is richer because you also have symbols are pairs of a strictly minimal central configuration and a non-trivial partition of the centers. You will see why. We will see why because actually, in our setting, the symbols have a physical interpretation. So, you will see that actually the dynamics on the configuration space follow the symbols somehow. So, they have also a dynamical interpretation. Okay, how to prove this result? Usually, if one wants to employ variational methods to build periodic solutions, and if the energy is positive or zero, Is positive or zero, one can use global variational methods because the illness region coincides with all the punctured plane. But since we have negative energy, we have a further difficulty because we have this boundary which exists in the case of negative energy. And if you consider the Jacobi length functional or the Mopertiv functional, and you know that critical points, non-collisional critical points, Points, non-collisional critical points of these functionals are solutions of the original problem. This functional degenerates on these orbits is zero. So you cannot minimize on all the space. And what you do is to find a sphere in which inside the sphere you are sufficiently close to the boundary of this region to apply variational methods, while outside, rational methods do not apply. So we have to split. So, we have to split the construction of periodic orbits when we are far and close to the boundary of this region. And this is made through a broken geodesics method, which, if I'm not wrong, was introduced by Seifert. And let's say outer hearts, the one which approach the boundary of this region, the blue one in this picture, they are made through a perturbation technique. So, remember that when we are fast. Remember that when we are far from the singularity set and we are close to the boundary of the illusory region, the potential reduces to the first one. So, this first potential admits homothetic orbits, let's say break orbits, because they touch the boundary of the ills region. So, perturb a little bit the initial condition of this homothetic and build the first return map, which touches the sphere BR again after some time. And then you will try, you will find an old name. You will find an old neighborhood of this central configuration for which you can solve this boundary value problem. So, at first, you find out the arcs. Inner arcs are built through a variational technique. So, they are fixed and minimized. And we require a topological constraint to separate the centers with respect to a non-trivial partition. Non-trivial means that you have to isolate at least one center. And we will go deeper on this in the next. Go deeper on this in the next slides. And collisions, the exclusion of the exclusion of collisions is really linked, as I told you, to the results of Vivina Barrutallo, Sona Tereshini, and Gianmaria Berzini, and on the threshold of the homogeneity degree, but we will see it in detail. And once you have these two pieces, you can glue these two pieces on this neighborhood. And what happens is that if you compute the length of this arc. That if you compute the length of this arc and the length of this arc, which depends on the junction point, you minimize this length moving this junction point, and you see that the minimizer actually matches the derivatives on this junction point. And so actually, if you start from P0 and you arrive on P2, you have a classical solution of the piece of solution, let's say, of the anisotropic effort problem. Now, let's give a look on Now, let's give a look on a sketch on the proof of the existence and lack of collision of the inner arcs. So you consider the MoPerty functional, which is the final follow-up on H1 paths, and fix a partition of the centers, let's say three centers at the left and three centers at the right. And you minimize inside this set, which is the set of H1 paths, which connects P1. Which connects P1 and P2 and separate the center with respect to partition and assume that U does not collide with the centers. But here you find anything because this set is not weakly closed. So we have to close it and to admit collision to find a minimizer through direct methods. So how to exclude collision in this setting? To do this, we need a result from the second paper that let's say Second paper that let's say I was trying to citate at the beginning of this talk. And so this paper concerns collision orbits for anisotropic Kepler problems. And imagine to consider to go close to one of the centers, you have a Kepler problem. And imagine to study collision orbits for this problem. Using McGee coordinates, you blow up the singularity. You blow up the singularity, and you see that actually central configuration and also minimal central configuration are equilibrium points in the collision manifold in the regularized flow. So they are hyperbolic equilibrium points. So they have a stable and a stable manifold. What we proved is that if you are sufficiently close to a minimal central configuration and sufficiently close to the singularity, the stable manifold, let's say the local stable manifold, Let's say the local stable manifold of a strictly minimal central configuration coincides with the set of initial data of minimizer for the Moperly functional. This means that whenever you fix a point on this neighborhood, let's say this one, this point, you find a unique minimizer for the Moperative functional, a unique collision minimizer. And this coincides with, let's say, a foliation of the stable manifold. Of the stable manifold. So, this characterization for us is very important because how to exclude collision again. So, by contradiction, assume that US a collision and localize the study. Let's get closer to the collision with a center CJ. We can find a sequence of minimizers which converts to this collision path and passes closer and closer to the center, but they are collisionless. And also, they have very good topological property because we can prove that they are. Property because we can prove that they are free of self-intersections. So I recall you that for this other result, since alpha j is bigger than the threshold, collision are excluded in angular sector, let's say strict sector. But we have to take into account the presence of the other centers and of the topological constraint. You don't have to forget the topological constraint. Topological constraint. So, what we do is that we define some new sector, angular sector, which are delimited by a minimal arc, let's say this red gamma of this volume, and a 2k pi copy. Actually, we will choose a proper k for which it works. And you, due to the, of course, this picture are not referred to the Euclidean plane because you have a 2k copy. So, it's just a way to. K-copy. So it's just a way to visualize well what happens. So due to the absence of self-intersection, if you fix an N, your minimizer will be inside, oh, this is a spoiler, it will be inside a curved sector, let's say. You define a blow-up sequence, so you normalize the starting points of this minimizer, and you see that the blow-up limit And you see that the blow-up limit is a collision minimizer, which belongs to a straight sector, because also the sectors are blown up. And when you go very close to the collision, they become straight sector. And this can happen because we have these results that I told you before. So this should be a minimizer of the mopertree functional with fixed at end that is in. That is inside a straight sector, and this can't happen. So, this is just the idea of the proof. And yes, once this is done, if we fix a sequence, let's say a finite sequence of central configuration and partition, we have this piece of solution. We can glue them and at some point we can close it. Point, we can close it, and so we build a periodic orbit, it has its period, and um, and yes, but how to deduce symbolic dynamics for this? This is quite easy at this point because we have to find an invariant subset of the energy shells and the first return map on this subset. I remarked that here we are treating the non-collisional case so far, and uh, to find this. And to find this is very easy because you know that if you take an initial condition close to a minimum central configuration in this small neighborhood that I have defined before, you can always find a first cross here because of the well-definition of perturbation arcs. And then if you fix whatever partition of the centers, you find these inner arcs. And you can minimize all over the sphere with the boundary point. With boundary points all over the sphere. So, for sure, you will find a point close to another central configuration. So, the first return map is just let's take the first, the initial condition and consider the second cross on the sphere. As Irani said, it's a second return map, actually. And then you consider all the possible initial data and you find your invariant subset. An interesting thing, at least for me, is that we At least for me, is that with some modifications of the topological constraint and of the symbols, this construction also works when you have just two centers and one minimal central configuration. Because two centers, the non-trivial partition is just one and just one minimal central configuration, so the symbol would be just one. But we can modify these symbols and also the topological constraint to show that it also works in the two centers problem. In the two centers problem. This is quite interesting because, as you know, that the classical two-centers problem is integrable, while here you have symbolic dynamics. And to conclude, I want to talk to you about, I have no idea how many time I have, five minutes, okay. Yes, to conclude, I want to analyze the collisional case. So I recall you that we have a non-collisional symbolic dynamics when Dynamics when we are over this threshold on the homogeneity degree. So, what happens when we remove this threshold? When we remove this threshold, the outer arcs, of course, are still there whenever you want, but the inner arcs can have collisions. So, minimizers in this case are in the boundary of the set that I have can be in the boundary of the set of the minimizing set. The minimizing set that I have defined before. But also, you cannot use partitions here because you have this very degenerate case, the red one, in which the minimizer collides with all the centers. And what is a partition in this setting? You don't have partitions. But in this case, you can still prove the existence of symbolic dynamics, because dynamically, what you see is just the other arcs. So symbols are just the So, symbols are just the minimal on the general central configuration for V1 that you can, and you can still build a symbolic dynamics. In this case, let's say a quite more general case because we have no threshold on the homogeneity degree. And yes, that's it. Thank you. And sorry for what happened at the beginning. No worries. So, is there a No worries. So if is there any question or remark? Well then. Yeah. For your PT if you want. No, I'm gonna do the journalist. In fact, I have a question. So there is something that I'm not sure to understand. In fact, you have this outer arc and this inner arc. And how do you match them? So you have some unicity of inner arc and outer arc? I mean. And outer arc, I mean, okay, yes. So the wait a minute. Okay, I'll do it like this. So the other arcs exist, let's say you take a central configuration, minimum, and you can find all a neighborhood for which, if you fix a point here, close to the central, let's say in this neighborhood, then you find. This neighborhood, then you find a unique point here for which it exists. So this arc is unique whenever you fix P0. Then you have existence on the inner arc, whatever you want. And yes, what you find here is that if you glue here, this other arc and this inner arc, you can have something which is not smooth here. Which is not smooth here, as you can imagine. So imagine that the gluing is something very weird, like this. You don't like this. And imagine that this happened in the boundary of your existence neighborhood. But we have been able to find a variation here, which lowers the functional and to see that the inner point actually, the smoothness point is actually. Smoothness point is actually in the inner of this neighborhood. And also, this the behavior of the other arc, the good behavior of the other arc is made through some dynamical analysis on the tangent space here. But for the inner, the good behavior of the inner arc involves the other results that I told you, the foliation of collision orbits. Because when you are here, you basically see a Kefere problem. Here, you basically see a Kefere problem. So, you can reduce all the inner arcs to kind of collision orbits, and you have that good behavior on the foliation here. This is how we made it. I don't know if I have answered the question. Yes. Okay. So, are there more questions or remarks, Ernesto? Uh, maybe close to one. The problem is the very one. For mu close to, yeah, well, the anisotropic problem at the beginning. So let's go back to that one. There. I'm very prepared on this because I gave a course on the anisotropic every problem last week. No, so as I told you, when Mu Then mu is over nine over eight. The problem is chaotic. When mu is over nine over eight, the problem is chaotic because you have yes, all that weird behavior. But if if mu is uh let's say in this situation, the oscillations are less and less. So let's say that we are close to integral. So let's say that we are close to integral to the integrable case. No. When mu is not equal to one. Yes. I mean, the angular momentum is not conserved when mu is different from one. No, no, I know, I know, but if you analyze the flow and the collision manifold. Lesion manifold, you see that the saddles, the sources and things which give you this chaotic behavior are not spirals. So the oscillations are very few. But these are very close. Yes, could be. Yeah. So, are there more questions or remarks? Well, if not, let's thank. Jamarco again, I would assume in five minutes.
