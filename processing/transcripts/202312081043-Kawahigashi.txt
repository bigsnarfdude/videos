Okay, thank you very much. So I thank the organizer for the invitation to this wonderful lecture. And also I thank him for staying up with him. So today I'd like to talk about this title, by unitary connection. This is a kind of quantum 6J symbols explained. Then they give some set of They give some set of finitely many complex numbers which completely describe a fusion category, and then I'll explain this in terms of alpha induction. So we present a new formulation of alpha induction, which I'll explain what it means. But Kenza functor to produce a new fusion category from a unitary braided fusion category and the two systems to a fragment. In terms of bi-unitary connection. Then there are some variants of 160 symbols, and then they also appear as four tensor in recent studies on two-dimensional topological order and tensor networks. So this kind of studies of bio-interconnection using rather old in some factor theory, as they were studied in the last decade of last year. Of last century. So they are rather old topics, but they are renewed interest in connection to tensor towards two-dimensional topological order. So the outline of my topic as follows. So I start with fusion categories and the quantum fixes in just basic scene. Then I explain what bi-unitary connections are and their relations to sub-factor theory. And then I explain alpha induction in terms of Alpha induction in terms of grade diffusion categories, that's an old. And then the last part is a new main problem. That is the formulation of the alpha induction for biometric collections. Then, so I start with a basic explanation on fusion categories in the framework of operated algebra. So, here, of course, we have been talking about We have been talking about fusion categories, modular tensor categories, and so on. So, okay, I'm in operator algebra. So, we want to study fusion categories in terms of operator algebra, particularly some normal algebra. When we have some unitary fusion category in some abstract way, we want to realize, or we want to study in the framework properties algebra, then we have three ways to realize. three ways to realize them in terms of operate algebra. The first one is I think the most well-studied setting that is each object is a bimorphine of a set two factors. And another thing is that each object is a metomorphism of a set type III factor. This is more natural in the setting of conformal field theory like toplica. Conformal field theory, like topic-house theory, supersection sectors. So, this has been studied in this context for many years. And the third one is setting up bio-unitary connection. This is the one I'd like to emphasize today. So, any unitary fusion category is realized as any of them about these three. So, in this sense, these three are equivalent, mutually equivalent frameworks to study and immediately. Same marks to study a unitalization category. And yeah, as I said, the first two are better studied. And the third one is basically due to assign a higher up in the late 90s. So this has an advantage that everything is finite dimensional. So the first two are obviously infinite dimensional. You have to be really infinite dimensional von Leimer's but sometimes yeah it's it's yeah theoretically uh it's easier to use infinite dimensional von Leyman but Infinite dimensional fund-number algebras. But for some concrete computations, finite dimensionality is somehow easier. And actually, the original construction of the Hagaram subfactor and the aside Hagaram subfactor is based on this bi-interpretion, a finite dimensional computation. So this, yeah, the third one, bi-initial connection, this has renewed interest recently due to its connection. Interest recently due to its connection to tensile networks appearing in two-dimensional topological order. Then, so I start with quantum 6G symbols. This is also called the F symbols. Here this week we also have at this talk. Then, so we have six objects. That's why this is six J. So X X, Y, A, B, C, D, these are irreducible objects. These are irreducible objects in the fusion category. So we have say so we make a tensor product. So here we first multiply the left part x tensor A, then we get the irreducible object C here. And here we first multiply A and Y, then we get an irreducible component B. And then from X tensor B we get D, and from C tensor Y we get D, and everything is irreducible. Then we have four morphic here. We start here, we compose these four morphic in this way. Then we get a morphism from D to D, which is a scalar. So in this way, we get a complex number. So we have many choices of, say, six irreducible objects. Also, we have many choices for more sequence. For more sequence, we choose them from more normal basis of Normal basis of the home species, original species. Then these numbers contain complete information about the fusion category, not breeding, but for fusion category. So we can recover the entire fusion category just from these numbers. And this is a typical picture denoting this. So we have six edges, they correspond to six iridescent objects, and we have four triple points, and this corresponds to four more things. This corresponds to four molecules here. So, this is a standard picture for 6J simple. And the next one is by unitary connection. So, in the previous page, X, Y, A, B, C, D, these are irreducible objects in the same future category. So, we can regard them as M M by G for the same to one factor M, that's that's how usually affecting to a subfactor theory. Then Subfactor theory. And then we also consider four to one factor, say P N MQ. And then we consider bimodule. So X is now P N bimodule, A is now N M bimodule and so on. Then we use the same diagram as in the previous slide and look at the complex numbers arriving from the composition of ordinary. And then, so also this is a viewpoint of two categories. So we have zero objects are now just. Zero objects are now just these four to one factors. So this is one object and two objects is voicing in that way between bimodule. Then here we have six choices of bimodule, but we fix two of them. So x and y are not. This is why I use different characters for these two. We fix x and y. And then we have different choices of A, B, C, D. These are irreducible. Uh A B C D. These are irreducible items, you would say the or irradiable object in this uh category. Then, uh B so we get uh uh six J symbols uh from these choices and basically this is uh this is what a biounitary connection is. So, actually uh the definition of a biounitary connection is more uh more general when they appear in the theory of commuting clear. I think the talk of the distomal. I think the talk of the digital uh this week. Uh but uh uh so they are more general, but uh we are basically interested in uh subfactors of finiteness. So we are interested in community squares uh which produce uh surfactors of finiteness. Then basically uh such bi-intellic connections are just the uh the same as these uh six J symbols arriving in this way, arriving from this uh two categories. Uh this is uh characterization uh due to me. Uh Characterization due to me rather than this me. So, bio-intelligence in this talk are just a special form of quantum fixed emotions arising from these two categories as the same thing. So, these numbers depend on four morphic. So, depending on choices of four indices, we get a complex number. So, this is a fourth answer in the sense that a complex number depends on four indices. Numbers depend on four indices. So, this is why we are recently again interested. Then, I explain why this is called bi-unitality. So, bi means these numbers are gives a unitary matrices in double rays. This is why we say pi. This is why we say pi a unitary connection. So these complex numbers give a unitary matrices. So first we look at the diagram of say four morphisms and we split these four morphisms into two like this and also two like this. We have choices of two morphisms here and two morphisms here. We look at the pairings of this this These two models and these two models. Then, so we regard these numbers indexed by a pair of these two passes. Then they give unitary matrices. Just typically, just these two passes give different orthonormal base in the same Morrison space, giving us finite dimensional hilts. A finite dimensional Hughes space. So it's trivial, but we get unitary matrix in this way. But then we cut this square also in this way. Then we look at a pair of these two morphisms and these two morphisms. Then we look at the numbers in this way. We still get a unitary matrix up to some normalization arising from constant dimension. This is basically a tetrahedral symmetry. Basically, a tetrahedral symmetry of 1 to 60 symbols. So, here we have to revers the orientation of this morphism. So, this is a morphism from top to the bottom, but here this is from the bottom to the top. So, this is reversing is basically what we do in a tetrahedron symmetry for quantum 6GF. So, in this way, we also still get unital matrices, and this is why we said tie unit type connections. And so, this name connection comes. So this name connection comes from an analogy to a discrete version of a differential group of finite class. So this is why we say bi-unital connection. Then this bi-unital connection characterized a commuting screen with a Markov choice. So this is a set of four finite dimensional algebra A, B, C, D, A is containing B, B is contained in D, A is contained in C, C is contained in D. Then we have a commutativity of We have a commutativity of uh this diagram, so we have two inclusions and two conditional expectations, and this diagram has to commute. This is a notion of a commuting square. And if we have a commuting square, we can repeat the basic construction of the joint. So we start with A, B, C, E, we get the next finite dimensional algebra, B1, B1, B2, B2, and so on. And we have an increasing sequence of finite dimensional algebra. Then after limit, we get our infinite dimensional fundamental algebra. Infinite-dimensional fundamental algebra. They are to a factor after completion, and this is the most important construction of a sub-factor between genes. Then, yeah, now I explain alpha interaction. So, we start with a unitary related fusion category, C, and choose a Q system also called the The Q system also called the Freudinus algebra. So, this is a procedure also called compensation in different contexts. Then, but yeah, I do not assume the raw curiosity of a Q system or also commutativity of a Fragile. That's sometimes important. Then, in this setting, we get an alpha induction. This is a tensor functor from C, this braided fusion category, to a new fusion category. This is not braided. Then, Not braiding. Then this depends on the choice of upgrading, so overcrossing and undercrossing. So in order to distinguish choices of braiding, we put plus or minus. So plus braiding and minus braiding. Then for the object, this lambda is an object in the original fusion category, branded fusion category. So this is an object in the original fusion category. And this symbol has. category and this symbol alpha rambda plus minus denotes the reverting object in a new fusion category. So this is a functor from ramba to alpha rambda plus or minus and in in the context in the original context this was very got as an extension of an endomorphism. So this lambda was very realized as an endomorphism of the margin, as for for smaller containing. Of a small algebra. Then we have a radio fundamental algebra M. Then this induction procedure is an extension of an endomorphism from a smaller algebra to a large algebra using a breaking. This is the way we studied alpha induction in 2015. And actually, this was originally considered as a kind of induced representation for an extension of a chiral conformal field theory by Long Matre. So we have one. We have one conformal field theory, and we have an extended conformal field theory, and we have a representation of the smaller conformal field theory, and we want to get a representation of the larger conformal field theory. So, this is a kind of induced representation, induction procedure. So, this is why we say alpha induction. Alpha is just a symbol, it's not a function. Then, yeah, this is an extension of anything. And in this general setting, this was study like. This general sector, this was studied by Beckenham, Evans and Lee, many years ago. And yeah, this was studied by many people in many different contexts. So this is in the original setting, we used the endomorphism realization of a fusion category. And also we have a bi-module passion of the IED. But as I said at the beginning, we also have a bi-unitary fiction realization of a fusion category. So I want to Of a fusion factor, I want to get a concrete description of alpha induction in terms of value teleconnection. This is a of this talk today. Then, so alpha induction by intelligence. So, we now realize, so this alpha induction in terms of bi-inteleconnection, so basically, quantum 6GS symbols. And here, Ramadan mu n n object, so we realize the smallest sorry, the initial brain. For the usual range diffusion category as kind of NN and binary or it's they are one object in a two category. Then we put A1, A2, A3, A4, B, I use different kind of character because they are different kind of objects. So now they are like N, M by machine or possibly MN, just by putting bar there. And also in this setting, the alpha induction class is say M. A class is I'd say M-induced M option, like M M by M. Then we draw this kind of picture to note the reverting quantum fixed SMR. So here we have triple point one, two, three, four, sorry, one, two, three, four. So we have four more things to draw a square diagram. Then we have Then we have more some basically we have six biomes, but here we have something different. Also here we have a different kind of grading. So this is here we have NN object. Here we have MN object. So the product is MN. But here now we have Mm. This is Mn. So the product, tensor product is MN. So this is a kind of new grading, which was studied many years ago by us. Then you have to walk by us. So this so for this crossing for lambda becomes alpha lambda induced object. The A2 stays the same. This is A2. This is also A2. So this is a new kind of grading, actually basically given by original grading. So the original grading among N objects extend to this kind of grading involving NM objects, which was studied by us many years ago. By us many years ago. So here we also have the same kind of thing. So this is Mm, this is N, this is MN. So this crossing gives us this thing. So this picture contains this picture contains M objects because we want to describe the resulting quantum 6GM. In quantum 6G, 6GS symbols involving MM objects. But then, so this is the initial picture we are arriving from this alpha interaction. But then, here... Is the Q system present in this picture still? Not here. No. But yeah so these A1, A2, A3, A4, they are arrive from Q system basically. Okay. Then so yeah, so so this is a well So this is a well topological picture. Then here we are crossing here like this one. Then we just we can move this wire to the right. So this is over, so this goes over, so we can move this one here. Then this is actually thickness of this diagram are distinguished kind of N, M. But if we move this wire to the right, then everything is NN. So these are fine ducts. With n. So this alpha induction disappears, and we get only n n objections of this picture. So this here we have the very colour circle gives nm. This is different thickness. So this is an n m this is n. So see. So this is alpha induction picture. So we can write this figure in the previous slide using great. Figure in the previous slide using Brady, then we get this picture. So, this is a new picture which doesn't involve alpha ramba. So, this is a new bi-interconnection or quantum 6G symbol that we get from the alpha induction. So, the alpha induction is now regarded as a passage from this. This is the original 6G symbol. This is a new 6G symbol, so the passage from the left to the right. Now, this is a Procedure of alpha induction in terms of biointeric connection. So, this is the main deterrent I explained today. And here, so this thickness and M objects arising from that Q. So, here, so this is 6G symbol. So, here, this is a usual 6G symbol. So, this comes from the associativity of the tensor proton. So, we have one object, then we have left multiplication by another object, and right multiplication. Another object and the right multiplication on another object, and they commute by associated, of course. Then we first multiply the left, first the right. In this way, by comparing these two, we get the ordinary 6G symbols. But here, we have NM object. Then we can multiply N object only from the left. But we have two left multiplications. Then, usually they do not commit. But now we have a breakdown. So the two left multiplications. The two left multiplications commute due to the grading. So we can change the order. Then after this changing order, we still get something like six decimal. So this is a new picture here. So this is then this realizes the alpha induction. So this alpha induction can be understood of the framework of 6J symbols in this way. Yeah. In the remaining In the remaining two pages, I'll explain the notion of fatness. So, if objects, say X, Y, A, B, C, D, these are 6J symbols, objects, are in the same fusion category as in the usual setting. Then we can choose this A is at the top left owner. This can be the identity object. Then, this choice gives us some distinguished property called flatness. And this bind that. Flatness. And this bio-interconnection in comparison to the case involving four-two-factor. Now we have two categories of biomodules. So yeah, this is these two settings different. So this name flatness comes from discrete analogy to the flat connection in differential geography. Some kind of invariance and parallel transport. Then, so in the original setting, so if we have a flat Setting, so if we have a third connection, this ensures that the commuting squares arising from the bi-inter connection is something canonical arising from a subfactor. So we have a general commuting square, but a general commuting, so from a commuting square, we can construct a subfactor, but from also from a subfactor we can construct a commuting square. But in general, this doesn't give you back the original commuting square. Then basically, we get the original commuting. Basically, we get the original commuting square if and only if we have extra property at the beginning. This is called the flatness. And this flatness is ensured because we can choose the identity object here at the upper left corner. So this is the importance of the choice of the identity object. But then now we have four different factors. four different tunnel factors. Then at the upper left corner we have say NM bimodes, NM objects. Then we don't have the identity object. So this is a module category. So we don't have the identity object. Then so we cannot choose the identity object for the A, and this is the difference we have here. Then so if the flat by interconnection yeah this is frank enough. So a flat by interconnection contains all the information about the original stuff. Information about the original stuff as long as we are interested in finitely text fine concepts. This is like the classification for the proper. So then, so this is the last page, so I'll explain this relation between this flatness and the raw currency of the Q system, or commutativity of the flooding surgery. So if we have, so as I said, for alpha. Have so, as I said, for alpha induction, we don't need commutativity of the for being surgery. But if we do have commutativity, this is this raw quality, this name comes from a raw quality of a conformance itself, then we do have flatness for the developing alpha interactions, alpha induced by the teleconnection. And then for proving this property, basically we have to get this. We have to compute quantum 60 symbols of this form. So then, and here, this iota, this is NM objects arising from the Q system. So in the previous slide, I had different levels, like A1, A2. And they are NM objects arising from the original Q system and some kind of induction for tensor product structure. But this is really. Structure. But this is really the one arriving from the floor being surgical objects. So if we have a Q system, then it immediately directly gives this NM object, we can regard it as an NM object. So this IOTA is basically for being a salient object. Then we use the same IOTA for all the four parts. So we have four corner objects in the diagram. In the diagram of quantum fixed symbols, then we fix them to be all IO arriving from the Q system. Then, so this lambda and mu are remaining labeled for this crossing. And then we have that compute at this diagram. Then basically, so if we have eye over here, locality is basically the feature resolved the crossing. So if we have crossing like this, We have crossing like this, and we have ioda here, we can resolve this crossing just like this. Then, for this picture, we can resolve this one, or we can eliminate the crossing. Then we have just an eye of the picture, and we have two i as lambda, u inside. Then basically, this is basically one, we have two normalization. And if we just take care of this normalization, we get number one. And this actually being one is based. Being one is basically another flatness. This is another characterization of flatness. So, in this way, we can characterize this kind of thing. So, yeah, so on the one hand, we have a class of nice biointele connections, but if we have local IQ system, then it may be easy to get something nice. Something nice. So if we do not have a locality or computer, this may lead something better because we can realize the 6GS input in a non-trivial way. So this may give more interest in the realization of quantum 6JSI mode arising from non-commutative filming charges. Okay, for I hope yeah. Any questions? Yaso, I think I asked this last time I saw you, but alpha induction is also, at least in the tensor category literature, used to refer to a construction that you can do if you have like an invertible module category. You can sort of turn it into a bimodule category using the braiding. You can use the over-braiding. Using the braiding. You can use the overbraiding or you can use the underbraiding. And if you do one and then reverse the other, you get this auto equivalence. And I know it has to be connected to this, but I don't quite see it. I don't have the direct relationship. Yeah, it's not quite similar, so I get more direct connections to there, but I don't have the relation actually. So the um where is the like the pentagonal in a data equation for 6j symbols? Where does it equal structure? Is it the flatness? Yeah, flatness is a kind of pentagonal equation. So that comes in characterization of flatness involving a large diagram. So yeah, this locality for sort of a part of that kind of pentagon. Is there an analog of the pentagon for these graphs that you can across? Any other questions? Okay, well let's thank the speaker.
