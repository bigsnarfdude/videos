Thank you, Paul. Thanks for inviting me. It's great to be in the mountains. So, yeah, thanks, Ronnie, for letting me this thing. So, I've actually never done this before, which might sound incredible, but anyway. Actually, that's what it works. So I'm I wanted I wanted to talk, what I announced was to talk about some work, current work with Omar, Leon Sanchez. And that work is a little bit technical. And so it struck me that maybe it would be worth spending some time talking about the sort of background problem that this work was motivated by, even though we don't solve that problem. Even though we don't solve that problem, or I will, in fact, give no theorems, even partial toward that problem. But that was somehow the context in which we started doing this. And maybe it's more interesting to this audience. And so I'll do that for the sort of two parts of the talk. So I'll do that for the first part. And I should say there's no algebraic dynamics per se. I'm sorry about that, but it does exist by analogy. So maybe in some analysis. By analogy. So maybe some, you know, there's some connection, but it would be purely analogical. It's really more on the differential than on the algebra different side. Okay, so this background problem. So let's try. So section one. Yeah, looks good. Poisson takes me. Do you think it's too thick? Sorry? It's kind of thick. Yeah, do you want to think? Okay, I think I saw. Yeah, do you want to think? Okay, I think I saw you do this there. Yeah. Yes. Okay, so that's the background problem, and it's something that's been around, but I've been involved in five years or something, so talked about different parts of it. I'm just going to give sort of a survey of the problem and how it. And how it led us to what we're doing now, Omar and I. So let's fix algebraically closed field, more or less for convenience, but characteristic zero. So the objects are Poisson varieties. So what's a Poisson variety over K? Poisson variety over K. It is an algebraic variety, and I'm working in the affine setting, so it's an affine algebraic variety over K, say X, such that the coordinate ring is equipped with a Poisson bright. Like that. So, what's up, Poisson bracket? So, this is first of all, it's a well, it's a k-linear biderivation. And the work with Omar that we'll eventually start talking about is really just about biderivations. So, this means that. So, this means that if you take any function on your variety and plug it in to one of the arguments or to the other argument, that both of these are derivations, k-linear derivations. So, trivial on k. Okay, yeah, so it looks pretty awful to me in the handwriting, but I guess maybe you could choose slightly smaller and my but I believe it's uh the smallest ah oh it goes is another row here, right? Okay, right, and then I just yep, right a little bit too much uh enthusiasm okay well I shouldn't uh yeah so. Uh, okay, well, I shouldn't. Uh, yeah, so it's even okay, it doesn't have to be page by page, it's sort of yeah, it's continuous, yeah. Great, uh, okay, so that's what the biderivation is. Yes, yeah, right. Um, so so that's the that's bi-derivation. It's something, you know, it's a bracket, it's a binary operator, and in each argument you fix one argument's derivation. The other argument, so that's that's that, but to be a Poisson bracket, there are a few more conditions so that you. Plus no bracket, there are a few more conditions, so it should be skew symmetric. Yeah, thank you. And it should satisfy the Jacobian identity. Okay, so it's a biderivation with additional with these additional properties. So, you know, the analogy here is with algebraic dynamics, where you add to the coordinate ring an endomorphism. Okay, the additional structures are an endomorphism. Structures. So there's an analogy to say d-varieties or algebraic vector fields where the coordinate ring has a derivation. So this is some other structure on the coordinate ring. When I say that there is some analogical connection to algebraic dynamics, that's what I mean. Though the analogy will go further, as we will see. Yeah. Okay. And I should say what a Poisson sub-variety is, so a sub-variety. Say y is a Poisson subvariety if the defining ideal as an ideal in the coordinate ring is a bidifferential ideal i.e., i.e., it is preserved by all these derivations. So, by the way, maybe I should give this a name and I should use a color. I'm getting confident here. So, these guys, these guys here, we call these the Hamiltonians. These are the associated Hamiltonians to the bracket. Okay, so instead of writing it out each time, I'll just say Hamiltonians, and I mean the derivations you get by plugging in arbitrary elements of the coordinate ring into one. Elements of the coordinate ring into one of the arguments. So if it is preserved by all the by all, oops. Ah, so first of all, that is preserved by all the associated kind of blendings. Okay, so that's going to be to be bi-differential idea. So it's a differential idea. So it's a differential ideal for all the derivations coming from the graph. So that's a Poisson subvariety. And I want to consider the following statement. So this line doesn't matter, huh? Okay, but okay. So let's consider the following statement, which Which I have phrased to be analogous to what Sina was talking about this morning. So one of the following must hold. I mean, it's not a theorem, this is a statement, and the question is: is it true or false about that? Okay, so condition A. Condition A is seen as the analog of Sina's condition A, except in this sort of stronger version, the problem session yesterday, we talked about this. I gave this, I guess then you had A and B split, switch, so I had to switch it as well. I'd write this B prime, so the sort of stronger version. So this is the statement that the union of all proper plus sub-varieties is irreducible. There was the issue last time, but irreducible sub-varieties over k is not as risky dense in X. So like in algebraic dynamics, you have sub-varieties of your variety, but then you have the ones you're interested in, which are the invariant sub-varieties. So here there's a Poisson structure, so the sub-varieties you're interested in are the Poisson sub-varieties. And the condition here is that the proper Poisson sub-varieties don't. That the proper Poisson subvarieties don't cover, they're not some, they don't, they're not Zariski dense in X. And condition B is that there is, well, an invariant vibration. There is a non-constant function, rational function. Yeah, so I mean here rational function that's not constant such that the Hamiltonian. that the Hamiltonian is identically is identically zero. Which this AB are really analogous well okay A is A is sort of a strong for it's not it's not about a Zirski dens orbit but some at least it should be it should be suggestive of the condition A that Sina talked The condition A that Sina talked about. And condition B should be suggestive of his condition B, which was the existence of an invariant vibration. So here it's a non-constant rational function. So I am, of course, so you can canonically extend the Poisson bracket from the coordinate ring to the fraction field. And so I mean with respect, right? I'm doing this in the fraction field, in the rational function field. Oh, I can look here. It's easier. Right, so it's not yes, right. Um, yeah, so that's that's that's a statement. So I hope that's um, so that's at least just trying to come to grips without actually understanding logic here. Um, so if I mean you take the plus one bracket for like a symplectic manifold, right, something like that. So, so these ideals would be like the features which define symplectic sub-varieties of and it's just. Yes, but and it's just that in this setting, you just don't expect lots of these things, it's not very exciting, but yeah, I mean, well, one of these must hold. So if you have many of them, it should be because. So maybe it's worth it. Because of course, it's not very many. That's your smooth side. So you don't have many. Yeah, exactly. Sorry, that's exactly my question. So the remark here, maybe that's worth pointing out, is that. Pointing out is that A, or rather B, I guess, implies the negation of A, right? If you had such a thing, then the fibers of F would give rise to a Zirski dense set of Poisson subfraids. Just the same intuition as in the algebraic dynamical situation on symplectic manifolds as the actual setting. Good. So it's a kind of strong form of this orbit Zirski. Strong form of this orbit, Zirsky, Zirski dense orbit conjecture, but are an analogy of the strong form. Okay, so this was studied. So this was motivated by classical work in representation theory, non-commuted algebra from Tixmei Meglin. And then, you know, this was a Poisson, commutative Poisson analog of this that was asked. This particular thing was asked by Gordon and Brown, Brown and Gordon for. For in well, actually, I must say that I'm not giving the full statement. The PDME has a third statement, and yeah, so this is a sort of simplified version, but somehow this is the heart of the statement. And Brown and Gordon asked this paper that appeared in 2003. I think it was studied already in the 90s. Is this true? And we give a counterexample. And we give a counterexample in this paper with Jason Bell, St√©phane Lanois, Dan Sanchez, myself in period 2017, and we really used model theory. Model theory of differentially post-fields. To give a counterexample so that this statement is in general not true. At the same time, maybe let me say we did prove that it is true if in right, so yeah, the pointing doesn't. So it is true that if you, the statement is true, if you replace an A, you don't look at all proper Poisson sub varieties, but just. Proper Poisson sub-varieties, but just Poisson hypersurfaces. Then the statement, then the equivalence we proved, but the general statement is false. Right. In particular, the full statement is true when the dimension of x is less than or equal to 3. Using this hypersurface statement, it reduces that into looking at curves and is a separate argument. So this is true. So it's true if the dimension of x is less than 1.3. In general, you have to weaken A to hypersurfaces. So it's going to move away, but I guess I can bring it back. People ask. It's true. It falls for all dimensions. In fact, in every dimension. For example, in every dimension, it's for four and then pretty much. Because Because I mean, you can construct a counterexample in each dimension bigger than three. Right. So I've been talking about this analog with algebraic dynamics, but the sort of more relevant analog is with differential algebra. I do want to state the differential analog. So we have a differential analog of this statement. So here the point is that you replace Here, the point is that you replace Poisson structure by d structures, or if you like, algebraic vector fields. So you add on the coordinate ring a derivation rather than that bracket, and then you have the statement delta dme, which says the same thing, one of the following. Following must hold, namely A, the union of the proper irreducible D subvarieties over K is not Ziriski dense or B. Or B, there is some non-constant rational function whose derivative is zero. Okay, so it's just the direct analog with the derivation rather than the Poisson bracket. And this was studied after we did the Poisson case. We studied this Jason, Omar, and myself, in a paper that appeared the following year. And again, it's false. Again, false in general. Again, true for hypersurface. For hypersurfaces. Okay, but what we also showed was that it was true for algebraic D groups. We also showed that the delta D M E holds for D groups. So here X is an algebraic group, affine algebraic group. And the derivation commutes on the coordinate ring, it commutes with the group structure gives you a coproduct on the coordinate ring, so it commutes with the coproduct. Yeah. So there's no reasonable notion of flow in this setting. I mean, you're just saying there's no closed leaves, but in general, you don't pick a point, there's no leaves. General, you don't pick a point, there's no leaves. Right. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. I'm just trying to. Yeah, yeah, I don't. Yeah, so here, here we're not thinking about any kind of flows. I don't know exactly how it fits in, but really we're thinking just sort of almost discreetly about sub-varieties separately and whether they're invariant or not. So, really, just about the leaves of a possible. Yeah. So, if the ambient algebraic variety has a group structure, which is compatible with the differential structure, then the full statement actually does hold. Which now strikes me that I guess that should be in the algebraic dynamical analog. If you have a sigma algebraic group, is the orbit. Ah, so that's yeah, semi-believing. Yeah, so that should be like the group version of the dynamical. Version of the dynamical. Special case, yeah, yeah. But it's along these lines, right? But here it works for any degroup. But this, the fact that this was true motivated asking the question in the Poisson case. I'm really interested in this talk in the Poisson case. I just gave the differential cases analog where we do, where we Where we knew where we saw that it was true in the group case. And so it made sense to go back to the Poisson case. And this was a conjecture in a paper of Omar of St√©phane Lanois and Omar, which came out the next year. Which is that the P DME, so back to the original one, the Poisson one, so forget about the differential one, Poisson, Poisson DME, that either A or B holds for Poisson sub varieties of a Poisson variety, that this should hold for all Poisson algebraic groups. And here, Poisson algebraic group means that the bracket commutes. Can you explore with the co-production quarter? Are there restrictions on the group to have a Poisson algebraic structure? That's actually a good question. Classify precisely what the Poisson algebraic groups are. There are definitely restrictions. There are strong restrictions. Yeah, this doesn't seem to be something that's been worked out. It would obviously help with this conjecture. For this conjecture, what are the interesting examples of Boisson algebraic groups? Well, you can get Boisson algebraic structures on powers of multiplicative group. You can get some on, I'll give an example actually on various non-commutative linear algebraic groups. So we have some examples, but we have sort of a handful. And it looks like it's quite free, but there are definitely constraints. So I don't know the answer. Construct. So I don't know the answer. It has something to do with invariant differentials. I mean, in the case of just getting the degroup structure, you specify it over the constants. This just comes from invariant differentials. Right. Is there some construction from the invariant differentials to give you all the son-el-de-structures on groups over the constants? Not that we know, but that might be the right way to pursue this. And in fact, I think that approach. Approach. So we're actually continuing. So this is the, by the way, I've finished in some sense that this is the open, this is the background problem. Oh, let me also say here that they proved it for commutative algebraic groups, Poisson algebraic groups. So and the in the approach, And the approach that they take and that Omar and I took did not go via just trying to understand all Poisson algebraic groups. And this is ongoing work with Omar and also Jason. And one of the things that Jason has brought up is that we should try to just understand what are the, so I think something suggested might be a way to tackle this is to give a good sense. There isn't that much literature on Poisson's breakgroup structure. It's hard to find examples. It's hard to find examples in the literature, but you can construct some of those where you can't build structure. Yes, yes, okay, definitely not the case problem. Okay, so right, and the conjecture remains open. Jack otherwise open, and that's what we were uh thinking about. I mean, Stefan and Omar were thinking about, and Omar and I and Jason were thinking about it. So on and off, I guess, over the last couple of years, Omar and I were trying to. So, okay, so the case in the differential case where we get it for D groups uses the model theory of differential closed fields. And that is not going to, there is no model theory. And that is not going to, there is no model theory of Poisson fields, or model theory of binder factorial fields. It's not a good model theory. So you can't, that's not going to work directly. There are various possible approaches, but the one that motivated what we're doing now that Omar and I started thinking about a couple of years ago was to say, well, most of these results, model therapic results, could be stated in pure differential algebraic geometric language, and maybe those results can be extended to the Poisson algebraic setting. The Poisson algebraic setting, right? So, um, so one approach is to extend delta or yeah, and it's not, it's not really an extension, right? It's to develop Poisson algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry along the lines of differential algebraic geometry. I mean, the more advanced things about algebraic groups and so on, and differential algebraic groups. And when we started doing this, we immediately ran into, yeah, so you run into very fundamental. Very fundamental fundamental foundational foundational technical problems some of which we solve. In the work that I in this community by differential algebra, I'm going to talk about in a second, but let me give a couple of examples to show what kind of basic things, like very foundational things, that happen in differential algebraic geometry that don't extend here. So, the first one is in groups. This is an example of. This is an example of JSON's, which is that it's an example of a Poisson algebraic group whose center is not a Poisson subdivide. So, you know, we have the commutative case by all. We have the commutative case by Omar and Stefan, right? So, one natural approach would be to look at the center, apply Stefan or Marshall the center, then look at the quotient, try to get some sort of relative statement, and then reduce this to the centerless case, which, for example, differential algebraic groups, you have a lot of information about, right? But the very first step would be that the center should, you should be able to apply it, but the center is not necessarily a Poisson sub-variety. So, here's the example. It's very easy. It's the Heisenberg group. It's the Heisenberg group. Slide group of GL3 matrices. So the coordinate ring is just a polynomial ring and three variables. And the group structure gives you a coproduct. And you can make this. And you can make this, you can make it Poisson by taking the bracket of x and y to be y minus x and the bracket of x and z to be z minus one half x squared and the bracket of x of y and z. V z minus one half y squared. So one has to check that this commutes with the coproduct. You can do it, and it does commute with the coproduct. And this gives you a Poisson algebraic group. But what's the ideal? The ideal of the center is the ideal generated by X and Y, right? And that's not closed under the Hamiltonian, Hamiltonian, because if you take. Hamiltonians, because if you take xz, it's not in this ideal. x is in the ideal, but the Hamiltonian, the bracket with z is not in the ideal because it's z minus half x squared, so it's not in the ideal general x and y. So the center of H is not a Poisson subvariety. Remember, to be a Poisson subvariety meant that the ideal was preserved by all the Hamiltonians. Was preserved by all the Hamiltonians. It's not invariants up front. Okay, so that's going to make things very different. A lot of one's intuition about how things should go. Let me give an even more fundamental, yeah, elementary problem. So, this is going to be a Poisson variety, just yeah, Poisson variety x such that the diagonal in x squared is not a Poisson subgroup. Okay, so you don't have equality, if you like, in this category. If you like in this category, so an example is quite simple, it's A2. So the coordinate ring is just a polynomial ring in two variables. And you make it into a Poisson by taking this to be x. As you'd might expect on a polynomial ring, you really have a lot of freedom of how to define. A lot of freedom of how to define the bracket, and if you tell me that x, y, is x, that tells me that it is possible to put a Poisson bracket which has this property. And now, what's the diagonal? So if I is the ideal diagonal, well, this is the diagonal in the coordinate ring of x squared, right? So that is in the tensor. Yeah, maybe I should just write this as this xy. Let's see. Let's see if I can joke this in k x y tensor over k with k x y and it's given by x tensor one minus one tensor x and y tensor one minus one tensor y right that's the generating ideal that generates the ideal of the diagonal. What is the co-bracket? What is the co-bracket? Sorry, the Poisson bracket on the tensor product. Well, this is really where the issue comes up, but there is a canonical way of taking a tensor product on, so Kxy, tensor Kxy has a canonical, canonical plus off bracket given by So I have F1 tensor G1, and I want to take its bracket with F2 tensor G2. And I should make sure I'm using the same. No, yeah, F1, G1, F2, G2, yes. Then this is going to be, you take in the sort of left factor the The bracket of F1 and F2, and you tensor with the product G1, G2. And then you take the product F1, F2. You tensor with the bracket G1G2. This is the unique Poisson bracket on a tensor product, which extends the Poisson brackets on the factors and has the property that if you take F tensor one and bracket it with one tensor G, you get zero. Bracket it with one tensor g, you get zero. There's only one such way to extend it. And if you extend it that way, this is the sort of the canonical way it's done in Poisson Germanic geometry, then you get this. So now let's take x tensor one minus one tensor x. So this is something in my ideal, in my diagonal ideal. In my diagonal ideal, and let's bracket it with y tensor one, so it's additive, so I get x tensor one bracket y tensor one, but that means that this should extend just what's happening on the left side. So that should be x y tensor one. And the other one, I have one on one side and the x on the other side, and that's supposed to be zero. And if you work it out here, it is zero, so it's just that, but that's equal to x tensor one. But that's equal to x tensor, which is not in the diagonal. So the diagonal is not a person subject. So maybe to give the give the game away or the punchline away, the problem really here in this very basic example is that one is following the way in Poisson algebraic geometry you put a postnal bracket. Break geometry, you put a Poisson bracket on the tensor product. And it's not unique. It's unique if you insist that the F tensor one bracket one tensor G is zero. And that somehow you shouldn't do that. And so there's choices of other Poisson brackets that don't have that property. And then you can improve the situation, which is what Homer and I do, which I'll start talking about now. So it's okay. Okay, so there's a lot of, yeah, so the ideals are not Poisson sub-varieties, centers of Poisson algebraic. Of Poisson algebraic groups, not Poisson subvarieties. So, I mean, the hope of extending this thing looked sort of impossible, and so we just sort of started at the beginning. So, if you change the Poisson on the tensor product, then you change the version of Poisson group. Yeah. Yeah, so the Poisson Break group is a thing, so you shouldn't change that. If you change the Poisson Brackett's products, you shouldn't. I mean, the Poisson algebraic group should be, for example, that exists outside of. For example, that exists outside of the collaborators I've mentioned here. That exists in the world as something. So we haven't tried playing with the notion. The problem is about Poisson Jobrade groups as they are known. So one takes the canonical Poisson bracket on the tensor product. When you say that the bracket commutes with the coproduct, you're assuming a certain bracket on the tensor product and you're taking the canonical one. You should take that. So you have to be careful. Sometimes you might want to change it. Sometimes you might want to change it. So, why should you take the? I mean, you seem to be saying that they're wrong to take the conical. Well, we don't have a counterexample to the conjecture. No, but you have a counterexample. I mean, so you've seen that, for instance, the center isn't post-on-subfriding. Right. But for that example, for example, the PDV holds that Eisenberg thing. Yeah, but if you were to put what you're going to tell us is the correct choice of the Poisson block of the tensor product, that would change. The tensor product, yeah, that would change the notion, yeah. But I'm not going to do that, so so I'm not precisely going to do that. So, you're right. If I just decided, no, it should take this other one everywhere, then it would change the state. I'm not going to do that. We're still interested in the actual statement. It's just along the way. So, it's really going to have to do with things like base change. When you want to work over additional parameters, you want to extend your base, then you shouldn't extend the bases in this canonical way. The reason for extending the base is to do something sort of generically, and then to conclude something back about the original thing over the Back about the original thing over the con over k over the constants, and there you still have your canonical definition. So it's something like this that we were hoping for. But as I say, we don't actually get any. I'll tell you now what we do. So section two is this bidifferential. Well, I called it commutative algebra, but maybe algebraic geometry, the way I'm going to state it here, the way I'm going to present it. So I'm now, I forget about the Poisson stuff. In other words, I forget. I forget about the Poisson stuff. In other words, I forget about skew symmetry and I forget about Jacobian. I just work with the bi-derivation. So let's fix a bidifferential field. And I'm also no longer going to insist k-linearity. So the bracket is not, the derivations are not necessarily trivial on k. So I just start with some fixed pi-differential field k, a characteristic zero, maybe take k algebraically closed or not. Or not. So a B variety then. I'm sorry, so bi-differential means that it's just a the bracket is a derivations. Yeah. And something about the relation between the two arguments. So you just have two derivations. Not two. You have a family of derivations, but a family of Hamiltonian. So that's all that. Now you might want to impose symmetry, anti-symmetry, and other. Anti-symmetry. And a lot of the things we do, so the kinds of things we prove are, you know, extent algebraic closure and localization and things like that. They all, if you started with something that had some additional properties, the constructions preserve those properties. But you're not assuming anything about commuting derivations. No. And of course, they don't commute even in the Poisson set. But yeah. Yeah. So you have two families of derivations. Right. Indexed by the ring itself, by the field itself. That's all it is. Yeah. So it's a very That's obvious. So it's a very kind of tiny object. But you might want more structure, and then you have to see that what we do preserves that structure. And depending on what additional properties you want, it may or may not. But the basic things like skew symmetry do get preserved. The Jacobian doesn't. And that's part of our reasons for just working in this category. Well, some of the constructions we do, the new thing does not satisfy. Okay, so we talked about B varieties instead of Poisson varieties. About B varieties instead of Poisson varieties. So, this is just an algebraic affine variety x over k such that the coordinate ring is equipped with a bidervation extending the one on the base, natural motion. Okay, so we just call that a B variety in an algebra or Poisson variety or an algebraic dynamical system. So an algebraic variety, and you have this biderivation. And a B sub variety is a sub-variety such that the ideal inside k of x is a bidifferential ideal preserved by all Hamiltonians on both sides because it's skew symmetry. I don't have skew symmetry. I have to insist that it's. I have to insist that it's preserved on both sides by all. And a beamorphism, these are all obvious definitions, is a morphism such that on the coordinate rings, such that this preserves. Such that this preserves by Dervich in the night in the obvious way. Phi star of the bracket of Fg is the bracket of phi star of F with V star of G. So we have a natural category to work in. And let me state the theory, you know, one of the main theorems as follows. So suppose I have a dominant Morphism of irreducible varieties over my differential and my bidifferential field, then there exists a Zariski open dense, I guess it's ordered to spell soft, dense. It's a reduced ball dense subset of Y and a B variety structure on the product. So that's where the tensor products come up. So the coordinate ring of this would be a tensor product. You don't take the canonical, in fact, sure, the canonical doesn't make sense because I'm not even k-linear. But even if it happened that you were. Okay, but even if it happened that you were all everything was k-linear, you still wouldn't take the canonical product. But there's some B-variety structure on this, so some bracket on the tensor product, you know, extending. Obviously, they should match extending those on X and Y zero. So, I mean, there was a B variety structure on Y, you can show that you can extend to localization, so you get a B variety structure induced on Y0. On y zero such that if you look at the graph of phi over y0, so let me denote that as the graph. I'll say restricted to, but I mean, you know, I'm restricting the codomain, the image, not the domain. So, this is going to be a sub-variety. So, this is going to be a sub-variety of x cross y zero. This is a piece I've written. Yeah, thank you. So, the graphs of beamorphisms, and this sounds like extremely, but I already showed you. Sounds like extremely, but I already showed you. So, I mean, just a sick remark: if phi equals the identity from x to x, then this gives that the diagonal, at least in x 0 cross x 0, in some risky open set, you might have to throw away some proper sub-varieties, but at least generically, that this is a p sub variety. Okay, so the problem with diagonals is actually a problem about graph. With diagonals is actually a problem about graphs of morphisms. It's not true in Poisson algebraic geometry that the graph of a Poisson morphism is just outright false, that the graph of a Poisson morphism is a Poisson sub-variety. But we can put some Poisson structure on the product, such that some B structure on the product, such that the graph is a B sub variety. And the maybe other comment to make here is that the B structure, the The B structure, the B variety, or the bidifferential structure on the coordinate ring on X cross Y0 is not canonical. I don't just mean it's not the one that I call it canonical because that doesn't make sense here, but it's not canonical in the sense that it depends on fee. Not just on x and y zero. So I'm not giving you a way to produce bi-derivations on tensor products generally. I'm given this morphism and I use the morphism to decide what to make the Cartesian product. Okay, so the bracket, the bivary structure on the product is depends on phi. If that phi was an equation of x equals y, well, then it would be an isomorphism because I'm only doing that, I can only do. An isomorphism because I'm only doing that, I can only do this for dominant maps. Okay, right. Now, I can do some things with this, though. So, this is okay. This seems like sort of a first step, but I can do some things with this. I want to talk about it. So, the next thing I want to talk about is base extension. This actually helps us do it, but what do I mean by base extension? We do need to do We do need to do base extension. Even so, the idea here is even if you start with Poisson algebraic varieties, right, where your divine derivation is a Poisson bracket to begin with over some k, where everything's k linear, you have to move to this category to make things work, right? So base extension is a problem in Poisson algebraic geometry, but in B algebraic geometry, we can do it using that theorem. So what do I mean by compatible base extension? So I have some extension of bidifferential fields. Fields, and I have a B variety X over the smaller field. Then, what's a compatible? So, a compatible base extension. Base, all my handwriting is getting worse and worse. Compatible base extension of X to L is a B variety structure. Is a B variety structure on the base extension, the algebraic geometric base extension. So you take the tensor product of the coordinate ring, you work over L. Right, so a biderivation on KX tensor K L, which is the coordinate ring of X L. Which is the coordinate ring of XL, right? By definition. Such that, well, I won't say it, but first of all, it certainly should extend the bideration on Kx, and it should extend the bi-derivation on L. That goes without saying. But the additional thing making it compatible is that whenever, this is a somewhat weird condition, but whenever you take an ideal in k of x, which is a bidifferential ideal, preserved by all the Hamiltonian. Preserved by all the Hamiltonians, then the extension ideal. So, how do you do this? L XL, maybe, is also by differential. So, one of the things that goes wrong in Poisson algebraic geometry is that the extension of a Poisson ideal is not again Poisson necessarily. I mean, the example I gave already shows that. I don't know if I should. know if i should uh maybe maybe it's worth doing so you take you take the ideal x minus y in k of x where you just take the trivial by derivation but then you look at it's what it does in kxy where the derivation is the one i took before and you see that this is not this one is clearly all ideals are bidifferent if the biderivation is trivial but this one's not Is trivial, but this one's not a bidifferential ideal because x minus 1y is x, which is not in x minus 1. x minus 1 is in x, but when you practical y, it's not. So extension ideals are not, again, this is something in differential and in difference cases, the extension of an invariant ideal would continue with green. That's not the case here. So we really want, we really insist, we talk, we only want to put those by derivations on the We only want to put those biderivations on the base extension that are compatible in the sense that the lifting of ideals from kx to lx are bidifferential. And the point geometrically is that if y in x is a b subvariety over the little k, then it should say is also. So you want to put a b variety structure such that So, you want to put a B variety structure such that your sub-varieties remain invariant as you go through this. It seems like you definitely would want this. Okay, and then I will state another theorem and I'll end there. So, the similar setting, I have a dominant morphism. In this case, I do want k to be algebraically closed or Case I do want k to be algebraically closed or let's say absolutely irreducible then there exists a bidifferential field extension okay So these are all over. I started to remember with some bi-derivation on k, right? So I was working over k delta and I have everything over little k with its bi-derivation. I now get a bidifferential extension such that and I guess I could have written and be compatible and compatible. And compatible base extensions, right? XL and YL. So I can compatibly extend X and Y to this extension in the sense of the previous definition such that when you extend the morphism, this remains a B. The morphism, this remains a B morphism. That also doesn't follow from knowing that it was compatible with X and Y. You have to do it specially to make it compatible also with phi in this sense. Okay. Okay. Such that this happens. And whenever you take a small intermediate field, whenever, let's call it F. Is a finitely generated bidifferential subfield. Bidifferential subfield. I guess it's a bidifferential sub-extension, right? Whenever there's something finally generated over K, and it's a bidifferential subfield of L. Right, so whenever you take this, there is a B point. A B point alpha in X in Y in the target over L. So what do I mean by B point? I mean a B sub variety such that the singleton is a B sub. I mean a point such that the singleton is a B sub variety. So the ideal defining that point is a bi-differential ideal. So I get a B point, a sharp point, if you like, the analogy. If you like, the analogy of differential things. So I get a B point which is generic in algebraic geometric sense, generic over F. So this is a finally generic extension. I can find an L point of Y, if you like, with compatible B-vary structures, a B point of Y over L, which is generic over F, and the fiber, which is generally fiber. Which is something in Excel is a B subvariant. But the basic thing is that generic fibers exist. Sorry, in delivering. Overall, yeah, over here. Overall, yeah. It's not generic overall. Yeah, in L, yeah. Yeah, I see. That's what you meant. Yeah, so it's a lot of words, but it says, so I have this, I have x to y. I can find some L, right? So this is not any L. I'm given. The theorem is saying there exists some kind of universal domain for phi. So we think of this L as a kind of universal domain for this morphism. And I can. Morphism and I can take a base extension to this universal y-differential ideal, but it's only universal for this morphism, it's not dealing with all morphism, such that I can compatibly base extend X and Y. So the whole, it all works with a B variety structure. You have choice of B variety structure, but I can put a B variety structure on the it's probably a way to point, right? Yeah, the last one next to the finger. This one? Yeah. This one? Yeah. So, this. So, I can put a B variety structure here such that this guy will have lots of B points. In particular, for any finely generated sub-extension, it'll have B points that are generic over that sub-extension. And the fiber will still be a B sub variety. In general, fibers are not B sub-varieties. That's also, yeah, fibers of B-morphisms are not B-sub-varieties, but we can put a B-variety structure here such that the fiber is about a B-point. So, again, from differential algebraic geometry, you'd expect that if you take a sharp point, Geometry: You'd expect that if you take a sharp point, then the fiber of a dimorphism over a sharp point would be again a sub-variety. That fails, but we can choose our B structure here so that you have generic points here, and the fibers above those generic points are B subfibers. So, if you take, for example, in particular, if phi equals the identity for max. equals the identity from x to x this gives generic points gives generic b points so the the algebra the model theoretic approach and the differential algebraic geometric approach really relies on being able to take generic points of d varieties that so Zariski generic points that are d points so in the algebraic dynamical system sense that would be an invariant point in some extension which is generic or In some extension, which is generic over the dynamical system you started with, and you can't do this in post-algebraic geometry, but you can with some choice of L here. And so it seems like you could maybe start doing things. And we do a little bit more. I mean, I'm not going to do it. We articulate the Dixman-Mergelin problem in this setting. And we prove things like if you have a mock-down amorphism and you know the result in the image and you know the result for the generic fiber, then you know the result. The result for the total space. So, that kind of thing can now be proved using this machinery, but actually doesn't prove any new cases. So far, we couldn't see, we couldn't get it to prove any new cases. We expect, well, part of it is we don't have many examples of post-algebraic groups, but we expect it to be useful. But that's the algebraic statement that we obtained. Right, thanks for your attention.
