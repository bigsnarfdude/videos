Yes, thank you. I'd like to thank the organizers, Paul, Alex, and Boyan for the opportunity. So, I want to talk about some problems on the chromatic number, which is kind of the main focus of the workshop. So, all of these problems have the paradigm of structure and coloring. So, if you know the chromatic number of a graph, what can you say as substructures in your graph? Structures in your graph. So, the two main problems in the area, big problems, are the Hardweigher and Garfar Sumner. So, the problems are kind of special cases or some weakenings or implications of these conjectures or related things. Okay, so all graphs are finite and simple, and the most important invariant here is the chromatic number, and we are in particular. And we are in particular interested in the relationship between the chromatic number and the clique number, which is the subject of chi-boundedness. And H will denote the Hardweigher number, which is the number of vertices in the largest clique that is a minor in your graph. And for one problem, we need the number of spanning trees, which is a classic invariant. And a hole in a graph is an induced cycle of length at least four. Of length at least four, and whenever we say free, we mean as induce subgraph. So, those are the important things. Okay, so the first question is, suppose if some four or five problems relate the cycle lengths and the chromatic number, one of which is if you don't have any cycle length divisible by three, then you are four colorable. So, so this comes from actually one of the first things that started this. From actually, one of the first things that started this lot of movement in high-boundedness by Bonami, Sharbi, and Tamasev, who proved by a Trinity-changing argument that they are in fact bounded by some chromatic number. So, there is an upper bound, but their bound is very, very large. So, the actual problem is to decide whether they are all four colorable. I forgot, isn't isn't three colorable still open? Could they not all be three colorable? They not all be three-colorable? I think they had an example of a four uh graph that was not three colorable. Yes. I think there was an example of a graph where you couldn't delete an edge and stay in the same class. Yes, I mean we live in people where we cannot uh delete an edge, but I don't know of example where you need But I don't know of an example where you need four colours. So I think Paul is right. It still it still could be the case that they're all three colorable. Okay, so that's a harder problem. I think so. Okay, so that's possible. Yeah, okay. So a side thing would be to understand the structure of such graphs. So it's a harder problem. So the problem is about coloring. Okay. So okay. Let me move on to the next one. This is on a similar spirit. This is in a similar spirit. What if you exclude all subdivisions of K4 as an induced subgraph? So, this is a nice class of graphs that has been studied. And again, it's a four-color problem. You want to show that it's four-colorable. And the best known thing is they are 24-colorable. And I think Maria and a lot of co-authors proved that if you're triangle-free, then you're three-colorable. But the general case is open. General case is open. If you just exclude induced subdivisions of K4, then you are four-colorable again. So, a structure theorem is related, but okay. The third problem? I'm not sure. Yeah. I think probably it is known, but I can't think what the example is. It is known, but we can't think what the example is. Yeah, I think that the Garage graph or something like that, I'm not sure. Yeah, for at least one of the two problems, I thought one of them had a thing that had graphs with chromatic number four. Yeah. Okay. So this, you exclude all odd holes except for the first one. But then you exclude triangles. You and you exclude triangles, what can you say about the chromatic number? So, there was a paper which proved that such graphs are four-colorable, and their conjecture is that you can actually say one more color. So, I think this is a good problem. Do you mean to exclude holes of length four? Yeah, ah, okay. Odd holes and four holes. Okay, yeah, three, four. Yeah, can you see my screen? Three, four, yeah. Can you see my screen? Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, I just want to tell you whether that was a mistake. No, no, no. Okay. That's the next problem. Not excluding four is the next problem. Okay, so I think this is a very good problem. This is probably one of the most problems that can be done, I think, in a week by experts like you. So, what's the structure of such graphs? So, I think this comes from a conjecture of Neil Robertson about some structural. Of Neil Robertson about some structural things, but that conjecture turned out to be false, I think. But anyway, the problem about the chromatic number, I think, is still that they are three-colorable. The next problem is where you don't exclude holes of length four, where you just exclude odd holes, except five, but then you exclude a triangle. I think you call them pentagonal graphs. And the conjecture is that, I mean, the possibility is that they are four-colorable. And the known bound is that. The known bound is that there is some big constant, which uses a nice leveling argument, iterative leveling argument, to prove that they are some 82,000 colorable. So that's the difference between problem three and four. So again, there is a structural question. Okay, problem five: if you don't have even holes, then can you partition into two sets, each of which induces a perfect graph? And the motivation. And the motivation for that would be: well, to find the optimal chi-bounding function for even-hole-free graphs. I think that's still open. So, Chirnovsky and Seymour proved that every even-hole-free graph has a simplicial vertex, which would give you the two omega bound. So, this problem would also give you a two omega bound, two times omega bound for the chi-bounding function. So, it will be an alternate way to show. So, it will be an alternate way to show that they are chi-bounded by 2 times omega, but I think one can improve the chi-bounding function along going along structural lines. So, trying to partition your graph into pieces where you have more control on each of the pieces. Okay, sixth problem is the Hardigan number is at least the chromatic number. So, what is the co-chromatic number? What is the co-chromatic number? It's kind of a spin on the classic chromatic number where you want to partition your vertex set into sets, but you don't care whether it's a stable set or a clique. So this has been studied by some people, including Paul Erd≈ës and some people. So it's an invariant. It's invariant under complementation. The graph and its complement have the same thing. So this is a weakening of Hartweger's conjecture. Of Hartweger's conjecture because this co-chromatic number is less than or equal to the chromatic number. So I think this has some chance of, but I'm afraid if it's going to be equivalent to Hardweeker's conjecture, there's a simple reduction or do something for like triangle free graphs or something, which would say that it's not very different from Hardweeker's conjecture. That's possible, I think. Okay, problem seven is along the lines of Gapfar. Is along the lines of Gaffer-Sumner. Suppose you exclude any tree and C4. So, can you show that it is polynomially chi-bounded? In fact, it's more close to this conjecture of Espray, Louis Espray, who claims that every chi-bounded class is actually polynomially chi-bounded. So, because this class is known to be chi-bounded, but it's not known to be polynomially chi-bounded. Polynomially bounded. That's the problem. And structurally, I think this has been investigated a lot for specific T. I think P6 is the biggest one that people have studied structurally. P7 would be a nice problem. Understanding the structure of graphs without a path on seven vertices and cycle of length four. Okay, here is a problem. Okay, here is a problem motivated by Hardwiger. So, the number of spanning trees in a graph is at least the chromatic number to the chromatic number minus two. Well, where is this coming from? Well, Cayley famously proved that counting result that the complete graph on n vertices has exactly n to the n minus 2 spanning trees. So, if you believe him and if you believe the him and if you believe the deletion contraction spanning trees enjoy this deletion contraction and then so it is an immediate consequence of hardwiger so so i think if you disprove this i think you are disproving hardwigar but maybe there is a trivial proof of this i don't know i haven't showed i haven't talked to anybody about this or maybe maybe it does it will not survive Maybe it does, it will not survive. But it looks pretty. I mean, just comparing two invariants, which have nothing to do with each other, coming from different sides, and both of them are very important. Like tau is very important in matrix theory because of the deletion contraction. And chromatic number is more structural. Okay, so I think this is my favorite problem of the twenty-five. So because it relates to two different things and it's related to the one of the biggest things, which is hard weaker. The one of the biggest things, which is hardwiger. Okay, coming back to excluding things. Suppose you exclude a path on five vertices and a cycle on five vertices as induced subgraphs. Can you bound it by omega square? So with Maria, we proved that they are what are called two divisible, which means you can break into two parts such that each part has a smaller clique number, which unfortunately gives only an exponential bound. Exponential bound. So for Ardish-Heinel, you need a polynomial chi-bounding function. And so omega squared or something, any polynomial would be nice. And I think this is the simplest open case of Addisch Heinel, excluding both P phi and C phi. Okay, here is another problem that I put it in haste. So if seven doesn't work, put eight there. So every seven chromatic graph either contains a pattern. Either contains a path or a cycle or a clique on five vertices as an induced subgraph. So, yeah, so in other words, what we are interested in is we are excluding P5, C5, and K5 as an induced subgraph. And what is the maximum chromatic number for this class? So So okay. What is the optimal chi-bounding function for the class of graphs whose complements have girth at least six? Which means we are excluding three graphs as induced subgraphs. And what's the optimal chi-bounding function? Because the class of graphs with girth at least six has no, it's not chi-bounded, but the complement is chi-bounded. And we know they are quadratic. And we know they are quadratically chi-bounded because, I mean, either you can see it by seeing just the C3 complement or C4 complement, either one. But if you're excluding C5 as well, can you, so the question is, can you do omega to the two minus epsilon for okay? Problem 12 is about a graph which is called the fork, the fork is the graph. Which is called the fork. The fork is the graph obtained by subdividing one of the edges in K13. And so the question is, if you exclude that particular phi vertex graph and all cycles of length at least five, is it polynomially chi-bounded? And where does the problem come from? Well, it comes from the intersection of two things that we don't know. So it's a problem easier than two harder problems. Problems. So we don't know whether four free graphs are polynomially bounded. And the same thing holds for graphs without holes of length at least five. But if you intersect them, hopefully it's more tractable. You can do a polynomial high-boundedness proof and actually get a good polynomial like omega squared or something like that. And also structurally, I think it's a good interesting problem. So you exclude. Interesting problem. So you exclude these many things. How can you build graphs in this class or decompose graphs and do a structure theory for this class? Okay, here is a piece of Hadwiger. So suppose you exclude small cycles, say the first three cycle lengths. Can you prove Hartweger's conjecture? That the Hartweger number is at least the chromatic number. The chromatic number. And this comes from a nice result of Kuhn and Ostas, who proved that some large girth, sufficiently large girth is enough. So they proved that if you exclude up to 27, then you get hardwigger. And so a harder thing would be to just see how far you can push this argument. Can you just exclude some small cycles and get away with it? Some small cycles and get away with it. Okay, so another problem on the variation of Jarfar Sumner is you exclude a tree and you exclude cycles of length 3 and 5. Does it have bounded chromatic number? I mean, you can actually ask just with C3, but I think that's very, very hard. In fact, that might be equivalent to the whole conjecture. So if you put the mix of C3 and C3, If you put the mix of C3 and C5, what can you say? Does it give more traction? So that's the point of this problem because just C4, I think we saw that it's known. Roddle proved that if you put C4 in, it's known. So, okay, here is a conjecture. The chromatic number is at most, the clique number to the L minus 1. Well, what is L? L is the length of the longest induced path. So, this relates. So, this relates three invariants: chromatic number, the clique number, and the length of the longest-induced path. Well, yeah, it is known that there is a relation. Giafar famously proved that if you don't have a big induced path, it's chi-bounded. But what is the precise relationship between these three invariants? So, this is not even known when L is 3. Well, because if you extrude a P5, it's not known that it's omega. It's not known that it's omega squared, which was one of my previous problems. So, sorry, Vaidy, can you go back a couple of problems? I just had trouble unmuting myself, but I have a question about a previous problem. Isn't this what Jacob just talked about? This one? The triangle-free graphs. Well, isn't that right? Not proving the conjecture for triangle-free graphs, but he proved that there is a minor. Graphs, but he proved that there is a minor of some function, right? But not exactly the Hardwicker conjecture. So Jacob was talking about independent sets rather than the chromatic number, and he asked the same question about the chromatic number. Yes, okay, that's right. Okay. Sorry. But I also said that That if you go through average degree, the Kunostis and Krivolevich-Sudakov work does allow you to prove this sort of thing with an exponent that's bigger than one, but there's a constant in front. And I'm not sure if that constant factor in front of the chi of g to the one plus exponent, if that gives you a bound that's actually bigger than this. So for chi of g large enough, this is true. If this is true, it comes from that. Certainly, okay. Okay, so longest induced path. Okay, I think this is not a good problem, I think. But anyway, I just put it in. If neither G nor the complement contains a KT minor, then the chromatic number is bounded. Well, it's a Bounded. Well, it's a finite set, but still, I thought, so I think this should be known, but I just put it in case. So this is one of the weakest problems, I think, in the set. Okay, so this is a piece of a famous conjecture of Lova's: that if you take a graph with chromatic number six and you take any edge and delete the endpoints, you get a four-chromatic graph. Something that special happens, and that happens only for K. Special happens, and that happens only for k6. So, this is the first open case of a famous problem called the Lovas double-critical conjecture. So, I think for k equal to 5, there is a famous short proof of stee bits. So, but I think 6 is open, is the first case that is open. And I think it's a very nice problem because it looks very tractable because you're working with a six-chromatic graph and thing. And I think a lot of like the proof for k equal to six of hardwigger, although it's different, I think there can be some techniques that can be used. Okay, so usually when you exclude something, it's much nicer if you exclude its complement as well. And this is in that spirit. So if you exclude a path on six vertices and its complement, then can you get a polynomial chi-bounding function? So So, well, if you do it for P5 and P5 complement, that's a very well-structured class of graphs. So, there is a structured theorem known for that. But once you go higher, there is no structure theorem, but maybe there is a polynomial chi-bounding function. Okay, so how about excluding a path on T vertices and a cycle of length 4? Then, well, it's known to be high-bounded for sure. And how about a linear? And how about a linear pi-bounding function? So, I think a lot of work has been done on the algorithmic side of these problems. So, detecting: can you three-color these graphs or four-color these graphs and so on. But a linear chi-bounding function would be useful for approximation algorithms. Okay, so what happens if you exclude a path on T vertices and a cycle on five vertices? So, it's just a mixing of different combinations of these graphs. Different combinations of these graphs. And here I think linear would be too much. So I probably think there are examples that are known that you can't do linear, but you have to, but the objective is to get a polynomial type bounding function. Okay, here is a problem that relates induced subgraphs and minors. So let G be a graph where the chromatic number is at most the clique number plus two for every induced subgraph. Two for every induced subgraph. So we are doing the spirit of merge. So doing it for every induced subgraph and then prove Hartwiger's conjecture for this class. So it's proving Hartwigger for a specific class of graphs. So, I mean, if you put zero instead of two, that's perfect graphs. That's easy. If you put one instead of two, I think it's an easy argument and it works. And for two, I think it's slightly. I think it's slightly harder, but I don't know. But if you think that's easy, then you can just make it any k. So, what's the maximum k you can do this kind of argument? So, you're doing graph classes, well, pretty much defined by induced subgraphs. And you are trying to prove a conjecture which is based on minors. So. So, what's the maximum you can do as far as K is concerned? So, I think two and three are good problems, I think, doing it for two and three. Okay, here is something motivated by original paper of Garfar's. So, if you exclude a path on T vertices and the three cycle, then can you actually get an exact bound on the maximum chromatic number of the class? So, Giafar's proof. So, Gerfars proved that they have chromatic number at most t minus 2. That's the famous Gerfars path argument. And so, the question is: can you save one more color? So, I think probably you need to do more structural analysis to save one more color. And I just put t greater than or equal to seven because I'm afraid it's going to be false for smaller values because I haven't checked it. Okay, did I put this problem already? Maybe. Problem already? Maybe. So for every tree, you exclude a three-cycle and a five-cycle, then it has a bounded chromatic number. So probably this is it. And in 1980, Giafar Samaritan tools approved that if you exclude C3 and C4, that indeed has bounded chromatic number. So instead of C4, if you just plug in C5, what happens? Okay, so if you exclude a path and the complement of P5, is it polynomially kibound? P5 is it polynomially pi-bounded? So I think this is still not known anything. So, okay, this is a problem. So, I posed one problem in Barbados last year, I think. So, if you exclude cycles, induce cycles of prime length, then you have bounded chromatic number. So, well, the common theme in number theory is to push whatever you have. Theme in number theory is to push whatever you have for primes to prime powers. So, I thought, why not do that? So, if you exclude all prime power length cycles, then you get a class of graphs. Does it have bounded chromatic number? So, this should be easier than doing it for primes, hopefully. But, how do you control the length of cycles in your graph and primality? So, this is just a crazy problem I put there. Okay, that's myself. Can you go back to quite two problems? That's three. One forward. Problem 24. 24. So you're excluding PT and P5 complements a house, right? Yes. So I have a student who's currently working on that. Okay. Okay. I mean, you can partition into a bounded number of sets where each set is can be a disjoint union of cliques. That doesn't imply. Yeah, that would imply it's polynomial chi-band, I think. So I think we can do this. Okay. Okay, I think so. Okay. Anyway, all right, thanks. So Thanks. So, and is that, did you stop? Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? I have a question. Yes. It's more of a comment. I think you had a question about if you look at graphs whose complement have girth at least six, then the chi-bounding function you said was at most quadratic. You said was at most quadratic. And then you wondered if the exponent could be improved. Yes. And I think the exponent can be improved to three halves. Okay. There's work of Benny Sudikov on odd cycle complete Ramsey numbers and others as well. And it implies that if you have a graph with no five cycle on n vertices, it has to n vertices it has to have an independent set of size roughly n to the two-thirds up to a lower order term so there's some logarithmic factor but you get roughly n to the two-thirds and then that implies when you go to the complement that you get I think three halves one of the big open questions in that area for is the Ramsey number of a four cycle Of a four cycle versus a complete graph. And this is a famous question. And the big question is: is it quadratic or less than quadratic? And I think your question, if you replace six by five, it's probably equivalent to this, to this big this rather famous hard problem that people had worked on. Oh, so you're not excluding C5? C5? So, right. So, if you exclude C5, the answer, the exponent's not 2, but 1.5, roughly, up to some logarithmic factor is an upper bound. And if you exclude, if your girth is at least five instead of at least six here, then it's a big open question about Ramsey numbers. About Ramsey numbers or cycles versus complete graphs that this is equivalent to. And it's not known if the exponent is somewhere between three halves and two, and we don't know anywhere in between. And we're stuck with that problem for many decades. Okay. And for Ramsey numbers. All right. Thank you. Any more comments, questions? Questions. All right, I'm going to say clap in three seconds. One, two, three, clap. Thank you very much. Thank you.
