It's my pleasure to introduce Eric Finster from Cambridge University, who is going to talk about the Neopotens Tower. Yeah. Okay, yeah. So first of all, thanks. A big thanks to the organizers, Christine and Robin and Jeff, for inviting me to talk. What I'm going to speak about today is joint work with Matuan L, George Biederman, and Andrew Joyal. And we've had a kind of long-term project. of long-term project attempting to marry some of the i gotta keep my uh my tablet turned off uh marry some of the ideas uh coming from infinity topos theory with uh the ideas uh coming out of um goodly calculus of functors and um uh sorry just actually yeah um and so today's uh yeah is a sort of today's talk is a sort of report on This talk is a sort of report on some of that work. And I won't be constructing sort of tangent categories or Cartesian differential categories directly, but I hope the description I'm going to give of this picture that we've been developing will perhaps give some background motivation for some of the structures that people will be talking about soon. So, one caveat here is that everything I'm Everything I'm going to be working in this talk in the coherent world, in the homotopy theoretic world. So, I need to be talking about infinity categories instead of ordinary categories. And all co-limits and limits and stuff need to be their correct homotopy versions of these. And yeah, so I'm going to sort of proceed just under that general assumption. And I feel like most of what I say will be understandable just from the point of view of ordinary category theory. From the point of view of ordinary category theory. And I'll try to point out the points where there are some divergences. So the first thing I have to tell you is what is an infinity logos? And I'm about to shock a bunch of people because I'm going to call it an infinity logos instead of an infinity topos, which is the standard terminology. Standard terminology. But I'm going to explain this choice, this funny choice of terminology as I go along. And it's not completely arbitrary. It's important. So I'm just going to start with a definition and then we'll explore it a little bit. So an infinity logos. Infinity logos is a presentable infinity category which satisfies dissent. Okay, and so obviously just sticking down a bunch of words is not super helpful. So I'm going to try to give now some motivation for what these words mean. Motivation for what these words mean. So, in particular, E has all co-limits. And the word presentable basically means that E is generated under these co-limits by some small set of objects. So this is a sort of kind of size assumption that needs to run throughout the theory just to just to make it sort of work more smoothly. In fact, you can, in some sense, get away with dropping. Sense, get away with it, get away with dropping it, but the theory gets less nice. So, I'll just stick around that E is presentable, and that in particular means that it has all co-limits, so it's co-complete. So, E has, and now here I'm going to put in parentheses, finite limits. So, in fact, because E is presentable, it actually has all limits, but we're going to be focusing on functions which preserve the finite ones. So, what's going to be really essential in this theory is that E has finite limits. As finite limits. So we start off with basically some co-limits and limits. And once I have these, I can define what I mean by a descent principle. And what that means is the following. If I now look at my category E, E up, I have this functor to the category that I'm going to write S, which is the infinity category of spaces. So, in other words, So, in other words, topological spaces up to weak homotopy equivalents or consequential sets or any other model you'd like to choose for spaces or infinity groupoids is another way of expressing this idea in an algebraic way. So, I have this functor, which I'm going to write E slice, which associates to any object x, the slice category over x. Category over X. And well, so that would actually be a category. And actually, what I'm going to make sense makes sense is a category. But let me just do one thing, which is I'm going to forget the non-invertible morphism. So I'm just going to remember the underlying space inside of my category. So if I realize, for example, my theory of infinity categories as quasi-categories, I mean, take the maximal sub-sub complex. Or in other words, remember just the automorphisms and higher automorphisms and higher automorphisms. Higher automorphisms and higher automorphisms inherent in my category, and just regard that it's a space. And this is a contravariant functor because if I have a map to y, then this gets mapped to e over y. And because my category has finite limits, there's a pullback functor. I can pull back any map over y over x, and I can take the core here, and this will just give me a map of spaces. And so the definition is that E satisfied. Definition is that E satisfies descent if this functor preserves limits. And so just to unravel what that means concretely, so let me just pull the diagram again. So a limit in EOP is just, of course, a co-limit in E. So that's another way of saying. So that's another way of saying this is saying that if I have E and I slice it over the co-limit of some family of objects, the co-limit of some diagram indexed by a bunch of objects of E, then this is equivalent, well, as spaces, but also as categories. I'm sort of not going to worry too much about the difference, to the inverse limit of the slice categories over the components of I. Of i. And so let me unravel what that means. That basically means that in an infinity logos, we equip ourselves with a way of calculating with colimits, which is other than which is different from its universal property. So a way to get a handle for this is to is to think of the simple example consisting of pushouts. So I can take, if I take a pushout diagram and then I have the co-limit, which And then I have the co-limit, which is, oops, the co-limit is just, well, the homotopy push out of these guys. What this is saying is that if I have a map into the homotopy co-limits, that it decomposes as just a sequence of maps over the individual spaces. And then these maps need to be compatible in an appropriate sense. And the appropriate sense, since I used, since I used, let me Since I use the pullback functor, that means that the appropriate sense of compatible is that these maps are pullback diagrams. And the axiom of descent says that these two collections of data are equivalent to each other. So in other words, the sort of defining property of an infinity logos is that maps into a co-limit can be decomposed into compatible families. Decomposed into compatible families of maps over the components. And this is obviously, this is a very strong property because, well, obviously, co limits have a universal property which works in the other direction. And in a sense, this axiom is responsible for all the nice properties that NFI logos satisfy. It makes already the category. So let me just say an example. An example is the category of spaces. An example is the category of spaces itself satisfies this axiom, which is an important calculational tool already in homotopy theory, the category of spaces. And in fact, this is the category of spaces is in fact the initial for some for the choice of maps that I'm gonna give later. So spaces are an example of this. And this axiom is amazingly, a single axiom is enough to make essentially all enough to make essentially all other infinity logoi act very similar to the category of spaces. They're in a sense homotopy theories like the category of spaces. So in summary, just so what we have now is that an infinity logos is an infinity logos is a category which so So it has all co-limits, has finite limits, and satisfies the sense. And as I say, this is not an exhaustive list of its properties because it turns out that with the definition I've given, there are actually more. But these are the properties that I want to focus on today for the purposes of. For the purposes of what I'm going to be doing. So, the descent principle is the kind of strong interaction between co-limits, homotopy co-limits and homotopy limits. And a special case of the descent axiom is what goes by the name universality of co-limits, which says the following, which says that it. Which says the following, which says that if I have a diagram, a collimate diagram, and a map to y, and I pull this back along a map F, so here I can take the cross over y with the co-limit times I, that this is again a collimit. So in fact, this is equivalent to the co-limit over I of X sub R X. Of x subar x cross over y with each of the components. Okay, so this is this is a special case. Descent is actually stronger than this special case, but it but it's one particular example of something Descent gives you. It gives you the fact that collimits are stable, homotopy co-limits are stable along pullbacks. Okay? And so now, okay, so now we have a sort of basic idea of the characters in play when we're talking. The characters in play when we're talking about an infinity logos. And so now I want to sort of develop an analogy with cumulative algebra. And what we're going to do is compare the theory of logo in this sense with the category of commutative k-algebras. K algebras and we're going to in a sense try to try to push this analogy analogy as far as we can as far as we can go. So first of all, we have the zero and that corresponds since I have all co-limits I have an initial object. So the zero object of my k algebra that corresponds to the term the initial object. The units of my k algebra, that's going to correspond to the terminal object, which I'll write as just one. Object, which I'll write as just one, or maybe occasionally I'll write it as just a point or something like this. The addition of my k-algebra is going to correspond to the fact of having co-limits. So the co-limits are the sort of categorified version of addition in a sense. And the product is going to correspond to the finite limits. And the distributive law, which says that Which says that products distribute over sums, this corresponds to descent. And this is why I wrote out this axiom. Maybe I should write it the other way around. I wrote this axiom out above, because if you write this universality of co-limits, you can see this a little bit more clearly, that this is equivalent to the co-limit over here i. Order i of x cross y plus i. So, this is this universality, this special case is analogous to the distributive law, the axiom for the interaction between sums and products. And obviously, the initial k algebra is k itself, and the initial logos is the category of spaces. Category of spaces. Okay, so I want to develop this analogy a little bit more. And maybe what I'm going to do so that I'm going to use this orange line as the sort of dividing line between algebra. And that way I won't have to scroll back up to the top and keep going into this list. But I'm going to try to complete this list with some more entries. Okay, so let me give a definition. An algebraic morphism, which I'll oftentimes probably just say a morphism is a functor which preserves covenants and finite limits. And finite limits. Okay, so I just ask that the morphisms that I want to consider are just the morphisms preserving the structure that I've introduced so far. The descent property is a property, so that's fine. But when we think of a logos as a sort of algebraic structure with co-limits and limits playing the role of the algebraic operations, then we should ask. The algebraic operations, then we should ask that they preserve. So, this is the notion of morphism that I want to take. And we'll say, because it's going to be useful: is a reflection if it admits a fully faithful right adjunct. Okay. Okay, so the reflections are going to play an important role in what follows. So let me just continue our analogy here. So in the algae with k algebras, a homomorphism of k algebras is the analog of what I'm calling an algebraic function between logoi like this. logo like this. And of course, every such function, in fact, factors, because I can always quotient R by its kernel and then include into S. And in fact, this is also the case. I'm going to come back and explain what I mean by ideal in just a second. This is also the case for algebraic mortisms. I can always factor them as a phi, maybe sub R, where Where this is a reflection, it admits this fully faithful right adjoint, as I, as I, and the resulting, and the functor following it is conservative. In other words, it inverts nothing. It's just it sends all isomorphisms to, it preserves isomorphisms or whatever. Excuse me. If a function, if it sends an, it reflects isomorphisms, I guess is maybe the correct terminology. So this is the analog of this sort of. Is the analog of this sort of elementary factorization theorem from algebra is that we can factor every homomorphism in this sense by a reflection, which admits a fully papered radio joint followed by a conservative function. Okay, and now, oops. Okay, and so now I want to add the notion of an ideal. So associated. So associated to any homomorphism we can consider what I'm going to write IC Phi which is just the collection of maps in E which phi inverts. Is an isomorphism. And I'm saying isomorphism here, but sorry, maybe I should say equivalence if that helps people, because I'm sort of working in the infinity categorical sense where there's really sort of no difference between equivalence and isomorphism. Isomorphism is the correct word in an infinity category. Okay, so I can look at this collection of maps which are inverted by my morphism. And sort of what I claim is that this is playing the role. Is that this is playing the role of the ideal of my function, the role of its kernel? And so the difference here is that it may be somewhat surprising that i sub phi is not a collection of objects of phi, it's a collection of maps. But this is maybe less surprising when we think of an ideal as really the ideal in a ring is really sort of witnessing a collection of relations. It's saying that these elements in this idea are related, becoming. ideal are related, becoming related, forced to be equal to zero. So in that it just so happens that in an abelian group and a ring or something like this, those relations determine all of the relations that are being enforced. And so we can identify relations with elements of the ring itself. Whereas when we're working hieroglyphically, categorically in this sort of categorified world, we really need to remember all the relations that we're enforcing. And the analog of relation in this setting is forcing to Is forcing two objects to become isomorphic. So the kernel of a map like this is really the collection of maps that it inverts, and it records the collection of things that we force to become equal to each other in this categorified sense. Okay, and so we can add to our list an idea. So, oh, I wanted to say more things. So it's clear that I sub. That I sub V satisfies. Well, first of all, it obviously contains the isomorphisms, the equivalences, and it's closed under composition. This is just because phi is a functor, and so phi preserves all isomorphism and it preserves composition. Two is that it's closed under collimits. Under co-limits in the arrow category. And this is clear because if I have a diagram of maps in E, and all of them are sent by phi to an isomorphism, then since phi preserves co-limits, it's going to send this to the co-limit of a bunch of isomorphisms, which is an isomorphism. So this is also relatively straightforward from the topics of phi. And third, for exactly the same reason, it's closed under. Reason it's closed under finite limits. Okay, so a definition, a congruence on E is a class of maps satisfying these closure properties. These closure properties. Okay. And right. And so this sets up a kind of bijection where, or the analogy here is just kind of ideal compares to this notion that I've just described of cultural congruence. Okay, and if you give me a congruence, well, I'll leave it there for now. And so, right. Okay. Let me just say one more thing about the theory of ideals, which is that they do also satisfy a kind of closure property. So, and for that, I need to recall. And for that, I need to recall that we have the push-out product. So, this is a construction which comes up all the time in homotopy theory, and it goes as follows. If you give me two maps from X to Y and a map from A to B, then I can construct a new map out of them in this somewhat funny way, which is that I do the identity on A and then I use On the other hand, I can do f and stick with the identity, and I'll get a map pbx. And these both map pb cross y using the other term. And I can take the pushout right here and I get an induced map, which people call the pushout product or the Leibniz product of F and G. And let me just make some remarks about this. some remarks about this so remark is that is that uh the box product i'll sometimes refer to this as the box product or the push-out product um is uh absorbing uh for isomorphisms what i mean by that is if f is an isomorphism then uh f box g is an iso for for any g independently of g. Independently, this you can check very quickly from the diagram because the pushout will degenerate and the induced map will have to be an isomorphism. And so the corollary is that I sub phi, the congruence associated with a map, is an ideal for this box product. What I mean by that is that if I have a map, nice and phi, and g is any map in And G is any map in E, then this implies that F, the push-out product of these two maps, is again in I sub phi. And this is quite clear because phi, my morphisms preserve co-limits and finite limits. And this box product is just simply constructed out of a couple of co-limits and finite limits. So it's in fact preserved by any of these. By any of these morphisms of logi. And by assumption that f is in I sub phi, that means this map is an isomorphism. But by the fact that this is absorbing for isomorphisms, that means this composite map is an isomorphism. So the box product is contained inside. Right, so the product of these two things is again in isom. So this is another sense in which the congruence plays the role of an ideal. It really is an ideal in exactly. An ideal that really is an ideal in exactly the sense. You just have to get the correct product. And you might have expected the Cartesian product of two maps to appear here since I said the Cartesian product was somehow the limits were the analog of the multiplication. It just turns out that because the ideal doesn't consist of elements of E, but of maps in E, that the correct way to multiply relations is with this other product, this push-out product. Okay? Okay, um, okay, so we have uh so we have a sort of notion of uh we have an additive structure, a multiplicative structure, we have a notion of morphism which preserves that structure, we have a notion of ideal. And so let me make a definition. So if I and uh and j are two congruences, so two classes of mass in In E, then I sub box J is the smallest congruence which contains all pushout products of maps. Of maps in I and J. So, in other words, we'd like to say something like this is just the collection, the class of all products like this. But this in general won't be a congruence because it need not be closed under the various operations. But we can close it up and make it a congruence. And a lot of, I'm going to sweep some. And a lot of, I'm going to sweep some subtleties under the rug here, but a lot of the work, the difficult work in sort of the story I'm describing, is getting a handle on how to present these congruences in a nice way. And right. And right. And so you need some finiteness hypothesis. By the way, I meant to say one more thing, which is that just like in algebra, the collection of congruences. The collection of congruences. So let me be a little bit careful about the statement here. The congruences in E are sort of in bijective correspondence with the reflections which admit is fully faithful right attribute. By the way, let me just point out that what I'm writing is E mod I off. Writing is E mod I oftentimes goes in the literature by E, where I is the collection of maps inverse, because it turns out to be exactly the localization in the sense of Bausfield with respect to these maps. But I'm going to stick with my mod terminology here because I'm trying to enforce this analogy. And this is not, this is where we need, in order to make this statement strictly true, we need a small generation. We need some hypothesis and accessible on this side. So we need, On this side. So we need some set-theoretic hypothesis to make this kind of statement sort of strictly true. But it's morally true that the class is sort of determined. And the reason is, well, if I have a reflection, I get a congruence automatically by the proof that I just showed you. And if you give me a congruence in order to produce the actual reflection, the congruence actually already determines a subcategory. But in order for it to be reflective, you'll need to use the small object argument and sort of iteratively force the object. Of iteratively force the objects to be local with respect to these maps. And for that, you need some generation hypothesis. But sort of, morally speaking, this is sort of correct. And this corresponds to the correspondence between ideals and quotient maps. Okay. Right. So now I want to say, now I want to talk about presentations. Just very briefly, I'll introduce you a little bit. Let me say one more thing. Let me say one more thing before moving on to that topic, which is that I've been talking about infinity logoi, but in fact, as maps, and I've chosen the maps to go to be colliment and limit preserving maps like this. Most authors speak of the category of infinite toboi, and they take the maps to go in the other direction. And because of the analogy that I'm sort of developing here, I want to think. I want to think of this as sort of k algebras and maps from R to S. And the opposite category, so right, we have affine k schemes where the map goes now the other way between spec of S and spec of R. And similarly, here, there's kind of a notion of Similarly, here, there's kind of a notion of spec of F and the and spec of excuse me, spec of E. And so just like the analogy between, yeah, so on the left-hand side, we have our geometric objects. And in fact, people call the morphisms between infinity topoid geometric morphisms when they go in this direction. And on the right-hand side, we have our categories viewed as algebraic objects. Categories viewed as algebraic objects. And so this duality is the reason for the naming convention because there's something funny about naming the objects, which are very algebraic, as topoi, while the morphisms sort of go in the wrong direction. So we're sort of in the analogy, it becomes useful to distinguish between these two, even though they're essentially the same objects. The categories are just dual to each other. For the same reason, it's useful to distinguish between K algebras and affine K schemes when these two things are essentially the same thing. Two things are essentially the same thing. Okay, so that's that's the reason for this strange terminology. Okay, now I want to talk about presentations. Well, so the classical statement would go something like this: A category is an infinity logos, if and only if. An infinity logos, if and only if it's a category of pre-sheaves. So I'm going to use the brackets to note the functor category. If and only if there exists a small category C and a left exact reflection, so exactly one of these reflections I've talked about, which means that E is embedded fully, faithfully in some pre-shaped category. So this is a very classical description of a way of characterizing a sort of structure theorem for how Sort of structure theorem for how one arises at in the classical situation, uh, toboy, but I'm a few developed as Logoi. Um, so uh, and uh, sort of this phi here in the ordinary one categorical world, this phi, this reflection functor, is entirely encoded by some combinatorial data on C, which people call a grotique topology. Um, this uh This Grotendik topology, so this doesn't quite survive the higher setting in the sense that there are left-exact reflections of higher topoi and higher logoi. We're going to see some later on in this talk, which are not described by a grotend topology. Those that are, people refer to as topological, but that there are some that are not. So, a variant on this presentation is that actually we can do a little bit. Presentation is that actually we can do a little bit better. It's actually true that every infinity topos is embedded fully faithfully in the category of pre-sheaves on the free finite limit completion of a small category E. And so we'll have a phi and we'll have a fully faithful right adjoint. In other words, we can always suppose that C has had its Suppose that C has had its finite limit, C has finite limits, and we can even suppose that these finite limits have been added freely. And what's interesting about this, and what I want to argue is these are the analog of polynomial K algebras. So let me try and sketch a little bit why that's the case in this setting. Well, D embeds into its finite limit completion, and this then embeds via Yoneda. This then embeds via Yoneda into the pre-sheaf category on its finite limit completion. And let's just consider maps to any other, any arbitrary other logos. Well, if you give me such a fee, then precomposition determines a D diagram in E. But conversely, if you start with just a D diagram in E, then because E has finite limits, because Because E has finite limits, because it's a logos, this extends uniquely to the free finite limit completion of E. And in fact, because E has finite, it has all co-limits, this extends uniquely to the free co-limit completion of E. And that's just the category of pre-sheets with values and spaces. So, in other words, this is the analog of the, so I'm going to write this as S brackets. Bracket D. And I'm going to sort of develop, I'm going to come back to my universal property here and try to explain why this. So, this corresponds to if you give me A, a set of indeterminates, then I can create a K algebra, which is free on A. And how do I create this K algebra? And it's going to have the universal property that for any other K algebra. That for any other k-algebra, maps here are just maps of sets from A into R. And so, what we've just shown with this free, with this construction of the free topos is that algebraic homomorphisms are exactly the same thing as just maps now ordinary functors preserving no structure, the underlying collection is just the category, into E. So, this is the sense in which these free. These free topoi or free logoi, see, I did it again, it's hard to keep are the analog of polynomial algebra. They have exactly this universal property that a logos map out of them is the same thing as just an underlying diagram. And if you like even more, what is the definition of Ka? Well, it's functions from the free commutative model. Free commutative monoid generated by A into K. And of course, I need to say finite functions, but that's just because R in the world with K algebras only has finite addition. And so in order to have this universal property be true, I need to take only finite functions. So this is the analog of my definition of this category as the functor category from the free finite limit completion of D op. D up in into spaces. And here we don't need any finite finiteness condition. So freely adding limits is like freely adjoining a multiplicative structure to D. Okay. Oops. And so example. An example is the is we take D to just be a point. And then so to figure out what this is, the free What this is, the free finite limit completion of D. Well, that's just the opposite of the free finite co-limit completion of D or of the point. I'm going to say if I've taken D to be a point. But the free finite co-limit completion of a point is just the category of finite CW complexes because we're completing for homotopy co-limits. So this is. Be co-limits. So, this is just the category of finite spaces, which I'll just denote by in. And so, I have op here in my diagram. So, my formula for S adjoin, and when A, my commutative algebra just consists of a point, I'm just going to call this indeterminate X as the name for this topos. And concretely, it's functors on fin op op because pre-sheafs on the Because pre-sheafs on the lex completion. And so this just becomes the category of finite space, the diagram category of functors from finite spaces into spaces. So at minute 37, we've now arrived at the setting of Tom's talk this morning, considering finite area, functors determined by their values on finite spaces. And in this case, I'm taking their values in unpointed spaces because that's an interesting use of course. And this category, by what we've discussed, it has Category by what we've discussed, it has the following universal property. A morphism from this category is the same thing by what I just said, the point embeds in here. And a morphism is just a functor from the terminal category to E. In other words, it's just an object of E. So in other words, we call this is why we call SX the object classifier. Okay. And in fact, there's a very rich theory of toposis classifying various algebraic theories. This is the simplest example of an algebraic theory you can classify. You can classify the theory of just being an object. But there's a very rich theory of classifying topos, which I think Andre is maybe going to talk a little bit about later on, but I need this example for what I wanted to say. In particular, a similar construction. gives you the topos classifying a pointed object. So this turns out to be the category, it turns out that this is the category of pre-sheaves on finite pointed spaces. This category, this topos, or this logos, excuse me, I did it again, has the universal property that an algebraic morphism in this sense is the same thing as an object of E equipped with a global section. In other words, equipped. A global section, in other words, ecliptic with a map from the terminal objects. So, in the language of classifying toposis, this pre-sheaf category on finite pointed spaces, it's the classifier for pointed objects. A pointed object in any pointed object in any topos uniquely determines an algebraic morphism from this topos. Okay, and so now we can sort of get to the Get to the Goodwilly calculus pointed portion of the talk. And in Goodwilly calculus, we sort of start. Well, one place to start for the homotopy calculus is to start with this category of diagrams on finite pointed spaces. And in fact, this, I'm going to keep writing it as S box X. S box X. This admits a functor back down to just the category of spaces. And all I need to do by Spaces and all I need to do by what we've discussed is tell you a pointed space in the category of spaces. So I'll just pick the terminal object together with the identity map. And in fact, it's easy to check that the value of an arbitrary pre-sheaf under this functor is just f evaluated at the terminal object of. So as a functor, this is just the evaluation at the terminal point. So, and I'm going to call. So, and I'm going to call that P0. And so, associated to P0, we obtain a congruence. We obtain this congruence, which is the collection of maps inverted by this morphism. And in fact, it's fairly easy to work out what these maps are. They're just maps where functors are, where the functors take value, the same value at the base point. Those are the maps that will be inverted here. There's some maps that will be inverted here. And so the sort of theorem is that, well, what we can do now is we can look at this functor P0 and we can start taking, I said we have this product, this box product, which is a power of ideal. So we can now take this tokos. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say divide by the congruence P0, but take its box power square. zero but take its box power squared and um uh and this will give us uh uh we can localize the category of discongruence and this will give us a map of logoi down here and we can repeat this process in fact we can just take higher and higher powers of this uh um uh of this congruence and so the theorem is that Is that this category that I've just constructed? If I mod out by the identity of p0 n plus 1, is equivalent to the category of n excisive functions from finite pointed spaces to spaces. So it's in this sense that the analog of this k algebra, which has K algebra which has freely adjoins a nilpotent element this compares to this in my comparison this is this compares to this topos where I mod out by this object here in other words in analogy with with with algebraic geometry that I'm presenting here we can think of the topos of n excisive or the logos of n excissive functions excisive or the logos of n excisive functors as the ring of functions on a formal infinitesimal on a formal tangent vector um and um but um so generalization is that um nothing i've uh said here everything i've said here applies to an arbitrary uh to an arbitrary reflection if you give me any reflection phi Me any reflection phi, I can start taking powers under the push-out product of its ideals. And we call this the Nilkutmin's tower. And it exists for any, as I've sort of pointed out, for any of these homomorphisms of Mogo. It always exists. So this should maybe be dot dot dot. By the way, I should say that you get. You get the Goodwilly Tower. You recover the Goodwilly Tower. This is kind of implicit in what I'm saying. If you a particular function f in here, and you look at its image under all of these reflection maps, that is its reflection. That will be its Taylor tower. So the generalization is that, in fact, this works for arbitrary morphisms. And as an example, what we can take is, example, Michael Weiss developed this nice type. Michael Weiss developed this nice calculus where we start with this category J, which is the infinity category of finite dimensional inner product spaces. And he develops a Taylor Tower in this setting, and he's working in the pre-shaped category of J to spaces. And this functor has a canonical morphism back to spaces by just taking the co-limit. To spaces by just taking the co-limit. And so there's a nice lemma here, which is that viewed as an infinity category, this j is filtered. Infinity category. And that means that the co-limit functor will preserve finite limits. And of course, it preserves co-limits. So that means that this is actually an algebraic morphism in the sense that I've just described. And consequently, it determines. consequently uh it determines um it determines a tower uh going to s so because it determines we can take the uh j s and we can mod out by the congruence associated to the co-limit functor squared and we can continue in this way and and the theorem is that this is the orthogonal tower of vice Of vice. So, and the interesting thing about this is that, so, this idea of completing what I've sort of argued is a commutative ring-like object, it turns out that these powers of ideals generate a notion of excessiveness in an extremely nice way. Whereas the functors from J to S, which are defined to be n excessive by vice, for example, they're not expressed in terms of For example, they're not expressed in terms of a sort of co-limit, converting co-limits into limits kind of thing. And this is why these two calculi are not immediately in the same, put in the same standing. But viewing them this way from the theory of logo, they end up being the same. So I think I'll stop here. Thanks. I'm out of time. Yes, all Newton thank Eric Finster. So, there was no question left unanswered on the chat. So, if you have any question, please raise your hand and I will give you space. So, I believe there's a question from Joff. So, if you want to ask your question, please go ahead. Thank you. I actually have a couple, but I'll wait. But, do you have? Well, wait, but uh, do you happen to have an example offhand of an infinity topos which doesn't come from a localization out of growth and peak topology type thing? Right. So I was going to say that, which is that this tower, yeah, that's an excellent question. This entire Goodwillie Tower is of that form. These form. These localizations can't be described by Groton Deep topologies. Or maybe these localizations right here, I guess, are not. And in fact, this goes along, this is part of a more general fact that if B is topological, then this tower is Is constant. In other words, one category theory cannot see this tower at all. So, this is a kind of nice explanation for why ordinary one topos theory just doesn't have an analog of Kribbli calculus, because in fact, you can show that the natural analog is just always completely constant. So these localizations, these nth order localizations, they live entirely in the world, which is invisible to Groton Deek to Project. Which is invisible to Grotend topologies. Okay, thank you. It's kind of like requiring formal neighborhoods with formal schemes. That's exactly right. So in the analog with algebraic geometry, if we take our E and E mod i, this is sort of the quotient, and we take our E mod i, the n, if I dualize this picture, then e turns into spec of e, which is like a space, and this quotient map becomes a subspace. Space, and this subspace has higher-order neighborhoods. So, and they include into x, and the inverse limit is the full formal neighborhood of this thing. So, what this is saying is that the theory of one topoi is sort of essentially topological in the sense that it can't see this extra formal neighborhood structure, this extra geometric or differential structure. But the theory of high. But the theory of higher logoi does see it. It sees formal neighborhoods. Sub-spaces of higher topoi have formal neighborhoods. They have an associated geometry in a way which is not true in ordinary category theory. Thank you. That actually, yeah, yeah. All right, we have a question from Michael Ching. Michael, if you want to unmute yourself and ask the question, go ahead. To unmute yourself and ask the question, go ahead. Thanks. That's a lovely, lovely talk, Eric. So, I have a couple of questions, if you don't mind. So, one is, in your general nilpotence tower, if you take E to be some other category of functors from some small infinity category to an infinity topos or logos, do you get the power of excisive functors in the same way that you do? In the same way that you did here for functors from finite pointed spaces to spaces? In special cases. So if C has finite co-limits and a terminal object, and you choose the particular morphism, which is evaluation with that terminal object, then in this case, you can show that it corresponds. you can show that it corresponds that that you get excisive functors in the in the classical sense because because excessive functors make sense in this in this setting this is one of the reasons I wanted to give the analog of J exactly because that's not what happens for J in inner product spaces we don't have co-limits and so on so so it's not of this type but that's right if this restricts to the sort of natural definition when C has finite co-limits in a general object thank you Thanks. And just one quick other question then. What about the manifold calculus? Have you thought about how that fits into this picture? So the manifold and embedding calculus? Yeah. Yeah. So just yeah. So the short answer is that it doesn't. And there's actually a very strong reason for this. The manifold calculus is actually a sequence of topological localizations. So it's a well-changed. So it's a well-chosen sequence, a naturally chosen sequence of Grotendiek topologies, as far as I understand. I think I'm getting that right. And therefore, the tower doesn't arise from this construction exactly because of what I was saying before, that this particular tower is invisible to topological localizations. And there's a reflection of that fact in the following observation. Well, I can look at the, I'm not going to, I won't work it out. I'm just going to draw this in sort of quotes. I can look at the subquotients of. I can look at the subquotients of objects which are local for n plus one but lie in the ideal i sub n. And the general theory, the general theory of logos shows that this is always a stable category. So actually, to make that true, I need to take pointed objects in this. So in other words, the layers are provably stable in this setting. So this is really a homotopy theoretical setting. And I think this is not the case, if I understand correctly, for the embedded calculus. Case, if I understand correctly, for the embedded calculus. So that's another reason that it's um, that it's uh, that it's slightly incompatible. They're two slightly different settings. Great, thanks. We also have a question from Gerg Biedermann, if you want to unmute. It's not a question. He just made the remark. I mean, I just wanted to tell you that you could mention maybe that each of our towers comes equipped with a blakers.
