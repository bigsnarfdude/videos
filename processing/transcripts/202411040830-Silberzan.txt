We'll talk about active active cells, population of active cells. And I'll show you a few examples of what I mean by that. Being the first speaker, I thought I would try to go a bit slowly on the vocabulary and definitions. So that wouldn't have to be. Okay, yeah, that's good. So here, in this audience, I don't have to emphasize the common trends that you can. Common trends that you can have between these different examples of collective behaviors from fish or birds or cells. You sort of recognize with your eye visually the same sort of collective migration of the individuals in the population with differences, of course. But the way we tackle these problems are basically the same. We don't go into the model. We don't go into the molecular details of the cells or the muscle and fins and details of the fish or birds. We try to have a coarse-grained approach of all these problems. So the concepts are similar, actually. And you can see that if you plate self, so this is a very easy experiment. You take fabroblasts in culture, you plate them on the plate, and you look, you just watch them. And what you realize very quickly, and that you Very quickly, and that you know, almost any biologist would know. And we discovered it, we rediscovered it, is that the cells tend to align together. No, here it is. Okay. The cells are elongated to start with, as you can appreciate here, and they tend to align together and form domains where they reach almost a perfect alignment together. And you can see that here. So, of course, you know, with physicists' eyes, this is an textbook example of a nematic phase. And indeed, within these domains, here or there, this is just a close-up, the cells are almost perfectly aligned together. They make very, very well-aligned phases. And the color that you have here on this. And the color that you have here on this graph, so this is a huge field of view, which, unfortunately, yes, this is the same bar that here. So, you know, these things here, they're almost a millimeter size. So they're huge, right? They're very large in front of a cell size. And the color codes for their orientation, you can see uniform green mean that they're all aligned in the same direction here. And so you have several of these domains, so this patchwork of Of these domains, so this patchwork of domains make this particular organization. But you can go from one domain if you look closely here. Here you're oriented in that direction and here in this direction, and you can go continuously from one domain to the other. Okay, you have no real frontier here, no hard frontier. Of course, you have to change orientation, but that happened over a relatively wide. But that happened over a relatively wide area. But what you cannot avoid then is to have these singularities here. And in this, by singularity, I mean that these are locations, points where you cannot define the order. There is no order there. Right? And it's very obvious here, there, and there, and even aesthetically easier to see here, that you have three types of these defects, three types of single, two types. Defect three types of singularities, two types of singularities that are either with this orientation, this configuration, that's the comet-like defect, or this one, the triangular-like defect, and only these two. And having only these two defects mean that we indeed deal with a nematic phase, but not any nematic phase because you see the cells moving by themselves, they migrate. Moving by themselves, they migrate, they align, they interact. And these defects are very different in their nature. This is a comet-like that you recognize this one here. You see that the flows that are color-coded and represented by the arrows, these are the velocity field, are much stronger in this defect than in this defect. And that's logical in a way because here. A way because here there is a threefold symmetry, the defects are nowhere to go, really. Whereas here, the symmetry is broken, and defects would, you can imagine, would go that way or that way. That's something we don't know a priori, but they can move. And indeed, there are the locus of very strong velocity field here, which are absent there. And if we track the effect, well, that indeed self-propel, whereas Self-propell, whereas these ones don't move, they remain more or less at the same place. The direction they take for this example of fibroblast would be in that direction, they're propelled tail up, if you want, tail first, and that's the signature of a contractile behavior, which is logical for cells. But okay. Okay, so now we've put the landscape together, and the question would become: can we avoid these defects altogether? We can, you know, we've shown that they're intrinsic to the organization of the cells when there are no boundaries. But can we play with some parameter, external parameters, to remove all the defects from the population? The first answer would be we have to do something. We need to impose and We need to impose a particular environment to the cell for that. And the logical environment that we can use is to make boundaries into these populations. Because the cells spontaneously align with a boundary. So in this image, what is reddish here is an area that we've treated so that the cell don't go there, they avoid it, and they grow very well on the green area, and they align at the boundary. At the boundary. And so, if we make now this kind of design where we have stripes, tracks of a certain width, oops. Not very good with this. Here it is. Right? They will align with it at the boundaries, and then the order propagates toward the center. And what happens is you end up with is you end up with a perfectly oriented monolayer. Okay, in that direction. Of course, if you're too wide, by too wide, I mean wider than the correlation length and the typical size of the domain that we had before. If we wider than that, then you back to the infinite case and you have defect again, etc. But if you remain within, you know, in a pretty large range already, you know, in a pretty large range already, below, let's say, 400, 500 microns, then you don't have defects. You avoid them altogether. But then another question, then you end up with a configuration where everyone is aligned here. And so that's exactly what you would expect. That's just the same, the close-up of that. How can, that's a typical configuration of a passive pneumatic phase. So, why would an active nematic population behave eventually? I mean, it's a disappointment, disappointing. You would expect stuff, right? Characteristic behaviors, and we don't have that here. So there are still many questions in that direction, but the idea that in this for these cells, and that won't be the case for all the examples I'm going to show you. Examples I'm going to show you. Cells slow down gradually. They said they are said to jam in their behavior. And this jamming corresponds to a decrease in activity, an effective decrease in activity. So that creates the defect, that create the domains, because even though the cell would like to align together and expel all the domains from the population, they cannot do that because they slow down dramatically. They slow down drastically with time, and at some point they just can't do anything. You know, they would align, but they can't because of that. And that's precisely what we have here. We enter the jamming phase. So we want to see examples where we avoid that. And we work with other cell types. These are not fibroblasts. They're myoblasts or retinal epithelial cells. And these cells, I'm going to be a bit fast here because this is already somewhat. This is already somewhat older work. If you play these cells in the same tracks as what I showed you before with the fibroblast, they don't align with the track direction anymore. These cells will make an angle that you can see here. And here, and here it's even easier to see. They make spontaneously an angle. So that becomes interesting. You put cells in a track. You put cells in a track, you don't do anything, and by themselves, they will take a certain direction. And not only that, but they will describe this angle profile. So the angle at the center is different from the angle at the edge. At the edge, it's close to 90 degrees. 90 degrees is vertical in this representation. Not quite, but closer to this value. But in the center, it can go down to values up to or down to. Values up to or down to 50 degrees, 45 degrees. So it can be rather dramatic. I'll show you an example later. And you can see this in the histograms. These are two cell types that we think are more active. And these are the fibroblasts I showed you before. And this one just aligned with the truth. Okay. What about the dynamics? Well, the dynamics, we just took movies of the same cell. Just took movies of the same cell. These are myoblasts, no RP1, I think, on a very wide track. And you can see the angle here. It's very, very clear. So you have a dramatic angle in the center, and you have this particular profile of orientation that make an S shape here. But if you look more closely to the dynamics now, not only the orientation, I'm sure you can see that cells tend to go up here. See that cell tend to go up here and down there. Can you see it? Okay. All right. So, on top of the spontaneous tilt, you have a spontaneous shear. Cell will shear spontaneously with this flow up here and down there. So, we can map that, we can quantify it and measure it. And what we find And what we find is that it actually describes a profile that you have here and that you can see here. So there is a very definite shear and a very definite angle and we were interested, why would active cell do that? Why would active material do that? And for that, we went back to an old publication, rather old now, of you know, one of the first on active pneumatics, and that was designed. Active pneumatics, and that was designed to work on actomyosin gel. But actually, you know, from an experimentalist perspective, it's exactly the same. And what these guys predicted at that time was that you would have a tilt here that would progressively go from 90 degrees to some angle and back across the stripe, and a shear flow associated with. And the shear flow associated with it. And the reason for that is that for active material, active pneumatic, the gradient of orientation produce flows that reinforce this gradient of orientation. And so there's an instability here if you wide enough so that you can have this kind of solution that are more stable than the solution where everyone is aligned in the straight direction. In the stripe direction, solution that still exists, but is not stable. Except if you go to very narrow stripes. If you go to very narrow stripes, then the effect of the boundaries become dominant. And then you supposedly, in theory, you should align everyone with the stripe. And so not only they were describing what we were seeing, but they predicted that if we take very thin stripes, If we take very thin stripes, we should see an alignment and no flow. Okay, because we would cross this transition. Okay, that was in the original paper. And indeed, we used, I'm making a long story short, we use very thin stripes. Here it's 50 degrees, 40 microns. You still have fluctuations. The angle is not like 90 degrees and no shear at zero, nobody moves. Nobody moves. You have a lot of fluctuations. You can reach very, very high velocities, but in average, everything falls down to zero. You align with a stripe and you have no flow. And indeed, this describes a transition. You have a transition at, this is the width, this is the velocity, the shear velocity, this is the angle at center. And what you have is really a transition at some value around 50 microns where you Around 50 microns, where you begin to have a certain shear and a certain orientation. The theory would predict this slow for. I mean, I'm not pretending we're seeing that. The interesting thing is that for those of you who are used to liquid crystals and liquid crystal theory, it's really like the Frederick's transition. It's really like a transition induced by a field acting on these molecules. Except that the field here, there is no external field. There is no external field. The field is the activity of the cell themselves. What about the biology of these things? Interestingly enough, this is a movie I took from Peter Frido. What is his name? Here, Peter Frideau. And what he does, he studies cells by in vivo imaging cells that come out from a tumor. Tumor would be around here when I show you the movie. Here, when I show you the movie, and that circulates in the stroma in between nerves. I mean, it's confined because you have nerves, muscles, vessels, a lot of things. It's very busy. And when they do that, they exit the tumor which is here and invade the stroma, which is there. Just the linear aspect is for technical reasons. So the sound collection. Reasons. So the cells collectively migrate away from the tumor in this confined environment. Now, if you look more closely, I think it's around here. And I have to do that manually. Oh, here it is. You see cells going to the right, cells going to the left. So you have something that looks like a shear. Maybe. I mean, no. Maybe. I mean, no, it looks like a shear, that's sure. Whether it's similar to what we have in our in vitro experiment, I can't be completely affirmative, but it really looks like it. There is no reason why the cell would go back, right? So that's the motivation we have for this project here. Now, I'm going to switch gears here and take cells that don't jam. I told you that, you know, if you wait long enough, cells will jam, they don't move. Long enough, the cells would jam, they don't move much anymore. The defects are frozen, everything gets frozen, and that's it. The cell I'm going to study here don't do that. They are mostly myoblast and they make multi-layers. And the motivation comes from early studies in the 70s by Thomas Derr. He studied primary fibroblasts, not the one I showed you, primary fibroblasts, and realized that they would make 3D. 3D mounts in the monolayer on top of the monolayers. And strangely enough, that these mounts here, here, the nuclei have been labeled. The nuclei would show that the cell organized perpendicular one to the other from the first layer to the second layer. And so that's very interesting. And we spend a lot of time trying to understand why they would do that and how they can do that. And so that's. They do that, and so that's what I'm going to show you now. That's the nuclei are labeled here, and you can see that very clearly. Call this a crisscross organization. Crisscross is everywhere in muscles, right? So in organisms like the hydra, you have two layers of muscle-like cells that are organized perpendicular one to the other. You have this around big arteries around... Big arteries around the intestine, even the tissues like the tongue is full of systems where you have this crisscross orientation just because it makes a lot of movement easier to deal with. And it's an inspiration for people doing robotics, by the way, because with two systems that are complementary, you can do a lot of movement. These are called Adrostats. Adrostats. Anyway, we tried with our myoblast and we got the same thing. So these are the cells we're going to describe now. You've got this crisscross orientation very clear here and on the actin network it's very clear as well. Okay, so we have this crisscross organization between the two first layers and we only study the onset of multilayering, the two first layers, the bilayer we have. From experience, we know that defects, the defects I was talking about in the first place, were very important for extrusion of cells, for formation of mounds, disordered mounds, for formation of bacterial multilayers. So we were interested in looking at the defects, see if there was any interest in this particular study. And we took a lot of images of defects, a lot of images of the associated velocity. Images of the associated velocity field, and what we found was these are only simple that the defect behaves as defect and don't show anything particular. You can see the orientation field in black, you can see the velocity field in colors, color coded for the velocity itself, and you have the two vertices that you expect here for a contractile active pneumatic, pretty much the same thing that I showed you before. So, nothing really interesting there. Well, actually, there Actually, there is. What Trinish did, the student involved in this study, was to monitor all the defects of the monolayer in the field of view that he had. And then he realized that the number of defects would decrease, which is expected, because cell would interact with the other, and minus one half defect would interact with plus one half defect, and that makes them disappear and dihilate, except. Except at the end, before we reach the time at which they will make two layers, some defects will remain there and not annihilate with the others. And interestingly enough, these defects here are different from the other in the sense that they are slower, much slower, they almost don't move, whereas the others here are just defects that self-propel as you would expect. Defect that self-propel, as you would expect. And these immobile defects are the ones giving rise to bilayers. Okay, so we have two populations of defects that seem to be different, and yet there is no jamming. Remember that. So the cell are still very active. The defect don't move, but the cells do. I'll show you that in a minute. Here it is. Okay, so the defect doesn't move, but the cells are very active. If I labeled only 10% of the cells, so you can see. Of the cells. So you can see them, otherwise, everything would be fluorescent. So you can see the cell describing, I mean, the moving around as what cells do. They don't jam, but the defect itself, the core, doesn't move. Okay, I come back. So that's another question. We started with one question. We have two now. But I'll show you what happened in the next part. So if we take all the effects that the images show you before, we have the standard image of effects of plus 100. Of defects, of plus one half defect, but if you focus on the stationary defect, the story is completely different because the stationary they cannot self-propel, they cannot develop this pair of vertices that self-propel them. And what happened is actually in this area, the core is here, in this area, there is almost no velocity. So the cell would just move from here to there and stay there, you know, to a certain point because you cannot do. Certain points because you cannot do that forever, of course. You have some limits. So, this is a schematic of the defect: the tail region, the head region. For standard defects, the velocity is more or less symmetric between the head and tail. All right. But for the stationary defect, it's completely asymmetric. It falls down to zero very quickly. You have almost zero velocity here. And so, meaning that. Here. And so, meaning that the cell pile up on the head and don't exit at the tail. And indeed, of course, there is a density gradient between the head and the tail. So pile up there and there is a source, but no sink in a way. And of course, again, that cannot last forever. And we see how the system solves its conundrum. That's our defect. That's our defect. Okay, so the imaging is not very good. I have another image on Active Network just after that, but the images are hard to take. It's not that it's, you know, there's a reason for the quality. It is very difficult to go between two layers. And that's the reason why. Okay, so cells move around quite a lot. And here you see. And here you see more of them. So, indeed, they pile up here and they don't exit because the defect doesn't move at all. And so, when the pressure here, what I call pressure, when the density here becomes too high, this is what happened. You can see that the cell move from this region to that region and invade it. And invade it. So, but the thing is, the important thing, if you can see it, is that they would migrate, keeping the memory of their orientation. You reproduce in 3D the organization you have in 2D. So you start with a crisscross organization in a defect laterally that translates into a crisscross organization between the two first layers. First, layers. This is another movie that shows it maybe more clearly. This is the actin actin in the first layer, actin on second layer. And you can see the cells progressing on the tail of the defect from the head and keeping their organization in that direction. Okay? Which brings actually another question. Actually, another question. Look at the cyan cell here. That's exactly what I described. The cell starts from the head, right? It's oriented in that direction. And then it progresses on top of the tail, but it keeps its orientation. So this explains the crisscross organization, of course. That's the solution to what we were wondering. How can you get a crisscross organization between two layers? That's because they keep. Between two layers, that's because they keep this memory of the organization they had initially and transfer it in 2D in 3D. But how they can migrate, keeping this orientation here, that's really something I don't understand. We need people like Sasha here to explain that to us because there is no lamellipodium, no, no, no, nothing, nothing compared to what you would expect for cell migrating. Okay, the other interesting Other interesting thing is that these cells don't adhere really one to the other. And so, how can they keep collective if they don't adhere? And of course, we spend a lot of time trying to understand how they would do that, why they would feel the orientation of the cells below, etc. And of course, as soon as we begin to interact more closely with certain biologies, they told us, you know, these cells, they don't live like this, especially myoblasts, they produce. Especially myoblasts that produce a lot of extracellular metrics, a lot of stuff. And extracellular metrics is really, you know, what we call the dark matter of biology. It's everywhere and nobody cares. Well, dark matter, actually, a lot of people care. But it's very important. And it's important in that case, in particular, because that provides another source of memory, because cells tend to follow the orientation of the extra. The orientation of the extracellular matrix and they tend to produce it within their orientation. So you can see you have a lot of extracellular metrics everywhere. And if you put collagenous that destroys it, you kill the effect I just showed you. I'm going a bit fast here. And now we can sort of begin to understand what happened with immobile, having immobile defects with active cells. Remember, that was something we didn't completely get. didn't completely get what we did here is we took the whole sequence and we colored it with this color code that at the time when they bilayer and at the time okay so time when they bilayer minus 10 hours and that gives this product here where you see the cells moving along the trajectories that describe a plus one health defect. The cell themselves are not frozen. Frozen in the plus one half defect, they move around, but the trajectories describe this plus one half defect. So that's another source of memory. I was talking about memory of the defect going from 2D to 3D. Here we have a memory of the trajectories that is triggered by this secretion of the extracellular matrix and the fact that the cell navigates along this extracellular matrix. So if the cell does this, it leaves extracellular matrix proponectin behind it that is. Matrix from an actin behind it that is felt by the next cell that goes in the same way and releases some extracellular matrix. And so this is amplified. And that's why we have an immobile defect, even though the cells are very motile. So we solve quite a bit of a number of problems here. Let me just finish on that part. How much time do I have? Do I still have five minutes? Okay, good. By enforcing again. By emphasizing again the difficulty of this experiment, not because I want your, you know, any kind of judgment here, but because it is hard, we have relatively low statistics here. And you can see the imaging was difficult. And that's due to the fact that you have many defects, but you never know which one will give rise to a bilayer. So we have to take a lot, a lot of images, and Paul Trinish was doing that. That was hard. What we figured is that can we do That can we do artificial structure mimicking this? And by mimicking, I mean we're trying to be smarter than this. And the way we do it is that we said, okay, why don't we take this defect and just stretch it in a way? We don't really care that there are a single core. If we do this thing here, we have the conflict of orientation, and that conflict of orientation is what we need for crisscross. If we write, so we make these structures. Typically, they're a few microns wide and a couple of microns high. Okay. And that's the new structure we put the cells on. And now, if we look at what happened, you're going to see here. So here they're oriented that way, here they're oriented that way, and that the wave of the second, you could see that? That show it again. You see the wave that the cell moving, keeping their orientation again. So we have to understand how this cases work. And so now we have a lot of, we can accumulate a lot of data and try to understand a bit better the mechanism that brings cells from this region to that region perpendicularly. That's exactly what you have here. Okay, I'm going to skip this. Let's skip the same design because here you realize that we impose to the cell a pattern that is smaller than the cell size. It's in total contrast with what I showed at the beginning, where cells were confined in tracts that were much bigger, much larger than the cell size. So this notion of scale is very important here. Of scale is very important here. So we wondered then: can we learn something by culturing cells on this array of topographical rails on the surface? And for that, we took another cell type. We took Ashbeck monolayers. These cells are very disordered. You see, they migrate like crazy. They make this a lot of swills. They're completely disordered. These cells do jam eventually. As you can see, they even show, you know, turbulence to a certain point, but that's not my point here. What happened if we put them on an anisotropic system of micro rails? Again, rails that are smaller than the cell size. So you have a cell here or here, and it goes above one, two, or three of these patterns. Okay. Okay, and so what you will see is on the left an unpatterned substrate, on the right a patterned substrate with these. So, yeah, maybe I'm too fast here. If I put single cells here, they will migrate in that direction and they will elongate probably in that direction too. And that's called contact guidance that has been studied for years and decades, maybe more. This is very well known. But there are not that many studies. There are not that many studies tackling this problem with populations. So that's what we did here actually. We used contact guidance on the population of cells. And now I can show you the movie. So here, if you look on the left, that's what I showed you before, very disordered swirls, etc. And if you look on the right, do you see these impressive lanes of cells moving in the same direction? So you really. Really produce lanes, showing this in color, that move in different directions, anti-parallel lanes where cells move in the same direction. If I measure the velocity of the cells, you see that the first thing you see is that everything becomes paler and paler with time. That's the jamming coming in. Now, if you look at the beginning of the movie here, you have Movie here, you have many lines. Each color, blue or red, are just the velocity in the line. Colors are very uniform, meaning that in one lane, cell move all at the same velocity. And the lane coarsen with time. You start with many of them, and you end up with a relatively small number. I'll show you that again. Here it is. Okay, so that's exactly what I just described. That's exactly what I just described. Look at the scales again. 510 microns. Here we're looking at several millimeter size, centimeters, even in one direction. Okay, same thing. Either you go at plus V or minus V, red or blue. And in between these domains, so that's a close-up. In between these domains, the velocity goes from once from minus v to plus v in less than a second. To plus v in less than the cell side, so you have an enormous, enormous shear between these two anti-parallel lanes, and that's probably the reason why there's coarsening, because there's a cost associated with this shear. The main effect here is polarity. So, I won't go into the details. If we kill activity with blevistatin, we calm down everything, velocity can be. Down everything, velocity can differ a bit, but we keep the pattern of lanes. Whereas, if we kill polarity with this drug here, we kill everything. So the cell are polar, they migrate in a polar way. And we ask and worked with Carlos Blanche-Marcader on the model to describe this particular situation. Here is the only way the activity is plugged in. Activity is plugged in, that's active contractile forces. We have an anisotropy of the friction. It's harder to go perpendicular to the rails than along the rails. And we have a coupling between velocity and polarity, a term that becomes more and more, I mean, that is realized to be, that is more and more realized to be important in the description of this behavior. And Carles did. Carlos did a linear analysis of this. He found several patterns that are very similar to what we have. And in particular, he predicted that there was no periodicity in the pattern of lanes. See, no peak here. And so we looked at that, and indeed, we find also a pattern which is non-periodic. To make again a long story short, I don't want to take too much time. I don't want to take too much time on that. We collaborated on the same ingredient with Bart Smith in Leuven, and Bart just used the same equation as Carlos did, basically, to make simulations of self. And basically, these are the experimental results. These are the results from the simulations, and the agreement is just very good. You can by playing on. You can by playing on the five examples you have in each case are the intensity of the anisotropic friction or, which is the equivalent in the experimental case, the depths of the rails. So we can go from zero depths, which is a flat surface, to high enough depths, which triggers the strongest phenotype. The stronger phenotype. Okay, I'll end up here. I want to thank the group who did that: Mathilde, Trinish, who I'm forgetting, Victor, who isn't in the picture, Bart, Caroline, and Shang, and our friend theoreticians. And I thank you very much for your attention.
