And yeah. So today I will talk about the deep learning in power breast cancer radiogenomics for precision medicine. So here are my outline. So first I will give the basic introduction about the radiogenomics and then I will discuss a little bit major challenging to do this type of research. And then I will discuss two projects. One is one the data is single genomic. It is a single genomics and the data is matched data. And then the major focus will discuss about our work on the to analyze the microomics and the data is unpaired or unmerged. So this work is mainly finished by my two graduate students, Chen Liu and Zhong Yunjun. So let's first go for a little bit later genomics. With the lady genomics. So basically, lady genomics mainly involves these two pieces of data. The first one is the imaging, and then the second piece of information is this type of omics data, and then it's clinical data. So for the medical imaging, as we all know, this can be obtained real time, and this is also now inversal. So traditionally, So traditionally, we can use the semi-automatic approach to each other this type of medical feature or called the radiomic feature. So for example, we can get this type of shape and the size based on the feature and this type of texture type of feature, so on and so forth. For the omics data, so depend on Data, so depend on what type of level we are measuring. For example, if we're measuring at the RNA, we can get the gene expression data and the proteoic data and the microRNA and also the genetic data. Okay, so to answer some of the clinical question, for example, to identify biomarker or stratify the patient into the different group, we can either use this type of multi-ormost. Type of multi-omics data or use the imaging data. If we try to integrate this different type of data together to answer this type of clinical question, and then this is basically called radiogenomics. So there are some major challenges to do this type of radiogenomic research. The first one is the data heterogeneity. For example, For example, for the medical imaging, they may be merged at the different temporal or maybe use a different machine, a different type of machine. For the omics data, as we just discussed, this can be merged at the RNA level, protein level, or DNA level, or even the isolation level. Okay. Another major challenge is unpaired data issue. The data issue as we just mentioned. So, for the data genomic research, we may need to evolve the medical imaging, genomic data, and clinical data. But in reality, in the majority case, we may only have one or two types of this type of data. So we cannot really perform this type of radiogenomic research. Okay. And then another thing is to model it. It's to modeling this type of data. So there are lots of approaches, for example, for the medical imaging, using the traditional this type of semi-automatical approach to check the tumor shape, size, and so on. So basically, the human need to be intensively evolved, then this type of feature basically is subjective and also less informative. Less informative. Okay. Definitely, we can also use the deep learning type of approach to inject the feature, but the interpretability is an issue. So here, first I will briefly discuss the simple case. So basically, use the single genomic data and the data is paired. So basically, here, the pair means in a given It means in a given study, we have the medical imaging and also the genomic data and also the clinical information. Okay, so on top here, so for example, given a medical imaging, I use the traditional approach to eject the medical imaging. So basically, first we need to load the imaging in the workstation, and then the radiologists then need to settle in the human region, and then The tumor region, and then we will extract the medical feature as the image feature from the second region, okay, such as the shape and the size, this type of feature. So, this type of procedure is time consuming, and then the feature is subjective and is a shadow feature. Of course, we can use the deep learning kind of approach to check the feature, then this is the first and maybe it's objective. Objective, uh, there are a lot of hidden information from this type of feature. Okay, so uh, after we check the feature, and then we can do either do the association with the genomic data or to predict the clinical occurrence. So, here is the example, we use the data from the TCGA and the TCIA for the breast cancer. So, from the clinical data, this is different clinical characteristic. A clinical characteristic, and then this is just the gene suppression data use the RNA-seq data, and then this is the MRI imaging, and then merged as a different tempo and use a different machine. So, basically, this is the number of patients, and if we unify them, it's a long 110 patient. So, this is for the single genomic data, just the gene special data, and the genesis is. Suppression data, and then this is matched case. We have the clinical data, key suppression data, and also the medical imaging. So, to first, we will use the deep learning approach to each the medical feature. So, here we use the approach called the denoise order encoder. So, before we go to the denoise order encoder, first we discuss a little about order encoder. So, basically, order encoder is the first thing. order encoder is the first example this is our input data imaging and then generally this type of hidden ray using the hidden feature we can construct the input data so this is called the auto encoder but then this type of approach maybe the limitation uh maybe uh sensitive to the noise so this is the kind of the denoised order encoder so for denoised order encoder basically for the input that this type of node we land The this type of node, we land any signs and noise, and then use this type of noise data. We generate the hidden feature, and then we can reconstruct the input data again. So, this type of hidden feature, maybe it's more robust. Okay, so we use a denoise order encoder to generate this type of imaging feature. So, this is some parameters. So, basically, this in each box is a kernel. This in each box is a kernel, and then the size is 32 by 16. This is the input, and this is the output. So we use this 16 kernel, and the size is 16 by 16. This generates more than 4,000 imaging features. I use the denoise or the encoder. So for this type of imaging feature or quantum radiomic feature, so basically then it presents. Then represent a lot of rich information. For example, for the feature in this candle, then this maybe shows the blast age, as you can see here, this type of feature in this candle. But the feature in this type of kernel, this shows the tumor region, okay, the tumor-related information. So as you can see here, the feature in the different kernel, they show the different type of Different types of about the organ or the tumor-related information. So, after you check the feature, basically we do the association with the genomic feature. So, here our genomic feature, basically, we check some, we include three level type of genomic feature. The first one, the sixth is the commercialized gene signature. This gene signature represents The signature can, for example, predict the prognosis, predict the drug response, and predict the disease recovery, this type of commercialized signature. Another is the 288 misk gene. This is to be curated from these two publications. And then we also examine the cake pathway. Okay, so we use this linear mixture model as a reason-wise. Mixture model as the reason why we use this is because each patient has many of the imaging. So basically, we put each patient as a group, okay, and then this is the image level at the y. This is the radio feature, and then this is a genomic level feature. Okay, so this is the first analysis we do the association between the ladiomic feature and the genomic feature. So here's So here's a result. The first one, we look at the association with the commercialized gene signature. So this is the sixth gene signature we have. As you can see here, this is the clinical meaning for the different gene signature. So as you can see here, we show there are two gene signatures as show here. Then us has a significant associate with a lot of this type of A lot of this type of radiomic feature generated by this type of denoise or the encoder. And then all these show in this type of kernel, as I just mentioned, represents the tumor region or maybe the tissue close to the tumor region. At the same, we also get the association with this type of basic gene. And as you can see here, there are lots of gene. See here that lots of gene had a significant social association with this type of feature. Again, most of these features show from this tumor kernel liter. This is the result for the K pathway. We also observed the similar pattern from the dialogue of association. So this is for the association. Uh, for the association between the radionic feature and the genomic feature. Now, let's examine the association between the uh this type of radiomic feature and to predict the clinical outcome. So, here we use the LASO model and then as you can see here, use this type of ROC and AUC. So, basically, this is the AUC value, and then this is a different number of the lambda feature. lambda feature this different number different number of features given the lambda as you can see shows a very good performance to predict the clinical outcome so this is the first part the data you just a single genomics and then the we have the imaging data and also the genomic data and the clinical data and we also Clinical data. And we also examine whether they have some type of interpretability, for example, whether they are associated with the gene signature or risk gene or the password. But there are still the issues we didn't handle is heterogeneity, for example, the imaging from the different time points, and then there are also multiple points data. So here we propose this strategy. We propose this strategy to solve this issue. So, this includes a few steps. The first step, we try to develop the model to model this type of imaging from the multiple time point. Okay, so and then to interact with the medical feature. And then the second thing is we are trying to model or integrate this type of multi-omics data. Or mixed data. Okay. And then the third thing is for this data set, is basically as I just mentioned, we only have the 61 patients which have the all three pieces of data. For example, the gene suppression, the microorganism data, and the image data, and the clinical data. But for the majority of patients in the PCGA, so basically they don't have the medical image data or don't have all this omics data. And then in this way, we And then, in this way, we need to develop the strategy to predict the medical energy. Okay, so this is here I will introduce the two strategy. And then the final step, we want you to have some mechanics to understand a little bit the mechanism, okay, use of this type, perform this type of mediation analysis. So, this is the ongoing work. So, let's first look at the data. So let's first look at the data I just mentioned to you. So basically here is part of the data I just mentioned because here we need to use the button on this data. Okay. And then the medical imaging, we also need to focus on data have the segmentation label. And then in this case, it's basically we only have the 61 this has the label and then this is also the date sample without the medical unit. Without the medical imaging. Okay. So to integrate the medical imaging from this particle time point, so basically we use the 3D unit architecture to eject the radio orbit feature. So for this one, so this is the sun, the parameter we set up. Some the parameter we set up. So, this is 80 basically the 810 point, and then this is the volume. So, based on 8 volume, this is size 3d. Okay. And then this is the feature size. And then this is output. Okay. So we did the checking and test. So as I just mentioned, we have the total 51 patient with the label, segmentation label. So basically, we use the 51. So basically, we use the 51 as a changing and 10 as a test. For this, basically, we have the 408 volume, and each volume has 32 2D imaging. So basically, this has more than 13,000 imaging in the chain set. So for the performance, we use the dice similarity coefficient to measure the performance. To measure the performance. And then here is basically the final radio ohmic feature we track. So basically, there are 32 total. We also did some this type of interpretation or explanation. So basically, we just, for example, on the left side, this is road imaging and this is segmentation label. And then this is the trending result. And then basically we use the gradient. And basically, we use the gradient multiplied by the image intensity and then get this type of tumor, highlight this type of tumor region. We also compare this type of radioomic feature in chart from the deep learning model with the traditional ladiomic feature. So, as I just mentioned, this is called the semi-ordinary feature. So, this is provided by this group. So, here the total So here, the total is 36 features as you can see here. This represented the tumor size, the sheet, so on and so forth. Here is some examples. We compare the deep learning based on the radiomic feature with the traditional feature. So as you can see here, for the deep learning-based feature, it's more independent between the different features. But for this type of traditional feature, But for this type of traditional feature, you can see this type of process broad, some of these features are highly dependent. So they are redundant information. And we also did the correlation between these two type of features using the CCM method. And then as you can see here, they are highly similar. As you can see here, the similarity is quite high. And then if you look here, for the here for the the left dot is basically the uh deep learning uh basically the lady on the feature they are more splat leading and but for the traditional feature it's only plus on this uh vertical line okay it's just in this dimension but for our deep learning dynamic feature it will show in both dimension uh so this is the method how we in chapter as a method how we eject the deep learning use the deep learning based approach to eject the radiomic feature now here we introduce the method to integrate the body omics data so basically here we use the bs and tensor factorization based approach to eject this type of um omics uh uh uh based uh meta feature okay so for example here we have the jinx Example: Here we have the gene suppression data and the copy number variation data and the methylation data. And then we use this type of 3D tensor. And then we use the BSM tensor fragmentization approach. And then we get these three metrics. The first metric is the data type. So basically, here is the three data type. And then by length, I will introduce this in the next two slides. And then the second metrics is basically the gene by length. gene by blank matrix and then the third matrix is basically the patient by blank matrix okay so so here I quickly go through the two uh the one uh the concept so the code the tensor so basically tensor is the container which uh holds the data in the dimension so for example here the x is a is a tensor so but the in dimension tensor is basically the next mentioned tensor is basically the later one is a length one tensor it can be exactly decomposed into the out product of n vector such as here so this is the length of one tensor because the tensor x basically is the output of a vector ABC okay so but in in majority case length of one tensor is not enough so we just introduces the length So this introduces the length R tensor. So the length R tensor is the minimum number of length, one tensor needed to represent original tensor, as show can see here. For example, we use this R tensor to represent this tensor X. So in the majority case, we cannot just use the approximate, okay, basically to minimize this function. To minimize this function. Okay. So the key challenge to do this type of analysis is to estimate, to decide the length of this number R. But for the traditional method, basically it's just manual to set up. So here we use the BSN approach to estimate this value. Okay, I will not go to detail. This is the result. So basically, this is the initial length. Basically, this is the initial length R we set up and then this is optimized length R. So basically at the length 17, this is stabilized, then we set up the length at the 17, as you can see here. This is the final result. So using this type of cancer factorization result, and then we did the gene study enrichment analysis. And then as you can see here, for each of And then as you can see here, for each of these factorized map features, there are some significant pathways initially in each of these factorized vector. We also compare this type of tensor factorization based on the feature with the standard gene suppression feature I just mentioned to you. So, here, because we overlap with the data from we overlap with the data from anti-omics and then here we only have the 197 miscgun we did the same the correlation as you can see here for this type of bs and tensor fabricization feature from the omics data is still independent but for this type of g express this type of feature level based on the feature scale has some cluster Still have some cluster, there are some dependent information. And then if we see the similarity, and then basically they are still highly similar. So using this type of etched feature from the multi-office data, we did some application. For example, the first application, we looked at whether they can do justify the patient into the different group. As you can see here, for the TCG. For the TCGA breast cancer data set, basically we can clearly see six subtypes as you can see here. So using this type of approach, we can see clearly the survival difference among these six patient groups. And then we also compare with other published methods or use the single data type. Basically, the survival pattern are not significant. Significant. We also did a simulation. This is a different simulation setting up. This is compared with the different method. And this is the performance metric. And then, as you can see here, this type of BSN cancer fabrication based on the feature can work to stratify the patient into the different group. Another application uses this type of feature we did is to type of feature we did is to predict the survival. We developed the tensor, give a tensor based on the survival model, as you can see here. And then we also compare with this type of traditional approach. This is widely cited the survival model using the genomic data. So basically here we just compared all the features and this is the performance metric. And then basically this is use our tensor calculation. Our tensor factorization based on feature input into this model, and then you can see here the C index in our model is along the 0.7, here is along the 0.5 and 0.6, significantly better than here. And then okay, thank you. So basically, and then we did the two pretty, so we used. To predict, so we use this 62 patient. This is we have the label to predict the radiomic feature. We don't have the radiomic imaging. Use both the standard gene level feature and the PDF feature. And then we measure to use the mean square error, as you can see here, is lower than this type of traditional feature. So basically, this is the survival. This is the survival. I use this type of feature. This is basically for the more significant feature, as you can see here, the survival analysis. So I will quickly go to here. So that uses the DASO model to include the imaging. Here, we use the conditional gain to generate the feature. So for the conditional gain, it's basically here we have the 13, the PSN tensor characterization feature from the audio state. Feature from the audience data, and then this is the noise. And then use the generator, we generate the imaging, and then because here we do the conditional game. So we conditional on the BDR feature and then this perimeter. And then basically we can generate lots of this type of imaging, and then we can do this type of mediation analysis. And then this is basically the architecture, the conditional gain we use. Again, we use and then basically this is some result. Each node, basically, this is a patient and each column, this is the BSM pencil factorization feature. And then basically, using this at each row we input into the trend model, we can generate this type of imaging feature. And since each of the features, each of the BDF features, we get the Feature: We give the GZ enrichment analysis. We can see which pathway is enriched in this feature, and then based on this number, we can identify this type of feature, this type of imaging is related to what type of biological pathway. So, there are some type of interpretability. So, this type of approach, there are lots of potential application, for example, for the data augmentation imputation. Our augmentation, our implementation, and for the privacy protection, so on and so forth. So, yes. So, this is some work we did publicly. I just pretend, and thank you very much.
