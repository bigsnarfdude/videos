Today is Riddy Shah from Johoal Mary University talking about expansive actions of automorphisms of locally combat groups on the space of subgroups. Thank you, Colleen, for the introduction. Can you all hear me? Yes. So thanks. So, thanks the organizers, especially Belize for inviting me. So, this is the abstract which I have already shared with everybody. So, let me start with introducing what. start with introducing what are expansive actions. So if you have a compact, if you have a metric space X D and gamma is a subgroup of homeomorphism of X, then gamma is said to act expansively on X if there exists an epsilon greater than zero such that for any pair of distinct elements X, Y, and X, there exists a gamma in gamma such Exist a gamma in gamma such that distance between gamma x and gamma y is greater than epsilon. This means that the orbit, double orbit, somehow is expanded by this action, at least for a distance gamma. And a homeomorphism of T of X is said to be expansive. Of x is said to be expansive if the cyclic group t to the power n belongs to z acts expansively on x. That is, there exists epsilon greater than zero such that for any pair xy belongs to x, you have n belongs to z such that the distance between t and x and t and y is greater than epsilon. Expansive maps were introduced by Woods in. were introduced by Woods in 1950 and they have been studied by many mathematicians. Here there are names of a few mathematicians, Eoki Mattacharya, Helge Glopner, Ciari Raja, Bruce Kitchens, Cloudsmith, Reddy and Willis. I believe Willis called them on Group. On groups as automorphisms of bounded heights. So these are some of the properties of expansive maps. If T belongs to, T is a homeomorphism of X, it's expansive, then it's clear that any T to the power n is expansive for n not equal to zero. That means identity. zero. That means identity map is not expansive, which you can, it's an isometry, so it's easy to see. Every automorphisms of a discrete space X is expansive. If T is expansive, then the restriction of T to any T-invariant subspace is expansive. And if you have a compact space X and the homeomorphism T is expanded. T is expansive on X, then T has only finitely many fixed points. That's because if there were infinitely many fixed points and they are T-invariant, there would be a limit converging to a point. And so there will be many points whose distance between them become close to zero. And because T to the And because t to the power n is expansive, you also have that it has only finitely many periodic points of a fixed period. And once you have defined expansivity for a metric space, if you have any other metric space giving the same topology, then it is expansivity independent of metric, except that the Except that the epsilon, the expansive constant, will change. So the next two next properties easy, as I mentioned, the identity map of an infinite compact metric space is not expansive. And if T is a metric space, compact metric space, then T, then it is not distal. The map T is expansive. Is expansive, then it is not distal. In Raja's talk, he talked about distality. Let's recall the definition. A homeomorphism T of a space X is said to be distal if the closure of the double orbit Tnx, Tny does not intersect the diagonal in X cross X for any pair X Y belongs to X X not equal to Y. If G so If G, so now I would like to talk about expansive automorphisms on groups, locally compact groups. So if G is a locally compact group, then an automorphism T of G is said to be expansive if the identity E admits a neighborhood U such that intersection of all T to the power N U as N belongs to Z is trivial. So, if G admits such an expansive automorphism and G is first countable and vectorizable, then G is first countable and hence G is vectorizable and the above definition of expansivity coincides with the one given for metric space G D, where D is the left invariant metric on G. So, here also an automorphism T of G is distal if because it's an automorphism, we can define it as T to the power n X, the orbit of X, does not go close to the element identity E. Expansivity and distality are opposite phenomena. Are opposite phenomena for automorphisms of a non-discrete locally compact group. So, if you have the group is discrete, then the map, any automorphism or any map is expansive or distal and distal, both. So, let's see some properties of expansive automorphisms on automorphisms on a local. On a local on a compact, on a locally compact group. But if G is a compact group and T belongs to or G is expansive, then G0 is abelian and finite dimensional. Moreover, you have a subgroup of finite index, which is such a T-invariant subgroup of finite index, such that the restriction of T to H is ergodic. Is ergodic. However, ergodicity is not equivalent to expansivity. If G is a connected Lie group, then all the eigenvalues of the corresponding Lie algebra automorphism have an absolute value other than one. Every connect, and that these two observations. These two observations above will show that one can prove that every connected locally compact group admitting expansive automorphism is nil-portin. And if you have a closed normal subgroup H, which is T invariant, then T on G is expansive if and only if the restriction. If and only if the restriction of T to H and the T action on G by H both are expansive. So the quotient map as well as the restrictions are expansive if T is expansive and the converse is then easy to see. So for totally disconnected group, this was proven by Lochner and Raja, which was extended by me later to all local compact groups. So, the main aim of this talk is to discuss the action of automorphism group on sub G, the space of closed subgroup sub G. So, we want to study expansivity of this action. And so, sub G is a set of Sub G is a set of closed subgroups of G, which is endowed with Chaubotic topology. And sub G is compact, and it is matrizable if G is so. And given a locally compact group G, there is a natural action of G on sub G, which is you take an automorphism T of G and a sub closed subgroup H, then T, is going to. Then T, going to Ts is the action. And this action gives a homomorphism from automorphism group of G to homeomorphisms of sub G. And this action keeps the set of the space of close abelian subgroups invariant as well as the space of cyclic. The space of cyclic subgroups, discrete cyclic subgroups invariant. Throughout, we will assume that G is a locally compact micrizable group and T is an automorphism. So locally compact first countable groups. So why would one want to study subg and its Sub G and its homeomorphisms, and especially coming the ones coming from automorphism. So, for many group G, sub G, the closure of sorry, sub C G and the closure of the space of cyclic subgroups of G, discrete cyclic subgroups of G, are identified. Bike and Clavia Ritson. Glavia, Dridson, et al. and Paures and Habat have done this identification for some groups. For example, subgroups of R2, that space is identified with four sphere S4. And for three-dimensional hydrograph, the structure of sub-edge. Of sub-edge and that of the space of lattices in H and its closure, and the action of H on certain subspaces of such a sub-H have been studied by Britson et al. For connected Lie groups G, the IRS invariant random subgroup, the space of G invariant measures on sub G and the subspaces of lattices also have been studied extensively by. Have been studied extensively by Ebert et al. Gelander and Gelander and Love. Since the homeomorphisms of sub G arising from the action of 4 G form a large subclass of homeomorphism of sub G, the space of homeomorphism of sub G, it is important to study the dynamics of such homeomorphisms. And distality of this action has been already studied. Has been already studied by my collaborators, my students, and me. And also, distality of automorphisms of lattices in a connected loop group has also been distality of the action on sub G for lattices G in a connected loop group has been. G in a connected lead group has also been studied. And many characterizations have been obtained which classify these set. So now we want to start studying the opposite phenomena, which is namely the expansivity of the action of automorphism of G. These two are disjoint set because subg is a compact. Said because sub G is a compact space. So we start with a result on Lie groups. Now, strangely, this is what one gets that a non-trivial connected Lie group does not admit any automorphism which acts expansively on such. And the reason is mainly you have to study for R Rn or main. Or may is actually R or R2 because and the torus. So the reason is suppose G has a solvent, G is not semi-simple and G, so G has a solvable radical and there will be the last subgroup in the derived series which will be isomorphic to Rn and it is T invariant. Now, if you show that there That there is no automorphism of Rn which acts expansively on Rn on sub-Rn, then the whole group will not admit automorphisms that act expansively on sub of G, subspace of closed subspace. But the automorphisms of Rn R in G L and R, so you always have. And R, so you always have one either depending on eigenvalue, which is real or complex, you have a one-dimensional line R or two-dimensional space R2, which are invariant. So you only have to show that automorphisms of R or R2 are don't act expansively on the space of closed subgroups. Now, on R, you know what they look like. On R, you know what they look like. It's just R star and just scalar multiplications. And the subgroups of R are either discrete NZ of the form NZ or zero or whole of R. And then you have to use some properties and work it out. And for R2, it is essentially. And for R2, it is essentially similar because modulo rotation, the map is just a scalar multiplication. And if G is semi-simple, then some power of the automorphism is an inner automorphism. And since the inner automorphism, it cannot be. It cannot be of finite order because if it acts expansively on subg, then it cannot be finite order. And otherwise, if it has infinite order, the inner automorphism, then the case reduce to identity map on R or the torus n-dimensional torus, and identity maps have many fixed points, so it cannot be expanded. So now we know that Lie groups do not admit any expansive, any automorphisms which act expansively on sub-G. Then a compact group G also does not admit any automorphism which acts expansively on sub G unless the group is finite. If the group is finite, then obviously. Then obviously the set of subgroups is finite, and any automorphism, any map of a finite space would be expansive. So for this, the proof uses some known results on dynamics of automorphism of compact groups and the above theorem for Lie groups. For example, you have a torus, then you have The group subgroups of finite order elements and which are infinitely many and they are team variant and they do not so it has too many for infinitely many uh fixed points in sub G. So the automorphism of a torus cannot act expansively in subg. Now you see Now, you see, the for a Lie group G, sub G is a very big class, very big space. So, you want to know if it happens that if you take a much smaller space, which is T invariant, and does the automorphism act expansively on sub closed space of closed subgroup of. Closed space of closed subgroup of it. So, for example, you have a lattice Gamma in a connected Lie group G, then this lattice is finitely generated. It is well known. And if I take the space of close space of cyclic subgroups of gamma, then it is a finite, it is a countable space. Is a countable space, so it's much smaller. And if I have an automorphism T of a connected Lie group, which keeps gamma invariant, then the sub C gamma, the space of cyclic subgroup, which is a countable space, will be invariant, right? So maybe one would hope that there the action is expansive, but no. In fact, if you take any automorphism gamma. Uh, automorphism gamma of a lattice in a connectedly group G, it does not act expansively on sub C gamma. Here, the proof would use structure of lattices in a Lie group and also some properties of structure of sub-CG for certain kind of group G. Because if G is a discrete cyclic nilpotent group, Discrete polycyclic nilpotent group, parallel activists in a certain semi-simple L group, means linear group with finite linear group, for example. Then in such spaces, the set of roots of any elements is finite. And for example, what are called root compact groups. And there you can show that the identity. Show that the identity neighborhood of sub G has the complement of identity neighborhood of sub C G is only finite and that helps one to prove that there is no automorphism which expands only on subsets. And for certain things like proving such a thing, roots of any element is finite, one has to use. Element is finite, one has to use Borel's Selberg's lemma and Borel's theorem, Borel's results about net elements in linear groups. One more thing I would like to mention that about the structure of lactices: if you have a lactase in a connected Lie group, then it has a polycyclic subgroup module of which the quotient. The quotient group is lattice in a connected, in a semi-simple, connected semi-simple Lie group with finite center. So you can use the quotient and also the polycyclic part would have a discrete cyclic, discrete subgroup Zn invariant under the automorphism. Under the automorphism, and you can work on Zn, and then you can work on the potion. So now these two results earlier will tell you these two theorems that since compact groups, infinite compact groups and connected non-compact Lie groups do not admit any automorphisms, sorry, and connected Lie groups do not admit any automorphisms which. Do not admit any automorphisms which act expansively, you get that if G admits any automorphism, any such automorphism, then G is totally disconnected. So now we are in the space of totally disconnected groups, and one would like to know which totally disconnected groups admit such automorphism. So, and what is the structure of such totally different The structure of such totally disconnected locally compact groups: What are the properties of such automorphisms that act expansively on such? So first thing is that if T acts expansively on such G, then the T action on G itself is expansive. So let me give you a quick proof. So So assume Tx expansively on sub G, then by the corollary, G has to be totally disconnected. If G is discrete, then any map is any homeomorphism is expansive, so T is expansive. If G is not discrete, and suppose G is not discrete, and suppose T is not expansive, then what happens? Then there exists a neighborhood basis UM of identity E. Of identity E consisting of, say, distinct compact open subgroups, such that Hm is intersection N belongs to Z T to the power N U. So that's a compact group. And it is non-trivial that this happens because T is not expansive. So every neighborhood, such set would be not identical as for the definition of expansive. Definition of expansion and as HMR compact invariant, that is, T has infinitely many fixed points in sub G, and that gives you contradiction to the fact that T is expansive, T action on sub G is expansive. So this is a very easy proof to see why expansivity of T action on sub G implies expansivity of T. What about the converse? Means if you have T is expansive, then is the T action on sub G is expansive? Does it happen? Or are there any automorphism of a group totally disconnected, any totally disconnected group which are acting expansively on sub G? So which totally disconnected group C have automorphism whose action on sub G is expansive. Subjuice expansion. Now here is one. So any expansive automorphism of the periodic field QP acts expansively on sub QP. So, but Qp to the power n does not admit any expanse, any automorphism which acts expansively on sub qp to the power n for any n greater than or equal to 2. Greater than or equal to two. And it also follows that if you have an automorphism of t automorphism t of g of direct product of different periodic vector spaces and that expand that acts expansively on space of its closed subgroups, then these n1, n2, nk have to be one and g becomes qp. becomes QP direct product of distinct periodic fields, finitely many distinct. So this one can easily see that T keeps these spaces invariant and then use the proposition. So here is one. So this example is to illustrate what happens in proposition. So if you take T from Qp to QP, t from qp to qp which is just a scalar multiplication by element in qp star then tx is ax where a belongs to qp star and if you take that absolute value of a p is not one then it's expansive and it acts expansive periodic absolute value of a should be not equal to one then the map is expansive and it takes expansively on subtl p. Expansively on subproof P. So one needs to give a proof of this, but I have not given it here. It's in the paper with Prajapati. So now I would like to talk about contraction groups of such automorphisms which act expansively of subgene. It has specific structure. So we are just trying to study what happens when a man. To study what happens when a map T is expansive on circuit. So let's recall the definition of contraction group of Ct of an automorphism T. So Ct is all those elements X moves forward orbit converges to identity. It's a T-invariant subgroup of G and it need not be close. However, one can show that C. However, one can show that C T, this contraction group of T, is close if T acts expansively on sub G. So how does one do that? Using certain results of Baum, Gartner, and Willis in 2004, you can show that the close, if it shows that closure of Ct is Ct into K where K is a teen variant compact subgroup of. Compact subgroup of G. But since T also expands, acts expansively on sub K, which is a compact group, that by the theorem above for compact groups, you get that K is finite. But if K is finite, this forces the contraction group Ct to be closed because Ct becomes open in Ct bar. In CT bar, and so it becomes close. So I would like to talk about a very classical, very deep theorem by Gloekner at Willis about the structure of totally disconnected contraction groups. So before this, there was a struct theorem by Ziebert, which told that if you have a locally compact group admitting an automotive Compact group admitting an automorphism T, which whose contraction group is whole of G, then it is a direct product of a totally disconnected group and a simply connected nidpotent group. And we all know the structure of simply connected nibotant group and 50. If T acts on that contractively, then we know what happens to that. But we didn't know anything much about this totally disconnected part. So here is a theorem which tells you very nicely what happens. So let G be a totally disconnected locally compact group and T contracts whole of G. So C T is G. Then So Ct is G. Then there is a group of torsion elements called torque G and infinitely divisible elements called divg such that G is a direct product internally as topological group of torque G cross div C. Furthermore, dv G is a direct product of T invariant nilpotent periodically groups GP for certain primes P. So these are all distinct prime such. are all distinct prime such that dg is gp1 cross gp2 cross gpn and these gpn are actually the group of qp rational points of a unipotent linear algebraic group defined over qp and the last part is due to bang in 1984 so yes uh if you it that part for periodic For piadic D groups, this was done earlier, but not for a general totally disconnected group. And they also describe the structure of a simple torsion group tor G, which is restricted direct product for a finite simple group F, which looks like this in the sense that it is eventually constant. It is eventually constant on the so you take all elements in this where on the left hand side it is identity eventually for all the points and on the right it's elements of f so it should and then t is a right shift so if you keep shifting it everything will become identical Everything will become identical. So that's the group of torsion elements. Using this, one can show that you see we did this. So if you take this dg, it would have, if you take a simple group there, it would be a direct product of p-ardic vector spaces. I mean, okay, no, actually, simple teen variant group. Teen variant group, and then it the question boils down to only the PRD vectors, right? Because this is a direct product, so they are they normalize, I mean, centralize each other. So now, and these are teen variant subgroups. So you, if in GP1, one can show that. That it becomes just if so, if you have T which acts expansively on sub G, then you can show that D V G just boils down to QP1 cross QP2 cross QPn because the periodic vector spaces which are invariant would have only dimension one and then you have to use that the group is unipotent in particular it's a lin it is nilpotent Particular, it's a linear, it is important, and you can get if you have one-dimensional subspace, which is the center, then you do have this two-dimensional space, which is invariant, and then you show that it is not possible. In the case of Tor G, you can reduce the case to a simple group, and then you can use this. In this torsion group, you can take Tortion group, you can take a set of finite subgroups, which are many. So, and you can show that T so if you take a finite subgroup, you can show that it's positively asymptotic to identity as well as negatively asymptotic to identity. So, proper finding. So, proper finite subjects. And then, so for us, there is a result in expansivity that if you have a compact space, you cannot have elements which has forward orbit converging to some point, the whole forward orbit. So, if X is a compact space, then and T acts expansively on X, then simply on x then x does not admit elements or which are such that so let's say x small x that t to the power nx converges to some element a and t to the power minus n x converges to some element b where a and b may be same or different then the map t is not expansive this is a result by red d so you don't have all So, you don't have orbits which are positively automatic asymptotic to an element and negatively asymptotic to another to an element. So, you show that tor g is trivial and dg becomes finite direct product of periodic fields. So, this is the structure of this theorem is about structure. This theorem is about the structure of contraction group which acts of T, which acts expansively on subs. Let L G be a locally compact group and T be an automorphism of G which acts expansively on, sorry, here it should be sub G, not G. So there is a mistake here. It should be sub G. Then the contraction group C T is a direct product of finitely many periodic fields. finitely many periodic fields qp for distinct primes p that is ct is qp1 plus qp2 cross qpn and yeah these are distinct brands and it is t invariant space and on each of them t would have the structure as i explained in the example that it is a scalar multiplication Scalar multiplication and mod whose modulus of those elements is not one. So, those are the contractive elements. So, remember, I said that compact groups do not admit automorphisms which act expansively on space of closed subgroups unless they are finite. But we also show that if you have any automorphism T. Any automorphism T of a group G which acts expansively on sub G, the group of elements with bounded or T orbit is finite. So not only in compact group, of course, the elements, it's true, but you can also show for any local compact. So it comes down to totally disconnected groups. And it follows from And it follows from above and Glopnar Raja that if you take just the group multiplication of the group Ct and C T inverse, it's a set. It need not be a subgroup. It is opening G for such T. And if your group is a bailian, then of course this is a subgroup and it's an open subgroup. Subgroup, and it's an open subgroup. So, and it is T-invariant and it's normal. You can go modulo, the quotient is a discrete group. And if Tx expandsly on sub G, then one, it is easy to see that Tx expandsively on any sub-space of closed subgroups of the quotient group. So that's true for any quotient group also. Quotient group also. So then it would be interesting to study the structure of infinite discrete groups G admitting automorphisms which act expansively on sub G. We have already shown that lattices in a connected Lie group G connected Lie groups do not admit such automorphisms. We have also shown that if you have a polycyclic group, they also They also do not admit such automorphisms. But what are the other groups, discrete groups, which admit these automorphisms? That would be interesting. And because we don't have much information about the structure of these groups here. I mean, the closed space of closed subgroups, we know some things, but not too much. So one could do that. So, one could do that. Of course, if the group is what is called root compact in some sense, where it has roots of every element is finite, then you can show that it doesn't act expansively. But there are many other groups where one could study this. So, thank you very much. And these are the references, some of the ones I have mentioned here, but they're. Have mentioned here, but there are many more which are you can find them in these references: Woods, Wang, Bank, Gutler Village, Glopner Village, Glopner and Raja. And these are the references of papers I talked about. And further references can be found in these papers. And so, as I mentioned, there was a mistake here. There was a mistake here, which should have been the second line of this theorem should be TX expansively on sub G, not just G. Okay. Thank you, Colleen. Thanks, Rindy. Any questions? Yeah, I'd like to ask about the, if I am following something properly. So suppose you have some group G with an automorphism that's not, sorry, that yeah, has non-trivial contraction subgroup. Subgroup, then does the property of having an expansive action pass to the closure of that contraction subgroup? In which case, would your result about the contraction subgroups or their closures, would that extend to the group, the larger group? So yours, so closure is actually if you have, yes, so that's true that if you so if you have a T an automorphism of a totally disconnected group and you you are saying that it has non-trivial contraction group and you take closure, then T restricted to that is expansive. Expansive on sub G, that's what you're saying, right? Isn't it? So then CT is already, then you, yes, you see, you will not have these compact invariant subgroups. So it is except that is finite, then Ct is close and Ct will be direct product of Qp1 cross QP2 cross QPN. 2 cross qp n okay and ct inverse would be direct product of that and uh yeah then i i mean beyond that so you have to work little more and if it's abelian of course you go modulo and it's a discrete group but if it's non-abelian well ct ct inverse Yeah, I think one has to think about it a little more. If it's a billion, then you can do something, but if it's non-a billion, but it is possible, it's a good question that it should, in my opinion, no, oh, non-trivial. Okay, yeah, but you see, the modulo discrete, suppose it's a billion and you've got this, but modulo, it is a You got this, but modulo it is a discrete group. Now you don't know what happens there, right? We don't know anything about discrete except for a specific case, right? Yeah, so I can't say more about this because but you could possibly rule out a lot of groups as having expansive automorphisms. Yes, we can, but applying what you already know about contraction groups. Yes, but we don't know. But we don't know many, we don't know too much about all, I mean, all. See, so you have to worry about potion, but I mean, in some sense, potion. So I don't know many things about that. But yeah, that's the big question. All right, thank you. All right, thanks, Kerody. Thank you.
