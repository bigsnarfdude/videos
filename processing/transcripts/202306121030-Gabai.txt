Yeah, thanks. Great, thank you. Right, so so so there's a word problem let me just just remind So, as a warm-up, let me just remind everyone something we all know that we have the classification of surfaces. Surfaces are closed-oriented connected surfaces determined by their genus and genus is a function of Euler characteristic. And more generally, if you have a surface, say, with boundary, then the Euler characteristic and the number of boundary components. Characteristic and the number of boundary components, and seeing everything's connected, say, and oriented, then that determines sort of all the information. And it's already in this sort of just very simple thing. It illustrates one of the beauties of topology is that you have something sort of standard and sometimes it's sort of presented to you in a slightly non-standard way. And so we sort of develop sort of technique to somehow be able to recognize things that aren't presented in perfect usual way. Presented in the usual way. So today, I'm talking about hyperbolic manifolds. And just to remind you that in the upper half-space model, the hyperbolic, whoops, the hyperbolic, oh, that's strange. The hyperbolic metric is simply the Euclidean metric scaled by the distance from the x. From the x-axis. This is in dimension two, but in dimension three, hyperbolic is the Herbal metrics simply also scales, you know, in dimension three, in the upper half-space model, you know, the Euclidean metrics scaled by one over the distance to the xy plane. Distance to the xy plane. So, but then we have also the Poincaré disk model. And here, Euclidean, here, the hyperbolic space is the interior of the disk, and it scales the Euclidean metric by 2 over 1 minus the radius squared. So, in particular, as you can see, that this beautiful Escher picture that things sort of excites. Things sort of expand exponentially as you go off to infinity. So, right, so, right, so as you all know, there's the Gas Bonet theorem, and in particular, if you have a sort of a complete surface hyperbolic structure, metric of constant minus one curvature, then the area is 2π times the Euler characteristic. And since we know more or less the Euler characteristic determines Or less storial characteristic determines the surface. But right in dimension two, we see that area is sort of another way of informing us what the topology is. So right, so let's look at one sort of warm-up example. So, right, so here we have like an ideal regular square in a hyperbolic two-space, and we can get sort of a puncture torus by. And we can get sort of a punctured torus by identifying opposite edges. So, topologically, the surface is a punctured surface of genus 1, but the end, so topologically, is just a product of a circle with a half-opened interval. So, this is sort of the topological picture. So, let's look at a geometric form of this. So, here we have We have this surface, which is gotten by identifying opposite sides of the square, you know, viewed in the upper half-space model. So here are two things you're supposed to get out of this picture. One is that the end of the surface is circle across R, this annulus. But when you lift it up to the universal... But when you lift it up to the universal cover, that annulus lifts up to the pre-image is sort of a disk, posed disk with a point at infinity. And so you see these various translates of the cusp. And in particular, well, there's when you, In the upper half-space model, there's the point at infinity, the R Euclidean infinity. And in that case, the cost corresponds to everything lying above sort of an edge or sort of like you could arrange it so it lies above, say, the line, you know, y equals one. So another thing you're supposed to get out of this is. you're supposed to get out of this is is that if you if you look at say the previous picture you see you see this this this this cusp here but but now we could just sort of just you know just expand this cusp sort of bigger and bigger and and eventually it it it uh crashes into itself and when when you just crash into yourself you just stop and that's what we call sort of a maximal cusp so so this this this figure also shows sort of uh you know the Of the maximal cusp for this punctured torus. And one other feature of this picture is sort of the striking fact that the area of the cusp comprises a large fraction of the area of the surface. In fact, for this particular surface, the area cusp comprises 90% of the area of the surface. And on the other hand, you look at On the other hand, you look at a picture like this, and it looks like maybe a fraction of 1 20th or something, but in reality, it's actually strikingly large. And these features that I just mentioned manifest themselves in dimension three and are extremely useful. So let's go straight to dimension three. And so here's sort of a schematic picture of a two-cusp hyperbolic three-manifold. Three manifold. And here, instead of a circle cross half open interval, the ends of such a manifold is a torus cross half open interval. And so this is sort of the picture topologically, sort of schematically, but it's also useful to think of the picture sort of from inside of hyperbolic space. From inside of hyperbolic space. So, this is a beautiful picture from Jeff Weeks' sort of initial Snappy program. And here's sort of the same picture from the modern incarnation Snappy. But it's an homage to Jeff. Let's stare at this picture for a while. Actually, I literally could spend really the rest of the lecture just staring at this. The rest of the lecture just staring at this picture and talking. But let me point out some features that a little bit spoiler alerts for what's going to happen in the future. But one feature is that just as the pre-image of a cusp was a disk in dimension two, the pre-image of a cusp is a three-dimensional ball, nice round three-dimensional ball in dimension three with a point at the point. Three with a point at infinity. But also, there's sort of a cusp at infinity. So, if you're looking at the upper half-space model, everything lying above the x-y plane in three space, we have this maximal cusp, which is everything lying above height one. So, right. So, first thing is this here, here's a way of is this here here's here's a way of of of of like you know staring at uh getting a view of of the manifold from from from inside and and a second thing is is this feature of of the the volume of the cusp taking up a strikingly large amount of of volume so so this is the manifold uh m011 its volume is about you know 2.781 plus some decimals but the volume of the cusp is 2.1 But the volume of the cusp is 2.135 plus some decimals. So this thing is well. So the volume of the cost takes up slightly more than 75% of the volume of the manifold. So one thing, so to get out of this, if you're trying to understand volume of cusp manifolds, it's often extremely useful to try to get a grip of the a grip of of the volume of the cusp and neighborhood so so here's here's another feature which um which is you know you here we're looking at the unit you know it from the universal cover from up up high in the universal cover and and and we could see um you know the cusp at this is the pre-image at cusp at infinity of you know the you know there's a one cusp manifold the ends torus cross custom manifold dns torus cross half open interval so so you can see the z plus z action acting on uh on on the the manifold that that fixes the the you know the cusp at infinity and translates the other cusps. So in particular, here's sort of a fundamental domain for the Z plus Z action. And you can see this horrible and these four horribles are taken to themselves under the action. Taken to themselves under the action. But notice that these balls sort of come in pairs. There's this one, there's another one that's sort of full-sized, and here's one's a little smaller, and a similar one, and this one, that one. And this is an observation that goes back to Colin Adams, that these hardwalls come in pairs. And there's sort of a very simple reason why, because this picture is invariant under the This picture is invariant under the fundamental group. So, so, whoops, lost it. So, so this this cusp over here, for example, there's a group element takes it to the one at infinity. So, this one is tangent to the one at infinity. So, if the one, so if this goes to the one at infinity, the one at infinity has to go somewhere else that's tangent to it. So, whoops, doing that. That. So this one, you know, up to the Z plus Z action goes to infinity, infinity goes to somebody else. And maybe it's that one. But the important observation is that hyperbolic manifolds, well, it turns out they're k pi ones. There's no torsion in the fundamental group. So this guy can't be somehow taken back to this one by this operation because if it did, it turns out. This operation, because if it did, it turns out there'd be sort of an elliptic of an element of order two. And in the same manner, you have some guy like this who's at whatever, such and such distance from infinity. When this guy goes to infinity, infinity goes to something at such and such distance. And that's where you see sort of this guy. And another thing is: well, here's another point, which is if you start with a manifold with a cusp. Whereas a manifold where the cusp volume is pretty large relative to the volume of the manifold, then when you're staring at a diagram like this, you have to see sort of a lot of big horror walls. I mean, if there was like a lot of empty space, like here's a little empty space, but if there's a lot of empty space, well, well, you know, that would sort of suggest that, well, the volume, you know, the ratio of cusp fine, the manifold volume wasn't that big. So, therefore, you see a lot of, you know, it's things are pretty packed in. Okay, so here's another idea, fundamental, which is, okay, you know, we all know like Morse theory. You have a manifold, say a boundary, and now you have a Morse function or a function, you know, given by distance from the boundary. So you could take the boundary and start expanding it, and it crashes into itself, and that corresponds to, you know, adding handles. Corresponds to you know adding handles of index one, and maybe it hits itself again, handle of index one, and maybe you know expands, and you see a handle of index two. And okay, so you see that all in this picture here, where here's the maximal cost, and there's sort of this point of tangency here. So, so the so where the maximal cost touches itself, you could think of that corresponds to a handle of index one. So, you could see a sub-manifold. So, you can see a sub-manifold inside the cusp manifold by starting with the torus, you know, and expanding out a tiny bit, and already you get a one-handle here. Expanding out a little bit more, you see, you know, this one handle. So now you have two one handles. Okay, now here's one of the beauties of this snappy program. You see all these little numbers? Well, the numbers sort of just keep track of, well, these one handles, so to speak. Like here. Handle, so to speak. Like, here's a one, and that corresponds to like this one handle going from this guy to infinity. So, when you see like the one, that means that's a translate of this handle. And see, here's a one from this guy to that guy. That means the translate of this one handle, you know, corresponds to this guy over here. So, whoops. So, so, so you could start. So, in this particular case, you could start. Could start, so in this particular case, you could start with a Taurus cross eye. And now you see, like, this, this, this one handle here, this one handle there. So now you added on two one handles, but now look, you have a little triangle here. See that triangle here, here, here? It says one, two, two. That means here's like a little triangle whose boundary lies in the one handles. So you have to stay. Handles. So you have to stare at this and think about it for a while, but this corresponds to a two-handle. And here's another one: two, one, one. So this is sort of another two handle. So if you start with a torus cross I, you add on two one handles, and then two two handles, a little Euler characteristic calculation tells you you have a manifold of Euler characteristic zero. zero. The Euler characteristic of a three-manifold is half the Euler characteristic of the boundary. So with a little bit of luck, the boundary is Euler, well, the boundary is Euler characteristic zero. And well, it turns out you have to have bad luck, but in this particular case, the boundary is just a union of tori. So just fast forward and just press some details. And you know, just press some details: is inside the manifold, you see a compact manifold built by Tor Scourse I, 2, 1 handles, 2, 2 handles, the boundary of Tori. Well, you know, under, you know, except for silly reasons, Tori and hyperbolic manifolds either bound solid tori or cut off cusps. So the conclusion is just by staring at this diagram, you can see that this That this manifold, this cusp manifold, is obtained by sort of filling some very simple compact manifold. This is what we call sort of a MOM2 manifold. Turns out there's only three of those. And okay, so here's, here's, let me show you one more thing to get of this. Is look, here's where, okay, here's our one that goes to infinity. And well, And well, shoot. So anyway, there's another one that goes a little bit to the right to that two. And then there's one that goes down at five o'clock. And then there's one that goes off to three o'clock. And then there's one to infinity. So there's this. So starting at infinity, there's actually a cycle of horriballs that of five horriballs, one tangent to the next, which have ones. So here's another way of thinking about what. So, here's another way of thinking about what turns out to be the same handle structure. Start with Taurus crossed I and add this one handle. And now this one handle turns out, we have to stare at this a long time, but inside this picture, you could see a two handle that goes over the one five different times. So, starting with the Taurus, single one handle, single two handle, you get you also get this compact manifold. And this is anyway, this is what we call. This is anyway. This is what we call sort of a necklace structure. So, um, right, so um, so, okay, so, so this is talking about volume of hyperbolic three manifolds. Volume is extremely interesting because, first of all, if you just have a Riemannian manifold with such and such special properties, it'll be interesting to know what its volume is. But Maastar rigidity tells us that volume is extra. That volume is extra special in dimension three because Maostov rigidity says that if you have two metrics of constant minus one curvature on the same manifold, there's just an isometry of there's a there's a map from the manifold to itself, which is isometry with respect to taking the first manifold, same manifold with metric zero to the manifold with metric one. The manifold with metric one. So if you have two different metrics of constant minus one curvature, there's isometry taking one to the other. So, and in fact, Maastel says that this isometry is homotopic to the identity. So a corollary of this is this credible fact that any invariant of the hyperbolic structure is a topological invariant. And anyway, so here's some technical things. And anyway, so here's some technical things you might read on the bottom, which is, you know, Most Dell says this isometry is only homotopic to identity. And with, you know, Rob Meyeroff and Nathaniel Thurston, you know, we showed that, in fact, in dimension three, it's actually isotopic to identity. But this is actually false in dimension 11 by Farrell and Jones some 30 something years ago. Something years ago. And more recently, well, it's in dimension 10. And very recently, Ryan Buddy and I posted using our barbell map theory that in fact, in dimension four, you could find such maps F, which are not isotopic to identity. So, when people think of Maostell rigidity, the casual think is: well, hyperbolic manifolds of higher dimensions have unique hyperbolic structure, but it's unique up to what? The reality is the space of hyperbolic structures is quite complicated. And well, in dimension three, actually, some time ago, I showed it was contractible. But these theorems say that in higher dimensions, it's not even path-connected. So it's unique up to the right equivalence relation. So another element is a thick-thin decomposition. And well, earlier, I made the casual remark that if you have a hyperbolic manifold, well, the ends sort of are, you know, are topologically, say, dimension three, torus cross, you know, half-open interval. interval but uh but this this thick thin decomposition says in fact that um that that they're they're geometrically uh just you know have this nice sort of geometric cusp structure and well uh and with sort of nice uniform invariance and uh and well this is close closely related to what's called the the margulis constant and anyway not time to talk about that so um So, right. So, okay, so the next sort of maybe central theorem you need to know about hyperbolic manifolds is this theorem of Thurston, you know, extending work of Juergensen and Gromo. And his theorem says that volumes from complete hyperbolic three manifolds, if you look at those numbers, it's a well-ordered set and it's sort of closed and of order type omega to omega. So that means. Type omega to omega. So that means there's a first volume, a second volume, third volume, first limit volume, and then a next volume, next volume, next, second limit volume. Then there's the first limit of limit volumes. Then there's the first limit of limit of limit volumes and so forth. So that's what it means to be a well-ordered set of type omega to the omega. And just ever so briefly, the reason why such a thing is true, it really Why such a thing is true? It really is because of this thick, thin decomposition that there's basically sort of a uniform number, so that if you just ignore the part of the manifold that has sort of small injectivity radius, then you're left with sort of this thick, so to speak, manifold. And it turns out that if you fix the volume and you fix sort of this cutoff, then there's really up to... Then, then there's really up to just sort of small perturbation. There's only finitely many such manifolds. So, how you fill them in, take the limits. I mean, that's how you get sort of this more detailed picture. So, right. So, yeah, so a consequence of this is that if you just restrict yourself to any class of hyperbolic manifolds, there's always a least volume. There's always a least volume one. There might be some finitely many, but there's also some finite set of manifolds of least volume. And Marv Meyerhoff showed that there's a least, I mean, he found explicitly the least volume cross hyperbolic 3-orbifold. And Gohring and Martin, Marshall Martin, you know, found the lead. You know, found the least volume orbifolds. And so, right. And Colin Adams, you know, he found the least volume non-compact manifold. So he found the volume, non-compact manifold of least volume. And so let me just ever so quickly sort of give you some hints of why it's true. It's true, and there's this basic fact of Borotsky that if you look at hyperbolic three space, actually, he has this sort of general theorem, but in particular, if you have hyperbolic three-space and you have it filled up by horror walls with interiors disjoint, maybe they're tangent, then the density is the most root three over two times this V3, which is the volume. This V3, which is the volume of the ideal 3-simplex. So, well, so that's point one. And point two is Meyerhoff. Well, okay, you know, as stated here, it's sort of a tautology, but Meyerhoff used that to prove this theorem about cusped orbifolds. And Adams used this observation that I mentioned earlier that if there's a big ball, there's another big ball, and the smaller ball, another smaller ball. But at least for the case of the big ball, Smaller bull, but at least for the case of the big bull, this is where he used it, and he was able to double a volume estimate of Meyerhoff and show that in particular, cusp hyperbolic manifold had volume at least the volume V3, which is like 1.01 something, which is this volume of the ideal regular 3 simplex. And in particular, it turns out the Diesing manifolds sort of unique. Manifolds, sort of unique manifold with this property. It's obtained by gluing faces in the right way of ideal regular simplex. So, right. So, so here's, well, just something that's incredibly important, which is, you know, many of these theorems, things I've mentioned, but more so things I will mention. More so, things I will mention just don't come out of a vacuum. I mean, these incredible programs that sort of just that you stare at them long enough, you could find some insights. And in particular, Jeff's original Snappy and then sort of the modern Snap Eye, Mark Culler and Nathan Dunfield, and help multitudes of other people. People, I mean, you know, it's just, I can only say it's sort of a gold mine. You just, you know, look at their stuff and you stare at it, and there's just, you know, you just dig out sort of interesting ideas. So, right. Okay. So, so now I want to just mention some results. So, let's now focus on, say, On, say, manifolds. Manifolds are all orientable and complete and without boundary. So again, Bill's theorem tells us that any class of such manifolds has a smallest element, maybe more than one. So now it's more than 10 years ago, 15 years ago. More than 10 years ago, 15 years ago, that Rob Meyerhoff, Peter Milley, and I showed the weakest manifolds the unique most volume minimal one. And now if you look at cost pyrobolic manifolds, well, you could say, okay, what's the smallest one cost manifold, two cost manifold, three cost manifolds, so and so forth. And so Chow Meyerhoff showed the figure eight and its system. Showed the figure eight and its sister were the unique one cusp manifolds of minimal volume. Ian Aagle and Ian Agle showed that the minus two, three pretzel complement and the Whitehead link complement, those are the unique two-cus manifolds. It's an open question of what the minimal three-cus manifold is, but this is. This is attribute this to Snappy, but maybe should be attributed this to Hodgson and Weeks, you know, in their census. This is sort of the smallest three-class manifold. And as far as I know, the census is pretty good, even though it's been maybe 35 years. I'm not aware of new manifolds sort of coming in. So strikingly, well, in that case, Well, in that case, they really looked at manifolds obtained by gluing seven or less ideal seven or less tetrahedra and doing fillings on them. And okay, now maybe up to nine or ten such things, but still for the early part of their census, it seems extremely effective. So Yoshida found the, showed this the A4 link complement is unique for a cost manifold. After that, Manifold. After that, it's open, but there's sort of conjectural links that satisfy these conditions. So my goal for maybe next bit is to give you some hints of technique that goes behind these theorems. So, right. So, oh, so one thing, just even what part that goes behind these theorems is sort of this. These theorems is sort of this fundamental sort of open-ended conjecture, hyperbolic complexity conjecture of Thurston and Hodgson-Weeks and Matt Veya-Fimenko. And each of these individual sets of people looking at sort of the data from Bit different, I mean, Bill just directly from starting out with like the figure eight knot complements or lane complements and Hodgson Weeks in their census and Matve Pomenko looking at. Census and Medveyev Fimenko looking at special spines, you know, it seemed that if you fix sort of a small volume where small is sort of, you know, a little bit open-ended, then those manifolds seem to be obtained by sort of filling, you know, cusp manifolds of sort of some low topological complexity, where the notion of topological The notion of topological complexity varies from case to case. So, in part, we're inspired by this. So, again, my goal now is to give you some hints as to this theorem. So, by the way, this has sort of this long history where it's what? I mean, 45 years ago that Meyerhoff showed that 0.0006 was sort of a lower bound. Bound and seven years later, he's able to improve that by what 30 something percent. And so, right, but interestingly, that many of the techniques that went into sort of these progress, played into the resolution of this problem. And let me just mention quickly some of these techniques. So, Rob Meyerhoff and Nathaniel Thurston. Rob Meyerhoff and Nathaniel Thurston and I, with sort of rigorous computer assistance, showed that if you have a closed manifold, then the shortest geodesic had a sort of a thick tube about it. Thick means log three over two. So that's not exactly true. There were sort of certain exceptional manifolds, and those exceptional manifolds had sort of biggest volumes. And actually, there was quite a bit of other information about them. And sometime later, Sometime later, well, these set of people who are undergraduates, working with Walter Neumann and stuff with Maria Ternikova, you know, ultimately, except for this Vowel III manifold, all the other manifolds had a geodesic of a log 3 over 2 tube. And the point is, well, what is log 3 over 2? I mean, maybe this number is, you know, 0.549306, blah, blah, blah, whatever, sort of meaningless to you. But the point is, this is sort of some number that enables. This is sort of some number that enables certain geometric control of things, and this number turns out to be really useful in later contexts. And sort of here's a okay, here's a second element, which is sort of using sort of Perlman's work on Ricci Flow to help things. And so quickly is suppose you have a closed manifold and Manifold and it's obtained by filling a cusp manifold. Then, if you look in the small print on the bottom, you know, Eagle and Dunfield showed that like an inequality between the volume of the cusp manifold and the volume of the closed manifold, where n gamma is sort of this cusp manifold, n is the closed manifold, and l is is the length of the geasic in the closed manifold. The g-s, like, in the closed manifold that that appeared after you did the filling, and r was its tube radius. And so, so, so, this really is giving you, saying that the volume of a closed manifold is based on certain such and such geometric information, in particular, this control, which we just mentioned, is in terms of the cusp manifold. And so, well, I only have time to like flash this picture, but Flash this picture. But this sort of explains how to somehow relate sort of the volume of the cost manifold, volume of the closed manifold. So here, the thing on the right is the closed manifold with a maximal tube that this geodesic, the surgery geodesic, sort of drilled out. But now somehow you just tackle on some rescaled cost satisfying such and such geometric. Satisfying such and such geometric property. You rescale the whole metric in such and such a way. You can actually compute explicitly what the volume of the custom manifold is relative to the closed manifold based on this data. But then you apply, you know, Ricci flow and this thing is set up for the Ricci flow, you know, where the, where the, where when you do the Ricci flow, the volume is just getting sort of, you know, the inequality is going more and more. The inequality is going more and more in the direction you want. And so you ultimately get this theorem. And well, there's some technical points, and actually, there's some history here. But sort of the upshot of this is that if you're trying to find the lowest volume manifold of what we know by Jeff is it's what's called the weeks manifold is volume more than 0.94. More than 0.94.9428. And using sort of this, you know, Perlin thing with an estimate of tube radius plus a packing estimate of Jaworski, that means that the manifolds obtained by filling a one-cus manifold of volume at most 2.848. And that's what sort of we did. We developed this MOM technology, which I mentioned in the beginning. I mentioned in the beginning is if now that we know. So, well, anyway, so anyway, we developed this technique to understand low cost volume manifolds. And sorry, manifolds of low volume, cost manifolds of low volume. And well, Volume and well, let me just mention sort of the complexity which we use, which is called the LOM complexity. And that's simply, if a manifold can be obtained by starting with torus cross I, adding some one handles, adding some two handles, but now the two handles are constrained to only go over one handle exactly three times. That's what's called a mom-n manifold. What's called a mom and manifold, and um, and what right? So, so well, this is so go glance through this, which is um, so I mentioned at the very beginning when we were looking at this horrible picture that we could see these horrible, and if you look at sort of little geodesic arcs between the horrible, you know, those are You know, those are those give potential one handles. And if we see triple of horror balls, those give potential two handles. But in this business, it turns out to sort of, you might guess these are the one handles, these are the two handles, but we're mathematicians. We actually have to justify things that we state. So it turns out that there's lots of technical issues. Well, maybe these handles sort of interact. These handles sort of interacted sort of a nasty way. And so, anyway, this is sort of a technical point. But the bottom line is that what we showed is that if you had a three-manifold, cost-a thief manifold with volume at most 2.848, it's obtained by either filling a MOM2 manifold or a MOM3 manifold, and we explicitly know what those manifolds are, and then And then this question of analyzing the fillings of those manifolds. Analyzing fillings of manifolds actually goes back to Thurston, but it was sort of souped up by Dave Fruder and Jessica Ricell and Cal Faggiani. And so maybe you have to check like four. So, maybe you have to check like 40 fillings, and whatever you needed to know, those fillings are rigorous, whatever. But so, the MOM technology sort of helped with this point. So, anyway, so those are sort of three things that ideas that went into this minimal volume thing. So, oh, so look, I'm sorry if you're offended by the use of this word mom technology. Probably if it was in the modern day, we'd call it maybe parental technology. Maybe parental technology. But the reason we quoted that was because, well, I mean, you know, well, okay, Bill in this paper in 83, you know, he made this sort of statement. So that's where we got, you know, we shouldn't make excuses, but this was our motivation. So, right. So, okay, so now let's talk about cost manifolds. And so there's. So there's, as I mentioned, there's Egl's theorem that there's just, okay, there's Meyerhoff's theorem, which somehow, you know, he just, you know, this is sort of like a really small number, like 2.02, and he really got in there and he was, you know, expanding the cusp a little bit and did some rearrange computer assistance with Chris Chow and things bumped into each other. And things bumped into each other, made sort of explicit control, and got these manifolds. Okay, that was Meyerhoff's theorem. So with Eigol and Yoshida and Zhang, which they're sort of all finally based on sort of the technique that goes into sort of Egle's theorem. And so I wanted to sort of give you some hints about that. So here's, well, let me say sort of the sharp version of the theorem, which is due to Cal Gary, Friedman, Kevin Walker. And that is if you have a complete hyperbolic free manifold and you have like an incompressible surface and you look at the guts of the complementary region, then a lower bound on the volume of the manifold. On the volume of the manifold is V8, which is like 3.666, the volume of the ideal regular octahedron times the oil characteristic of the guts. You meant thinking like, you know, what's this guts business? But, you know, as you all know, that if you take a surface and you, say, an incompressible surface, and you have another incompressible surface, say they intersect along a circle, then you could do like Hawkins. Circle. Then you could do like Hawkins' sum of, you know, 20 of one with maybe one or the other. And you get this surface, which is maybe incompressible, but it's like an enormously large genus. And but the thing is that this surface, if you look at it, you could see because of the cut and paste, there's a lot of sort of product structure and the complement of that surface. So basically, if you have a surface and you see product structure, And you see product structure, you just basically cut out all the product structure. And what you're left with is the gut, is the guts. And so if you have a surface, if you can find a surface, interesting surface, and you look at the gut of the surface, calculate its Euler characteristic multiplied by like 3.66 something, that turns out to be a lower bound on the volume. And the theorem of Calgary-Frien-Walker. Of Calgary Friedman Walker is sort of a sharp form of a theorem of Aegel, Storm, and Thurston. And in the context of their theorem, you had, say, a manifold with boundary, and the boundary had an incompressible surface, which was incompressible, but also ateroidal. So the gut of that surface was, in fact, a whole manifold. Manifold. And using sort of Perlman's monotonicity theorem results, and they prove this beautiful theorem that the minimized volume is the case where that surface is totally geodesic. And studying volumes of totally geodesic surfaces go back to this Miyamoto, who had this beautiful theorem that if you have a manifold of totally geodesic boundary, if you look at the ratio of the volume of the If you look at the ratio of the volume of the manifold to its boundary, it's bigger and equal to V8 volume of this octahedron divided by 4π. So this is the ideas of the Eggles theorem. And there's an issue of getting started, finding closed incompressible surface. And there he had to use sort of deep work of color and shale and then had to modify that, you know, dealing with the gut and so on and so forth. And so forth. So, right. So, I want to say a few words about three cus manifolds, but before I do, let me address sort of another volume question for manifolds, which is, suppose you have a manifold, a cusp manifold with say 10,000 cusps. But you suppose you know that one of those cusps is not too big. Well, maybe not too big. Well, maybe not too big might mean 2.62, like we see on the bottom here. Whoops. Or it might be 1.825. But the theorem of myself and Rob Haraway, Rob Meyerhoff, Nathaniel Thurston, Andrew Yermoa is that if you know that one of those cusps isn't too big, then that means that the manifold itself, in this case, if the volume bound is 2.62, that means the manifold itself. 2.62. That means the manifold itself is obtained by doing gain filling or filling of 16 explicit cusp manifolds. And it turns out 15 of them are two cusp and one of them S776 or three cusp. And furthermore, if you really constrain the volume bound further, like 1.825, then in fact, it's just exactly two manifolds. Just exactly two manifolds, and that's the figure eight knot complement and its sister. And so, some particular consequence of this is these two manifolds, the figure eight knot complement sister, comprise the unique three manifold with a minimal volume cusp. And furthermore, the minimum volume is root three. As you can see, this thing has a little bit of history and going from Meyerhoff down. history and going from Meyerhoff to atoms again you see the the uh you know the atoms ball sort of uh reapp reappear and so um right so so I want to give you like an ever so brief hint about this so um so so the question is how do you like get a grip of these things and well so this is this this picture is sort of the cusp version of the version Of the version of what we had to do for, you know, with Nathaniel Thurston, Rob Marho for this, you know, thick tube log three over two theorem. So the point is, if you have a cusp manifold, so this enormous cusp manifold, million cusps, but one cusp in particular, and you look at a maximal cusp, then there's like three bits of information that sort of give you exactly the geometry of the cusp. And those bits of information. Of the cusp. And those bits of information is the geometry of the torus. So there are these two parabolic isometries: A goes to MA and A goes to NA. So that defines the torus. But there's also this conjugating element, which takes a maximal ball to infinity and infinity to a ball inside the thing, to the atom's ball. So if you know the geometry, the cost of the The cost of the torus plus the transformation takes with the atoms ball, that defines this subgroup of the fundamental group of the manifold, which picks out this maximal cusp. And so Ian Eagle has this beautiful word. He calls such a group a bicuspid group. And if you this theorem using deep work of color and shape. This theorem using deep work of color and shalin that if the volume of this cusp is less than pi, then the bi-cuspid subgroup is in fact finite index in the manifold. And we proved that, in fact, with the 2.62 bound, then this is actually index one. It gives the whole group. But the beauty of this is, here's another idea I want to get across, want to get across to you, is it turns out, you know, You know, you only need three, uh, six real parameters to specify this information. So, and again, one of the beauties of hyperbolic, you know, you know, three-manifold theory is it's all about PSL2C or SL2C. So, those are two by two matrices. Matrices, you want to multiply them together, they're amenable to computation. Computation. So, with a volume balance of 2.62, then we get sort of a compact six real-dimensional parameter space. And we could analyze that, break it up into maybe 3 billion boxes in this case. And it turns out that we dispatch all of them except for a bunch of boxes. And those boxes correspond to relators, which have like G length at most seven. Length at most seven, and those relators correspond to necklaces of horror walls. And so, so, therefore, all these manifolds obtained by filling a necklace of a seven necklace. And well, and we can analyze those. It turns out there's like 26 of them or so, but some of them And, but some of them are fillings of others. So, so, anyway, so that's so that's the idea of this theorem. So, um, so I went over time or I'm going, if you don't mind, I just want to get across one more thing since we started late with the permission of the organizers. Thank you. So, I'd like to just talk about a work in progress with Andrew Yermola and Joy Chen. Andrew Yermala and Joy Chen. And Joy Chen is someone who just graduated from Princeton. And so this is work that sort of started in Joy's senior thesis. And we're trying to address the question of what is the conjecture that S776, which is this link complement over here, that S776. That S776 is the unique three-cus manifold of minimal volume. And there's three basic ideas that we have. And, well, three key ideas. I mean, you could read the words, but one idea is the canonical multi-cusp. The second idea is hybrid mom necklace theory. The third idea is use of the 2.62 theorem. Of the 2.62 theorem. So, in these few minutes, I want to sort of just show you these ideas in action. So, the picture of the left is the canonical multi-cusp of S776. So, what's that? So, as I explained, using thick, thin, Margolis is you have three cusps, and now you just start with them like really tiny volumes. Just start with them like really tiny volume. So each of them have tiny volume, but equal but tiny volume. And now you just start expanding them. And you expand, expand, expand. At one moment, they touch. Maybe all three touch sort of at the same time, but maybe one doesn't. And you could expand that a little further. That's what we call the canonical multicusp. So you can see it in the top left picture. And now look at this top right picture. Look at this top right picture. This is 842, and to make it look sort of three-cusp-ish, I made like one cusp really tiny, and then expanded three others sort of uniformly. So if you, okay, you have to stare at this a long time. But if you stare at those pictures, you can see that you can see a copy of the picture on the right, well, you know, made compact. Compact sitting in the left. So, in other words, look at that. In this picture, there's three cuss: blue, green, and blue, green, and red. And here, and here in both cases, blue is at infinity. So you can see, you know, there's big, big green guy. So there's a one handle from the green guy to infinity, another one handle from the green guy to this tangential red. So So you have these three cusps, and one handle here's from green to the red, one green to the blue. And now we have two, you have to stare at this, but you can see two handles that turned out to be totally geodesic that sort of go over these one handles. Anyway, you know, you have the, it turns out inside of both of these, you see the same exact manifold built by starting with three Tori cross I, adding one handles. I cross I adding one handles two one handles adding two valence four two handles turns out that that the that they these have some other you know very nice combinatorial structure and any three manifold that has these combinatorial structure is diffeomorphic to to this particular manifold and the case at hand if you if you do that to the right it just fills up the whole manifold the case in other hand you you see the the 842 You see the 842 living inside it. And here in the bottom is a picture of that, well, of the topological picture in Joy's thesis, senior thesis. But the point is that if you see this picture in the top left somehow in your manifold, then you can instantly see that it's obtained by filling 842. So here's sort of a non-example, but it's extremely instructive, which is the manifold T12039. It has a pretty big volume, 7.32, which is way bigger than 5.235, but it has the feature that if you look at the canonical multi-cusp, then the volume of these multi-cusps are root two, which is sort of significant. It's sort of significant. And okay, you know, as academics, we like this. So, the blue guy in Infinity, we call her the dean. And the green guy is the associate dean. And the red guys are the minions. And you might wonder why are we calling them that? Because when you now shift to the picture of green is at infinity, you know, the dean is sitting there nicely, is this big, full-sized, you know, red, blue, horrible. You know, red, horror, blue, horrible, but dominions are now these little guys that are just stuck tangent to it. And so, um, right. So, um, so you can see in particular on the left, you see the four, you know, full-size red minions, but the full-size are tangent to the blue. So that manifests itself. If you look at each of those blue guys, you could see sort of, you know, these four tangential minions. Now, sorry, the pointer is not quite working, but whoa, yeah. Whoa, yeah, okay. Well, you could see, like, right here, there's, I'm sorry, on the right, if you just start at like, you know, this blue on the bottom left, and you go up to like one o'clock, you see that this, this minion is shared by the next blue minion. On the other hand, so that's like half of what we want to do in this combinatorial thing. But on the other hand, you know, the other minion, which is going off at five o'clock, is off at five o'clock is not shared with sort of another with another translator the dean so so you know scratch your head and say oh my gosh you know everything's falling apart but then remember the 2.62 theorem and 2.62 theorem says that if if you have a small cusp then um then it's it's it's obtained by filling such and such manifold but there's only one such manifold but there's only one such manifold of three cusps. So the point of the two, so the 2.6 theorem is to tell us that, well, if there was a cusp that was more than equal to 2.62, then already the manifold's three, you know, S776 to start with. Otherwise, that means that if you have a three-cusp manifold, every cusp has volume at least 2.62. Now, Now, it turns out that if this wasn't 7.327, if it was in fact 5.335 or less, then this red guy, you know, the maximal red guy would actually have to be pretty small. I mean, well, you know, but let me just say it has to be small. But we know that when we make it maximal, it could be at least 2.5%. Maximal, it could be at least 2.62. So that means you could just, when we look at this picture, just sitting there as a little minion, we could, that minion can actually be pumped up to be 2.62 without bumping into any other minion. And in this picture, we sort of get a sort of a contradiction where if this was actually sort of something involved with the 5.335 bound, those guys would be cracking. Bound, those guys would be crashing into each other when we expanded them. But no, a false maximal cusp is at most tangential. And the reason, in fact, that, well, so anyway, in the situation of this manifold, the red cusp array is pretty big, 2.121, and the full-sized one. And the full-sized one is not that much bigger, so it needs only expand a little bit in real life. And I should say one final thing is we're so grateful to Snap, Snappy, Snap Eye, and Nathan in particular. I mean, you know, Nathan's like so gracious. I said to him, Nathan, please give us a list of all the three custom manifolds in the census. So he just writes back right away. So he just writes back right away, you know, and just gives us more or less this information. And then we could, you know, as I say, it's a gold mine. That's why he's in gold. You know, you just dig in there, look at the information. Whoops. And so, so, right. But, you know, I'm casually mentioning these things, but this, again, there's a work in progress. It's, here's, whoops, here's, here's sort of like an old, you know. Here's sort of like an old flow chart for what we're trying to do. And it's a little bit complicated, and who knows whether it's going to work out. And when you get nailed these things out, we're mathematicians and there's always potential manifolds are hiding in the cracks. So finally, just as I'm sorry to go so much overtime, but let me just mention one more thing, which is sort of like a totally different realm, but volumes, questions, and these are claims. Volumes, questions, and these are classical things to go back to, you know, Thurston, Milner, and you know, other others that, you know, these really interesting and Burrell, I mean, interesting questions that relations between volumes and manifolds and sort of number theory. In particular, you know, Bill asked, you know, if you look at this set of volumes, it's numbers. Are they all sort of All sort of rationally related, and maybe conjecture is not. And on the other hand, you know, here's this particular manifold, V8, which turns out to be four times catalytic when it's constant. As far as I know, it's not known where that thing's rational. And then there's this theorem of Borel, which somehow relates volume to some variant trace field. And this is an interesting question, sort of being able to. of you're being able to, you know, if you have a, you know, a number field, how to figure out how to, what these numbers are. So anyway, thank you for your attention. Sorry to go over time. Sorry for all the technical problems. But I hope to get across some like basic ideas about volumes of hyperbolic manifolds and try to make the argument that it's really just a fascinating subject. Thank you for your attention. Your attention. Can you say something about why the three cusp case was this gap between two and four in terms of like what makes the three cusp case more difficult to call? More difficult than two and four and four. That's that's an interesting question. Yeah, yeah. So that's a really interesting question. So there's In in case of two, it's a question of having a surface of Euler characteristics. And so, sorry, the thing with God that got has Euler characteristics and therefore the volume of this two cost manifold turned out to be like V8, 3.6. It turns out that the volume of the The four cosmonaut is two times V8. So, therefore, if just knowing those numbers tells you that there's a chance that the answer could come out this way, because the method is to find some surface or maybe some foliation or something, which has this essential gut in the complement. Got in the complement, and then use this conclusion is lower bounds in terms of some Euler characters and multiplied by V8. So it turns out 2, 4, actually 6 also is a multiple of V8, but 3 is not. And in fact, it's a little bit less than 1.5 V8. And so Eight. And so, um, so in fact, I just sort of just didn't have time to say this more, but but uh, Yue Zhang, who got his degree with Ian Agle, and you know, he and Ian had this sort of interesting sutured manifold theorem, which is, you know, relating some of minimizing surfaces and gut, and then UA sort of. And then UA sort of using that to show, pushing some idea further that if anyway, it's sort of technical, but a short answer is just the volume themselves are telling you that there's maybe other issues in three versus two and four or six. Versus two and four or six, actually. There are any other questions? Maybe this volume is finitely one and it's And this finite number grows linearly as volume grows, grow exponentially, or yeah. I don't know that, but I mean, it's certainly the so the number of manifolds that have such and such a volume. So, you're asking about if I if I fake. So you're asking about if I if I fix the number you fix the volume then there are yes so then this number grow like a linearly or well it's possible that if you put certain constraints you might get sort of reasonable growth but just in general the fact is that that if you fix your favorite manifold and and you just take like an en-fold sheeted cover Take like an n-fold sheeted cover, then the volume is going to be n times the original one. And three manifolds have a lot of different covers of the same index. So just purely just looking at the numbers, the number of manifolds, I think it's exponential. But I mean, that should be double-checked. But on the other hand, if you maybe put some constraint, maybe. Maybe the number of, well, even closed manifolds, I mean, covers of closed manifolds are closed. So, so, or maybe you just insist that they're not commensurable, maybe non-commensurable classes that are that have the same volume. You know, that I have no idea. Can I ask a question? Yes. Please ask. Have you thought about the number of manifolds with the same volume, which are all fillings of a single manifold? Oh, so you fix a manifold M, fix one cuss. You fix a manifold M, fix one cusp, and we look at fillings of that single cusp. How many manifolds have the same volume in that setting? They're unlikely to be commensurable, so it might bear on the previous question. Yeah. I don't know. Do you have any thoughts on this? I personally have no idea. I can't find examples where there's more than like eight. Yeah, no, thanks all. But yeah, I'd be very interested if you knew of any references along those lines. Yeah, actually, it's a really very interesting question. And I mean, I haven't really thought about this before. So full disclosure, it came up. Full disclosure, it came up in discussions with Koji Fujiwara. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Thanks all. Okay, any other question to the people by Zoom? No. No, okay, let's thank the speaker again.
