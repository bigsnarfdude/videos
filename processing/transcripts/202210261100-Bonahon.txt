And final point for today. So, Francis Bonhoeffer is going to speak about subset of the area. Yeah, actually, it's a the talk. There will be so much hand waving in this talk that you won't be able to tell whether it's all of them or a few or what. So, it doesn't, it doesn't. What so it doesn't really matter, okay? So, it's a um first of all, before I forget, it's joint work with Helen Wong and Tian Yang, which I'm going to talk about. And so, you know, if you go back to the 1980s, when most of you were not born, not only that, your parents were probably still in kindergarten or something like that. So, there was like two big. There were like two big things. So I grew up in the 70s, mathematically, at a time when topology, that was sort of the topology that there is at this conference, namely 3.5, in dimension 3.5, you know, like the tools were different. Certainly, Heger floor homology didn't exist. But in those days, these were Casson-Gordon invariants. I don't know if you guys know what. Invariance. I don't know if you guys know what that is. That was, and but then in the 80s, there were these two new fields which didn't look like anything else we had done before. So one was quantum topology. And the other one was like a word in Geometry. So, here the brand new thing was this. So, here you have a knot. Okay, I think I have to draw the trefoil and then I'll edit it. And actually, I want to make it a link. That's why I was trying to do in one step. Yeah, it's good enough. And so there was that thing called the Jones polynomial, which was Which was really weird. It didn't look like anything else. So, can we see who's attending? So, I remember Michel Boileau was in Geneva and he came back and he told us there is this guy, Jones, who came to visit and he has his funny environment. Is Michel here? He was there. Yeah, okay, Michelle. Roger, Michel. And but also they so so it looked like anything else we had done before, but then people started understanding it a little better and they and they understood that if you label each component of a link. Of a link with the representation of a quantum group. So that's when I first heard the word quantum group, UQ of D. Well, you get an invariant, which usually is in zero. Which usually it's in Z of Q inverse. It could be a little weirder than that. And so you put in this two-component leak, you put one representation V of your quantum group. Here you put another one. So, you know, that pushed topology to the representation theory in particular. And so the example I'm going to want. Example I'm going to want is when the group is UQ of SL2. That was the original example of Jones. And it has one dimension in each, one irreducible dimension, a representation in each dimension. So let Vn be the, actually it's n plus one dimensional irradium. Irreducible representation. And so you put that on every on every component of the link, and what that spits out is what's called the nth collorder Jones polynomial. So J for Jones, K L for Link. K L for link, for the link, and then n yeah n it's a Laurent polynomial in Q. Okay, so that's quantum topology. Thank you. Yeah, something with the subscripts. Yeah, something with the subscripts. That's a conversation at breakfast time. Sorry for the people who are not at our table. And you're doing N on every component? Yes. Yeah, so you put VN on every component. Yes. Yeah, thank you. That's important. Okay, now hyperbolic geometry. Well, that was this theorem of Thurston. We say that for most, so where most is something well defined, but I don't want to say, links L in S3, there exists a unique, so unique is really important, hyperbolic metric on the complement of the link. If you don't know what hyperbolic metric, If you don't know what hyperludic means, it's fine. Just you know the word, I think. And so, in particular, in this case, you get many, also, you met many different many invariants and example. The simplest one we can think about is to take the volume, so the volume of the hyperbolic metric of Of this complement of the link. And so, because the metric is unique up to isometry, this volume is unique. And what's weird here is that it's a real number. It's a positive real number. So it's a real number and usually very transcendental, which is not the kind of invariance we can find in classical topology. I mean, usually all the invariants are sort of integer-based. I mean, okay, you divide by one-half, perhaps, or some rational at least. Okay. And so the two fields are very different. And, you know, I branched out here and didn't think very highly of those guys. However, what really brought me to contact... Drew my attention brought me to quantum topology was this cache IF volume conjecture around 2000 and which is the following so you you take this setup and uh you so forth So for every, so now I have to be there. So you take J L N and Q. Q is a polynomial, so you can plug in whatever variable you want. And so for N, I'm going to plug in a Q, a root of unity. And this one here, 2 pi i over n. If I plug in the wrong one, it's not going to work. It has to be sort of like, for instance, pi i of minus. Minus exponential pi r over n, that's another root of unity that would not work. So I plug in this, I get a number, and I look at what's happening as n goes to infinity. Well, you do it and gets very, very big. Well, if it is very big, you can see how big it is. So you take the modulus. The modulus. It's a complex number, this guy. So the modulus is a real number. He goes to infinity very fast. So to see how fast he goes, you take the log and you divide by one over n. Namely, you take, so you have exponential growth. You compute the rate of exponential growth. That's what, if I take the limit, that's exactly what I'm doing. And the conjecture says that not only there is a limit, that's all reasonable. Only there is a limit, that's all reasonable, but it's precisely the hyperbolic volume, except with the one over two pi here. Okay, so it was a very brave conjecture of cache IF made on essentially three examples, actually, and none of them rigorous, but But it's very interesting because it combines these two things. Quantum topology is very combinatorial. You can compute these things explicitly. There are issues of complexity, as Dror can explain to you, computational complexity. But in theory, you can compute everything. Here, you have to find the solution. You have to find the Find the solution, you have to find the hyperbolic metric, it's not that easy. You have to solve an equation, that's why you get something irrational. And so, the way I say it is that here you have to be smart. You have to be able to find the solution to an equation. Here, you can just compute as much as you want. And so, the conjecture relates these two things. These two things. And now, I would like to ask the organizers, why did you invite me? Because it's about using quantum invariance to do interesting topology. So, first of all, interesting topology, I don't know if I've ever done that. That's one thing. But the other reason is that this conjecture, so you would think that you wanted something. So, personally, I think of this. That something, so personally, I think of this really as a topological environment, as topology. It's metric, it's very concrete, it's a geometric. This is algebraic. So I understand. So you probably want an arrow going from here, from this blackboard here to this one. But actually, the way this works is more like what you know here, you can use here. So it goes sort of backwards. And for instance, if you had a proof of this, that would be a very ineffective way, I think, to compute the hyperbolic volume because this theorem here can be made effective relatively efficiently, with software like Snappy or Snappy. And whereas, as I said, there are complexity issues in computing the John's. Issues in computing the Jones polynomial. And then, in addition, it would be a very ineffective way of doing this. And even computing this is very ineffective. And the reason is because when you compute the Enz-Jones polynomial as a polynomial in Q, it's huge. And then if you plug in this root of unity, there are many, many cancellations. And the sum, so the And the sum, so it's a so, yeah, it's a polynomial, but the value actually is much smaller than the size of the largest terms in the sum. So you have this cancellation, and they are not, as far as I can tell, they are not cancellations on the nose. They are asymptotic cancellations. So there is some very interesting mark there. But But um I was not that you gave up yes okay okay okay I was worried that you would cancel the invitation it's too late now okay so that actually what drew me in this field here which I didn't Me in this field here, which I didn't know anything about. I wanted to do something else at some point. And I thought that was pretty exciting. So I knew a lot of things here, didn't know anything here. And you can sort of see a part. So what I would like to do today, certainly is not that we have a proof on this, but I'm going to try your feeling at least about how from this kind of quantum world you can see the hyperbolic geometry. And so this is based. And so this is based on a long-term program I've had with Helen, okay, that's fine, which is about the representation theory of the Kauffman brackets. Skin Agile So scan of surface so of a surface S yes and S Q like this so what's that so S is the surface and I'm not going to say Not going to say what that is, just actually, no, I'm going to first, I'm going to explain something about this. So that's what this statement here is what's called the modern version of the conjecture. That was not the original version because this, so why did Cacha F take the Jones polynomial? Take the Jones polynomial and had this idea of evaluating it at this value. I mean, that looks weird, eh? So there was a precursor of cache IF which defined an invariant, so special case, yes. Well you have You have so an invariant K for cache IF Q, and so it's an invariant of a three-manifold and of a link inside of a three-manifold like that. So okay, and so Cash IEF created. And so Kashaf created an invariant with quotes, namely, so the Kashaev was a real physicist in those days and compute, compute, compute, and tried to make sense of audio computing after the fact, not before, which usually is not what we do. So he created that thing, except he was an invalid, he couldn't show that he was independent of the choices. And so that was done by Vasillac. And Benedetti. And actually, Basiliac and Benedetti realized that you need to give yourself something else, which is where R is a group homomorphism over the whole surface, not the complements, over the whole three manifold, not the complement. The complement to PSL2C to make sure that everything was now, of course, if you consider a link in S3, you need a homomorphism from the trivial group to PSL2C. It's fine. You don't need that. But in this full generality, and so and Kashayev had made his conjecture in this case, if they had stayed like this, nobody would have cared about it, but the Muraka. But the Murakami Hitoshi and June Murakami converted this to observed that this is equal to that. And so that became much more interesting for topologists. Trying to do. Thank you. So the question was: what was Kashayev's intuition? And the idea was to copy Torayev Vero. It's in particular something which is important. Something which is important is that this is defined using a triangulation of the three-manifold, which is well behaved respect to the link. And it turns out that that looks much more like the kind of techniques people use to construct the hyperbolic metric on the Nord complements. You can, because you have these techniques of taking ideal to. Have these techniques of taking ideal triangulations of the North complemented way. So that looks very much the same. So, which is why I started being interested in this, still not completely understand. So, this is three-dimensional topology is difficult. So, I and Helen, we decided to go down to dimension two or 2.5, perhaps, because it's about the scale algebra. So, now that some people know what that is. Some people know what that is, but this is this is so the elements here. So the elements are represented, so it's generated. Let me put it this way. It's generated by links. L in the thickening of the surface. And there are relations, modulo scan relations. So, which I'm not going to say what that is, first of all, because Druh doesn't like them. No, he just said they are ineffective. He didn't say he doesn't like them. Like them, and um, and it's not important, and so it's um, so except this fits like in the bigger patterns. So, so you know, the Jones polynomial, even the original point of view of Jones that came out of nowhere, but then we start having a more global picture. So, in particular, we can put the Jones polynomial within a framework of a TQFT where Where, so it's a TQFT, where to each surface you associate a vector space, and then the morphisms of the TQFT they are coborisms with links inside. So, if you try to guess the TQFT, so in particular, if you think about it, this is a morphism in the TQFT. So, when you have a representation that's the same as Presentation: that's the same as saying that that associates. So, when you have an element of caproman bracket scale algebra, the TQFT should associate a linear homomorphism from the vector space associated to the surface to itself. And well, that's a representation of the scale algebra. And so, the reason why you want to be interested in this is a way to guess the vector space associated. Vector space associated to the surface by the TQFT. So that's one motivation. And I forgot to say, so when Q is a root of unity, otherwise you won't get things that are finite dimensional. So that was the motivation for what we did with Helen. And actually, that was great because what we started doing is Great because what we started doing is importing ideas from hyperlink geometry to quantum topology, and that ended up working pretty well. So, for instance, we our big discovery was to find weird central elements in that scale algebra, which were not completely predictable. Okay, and so out of this, I'm going to give you an application. So, let's try. Phi from S to S be a diffeomorphism or home or it doesn't matter. And what these so what this representation theory tells you is that there exist many representation row. So from the scale algebra of the link. Of the link of the surface. So, what's a representation of an algebra? It's an algebra homomorphism from the algebra to a group of, to an algebra of, say, matrices, or if you want, linear endomorphisms of a vector space V. And then in this case, actually, but V is very big. So, if Q is a root of unity of order N, the dimension of V. The dimension of V is n to the power of something which depends on the topology. So, for instance, it's 3G minus 3 plus P if the surface has genus G and P punctures, for instance. I mean, that's so there means there exists many representations that are invariant. Under the action phi. So phi is a different mortism of the surface. So it acts on anything that is associated to the surface. So in particular, it acts on the scan algebra. And so you can, so it phi acts like this. Let's call this phi star to say it's the action. Start to say it's the action. And so if you have a representation rho, well, you can compose it with the action. And so you have rho composed with phi star. That should be equal to rho of, let's say, x, x for every x in the scale algebra, but the invariance is up to isomorphism. Invariance is up to isomorphism, which comes out to be important because what that means is that these guys are not equal, means that there exists lambda going from the vector space to itself. So there is a matrix that conjugates this matrix here to that one here. matrix here to that one here. So L lambda composed, composed, lambda inverse. Okay, so now when I was young, we would classify objects up to isomorphism. And then we say, oh, I'm done it, I'm done. But you youngsters, you learn something much better, which is that knowing that two objects are isomorphic is not enough. You can also focus on the isomorphism. On the isomorphism. And then you know that you get something, you get an invariant in one dimension higher. So here, this setup here is apparently purely two-dimensional. This Kauffman bracket algebra, you define it by pictures of knots or diagrams of knots on the surface with a certain relation. So that looks like it's purely two-dimensional. Looks like it's purely two-dimensional. However, if we do that, actually, we're going to see the three dimensions appear. And so, now in this setup, so first of all, so this lambda here, because it depends on phi and it depends on the order of the root of unity, and it depends on. It depends on Q, but so we have this new conjecture. So that's with Helen, which is the following. You have, so this intertwiner, phi n. So this is, you have to think of this as a matrix where the size of the matrix is this power of n. So it's very big. Big, um, so you're going to tell me that uh you could rescale lambda, you're not changing the property here, so there is a way to normalize it. I mean, like we can always normalize it so like the determinant is one. That's um and if you determine if you do that when I take the trace and I take the absolute value of the modulus of the trace, it doesn't depend. It doesn't depend on, it's well defined, it doesn't depend on a choice. And then we have: we take the log, we take one over n, we take the limit as n tends to infinity, namely we take the order of exponential growth of this guy as n tends to infinity. And that's a hyperbolic volume. So I said we should get something which is three-dimensional. Three-dimensional, and that's the mapping toss, namely and phi. This is you take the surface, you take the product, maybe you thicken it, and then you glue one side to the other by the relation that x zero is glued to phi of x. Glued to phi of x one. So that's it's a it's a standard construction. Look, I told you I was going to be so much hand waving. But here you're telling me, do you want to exclude something, or do you want to actually speak with our PR today? I probably don't. I probably don't want phi to be the infinity to be the identity, for instance. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. I want it, uh, for instance, I want this guy to have a hyperbolic metric. Yeah, ah, okay. Hand waving, hand waving, hand waving. Okay, and then to make it so originally that was something that was not a conjecture, that was called wild hope. So we did some. So, we did some simulations, and we get to a conjecture which is obviously true because it seems to be numerically true. So, for SS, you take N. I forgot to say that here for our machinery to work, we need N to be even. No, N odd, sorry. There are versions for N even, we're not that. Even one of that. Oh, I also forgot to give credit here. To go back, so originally there is work of me and Helen, but then there is another, so we construct the map a good way, but there was a reverse construction due to two groups. One is the regional topological group of people you know, Charlie Froman, Joanna Kanya Bartoczynski. Joanna Kanya Bartuczinska. If you're founded by NSF, you know her and you're very grateful to her. And Tangle. So these are the topologies, but there is another group of representation theorists around David Jordan. So there is Jordan Ganeff and Pavel Safronov. So they've been involved with that. And so we sort of almost So we sort of almost an if and only if here. In theory, to do this construction, you only need the work of Helen and I, but if you want to say it nicely, you need the work of the other guys. So yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. No link like here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only a surface. Only a surface. Yeah, thank you. That's it. So let's plot it for n odd. So, I have a surface and I have the diffeimorphism. So, I take the trace. No, I take this guy here. So, I take one over n log trace of lambda by n. So, I fixed the diffeimorphism. I said that there are many here, indeed, yes, and there are parameters. And they are parametrized by some geometric data which I don't want to discuss. And I fix that one too, in addition to phi. But the output obviously does not depend on this. And so you plot and then you see, so first you see something which with my first plot looked weird because you see something which depends on so n in odd so N in odd, so that means that the class modulo two is uniquely determined, but there is a plot depending on n mod four. So you go up, down, up, down, but you sort of see two curves. And they do seem to converge to an asymptote. They seem to be a common asyptote, and actually, you can. And actually, you can with Mathematica, you can get a very good estimation of the asymptote with the fitting algorithm. And you look, and so you see the correct conjecture. Originally, we wanted one over two pi, of course, but it's one over four pi to get the correct conjecture. Okay, so that's exciting. Okay, so that's exciting. Now we have a conjecture which is true. At least when all our plots are for the case of the one-puncture torus, but it's good enough. It's much better than what Cachaev had when he started. And the thing is that it's much smaller. So in particular, the attraction here is this, is that this is, so why did you want to do this is because it's very closely related to this point of view. Point of view. And indeed, we're going to see triangulations in the involved three manifold, which can be used for both computing the invariant and computing the limits. So the two are very well behaved. Okay, so it's a new conjecture, and of course, we And of course, we don't have a proof either. So we start with a conjecture, and then what we did is we made another one. And there is no reason. However, there is a little bit of progress, which makes us quite optimistic, at least from a yes, Melissa. Okay, Melissa. Okay, Melissa, perhaps that's a naive question. Yeah, I'm supposed to repeat. But I need to think about maybe I need to add. So if I have a fiber knot, is this key related to the disease morphisms that I get for that? So if you have a fiber knot, you can do that for where the surface will be the fiber. And so the I didn't. So, I didn't say what the surface had to be because, again, the hand-waving principle, but you can allow punctures. So, there are things you can do. Actually, I will do it with a punctured torus. So, you can do that with the fiber and the monodromy of the fiber dot. And then you get this intertwiner here, and you can define an intertwiner like that. And then you can have. Like that, and then you can have exactly the same conjecture, and that would be the volume of your file or not complement. Yeah, which was not that naive, actually. Okay, um, and so so here is our theorem. So it's meat plus panel. Plus canon and then Wen Roltian because he knows he knows quite a bit more Hyperlook geometry than we do and so this is true so the conjecture true for many different Of the one functor for S. So that will be the case, S, that will be S11. So it's much more narrow. It's by focusing on a very specific surface, well, the smallest interesting surface, let's put it this way. Interesting surface, let's put it this way. And what does many mean? Well, it's something which is time-dependent because we currently have to put many restrictions and then we are progressively decreasing decreases. So it's a series of three papers, and we put out the first two on the archive a year ago, and there is a reason why the third one. Why is the third one not there yet? It's because it's taking forever to put it nicely together, and in particular, the hypothesis we need keep decreasing, but we're still not there yet. So, but I want to explain at least the principle again with a lot of hand waving. So, where are my notes? Sorry. Sorry. Why you can't use uh angular as a simple purpose like this? Uh yeah, uh no no hyperbolic metric on the mapping torus. Yeah. Yes. So so my feeling, so so you know, it's like the cache I have volume conjecture. Well, the first thing people did is to prove it for torus nodes, where there is no hyperbolic metric, so it just puts zero. Hyperbolic metric, so you just put zero here. It's not incredibly interesting, you want something where there is some meat, right? And so that's where you want high public geometry to make an appearance. Okay, so what's good about the one-puncture torus is that if you look at the mapping class group of the one-puncture torus, so mapping. So, mapping for instance that pi zero of z plus you know that this is isomorphic to SL2Z. So, it's a it's a rather simple mapping, it's a rather simple mapping class group, which is well understood. So, in particular, the combinatorics of these guys. So, in particular, phi, so that gives us that we have a natural. That gives us that we have a natural decomposition of file, the diffeomorphism file, which is here, into elementary pieces. And so that has two effects. One effect on the quantum topology: once you've decomposed five into elementary pieces, if you do. Fine to elementary pieces, if you do it well, you have a decomposition of the computation of this intertwiner into elementary pieces. Elementary pieces. So that makes on the quantum topology side, that makes the computation easy. In theory, you can always do it, but here it's much easier. And on the hyperbolic side, you get a nice decomposition of the material torus into, and so I'm going to explain that on the other board. I think I can get rid of that. I think I can get rid of the objections. You know, try to focus on the good boards. The two black boards here, once you prime them a little bit, they're actually quite good. It's the green ones that are bad. So here is the mapping torus. Here is the one-punctured torus. Actually, I should use color. I insisted to have colors. That's the surface, and then you thicken it and you blue. So the picture is like this, if you want. And then every time you have one of those pieces, this is to create what's called an ideal triangle. Angular. So it's topological. I dream tetrahedron, sorry. Three-dimensionals. So that's something which looks like a tetrahedron, except you remove the except that you remove the vertices, or more precisely, you send the vertices to the cusp. So that gives you. So that gives you. So this is, you have the cusp here, and so that gives you things like this. So I don't know if I can draw that thing. Perhaps like this. Like this. And like this, perhaps. Perhaps that's, I think that's right. So it's something like this. So you have a nice decomposition, and you have exactly one tetrahedron. Have exactly one tetrahedron for each piece in the decomposition of the Diffie-Module. So it's something fairly classical. And not only is classical, but it's being used to understand the hyperbolic geometry of non-vapping torrents. In particular, François Guerrito did that in his thesis in the mid-2000s. Okay, and so then I have five minutes just to get a sleep. Okay, I said with this we can do the computation. Okay, so it's a quantum invariant, and if there are k pieces. And if there are k pieces, you're going to get a big sum over k indices, i1, ik, going from one to n. And that's sort of what you expect when you do a computation like that. And then you have the, so that's, so I'm computing the trace of lambda of phi n of the intertwiner. There is a There is something here which I'm not going to talk about. That was the norm. Remember, I had to normalize so that the determinant is one. That creates something in front which is not important. Okay, and then you have these terms and they are sort of like powers of q. And q, I do like it or not, I don't know, it should be exponential 2 pi i over n, exactly like in the cache I have conjecture. So if we So, when you take power, you get exponential of something in n, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so, you can reorder these things. So, the principle is this. If you take Q to the power j, that exponential 2 pi j over n i. The point is that this guy here looks like an angle. And so, when you rephrase this, you find. rephrase this you find you you can write it as exponential of n over 4 pi i and then something which depends on n, a certain expression, and then 2 pi i1 over n, 2 pi i2, and so on, 2 pi i k over n. And then you have coefficients in font, let's call that g n and all. Let's call that g n. And also, if you can rewrite them as a functions 2 pi i1 over n, 2 pi i k over n. Things which do like functions of angles. So we're trying to go from the combinatorics to the geometry. So angles, that's already a little geometric. And then I said I was going to do some hand waving, but I'm going to do something worse. I'm going to I'm going to do something worse. I'm going to lie. Look, you have a sum like this, and so g n and f n, so these are functions, and they tend to, they have limits, g infinity and f infinity as n tends to infinity. So there is a limit, you can compute. I mean, you can sort of compute. Compute and uh, and so my big lie is to say, look at this, it's a Riemann sum, right? Over the torus, and so that's clearly going to be a multiple integral over r k. And these things are periodic, so 2 pi, 2 pi z k. So that looks like we're taking some over a discrete subset of the torus. Of the torus, and um, okay, you know, it's a Riemann sum, we know to approximate it, so that's the limit is going to be approximately g infinity of x1, xk, and then exponential. So, let me keep the n here to be nice, 4π i, and then f infinity of x1, xk, dx1. Dx1 dxk. Okay, and then here we need like an n over 4π and then over 2 pi to the power k. So that's the approximation of Riemann's sum by an integral. Well, of course, there are big lies everywhere because when we teach calculus, we also teach something about error terms. And look at this function with an n here. So this is bad. So actually, to justify that. So, actually, to justify that, you need to use the harmonic analysis and the Poisson summation formula. So, it's a horrible thing. It's a rather difficult analysis. But let me lie with that. And then I have one minute to explain the topology. And the topology is that it's these saddle point methods to find the asymptotics of this as n goes to infinity. So we're interested. So let's call this. We're interested, so let's call this TK or Taurus. So, actually, I'm going to do it here. So, we are integrating over this torus TK. So, I'm drawing the picture for K equal one. And if you look at this, if you're naive, you say, well, you know, we have an exponential here. You know, exponential is very sensitive to slight differences, right? To slight differences, right? So with this huge n here. So when F infinity is large, then this is going to be very, very large and completely negligible compared to the other points where it's not as large, namely things we should not cancel out. And then And so the important part would be where the imaginary part, where sorry, where so the main contribution should come from the place where this is as large as possible. So and if you observe that the absolute there is a little bit of algebra here, that if you take the modulus to see where it's big, you take this of F infinity. Of f infinity, you find that this is exponential of n over 4π times the imaginary part. And so the largest term will be when the imaginary part is large. So where imaginary part of this F infinity is large. Well, so then what you do is that you complexify. So that would be naive, but if you're a little less naive and if you're If you're a little less naive and if you're a topologist, we can complexify. And instead of taking Tk, which is Rk mod two pi Zk, we can take CK mod two pi ZK. It turns out that this guy is holomorphic, so it has an extension. Extension. And so you're integrating over this. Let me put the maximum here instead for my picture. And what you know is that if you look at the level curves or level surfaces of F infinity, the fact this maximum means that the level curves, they probably look like this, right? If you look in the complexified version. And you also know that if you deform the integration domain, you can do this. So what I'm proving. You can do this. So, what I'm proving to you is that there is a way, and also you remember that because it's holomorphic, the integral over Tk at, where I deform, is the same of my integral, it's the same as the integral over TK. So, this is showing you that actually that was a bad idea, and what's happening. That actually was a bad idea, and what's happening is that there are cancellations. But the principle is that you can deform so that you go through the saddle points, in this case, critical points of index K, because we have K dimension. And it turns out that this is what did be asymptotic. And so, what I have been hoping to explain is how, so actually. Is how so so actually we can do this explicit sort of explicitly, except uh the um I was hoping to explain to you how in this process because of the shape of this function f infinity, so f infinity is very explicit, involves the dialogarithm function as well as the quadratic part. And it turns out that finding critical points for that function is exactly the kind of math. Is exactly the kind of math people have to do. Where is my picture here? To define the hyperbolic metric, to construct the hyperbolic metric on this mapping torus. And there are two key words here. One is angle structure, and the other one is volume maximization. So these are standard techniques in hyperbolic geometry to construct the hyperbolic matrix. And we find exactly because of the combinatorics. Exactly, because of the combinatorics, we find exactly the same problem in both cases. I mean, the same thing. Now, in hyperbolic geometry, we know that we have to be to be for it to work, you have to worry about things degenerating. That's why we need a geometric hypothesis on the geometry of the mapping torus. And so, we know many examples where they are satisfied. We suspect that there are always. Satisfied. We suspect that they are always satisfied, but that we're not there yet. Yeah. Thank you. Sorry, I went over. So, so you say conjecture is true for many. Does many mean most? In other words, is it? mean most? In other words, is it generically true, generically proven or generically not yet proven? So it's many elements of SL2Z. So first of all, I'm not sure what that means generically. Take a big ball, it's not most. It's at this point, well, it depends on how strong of a geometry condition we put, but there are definitely a few where we do not. Definitely a few where we do not know how to make it work. Yeah. That's all I can tell you. But it's still progress. Yeah, no, no, no, sure. But I'm just curious. Is it almost everywhere true or almost everywhere not true? No, I would say 10%. It doesn't make any sense, of course. No, it actually does. Probably if you look at a big ball in SLP. A big ball in SL2Z, and ask yourself which fraction have you proven? It probably converges to either zero or one. SL2Z is not in a minimal group. So you cannot say things like that because it depends on how you put the metric on the wall. Yeah, I mean, you remember, I said it was going to be very hand-waving. Yeah, okay. So, Melissa behind you. Thank you. I am going to ask a question. I don't know if you've already told me and I'm just asking for more details or if this is not how you did this, but I'm reaching way back into my memory. If I take an angle structure on the mapping tours given by these Pactor moves from train tracks from like Eagle's description, yes. Yes. Can you combinatorily? What is like the so it's let me just say it like this: it's this kind of mathematics, it's this kind of mathematics that is there, yes. So uh so for instance, quickly, there is so this is actually relatively new in our understanding of what's happening. A point here, x1, xk, that's actually equivalent to an angle structure, okay, and and then. And then, so this process of moving like this that gives us, then when we do that, the value of the critical point will the value for a given point as we move here, that will be the volume of the angle structure, the hyperbolic volume. And then we maximize that volume, which is exactly what people do. Like, yeah, so. Yeah. So it's really the kind of mathematics you have in your head. So the natural decomposition into elementary pieces is these decomposition matter pieces. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's these matrices L and R in the case of the punctured torus. Yeah, so it's a layered ideal triangulation. Okay, great. Yeah. So if you come from Boston College, you know both the hyperling geometry and the quantum. Hyperlink geometry and the quantum topology. But most, I assume, I forgot. I forgot about you, Melissa. I think most people here don't know much about hyperbolic geometry. Me neither. Mike? Okay, great. Question from someone who doesn't know the hyperbolic geometry at all. So I think, if I remember right, the formula for the dimension of V is actually saying that V is one dimension. Of v is actually saying that v is one-dimensional here. Is that right? So, like, trace of lambda is lambda. Is that true? Um, I mean, your genus is one and you have one puncture. Um, yeah, so in this case, it's dimension one, yes, that makes it so it's uh it's polynomial growth, yes, n. The dimension is one no, oh, in that case, no, uh, our matrices is of size n for the one function. For the one-punctured torus. So perhaps I gave the wrong formula, or perhaps the formula does not work for the one-punctured torus. I have to see. Genius. I felt like it was independent of N. No, no, it's N to the power. So I think I still saw it on the board somewhere. Perhaps not. But it was like 3G minus 3 plus P. 3g minus 3 plus p, that's g is 1, p is 1, so that's 1. So it's n to the power. Oh, it's n to the power of 1. n to the power 1. So that's the different date size n. Okay, yeah. So, okay, so it gets larger. Okay, but I guess I was thinking the other surface I could think where this quantity is, well, I guess it's just n. I was thinking just one. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's n, but it's definitely n. Okay. Listen, otherwise, it would probably be not very interesting. Well, that's kind of well. That's kind of well, okay. I still want you to follow up with the other surface I can think of that would still only be n, then I guess is the four-punctured sphere. Is that the combinatorics are probably the same? Probably that can work as well. Yes. Okay, so you could do something exactly. Okay, great. Thank you. So I think now I'm really reaching. So I think there there are setups where you can compute invariance and quantum invariance in particular by invariance and quantum invariance in particular by looking at triangulations and adding triangle at a time yeah and so this fits into that framework adding tetrahedra i did i what did i say you said triangle yeah i meant exactly so that's yeah tetrahedra which in two dimension is called a diagonal exchange right and so um just to fit just i think i'm asking you to repeat something but in this process as we build up the diffeomorphism We build up the diffheomorphism. What the invariant is this intertwiner that you're building? Yeah, and then okay. Um, the trace, the trace of the trace, the trace because the invariant is only defined up to conjugation. Now, you could you could take uh transfer invariants up to conjugation other than the trace, but look, that's enough. I mean, uh, you look in QFTs, that's what you expect, the trace. Yeah, so this is this is a us, this is like a first case of Is like a first case of your setup in for general genus, but it's also a first case of take whichever invariant and how it's changing, which is how you build that entire setup. This really is what we have in mind. Okay, so I was kind of the reason why we started not the original work with Helen, but starting looking at this conjecture for us was a test case, see if we could develop new techniques to attack these kinds of problems. And so far, it's been working. Problems. And so far, it's been working. Yeah. I mean, why not totally exhaust the one punctured? Yeah, a lot of people think that the one puncture torus is a little limiting. Yeah. I sort of like it. Are there further questions? Maybe also from online? All right. All right, then let's thank our speaker. May I ask a question? Yes, please do. Perhaps I am wrong. I was remembering from the work of Basayak and Benedettis that in some sense, a key point from this Cache F conjecture was to understand the asymptotic of the quantum delogarit. And you say that. And you say that your F infinity is the dilogarit. Is this appearing in your proof? No, so the no, the quantum dilogarithm occurs in these things as a tool. It's even true for cache IF. The quantum dialogarithm is a tool to understand the asymptotics of these 6J symbols that underlie Cache IF's construction. Now, there are many good problems related to that, but here it appears as a tool more than as a goal. It was not sufficient for the Cache AF conjecture. If you prove that it's asymptotic, is this Roger Dilograph, the way to compute the volume? It's not sufficient. It's not sufficient to know that. Yeah. Okay. I mean, this is, yeah. And of course, this uses the fact that the quantum dialogarithm is a deformation of the classical dilogarithm. And in particular, what we see when we do that is not just the dilogarithm, but the Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm, the thing that is really connected to hyperbolic geometry. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Bonjour, Michel. Further questions? All right, then let's thank Francis one more time.
