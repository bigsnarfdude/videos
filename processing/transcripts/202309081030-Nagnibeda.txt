Thank you very much for the introduction and also for inviting me to speak. So, I'm sorry that I cannot see you all in person. And also, I did not participate and listen to previous talks as much as I would have liked to because it was the week of exams here in Geneva. So, it is pretty busy. Our semester starts in two weeks. Starts in two weeks. But I hope it was a successful conference for you. And so I hope I will not tire you too much with the last talk. The conference is about groups acting on counter sets. And so in my case, the counter set will be the boundary of an infinite rooted tree. So I'm sure you have already talked about it during this week. And you also know that one of the You also know that one of the tools to study such group actions, so groups acting on infinite-rooted trees and, in particular, the actions on the boundary, one of the tools is the Shire graphs associated to these actions. So, one particular example of an application of this tool that you have seen during one of the talks was in Vologia's talk. So, Shiregraf's So, shire graphs were used in his constructions of groups with new properties. And today, I will talk about a different application. So it's application of these shire graphs to spectral graph theory. So I will start with a little motivation to tell you about what is spectral graph theory. Then I will tell you about the groups and the shadow. About the groups and the share graphs that I will consider, and then the results, what we prove about these graphs from the spectral theory viewpoint. Okay, so yes, so the spectral graph theory does the following thing. It takes a graph, finite or infinite. So, more classically, it was a finite graph, but now more and more attention. More and more attention also shifts to infinite graphs. And you look at some operators acting on the functions defined on the vertices of the graph. Also, it can be functions defined on the edges, but we will just concentrate on the most classical case. So, the operators defined on the functions on the vertices of the graph. And so, this is an operator acting on some space, it has a spectrum. Space, it has a spectrum, it has some spectral properties, and we would like to understand how those are related to the geometry of the graph. And one of the most catchy questions asked about all this setup is the question, actually, the title of the paper of Mark Katz in the 60s: Can one hear the shape of a drum? So, the idea is that, well, a drum is some domain. Some domain in Euclidean space, so maybe a manifold or a graph. And you suppose you know you define some operator on it and you know its spectrum. And then can you hear the shape? So can you distinguish, understand the shape of the domain, the geometry of the manifold or of the graph from the spectral data? Maybe just the spectrum, the spectrum, and also the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions, and so on. Eigen functions and so on. So, to be more precise, the operators that we will consider are the following. So, to a graph gamma, we associate either its adjacency matrix. So, this is just the matrix that puts one, it's indexed square matrix indexed by the vertices of the graph, and you put one if two vertices are related by an edge and zero if not. Or you can take. Or you can take the discrete Laplacian, which is closely related to the adjacency matrix. I will explain how. Or the one which actually will be our choice for today, the Markov operator. So this is just some normalization of the adjacency matrix. And it corresponds also to the simple random walk on the graph. So it just means that instead of putting y, Instead of putting one when two vertices are related by an edge in your matrix, you put a weight so that the sum over every column and every line in the matrix is equal to one. So it becomes a stochastic matrix. So these operators, these matrices, you look at them as operators on the space of functions on the vertices of your graph. So typically we work with the L2. Typically, we work with the L2 space, a little L2, because it's indiscrete, right? And important class of examples with which we would like to work are either Kaylee graphs or maybe more generally, Kaylee graphs, but not of groups, not of free actions of the group on itself, but of some other actions. And so this class of graphs. So, this class of graphs is what we call Schreier graphs. Well, the definition of the Kelly graph here, I'm sure everyone knows. So, let me be a little bit more specific about Schreier graphs. So, let us go about it this way. Let us first define the Markov operator, right? So, if our graph is a Kelly graph, say, then the edges are labeled by generators and going Generators and going from a vertex, so vertices are elements of the group, going from a vertex g to some neighbor along an edge just means multiplying g by some generator s, right? And you have as many neighbors of a vertex g as there are generators, because to each generator corresponds some edge in the Kelly graph. And every edge has this weight. If you just consider the simplest random walk, so you go in. A random walk, so you go in all directions with equal probabilities. So your matrix acts on functions on the graph, on purchase of the graph, in this way. You multiply by this, you act by this operator. And you act on the space L2 of G. So G here is the group or the vertices of your graph. So now, if you just look at this expression, this is clearly an element of the group. This is clearly an element of the group algebra. And so making it act on L2 of G just means that you consider this element of the group algebra in the left regular representation of your group, right? But you can also consider it in some different representation, and one very natural choice would be to consider a quasi-regular representation that corresponds to some subgroup. So suppose H is some subgroup of G, then we can consider the quasi-regular regular. Then we can consider the quasi-regular representation. So it means that it will be the representation on L2 now on the quotient. So we will consider L2 functions, still with the L2 conditions, but which will be constant on the cosets with respect to H. And so if you think about this as an operator on functions on some graph, then this would mean that we will look at the quotient of the Cayley graph of G by H, and this is exactly what is called the Schreier graph. What is called the Schreier graph, sorry, the Schreier graph of G with respect to H and with respect to the generating set S. So the set of vertices is the set of cosets, and the edges in the graph are constructed exactly in the same way as in the Kelly graph. So two cosets are related by an edge labeled by little s, a generator. If you can go from one coset to another by multiplying Go from one closet to another by multiplying by this generator. And so the operator, this expression here, this element of the group algebra considered in the quasi-regular representation corresponding to H becomes the Markov operator of the simple random book with respect to generators S, but now on the Schreier graph. On the Schreier graph with respect to the subgroup H. Now, there is also an intrinsic way to define the Schreier graph for any action, any transitive action. Suppose that we just have some action of a group on a set and we fix the generating set. Then for every orbit, we can define the orbital Schreier graph. The vertices of the graph. The vertices of the graph are the points in the orbit, and the edges are they just trace how the generators of your group, the orbit of the generators. So you go from a point in the orbit to a point of the shape S times W, where W is a point and S is a generator. And so the two descriptions. And so the two descriptions give exactly the same if you consider these graphs as rooted, oriented, and labeled. So labeled by elements of S and rooted at the trivial coset or at some point that we've chosen. So choosing the root corresponds to conjugating the subgroup with respect to which. The subgroup with respect to which the share graph is taken. Okay, so I hope we are fine with the definition of share graph and also with the Markov operators. So we will consider Markov operators both on Kelly graphs and on share graphs. And here I put it down again how it acts. So this operator acts on functions f. Operator acts on functions f on the vertices of the graph by this formula. And because we have this normalization here, it is, as I mentioned, a stochastic operator. And so it's also a self-adjoint operator because the matrix is symmetric. And so what we can immediately say is that this is an operator in a Hilbert space whose Who is self-adjoint. So its spectrum is real and it's also bounded. And the spectrum is actually contained in the interval minus one, one. And so this spectrum and some associated features that I will specify later is something that is of interest to people who do spectrograph theory. And we will try to produce some information about these things. About these things, working on graphs associated with self-similar group actions, boundary actions. Okay, so now let me explain the class of groups with which I will work. So similar constructions have been done for other classes of groups, notably, or examples, not classes, maybe sometimes single examples. For example, For example, Basileca group, Uhanoitaur's group, then there are also others, but I will concentrate on the groups. I think it's not written on this slide, but the groups that we call spinal groups. And this term was first introduced in a paper by Bartoldi and Sonic. So their definition varies slightly from the one I will take, but essentially it I will take, but essentially, it is this idea. So, all our groups will act on regular, deregular, infinite-rooted trees. The action will be transitive on each level, and we will consider the action on the levels of the tree as well as the action that we get when we extend the action of the tree continuously to its boundary. So, we will also consider. So, we will also consider the action of the group on the boundary of the tree. The motivating example for the definition of spinal groups is Grigorchev group of intermediate growth, the first example. So, it is a group which acts, as you know, on the infinite binary tree. So, I denote it by T2. So I denote it by T2. Two here is the degree of the rooted tree. And it is defined by four automorphisms. So there is one automorphism denoted by A, which only acts at the root of the tree and permutes the two branches that grow from the root. And then there are three other automorphisms which act which who support Which whose support goes as far down in the tree as you want. But it is always concentrated along the spine. So the spine here is the rightmost infinite ray in your tree. So you see the action is in my picture depicted by the red arrows. So it means that this picture here means that we just switch the means that we just switch the two branches that grow from these vertices. If I don't draw anything below, it means that there is no action below that. And we have those red things all the way along this spine as far as we wish. So I'm sure that you are familiar with this representation of Grigor Chov's group. It corresponds exactly to the self-similar. Representation given by these formula formulas here: A, B, C, and D defined in this way. Now you can see that I drew it like that on purpose. So let us look at this picture of the three generators B, C, and D. And we see that we can look at it horizontally. So on the first level, we have switch, switch. First level: we have switch, switch, nothing, then switch, nothing, switch, nothing, switch, switch, and then again, switch, switch, nothing, switch, nothing, switch, nothing, switch, switch, and so on. So this corresponds to the fact that this group actually is part of an uncountable family of groups that Swava called G. Onega and his construction. Omega and his construction. And this particular example corresponds to omega being an infinite sequence of 0, 1, and 2, which is periodic, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, and so on. And you can also consider groups which correspond to different sequences of zeros, ones, and twos. And in this case, you will have not necessarily this particular configuration of switches and Configuration of switches and non-switches, but a different configuration that will define three different generators B, C and D. So this idea is generalized in the notion of a spinal group. So we fix M, an integer, and And D, which is the degree of the tree. And we consider first just the cyclic group generated by A, which is the cyclic permutation of the D branches that grow from the root of the tree. So this is the exact analog of the generator A in Grigorchuk's example. And then we also consider the cyclic group to the power M, and this will give us And this will give us d to the m other generators which will be called b, and they will be defined as automorphisms that are so-called spinal automorphisms. So the automorphisms that will act along the spine. So we will always choose this rightmost array in the tree as being the spine. And we will choose, this is just some convention that we make for this class of examples. These plastic examples that there will be no action in the middle and only at the leftmost vertex for child for each vertex that belongs to this ray. And here we will have the action which will be defined by so by the following construction. If we fix some Some okay, so I have to define this sequence of action omega 0, omega 1, omega 2, and I do it in the following way. So those should be some permutations, some powers of A. And this is formalized in the following way. So we consider as an alphabet, so the thing that was just called 0, 1, 2 in Slava's example, in this more general construction. In this more general construction, this finite alphabet is the set of all epimorphisms from group B to group A, and we consider the sequences in this finite alphabet. So this allows us to define an automorphism for each B in B in this way. And we consider the group, a subgroup, Panteger is a subgroup in the group of automorphisms of the indirect. Group of automorphisms of the regular rooted infinite tree, which will be generated by all powers of A and by all B's in B, little B's in capital B, except for the identity. And so there is some technical condition on the sequences that are admissible, which guarantees that the action on the tree by these automorphisms will be faithful, and so we will indeed. Will we will indeed define a group just by taking this? So, this is our class of groups, and you see that they are parametrized by D, the degree of the tree on which they act, by M, an integer, and for every D and every M, we have an uncountable family of sequences omega, and each of them gives you a new group G indexed by omega. Index by omega. So in the case of Rigorchup's group, this corresponds to d equal to 2 and m equal to 2. So you see that we have three elements, three spinal automorphums that were called B, C, and D. And the first Grigorchuk's example corresponds to the periodic sequence. Periodic sequence, so 01212012012, but there are also other uncountably many groups in Grigorchuk's family of groups. All of them correspond to the case D equal to 2, M equal to 2. And then another example, concrete example that I will need to show you our results, should correspond to the case D strictly bigger than 2. So it turns out. Strictly bigger than two. So it turns out that groups acting on the binary tree in the spinal way and groups acting on trees of higher degree in the spinal way are very, very different. So we take the simplest possible case, B equal to 3 and M equal to 1. So when M is equal to 1, the groups A and B are the same. So there is not so much actually freedom. And there is only one possible. So there are only two. So, there are only two possible epimorphisms, and there is one group which is the simplest one, which corresponds just to the constant sequence. And this gives an interesting group, which is well known, which is called Gutta-Fabrikovsky group. The similar case for D equal to 2, M equal to 1, this is a degenerative case, it corresponds to the infinite dihedral group, so we do not consider it. We do not consider it, but starting from d equal to three, already this simplest case and gives an interesting group. So, for d higher than three, you have also those examples which can be considered as generalized Gupta Fabrikovsky groups. So, I don't know, high-degree Gupta Fabrikovsky groups. So, let me remind you: maybe you have seen this Gupta-Fabrikovsky group under a different Under a different disguise. It also belongs to the very popular GGS class of groups. So you may know it from there. It also is an iterated monotromy group, which corresponds to this particular polynomial of degree 3. So it acts on the ternary tree, it is generated by two elements. But for this final representation, we will. This final representation, we will take four generators because so we will take all possible powers. We will take a and a squared, and b which is defined like that, and b squared. And b, you see in this spinal representation, it is defined by the constant sequence. So we always have this switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switch along the whole spine. Spine and nothing else. So, this defines the spinal automorphism, and this is the root automorphism that adds the root. So, these two will be our concrete examples, but we are talking each time about uncountable families of groups. Okay, so now I haven't put a specific family. I haven't put a specific slide, but so I hope that everyone is in the room knows that for these groups acting on rooted trees, we have a bunch of shire graphs associated to them. And the simplest ones are finest shire graphs, which correspond to the actions on the levels of the tree. So, as I mentioned, for these groups, the action is transitive on the tree. Groups, the action is transitive on each level. So this corresponds well to my definition of an orbital graph. We can take the vertices lying on nth level of the tree. So for example, for the binary tree, so this is a pre-workshop example, right? We have two to the n vertices on the nth level, and we draw edges corresponding to the action of our generators. So in this case, we had four generators, A, B, C, and D. Had four generators A, B, C, and D, and we get these graphs here. So, first level, second level, third level, and so on. I'm sure you've already seen this picture before. So, maybe not everyone has seen the picture for Gupta Fabrikovsky group. These are Shreya graphs for it. And so, here I drew it for a spinal geratus. So, we have Generators: So we have two generators A and A squared, which is of course A inverse and B and B squared, so B and B inverse. And you see that these graphs are already quite different from agriculture case because they do not have this linear structure anymore. And this is something that is drastically different between the case of spinal groups acting on the Case of spinal groups acting on the binary tree and spinal groups acting on trees of higher degree. So more generally on all spinal groups, a shire graphs will have this self-similar nature. So they be constructed in a recursive procedure. You have this Central piece to which the graphs of the previous level are attached, up to some details like deleting maybe some loops that we had before, because share graphs have to be regular. The degree is equal to the number of generators that you choose in your generating set. And so, up to some technicalities, this is how you proceed. So, for example, So, for example, here we have the central piece, and these are the copies of the graph gamma one that we attach to the central piece, except that we had to delete the loops that were attached to these vertices in the graph gamma one. And then here again, in gamma three, we have this central blue triangle to which we attached the graphs gamma two after. The graphs gamma2 after deleting some loops that at the vertices by which we attach the copies of gamma2 to the central piece in gamma3. And we can proceed this way and construct graphs that will correspond to shared graphs on more advanced levels of the tree. And we can do this for all spinal groups with high available. Spinal groups with higher values of D and M and for arbitrary omega. So now we will be interested in limits of these final graphs. And in certain cases, it is interesting to look at the scaling limit of these final shared graphs. So by the work of Nikrashevich, we know that the scaling limit of finite Schreier graphs for the Gupta. Graphs for the Gupta-Fabrikovsky group, for example, will be a fractal, which corresponds to the polynomial that defines the group as iterated monitoring group. So the Julia set of this polynomial is this dendrit here, and we can realize it as a certain scaling limit of our finite Schreier graphs. This is a very pretty picture, but Picture, but in my talk, I will be interested in a different limit of finite graphs because I would like to realize limits of finite graphs as infinite graphs on which I will be able also to consider Laplacian in the sense of graph, a spectral graph theory. So, there is also a parallel theory of spectra on fractals, as for example, dendrites like that. Dendrites like that, or other fractals that can be obtained associated with self-similar groups and obtained as scaling limits of the affinity shry graphs. But I'm not going to touch on that in this talk. Okay, so infinite shry graphs. To each boundary point, psi, so an infinite word in the D letters that correspond to the choice of D. Correspond to the choice of the area root tree, we associate its orbital Schran graph. So it means that the vertices will be the orbit of psi under the action of G and the edges, as I explained before, will correspond to the action of the generators. In our case, the spinal set of generators is set. So yeah, it will be always our choice. And we will view these graphs. And we will view these graphs as elements in the space of graphs. So, what is the space of graphs? It is the space of rooted graphs. And for the moment, we will consider rooted oriented labeled graphs because this is the information that comes together with the share graph. So, I remind you: a share graph is a rooted-oriented label graph. Orient label graph labeled by our generators S and the graph can be equipped with local convergence so a sequence of graphs like that converge to a graph like that if balls around the root of bigger and bigger radius stabilize and converge to the balls in the limiting graph. So this is a classical example of Classical example of local convergence, and we will consider orbital shire graphs as points in this space. Now we can associate formally to each boundary point of our infinite tree the corresponding graph as a point in this space. And we can study the properties of this map. Of this map. So it can be studied in two categories. First of all, this is topological space and this is topological space. And secondly, this is a measurable space because you can endow the boundary of the tree with uniform measure, Mernulli measure. And you can also think about various measures on the space of rooted graphs. So it is well known that if ψ is a boundary point, then one example of convergence in this space is the convergence of final graphs to the infinite graph, where final graphs, finite graphs on the levels are considered as rooted graphs. And the roots are just the beginnings of the infinite sequence, infinite ray that defines the boundary point. So your boundary point is psi 0, psi 1, and so on. point is psi 0, psi 1, and so on. You cut it after n letters. So this defines you a word of length n, so vertex on the nth level of the tree. This is part of the infinite ray. And so it is exactly at this point that you have to root your finite share graph of the nth level and consider it as graph rooted at this point, and then these graphs will converge. These graphs will converge to gamma ψ in the space of rooted graphs. So, this is the easy convergence. Now, if we wanted to get rid of this dependence on the root and just talk about the limit of finite graphs as such, there is a notion of Bejamini-Schramm limit of finite graphs, which was introduced by Bejamini and Schramm. So, the idea is the So, the idea is the following. You have this convergence of rooted graphs, and now you want to get rid of the dependence on the root. So you pick the root in your final graph uniformly at random. So, what does this mean? It means that we consider a uniform probability measure on all possible routings of gamma n. So, it is a probability measure on the space of routing. Is a probability measure on the space of rooting graphs, right? And a Benjamini Schramm limit of the sequence of final graph γ n is a possible star weak limit of these measures mu n that are defined by considering random routings on the graph, on final graphs in your sequence. So, this allows to define some measure. Define some measure, probability measure on the space G star of rooted graphs that can be associated with a family of final graphs. In our case, the family of finite graphs for the action of a self-similar group on the infinite-rooted tree. So let us go back to our construction. We have this boundary of the tree. We have this boundary of the tree. We associate to each point a Schrid graph, which is an element in the space of rooted graphs. And we can wonder what properties this mapping F has. So one can show that it is practically almost injective. So actually, this is true for all weekly branch groups. Branch groups. And one can also show that it is continuous everywhere except for the singular points for the action of the group on the boundary of the tree. So in the case of spinal groups, there is just one singular orbit. This is the orbit of d minus one of the ray infinite ray d minus one to the power infinity. And so it's natural to get rid of those singular points. So we consider the boundary without singular points. We look at the image of our mapping F by our mapping F of this set of regular points. So this is some subset in the space of rooted graphs. And we take the closure of this image. So this is something that has been called the space of shared graph. Called the space of Schreier graphs, but it is not only contains these Schreier graphs for the action on the boundary, not all of them because you take away the singular ones, but even for the regular ones, so it contains all the Shreya graphs of regular points, but it also can contain something else, something more, which are the points that you get by taking this closure. And so, these limit graphs in the space of shared graphs is something that will be. Is something that will be quite interesting for us later on. So, what I want to say here is that this describes the topological situation, but now if you take the uniform measure on the boundary of the tree, and then you can also pull it over to the space of rooted graphs, and then what you will get this F star nu. F star nu will be actually can be identified with exactly with the Benjamini Schum limit of the finite Schreier graphs that I defined before. So you can talk about the Schreier dynamical system G acting on the space of Schreier graphs either in the topological category or in the measurable category. So then the action will be probability measure preserving with respect to this measure here that we have on the graphs. Have on the graphs. So, in the case of Grey-Korshuk's group, the infinite graphs have this shape here. So, it's one ended for the singular orbit and two ended for all other orbits. In particular, this is the concrete example of the infinite ray zero to infinity, but all the other ones also look the same, except that the labeling by the generators will be different, but the shape will be the same. Be different, but the shape will be the same. So, here is a picture for infinite share graphs of the Gupta-Fabrikovsky group. So, you see again, as I mentioned, these graphs do not have this linear structure anymore. They still have some kind of chosen line. So, this particular graph has two ends, but you have those decorations growing and you have bigger and bigger. Growing, and you have bigger and bigger decorations as you move along to one end or to the other end. So, here is a more schematic picture. So, this is two examples, a one-handed graph, a two-handed graph. And so, you see here we glue in a copy of gamma two. Here we will glue in a copy of gamma four, here we glue in a copy of gamma three, and so on. So, we will have bigger and bigger decorations attached to this. Attached to this quasi-tree. So, together with my former PhD student, Titer Perez, we studied shy graphs of spinal groups in some detail, and in particular, we studied the number of N's. So, some information actually can be drawn already from my previous work with Evgen Bunderenko and. Uh um Ivan Gondorenko and Danielle Danjali. So, typically when D so when D is equal to two, so this is the case similar to Brigorchev's group, there is just those singular points that give you one ended graph and all other graphs will be two ended. For D equal to three or higher, then the generic case will be one-ended graph. One-ended graph, and then there are also some graphs which have two which may have two ends. This is for boundary shire graphs. And the interesting thing is that if you go to this space of shire graphs and look at the limit points, then you're going to also get graphs with more ends. So in the case of Gregorian group, this was studied by Horobetz, and there you only get two ended graphs, but starting from D equal to three or higher, you can get Or higher, you can get the ended graphs as well. So, in the case of Gupta-Fabrikovsky group, so I showed you this example. So, this is the generic case, a generic Schreier infinite Shire graph. It looks like that. It's one-ended. But then there are limits of those in the space of Schreier graphs, which look like that. So, there is some central piece, and then there are three of those attached to it. So, this infinite graph gets more symmetries than the typical infinite. Than the typical infinite share graph, and it is three-ended. We also studied the isomorphism problem of those graphs. So, as I mentioned, all of them are different as labeled graphs, but if you forget about the labeling as graphs, some identifications may occur. And so, we studied this question and we showed that there are So, uncountably many isomorphism classes, all of them of measure zero, but all of them also uncountable. So, this is something that also will be used later in spectral applications. And I just put it here, I'm not going to read it through the technical condition which defines those isomorphism classes, but this just shows you technically how it works. Shows you technically how it works. So Shire graphs depend on the boundary point, and so you compare the words that define those infinite words that define those boundary points. And this allows you to formulate some combinatorial conditions that make the graph isomorphic. Okay, so now I Okay, so now I go to the results about spectra. So I already mentioned this question: can one hear the shape of a drama in our case of a group or of a graph? So the question is whether one can find non-isomorphic graphs with the same spectrum. So this is the most standard question. And then there is also a strong version because the spectrum Version because the spectrum, as you may remember from your either from, maybe you know from your work, maybe you remember from your functional analysis course, the spectrum is endowed with the spectral measure. So it's a projection-valued measure, but you can also associate to it numerical-valued measures, which actually are quite interesting also combinatorially because the moments are. Because the moments are exactly the probabilities of return to the identity after n steps for the random walk on your graph. And these spectral measures carry more information than just the spectrum itself. The spectrum is just the support of these measures. And in the general case, they have three components. They can have a part which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. So we're in the case of a self-adjoint operator. So it's all So it's all in the real line. Then there may be some eigenvalues. So this is the pure point part. And then also there may be some continuous part, but which is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the spectrum. And so spectrum plus the spectral measure determine the operator up to unitary equivalence, but this doesn't tell us much because it is not clear how. Not clear how in which case non-isomorphic graphs may have unitary equivalent Laplacians or Markov operators. So, this is the question that we would like to understand. And there are examples of cross-spectral graphs among finite graphs, and there are also famous infinite examples. So, all cubic lattices D to the D with standard generators, all of them have the same spectrum minus 1, 1, and moreover, the spectral measures are all equivalent to the The spectral measures are all equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on this interval. So, these graphs, the Kelly graphs of Z D with different D, they are all cospectral and obviously not quasi-asymmetric. So maybe I will skip this. I wanted to show you why this is so, but it is a little bit outside my talk. So, I will skip that. Just mention that. That just mentioned that actually this example works not only for ZD but for all bipartite Kelly graphs of torsion-free amenable groups and maybe for more. And it is an interesting question to find other examples of isospectral families of Kelly graphs or of Schreier graphs and to determine to which extent strong and weak Strong and weak sense of cospectrality relate to each other. Okay, so what we can say about that with the help of our spinal groups is the following. So if we just consider spinal groups acting on the binary tree, then we can compute the spectrum of all the Asshrey graphs. And actually, it turns out that this spectrum coincides with the spectrum of the Kelly graphs, which is a very surprising fact. Which is a very surprising fact, and the spectrum is a union of two intervals, which do not depend on the parameter omega, which defines you the group, but only on d, which is equal to 2, and m the technical parameter that determines the family of spinal groups acting on a tree of a certain degree. And so we obtain here a continuum. We obtain here a continuum of non-quasi-isometric is a spectral Kelly graphs. So, this is the first example of this type of this type. Actually, you can get this even in different ways. So, two different manners are represented in these two papers, one by Slava and Apteon Dutkua, and the other in our paper with Slava and Israel Perez. So, we know how to compute also the spectral measure. We know how to compute also the spectral measure for the Schreier graphs, but the equality here between the spectrum of Kelly and Schreier only works for the spectrum as a set. And we cannot say anything about the spectral measure on the Kelly graphs of these groups. So it would be very interesting to understand whether they are also cospectal in the strong sense, but we cannot say anything about that for now. So another question that people like to ask in the spectral graph theory is. The spectrograph theory is what actually can the shape of the spectrum be? So, in other words, what compact subsets of the interval minus one, one can be realized as the spectrum of a Markov operator of a Laplacian on some graph. So far, we only saw examples which was just the whole interval minus one, one. And now we've seen that with Grigorchev's example here. Grigorchev's example here, or with spinal groups acting on d equal to two, we have the union of two disjoint intervals. So this is new. And in general, it is not so easy to produce spectra with holes in it, so with gaps. Such examples existed before. Free products of finite groups give you an interval plus maybe an isolated point. An isolated point, so there is also a gap. Recently, Grigorcio Kansimanik produced infinitely many gaps on the lamplighter by showing that it has a generating set where the spectrum will have infinitely many isolate points. Now, the second part of this question is what can be the spectral measure type? So, I told you in general, the spectral measure has three parts, pure points. Has three parts, pure point, eigenvalues, absolutely continuous, and singular with respect to Lebesgue. And again, all the examples that we've seen so far, so all those Kelly graphs of torsion-free aminable groups, and also Grigorchuk's group and its relatives. Here, the spectral measure will be absolutely continuous respect to Leban. Respect to the bed. There is so far only one known example of a Kelly graph with pure point spectrum. Those are specific Kelly graphs of the lamp lighter. For other generating sets, we don't know. And something more examples are known in the realm of regular graphs, not necessarily Kelly graphs. So here, pure point spectrum has already been obtained plus a count of. Obtained, plus a countable set of points accumulating on a country set. So this was done in the in studying some self-similar graphs like Serpinsky triangle. And also there are known examples of graphs with non-trivial singular component, singular continuous components in the spectrum, but these are quite rare actually. And so, with our examples of Schreyer graphs of spinal groups, we contribute more to this search for exotic behavior. So, as I mentioned, in the realm of Kelly graphs, we get now examples with uncountably many examples where the spectrum is the union of two intervals. And in the realm of Schreier graphs, where still you see a Schreier graph, you still can expect maybe more. You still can expect maybe more rigidity than arbitrary graph because still it carries some traces of the group action. So you could think that maybe not all possible exotic bad things can happen. But here we do get quite bad behaved graphs. So in our joint work with Slava and Aitor, we obtain examples with fewer point spectrum. spectrum so um infinite graphs uh where the measure is only has only spectral measure has only pure point component and also spectrum with non-trivial singular continuous component and so these two different situations occur when you consider spinal groups acting on trees of degree higher than two. Of degree higher than two, so like Upta Fabrikovsky example, and when you consider the Schreyer graphs for the boundary action proper and their limiting graphs. So, as in this picture, so these graphs, which are honest boundary share graphs, and the extra graphs that you get when you take the limits of those in the space of rooted graphs. Space of rooted graphs. And so here, these graphs with extra symmetries will have this very much interesting singular continuous component in the spectrum. Okay, so maybe I forgot. Yes, there was also this corollary. So we also get first examples of uncountable families of pairwise non-isomorphic perspectives. Of pairwise non-isomorphic spectral graphs with the same spectral measure. So, this is related to this isomorphism classification of shared graphs that I talked about before. Yeah, so now we go to the case when D is bigger equal than 3, and we look at the share. And we look at the shire graph of arbitrary spinal group. Then we can compute its spectrum and we show that, well, there are some isolated points, and then there are two parts essentially. One part is the Julia set of a very simple map, which is this map capital F here. And the other part is a countable set of points which accumulate on this Julia set. And in all our examples, when T is bigger than. All our examples when d is bigger or equal to three, the Julia set is a counter set of Lebesgue measure zero. So the spectrum has two parts: this part here, which is a counter set, and this part here, which is a set of isolated points, which accumulate on this counter set. So the most original part of our work concerns the spectral measures. So we show that for a substance. For a subset of the boundary of the tree of measure one, all Schreier graphs that correspond to points in this subset will actually have a pure point spectrum, namely they will possess a complete set of eigenfunctions. So all spectral values will be actually eigenvalues. And moreover, those eigenfunctions are all fantastic supported. So this is a spectrally interesting property which is called localization. Property, which is called localization. And so the spectral measure is discrete and concentrated on this discrete part of the spectrum. So when you average the spectral measure, the so-called integrated density of states, you can actually draw the picture. So this is the example for the Gupta-Fabrikovsky, and you can compare it with the example for Grigorchev's group. So you see that there is a huge difference between what happens in D equal to 2. Happens in d equal to two, a binary tree and the tree of higher degree. And here is this theorem about the limit graphs. So if you compare it for the honest Schreier graphs, you have this pure point measure. And for the Schreier graphs that belong to the boundary of this space that I called, yeah, this, the space. Yeah, this the space of shire graphs of the group. There, the spectral measure has additionally a non-trivial singular continuous component. The spectrum is the same, the spectrum coincides, so you still have this computation, it still holds, but there is a non-trivial component of the spectral measure that lives on this part, which is a counter set. And this is this singular continuous component. Okay, so I think that my time is over. So I will skip the rest of the talk that was supposed to discuss the third question: how all this depends on the change of the generating set. And it is based on our joint work with Slava, Daniel Lentz, and Daniel Zell. I invite you to check our paper, Papers, the latest one in 2022, and it is related to Is related to subshifts of low complexity and quasi-crystals, so it's quite interesting and uses very different methods from the ones that I described in this talk. And this is all. Thank you all for your attention. Thank you, Tatiana, for the nice talk. Are there any questions from here in the audience? In the audience? Yeah. So, if I understood this correctly, whenever you have a spinal group, the Schreier graphs are made out of small pieces in some sense. Yes. So there are no big circles in these graphs. Is this true? So, no, this depends. There may be because I only looked at the case D equal to 3. So if you go to To three. So, if you go to, I mean, in my pictures, if you go to higher degrees, then you will get actually instead of triangles, you will get here complete graphs of the corresponding degree. So you will have big circles, but they will be bounded for every given D. Okay, but is there a chance to get, say, a branch group where you have unbounded circles in the Schreier graphs when the level goes up? Well, yes, in Basilika, Yes, in Basilica, in Basilica, you have, well, Basilica is not branch, but weekly branch, but there you have bigger and bigger circles. Okay, thanks. So I have an old paper with three co-authors in Journal of Modern Dynamics, which is completely devoted to sharagraphs of the Basilica group. And there we have nice pictures. So you see those growing circles. Okay, I will look it up. Okay, I will look it up. But it still has this same property that it has lots of cut points. The shire graph. Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions in the audience or online? Oh, wait, there is a question. In the end, you quickly mentioned that you computed the spectra of groups associated to subshifts. Can you again say what was the result? No, I'm sorry. It's not that groups are still the same, but we used Schringer operators on subshifts of low complexity to say something. Shifts of low complexity to say something about the spectra. So it is based on this reduction theorem. So it says that if you want to study Laplacian, now weighted Laplacian, so like anisotropic random walk on the share graph of a spinal group acting on the binary tree, then you can actually show that this operator will be unitary equivalent to the Schrodinger operator on some subshift over a finite alphabet. And for this type And for this type of subshifts, there is a well-developed spectral theory, which actually was not quite enough for us, so we had to develop it further. But still, there are methods. And so we were able to say that for anisotropic random walks, the spectrum will always be singular continuous and a counter set of Lebesgue-Meg zero. And this And this implies, in the realm of what I was talking about in this talk, is that for Grigorshev's group in particular, there exists some minimal generating set. So you know that Grigorshev's group, as I defined it, was generated by four elements, but in fact, three suffice. And so there exists a generating set with three elements such that the spectrum of the infinite shar graph will be counterset of Lebesgue measure zero, and the spectrum will be purely continuous with respect to Lebesgue. With spectral bed. And this is quite surprising, and one would like to know what this Schreyer graph is, but this is just an existence result. Do we know whether the spectra of Schreyer graphs of the finally generated simple amenable groups were computed, which are known already? The ones from Yushchenko Mono or the intermediate growth ones of Nekashevich. Ones of Nakashevich? Yeah, this is a good question. So not explicitly, I think, but I think that it is not impossible because they are also have linear this linear. Of they also have this linear structure as panel groups for d equal to two, and so there is hope that the same methods of reducing to stop shifts could work. Yeah, so this is what I can answer to this question, but not more specifically. Thank you. Okay, so if there are no other questions, I propose to. If there are no other questions, I propose to thank Tatiana again for the nice talk. Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, thank you. Good. Yes, thank you. Hope to see you soon in another conference in person, hopefully. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye, Tatiana. Bye.
