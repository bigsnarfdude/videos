Firstly, I will thank the organizing committee to give me this excellent opportunity to show our group's work. And my talk is about the development and application of the density-based theory of chemical reactivity. And my talk is three parts. Three parts. First of all, is the four data-based frameworks introduced of the frameworks, and then highlight some our recent works and then give the proposal in this field. And we know in DFT, DFT told us that density can determine the properties of ground state of Of ground state of chemistry system, but how to do it is not known. That is what exactly the reactivity theory should do. And based on the feature of each, we partition the density-based reactivity theory into four frameworks. The first one is the opto-free DFT. DFT. The main idea is that the energy is the density functional rather than constant orbitals. I think this field is developed well, such as talks in this workshop. And the second one is concept DFT. And this concept DFT used the definitions from the From the tile expansion, and such as the fork function is the partial derivative with respect to the number of electrons. And the third one is the information theory approach. It used the definitions from information theory. From information theory, such as the shunner entropy, fission entropy, and the it else. And the last one is other density associated quantities. It directly used the density, delta density, gradient of density, and the Laboration of density to define, descriptor, to describe, to describe. To describe the chemical properties in chemical system. And our work is meaning in the ITA frame. The main definition in ITA is the entropy, such as the shown entropy. We know the variable is continuous. Variable is a continuous probability function. And in chemistry system, density is such a continuous probability function. So if we use density as a variable, then we can get the shound entropy in chemical systems. And in the similar fashion, we can define several other information. Several other information descriptors. They are all explicit expressions about density. The solar entropy is a measure of the delocalization of density. And the value will be The value will be maximum if the system is homogeneous. And the fission information gauges the sharpness of the density. If the data low, the gradient of density is zero, it is the homogeneous system and the feature information. It the visual information will be vanished, and then this is the alternative visual information. The integration is the same as facial information, but the local behavior is very different from facial information. And the GBP entropy is originate from the transcripture of ground state. Of ground state DFT into a local thermodynamical transformation, I think. And these entropies are about the nth power of a density. And all of these quantities have relative quantities, especially the information game is also called as the relative. Is also called as the relative shunner entropy, the important quantity. It also called as Kubenbike Libler divergence or information divergence. And there are usually four representations for the ITA quantities. We take strong entropy as an example. The first one is the electron density. One is the electron density representation. The variation is electron density, and the signal is the shape density. The shift density and the electricity can normalize using this equation. And each these two these two replications can transfer through certain equations, I think. Equations, I think. And the third is defined IT quantities according with the viewpoint of autons in molecular. And there are three schemes to partition autons in molecular. First is Baker's fuser autons approach. The second is beta zero flow flux approach, namely the AIM. Namely, the AIM approach, and the third is the Hatchfield stockholder approach. And our study has shown that there were no quantitative difference between them, between them. And for these three representation, this normalization conditions will always be held true. Always be held true. This condition will be held. And the fourth representation is a finite difference representation. This approach is used to study the behavior when the number of electron changing during chemical Chemical transformation. And the partial derivative is used to make it numerable accessible. And this approach is usually used in CDFT, such as the fork function. And also the hardness is the same fashion, I think. I think. And there are two distinct forms with finite difference approximation is the nuclear physical and electrophysical forms. It described the systems to gain or lost one electron. One electron. And we found that this is the comparison of the performance of band different representation of fork function and ITA. We can find that each of them can describe electron finicity and nuclear finicity. These four representations. These four representation of ITA quantities can describe can closely related with several physiochemical properties, such as the inorganic chemistry for the electrophenicity and the nuclear furnace system. The information gain and the Hutch field as the first old approximation of information gain can used as the Can used as a quantitative measure of the experiment scales, both electrophenicity and nuclear fenicity. And then for this N2 reaction, the energy balance head is related, is a linear related. Related is linearly related to the Hatch field charge on the on the carbon on the certain carbon atom and for the pK and for the anomaticity system the magnetic index and energetic index SE NICS are relationship with the GBP entropy and for And for PK system, this is Ben Onici derivatives. The experimental PK values are linear relative to several ITA quantities. And we also studied some other properties. They are all these. These properties are all related to the ideal quantities, and some result is not shown here. And then, besides the work in the work in ITA, we still studied some chemical concepts from the view of density, such as the static effort. Stereo effect is an important concept in chemistry, we know. But there is no significant general accepted definitions about steric effort. So we try to do this. And firstly, we assume that the energy, the total energy composed by composed by the by three by three parts is the steric steric effect from the steric effect the electron static effect and the quantum in quantum effect and we know in dft the the total energy can be composed by this four these five turns and the middle turn the middle three turns is the electron static curve. is the electrostatic static energy and then the power the quantum the quantum energy is from the exchange correlation effect and the poly principle polling repulsion principle and poly in uh poly energy is uh uh equals equals the non-interaction kinetic energy minus the with kinetic energy minus the with the kinetic kinetic energy. The non-interaction kinetic energy is considered as the precise kinetic energy in DFT. And the with the kinetic energy is based on the suppose that the electron is That the electron is both in particle and all of them occupied in the lowest orbital. So the poly energy is these two kinetic energies minus them. And then based on these two equations, we can get the steric energy as this equation. And it is only with the kinetic energy. with the kinetic energy. And in DFT with Zig kinetic energy is defined like this. It is the same, but it is the same definition as fission information, except one eighth factor. So based here, we can know the steric energy is also something information. something information in the ITA and based on the and because of the steric energy was defined we can also get the steric potential spheric force and steric charge factor these sterical associated associated quantities are related to some To some chemical properties, such as this one. And this SN2 substituent reaction. And we know the barrier head should be related to the substitute of R1 to R2 and R3. And if factory is true that the battery height is Is very linear correlated with the steric charge on the center carbon atoms in the transition state. And then another example for this nucleophilic additions of this molecular, the as a surface of steric force. Of steric force can show the difference of the vertical file or attack set. If the R is etho, the nuclear attack side is the other side of the substitute group. But if the R is a mesh oxygen, Makes the oxygen carbonyl and the attract side is this in the sin side of the substitute group. And this result is consistent with the experiment evidence. So, you know, the steric effort and steric negativity can be described, can be can be described these. Described by the steric association quantities. And the other work of this field is the identification of the interactions, namely recognize the bounding interactions. And firstly, it is based on the hypothesis that Hypothesis that in areas where there is interactions, repulsion regulate from the Pauli principle should be dominate. And the Pauli energy is such as this, the non-interaction kinetic minus the with zigg kinetic. We know the with the kinetic can be kinetic can be the pres can be considered as the both in both in systems as the processed kinetic energy and the non-interact interaction kinetic energy is the processed kinetic energy in DFT the difference between them is because of Pauli repulsion principle we know Principle. We know electron is not possible particle, is a family particle. So they can't occupy it in the same local orbital, in the same noticed orbital. And then we in literature, the most popular used to identify interactions is identify interactions is used is usually by ELF the electron localization function this function is based on on the on this function zeta it's scaled we call it scaled poly energy and the denominator is a Homer's Fermi kinetic energy for Homer kinetic energy for homogeneous homogeneous system as a reference as a reference. And the zeta is a simple, a simple total divergent. So to avoid it and different from ELF, we defined another function as this. function as this uh as this as the receptor receptacle of zeta and we found that this function the surface of this function can uh can distinguish the strong covalent interaction such as the dou double triple and uh quote And cortical covalent bond. So we called it as strong covalent interaction SSI indexes. And unfortunately, SAI indexes cannot identify the single covalent bond and a non-interaction bond. So it's a So is uh so we we changing the denominator the Thomas Femi kinetic energy into another reference using the with Zig using the with Zig kinetic energy as a reference, we defined another indexed another scaled polar energy and we Polar energy. And we use this index we can distinguish the several we can distinguish several bond types such as the such are ionic ionic bound mathematical bond or vandal forms and the single single single single single single covalent bond um and then we know inside index from retal is very successful to describe long lung interaction um interaction uh uncovariant interaction and this and we know this is a dimension dimensionless quantity Dimension this quantity. This is a dimension quantity. So we think we know in DFT there is another dimension is quantities. It's shown as this. It is used the Laboration of Density to define the dimension. Dimension these quantities. And use this index, we can distinguish all true joint interactions is a quantum quintuple and the quintuple, even the six triple covalent bond. So take together, use these four indexes, we can describe We can describe the entire spectrum of interaction from strong interaction to weaker Vanderworth-World force. And the factory will also define the polypotential polyforce and polycharge. And these poly relation quantities are also can I also can distinguish the different interactions. And there are two new developments in our groups about ITA. The first one is topological analysis of ITA. We know Bake pioneers the topological analysis with the Um, with the density and some real space function, such as ELF, LOL, and the Laplacian of density. And the most successful is topological analysis of density. We know the critical points have a definite physical meaning, and there are And there are well documented literature for this topological analysis. And it is straightforward to conceive that if we use the ITA quantities as a variable, we can also do the same thing. So we do the same thing as these four. We implemented We implemented these four ideal quantities in the open source software, Multwave, can make the topologic analysis. And then in this fashion, we can know that the simplest is also. That the simplest is also from Shannon entropy, is from Shannon MP2, but it still cannot the correct points with certain physical meaning. But it doesn't matter. We do the topological analysis of ideal quantities with some With some physochemical properties and processes, and get some surplus result, such as this one. It's bonding seven systems for bonding stretching. In this table, we can see three points that all of the four topological analysis can describe. Is can describe the sum of the systems. And secondly, for the sun entropy, efficient entropy, and information gain, there is the alternative sound entropy. At least there is one system that cannot be described by them. And finally, the alternative feature information using NCP. NCP, we can get an excellent correlation with the correlation is about the total energy density with the ITA quantities and the certain CPs. And we know, and we also checked that the facial information, the outer facial information can distinguish this distinction. distinguished several different bones. And so we can in that in that table, the correlation is very good. And we also studied some other properties as acidity, electrophenicity, nuclear financing, and aromaticity. A lomaticity and also these three points can get in this table. And the alternative fishing information also gets the best result. And then we compared the result with the ITA quantities without topologic analysis. And in this table, shown that there were no That there are no close, no good linear relationship can be found if the ITA quantities analyzed without topologic. And then we also compared the topological analysis result with four density associated. for density association quantities lemon the density itself the yl for l o l and the lablacian of density and in this table the density labla the density topologic is uh is very good and the others and the others is good but not uh is good for some of the system but not all of them so uh so So we know that the topological analysis, this is the first effort to do the topological analysis with IT quantities. We believe that the analyzer can be used to describe more physiochemical filaments. And the other new The other new development is extended the idea quantities to excited state. And we can find because of that the we know we using TDDFT, the low T is the exciting state for triplet and single date exciting state can be can be. Can be completed and is different between T1 and the S1 state. This is the data row, data signal entropy, data feature information. And then we studied that when the angle rotation, the angle rotation, the total energy of S1 and T1 is the same, but the Is the same, but the details of the energy component is very different. This linearization is true for ground state and 0,1 state, but is not for the S1 state. And also for the interactions, the S1, T1, and ground state is different. Ground state is different. And then the hash field is different from these three states. And also, the fork function with density information gain and local temperature is very different. This is the proof. This is the first effort to extend the IT quantities to exciting state. Exciting state is a proof of a concept fashion. We think is important to use in the two words. So lastly is our proposal. We extended the variable. I think it takes all of in these three fields, changing the variable into different functions, we can get different functions. Get different functions to describe the physiochemical properties. And lastly, it's a colony memory. And Subin, Professor Subin is my surprise almost all of their works. Thank you. Okay.
