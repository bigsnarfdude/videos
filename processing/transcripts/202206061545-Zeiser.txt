Okay, let's hope for the best. Well, as the title says, I will talk about the Sochomology of three-dimensional Lie algebras, and that's a project which started halfway through my PhD, where together with my supervisor Johan McCoot, we computed the Poisson homology of SL2R. And basically, the methods we use there, we can also use for other diagrams to compute the Poisson homology. And then there is a student. A student and Naimich and Auber Huxfra, who wanted to write a thesis with Juan, and together with him, we started computing the rest. And well, yeah, the presentation will be about that. So, well, the structure of the presentation is first I will briefly recall the basic definition of Poisson homology, especially for linear Poisson structures, and the classification of three-dimensional Lie algebras, and then we will go through some results and look at the interpretation of those. The interpretation of those and the way we prove it. Okay. So, Poisson chromology, well, we have a Poisson, a smooth manifold M and a Poisson bivector pi, and then the Poisson chromology is defined on the space of multi-vector fields, where the differential is just given by this colour Leinham's vector, the Poisson bivector. And that squares to zero is pius Poisson. And the corresponding cohomology groups are the Poisson cohomology groups. So that's naturally to any Poisson. That's naturally to any Poisson manifold. And well, the Poisson homology groups are interesting geometrically, but also algebraically. So geometrically, one has some heuristic interpretations of those groups. H0, the space of Casimir functions, functions which are constant along the leaves. H1, the Poisson vector fields, nor the Lu. The Hamiltonian vector fields. H2, which governs the infinitesimal deformations of our Poisson structures, modulate deformations which come from diffeomorphisms, and H3, which are obstructions to such deformations. Well, since we are only looking at three-dimensional Lie algebras, really, these four groups are all what we care about. So that is somehow the geometric picture or the geometric interpretation of these groups. And then algebraic. These groups. And then algebraically, this has the Poisson-Common groups. They have the structure of a Gelson-Haber algebra, which comes from the fact that the Scalter 9 has bracketed on 20 vector fields and the vetch product, they descend to the horizontal homology groups. So in particular, each zero forms a ring, um, each one is a Lie algebra, and also the higher pr uh the higher homology groups form modules over each zero. That's the most important thing to be learning. That's the most important thing for you. Okay, and then for linear Poisson structures we have already seen today that well for a linear triple structure we have the linear Poisson structure which I still defined here, which is a one-to-one correspondence. What is important here, or what is for us important here, is that the complex, for some complex, in case of Lie algebras, we can interpret it as Lie algebra homology with coefficients. So the coefficients here are in smooth functions. So the coefficients here are in the smooth functions on g star, and the differential is the High and Vaccin differential here, which is associated with the representation induced by the coefficient of action. Okay, and then the classification of three-dimensional Lie algebras. So here I briefly recall that in terms of the dimension of the commutator. So the first one is when the dimension is zero, where we just have the abelian Lie algebra. Lie algebra. If the dimension is one, we have the Heisenberg Lie algebra and the direct product of the two-dimensional non-abelian one at R. And if, well, if E is equal to two, then basically we can describe the Lyard structure by an action of R on R2 by a two times two matrix. And then we can characterize it in terms of the eigenvalues of this matrix. So the case for the imaginary eigenvalues is the Eichlinian Lie algebra. Eigenvalues is the Eclianian Lie algebra. The case where we have two equal real eigenvalues and the one on the diagonal for the short normal form is what I call here type 4. Then we have two parameter families which correspond to two real eigenvalues which have either the same sign or different signs, which I call here 6 plus and 6 minus. And one we And one which corresponds then to eigenvalues which are not real or not imaginary. And then finally, we have the semi-sample ones, SO3 and SO2R. Now, I don't present results probably for all of them because the time is not enough, but we will see how far we get. Okay, so we want to start with the Heisenberg Lie algebra. And so, in order to present the results, what we do is we identify the dual. What we do is we identify the dual with R3, and for the Heisenberg Lie algebra, then our Poisson structure is given by this. So we have x, y, and z coordinates. So in this case, let me draw the volation. So in this case, the volation is given by planes parallel to the xy plane. And then the xy plane itself is a plane well, is a plane which contains these sort of dimension zero, and all the other planes are really two-dimensional symplanes. are really two-dimensional symbols. Okay, so the leaf space in this case will be something like the real line, but then we replace the origin with this plane of zero-dimensional leaves. Okay, so well given from the So, well, given from the interpretation that I just showed before, it is not surprising that the zeros of the Katami functions are just functions with respect to the C coordinate. Now, in order to describe H1, what we do is we consider these two inclusions. So, first the symplectic vector fields on, well, R2 with the standard symplectic structure. So, there, well, the so-called symplectic structure. Well, Poisson homology for symplectic structures is that, or of the Poisson structure related, so symplectic structure is isomorphic to the Teramic homology, so in R2 that is trivial, so everything which is symplectic is Hamiltonian, and that is basically the description we have here, and we just look at the natural inclusions into the three-dimensional space. And I also want to include vector fields on R, which vanish at zero. So all those vector fields are of the form S times a function f of s. times the function f of s, and then we include it into the vector fields n dimension 3 by taking f, the function with the same variable, and e, the Euler vector field. And then for the Poisson vector fields we get the following structure. So we have the Hamiltonian vector fields which form a Lie ideal on these symplectic vector fields and the whole thing forms a Lie ideal on this vector field described by this quadratic. Vector field is described by this Euler vector field. So for the first chromology group, what we obtain is this isomorphism with the symplectic ones and the ones coming from the ones on the algorithm. So in particular, what one notices is that all these non-trivial homology classes, they are described by representatives which are transversed to the Fourier. So the symplectic. To the Fourierations. So the symplectic, the symplectic ones, they are transverse here on the zero-dimensional leaves, which can simply mean the leaf space on the other ones. What is that simple? What's this map again between symbol R2? I mean, what is L? Ah, that is just, well, because this should be the vector field some Vector field, uh, symplectic vector fields in R2 with the standard symplectic structure, and I just view them as vector fields in R3 by basically ignoring the source. So I just be a two-obuse notation. Okay. Now, and in terms of being the infinitesimal data of the corresponding Poisson-fomorphic group, well, these results here raise some questions or motivate some questions. So, what we may ask. With some questions. So, what we may ask in this case is: is every Poisson diffeomorphism of the Heisenberg Lie algebra which preserves the leaf actually Hamiltonian? So, meaning a diffeomorphism which is isotopic to the identity via a family of Hamiltonian vector fields. If we have a Poisson diffeomorphism which actually fixes here the R about except from the zero-dimensional plane, can we describe it by Hamiltonians and well the corresponding? Hamiltonians and well the corresponding diffeomorphisms corresponding to the symplectic symplectomorphisms where we view them as symplectomorphism as diffeomorphisms of R3, but just doing the identity in the search coordinate. And then, well, the general question, can we identify the Poisson diffeomorphism group with, well, this group I would corresponding to the infinitesimal data of that group. Okay, so that was about H0 and H1. Now to H2 and H3. So there I first want to just present the results. So, well, in H2 every class is represented like this. So we have a vector field partial C, which is basically a polynomial in the set variable with coefficients and smooth functions on R2, which vanish at the same time. 2, which vanishes at the origin, in order for it to be unique, because we take the derivatives as and then we take the bracket with respect to, well, this pi vector, x, partial y. And similar H3, we have unique representatives of this form. So here H is again a small function I2, and then we have the standard volume constructor. Now, associated to this, we can look at deformations. So we look at the bivector We look at the pi vector pi, g1, g2, and we add to our original Poisson structure, well, any non-trivial class. Now, first of all, we might ask, when is this Poisson? Well, direct computation shows basically that this here is a Poisson by vector if, well, g1 and g2 satisfy this relation on the right. And this in turn motivates the question if actually every possible. Actually, every Poisson structure which is a sufficient way nearby pi is of such form. So, if we can identify it with such a pipe G1, G2. And the different question is, what one notes is that if we look at deformations which correspond just to G1 and where G2 is 0, these are all unimodular ones. But if we look at G1 being 0 and G2 being, well, variable, then these are non-unimodular. Then these are non-unimodular except for G2 being zero. And this motivates a question related to linearization: namely, if we have a small structure which preserves this plane of zero-dimensional leaves and has the first jet along this plane equal to our original one, is it then locally isomorphic to our original one? Okay. So that was the Heisenberg Lie algebra. The Heisenberg Lie algebra and the results for this one. So, I did quite an extensive explanation of the results. For the other ones, I rather would want to focus on some very specific things which are important related to the various Lie algebra's weakness. Okay, so for the direct product of the two-dimensional one and of the non-abelian two-dimensional Lie algebra and the one-dimensional Lie algebra, so in this case, basically the result we obtain is. Basically, the result we obtain is something one would expect from a Kinnettz type of formula. Because we have a direct product, means we have also for the Poisson structure, we have the Poisson manifold R2 with the structure associated to the non-abelian algebra, which is x partial x partial y, and then r with the zero Poisson structure. So the result is precisely what one would expect from this formula. And I think that's also all I want to say for this one. I want to say for this one. So let's move on to the Aklinian Lie algebra. So here, well, in this case, the foliation is given by cylinders where we have again this one line of zero-dimensional simplexities. Um zero dimensional symplectic leaves being the z-axis. So we can, in this case, the leaf space is just a half-line where we replace the zero by this line of points. So again, well in this case, the Casimir functions are just smooth functions with respect to the radial, the radial squared, so x squared plus y squared. H1 in this case is a free module with two generators. A free module with two generators, and the generators are the radial vector field and the plane, and well, the vector field given by partial C. What we obtain for H2 is, well, we obtain one term, which is precisely the wedge of the two generators we have in degree one, and well, also three in terms of over the Casimirs. And then we have this additional term, partial x, partial y times. x partial y times gz, which might be a bit surprising at this point. And the third degree is then given uniquely represented by such by functions in C. I also wanted to say something about the proofs. So the first two L algebras where I presented, basically the proofs are by direct calculation. They are not very difficult, also because the dimension is very low. Now in this case, Now, in this case, what we use is actually a result by Ginsberg, which the way we apply it is if we have an action of a complex Lie group on a Poisson manifold by Hamiltonians, then the Poisson cohomology is actually isomorphic to the Poisson chromology, to the invariant Poisson cohomology. So the way we compute this is using the theorem and then describing all the S1 invariant multivector. Multi-vector fields on R3. And then there it's much less work to complete variation. Now I also want to look at the deformations in this case. So again, we consider pi with deformations given by our non-trivial classes. And then, well, what one can compute is that these are, well, Poisson if one has the corresponding. Saw if one has the corresponding relations between F and G described like this. But they form also three co-cyclics and then Poisson homology groups. And those are zero if either f of zero is zero or g of c is zero. And therefore one might ask um can one actually obtain actual um Poisson deformations in case one has this triviality condition in in cohomology? In comology. This is what I post here. And well, I think from formal deformation theory, it's known that one can do this in terms of power series around the origin. And then the question is, can one also get rid of the flat parts of this structure? Given that one has either f of zero or zero or g. Okay. Then let me move on to this Lie Achursk of type 6 plus. So these are our Fourier in this case is given by Okay, so I just draw the projection from above. So basically the leaves are Projection from above, so basically the leaves like this, and then we have again this C axis of zero-dimensional points. So that is for the case tau equal to one, and then for the various taus, one has some slight rotation of the leaves, but essentially that's the same. And now we'll look at the leaf space, which is in this case a certain denominator. real line of points in the middle to have some pictures okay and in this case we actually have to distinguish between different cases so this I put in color code for the different cases so we have tau equal to one or of the form one over n for n being well a natural number bigger than or big at least two and then the rest of the taus. And then the rest of the towers. Now, for the casimirs, we always obtain R, so there is no difference. But then in degree 1, we have a difference. So the group H1, they are isomorphic, in the case tau equal to 1, to the Lie algebra SL2R plus R. In the case tau is of this form 1 over N, then we have an isomorphism with the An isomorphism with the affine, so the two-dimensional non-abelian one plus r. And in the other cases, we just have r plus r, and here on the right side I wrote the generators correspondingly. So one can observe that these two generators, y partial y and partial c, they actually appear in all of them, and then just one has additional ones depending on how tau looks like. And then similarly, one has different cases for the D32. Different cases for the D32 part. So here, well, yeah, so we have isomorphisms with R3, R2, and R, respectively. And while the classes one, or the representatives one obtains are just the wedges of the partial C, so the last one here with the ones before. So that is basically how the H it is term. And H3 in this case is zero. That I did not. That I did not write down. And then, well, one can relate these classes again to linearization and deformations. So, what is known is that if a Poisson structure has, well, if one has a Poisson structure whose first jet is equal to the first jet of this pi tau, then we have then a local isomorphism whenever tau is in here. So, if it's in the interval 0, 1, but it's not a. In the interval 0, 1, but it's not of the form 1 over n for 2, for n being bigger or equal to 2. And that, well, the way, so this is proven by Dufour, first of all, and the way this is proven is basically to reduce it to the question of linearizing vector fields, and then one has the Nazi condition there. Okay, and well, the cases where it's non-linearizable, these are precisely described by deformations of this formula. Described by deformations of this form, which come from this Yn part here. Okay, so here I want to say a couple of more words to the proof. And in order to prove this, we use flat and formal Poisson chromology. So the basic idea behind is the following. So we have a Poisson submanifold n and our Poisson manifold and well this Poisson submanifold n. And well, this Personal manifold induces a short exact sequence on the level of multi-vector fields. So here, well, the one in the middle are just the multi-vector fields. The one on the right are the multi-vector fields, well, the sections of this bundle here, so wedges of Tn restricted to n with coefficients and the symmetric power of the polynomial bundle of n. So we will use this for the vector space. Use this for the vector space, so our manifold will be a vector space, and then one has the transverse vector space. And basically, what this is here will then be in terms of the power series transverse to our vector space we have. And then on the left-hand side, we denote this by the kernel of this map, and that will be the function, or the vector fields which are flat along this submap. Okay, so, and the Poisson differential descends to Differential descends to all these different types of vector fields. So, what we obtain is we obtain a long exact sequence for the cohomologies, and we denote the corresponding homologies as flat and formal for some cohomology along our manifold n. Okay, and then in this concrete example, right, what we do is our manifold n will just be this. Our manifold n will just be this real axis of zero dimensional, where we have the zero dimensional leaves. And because we have the description in this case of Lie algebra cohomology with coefficients, basically what is enough for is the short exact sequence on the coefficients. So here we have the functions which are flat at the c-axis, so meaning the infinite jet therapy is zero, the smooth functions, and then on the right-hand side the one where we consider power zeros in x, y, and then the coefficient. A power series in x, y, and then the coefficients will be functions with the z variable. And that, as here indicated, induces the long exact sequence in the more achieved. Okay, and then to prove the results we have seen before for the case 6 plus boils down to the following points. So, what we have is we have a long exact sequence and we divide the calculation into the formal part, into the flat part. And to the formal part, and to the flat part. And you can then compute the formal cohomology directly, that is just by looking at the Parma series. And then for the flat cohomology, well, what I described here is the case tau equal to 1, basically by taking out this sub-manifold n here, we have a Poisson diffeomorphism using cylindrical coordinates to the manifold series. The manifold 0 infinity times S1, so that are the cylindrical coordinates, and then the R coordinate is just a set coordinate. And then our Poisson structure becomes this R partial R H partial C, which actually we already know from the previous example before. Now, usually this coordinate transformation between cylindric coordinates and coordinates and R is not a diffeomorphism because you have the singularities at the X's. But because the singularities are But due because the singularities are only very mild, this flatness condition somehow keeps it under control. So what this map does is it induces an isomorphism between the flat functions, so the flat functions along the r axis and the flat functions at zero in the r coordinate. And then we can we obtain the flat cohomology just by our computation basically on this on this manifold over there, which is This manifold over there, which is much simpler. And then for the other tau cases, basically, one adapts this idea by adapting the map accordingly. Okay. And then we also have the case where tau is negative. So in this case, our foliation looks a bit more like Like this, so again this is the case tau equal to minus one. And in this case we distinguish two cases, but actually the distinction in this case is only And this case is only on the level of the Casimir functions. So if tau is of form minus p divided by q, for them being relatively prime, the Casimir functions are given by this beautiful expression here. I did not define a nice expression. So basically what we have is we have, so in this case, right, we have here a rational coefficient, and then the rational coefficient and then the function x to the power p and y to the power q is a smooth function on r and then the casimir functions are basically given by well a smooth function on r combined with this function x to the p, y to the q and then additionally what one has is um when one adds somehow functions which are flat How should I say this? So maybe let's say the g function somehow covers this leaf here, and then one can add somehow functions which are flat at the origin, but which describe the Casimir functions here and the Casimir functions here if the C is not. So that's basically what this G1 and G2 do. So the notation here means they are flat at zero. And then And then for the case where power is not of this form, well, we do not have smooth functions because we do, like there is no smooth description of this, the norm of x to the power minus tau y, the norm of y. But in this case, the Casimirs are given by constants, and then one just has this functions which are flat at zero, and then one just defines them somehow outside of. Somehow, outside of this cross here, and they all have the property that they go flat to this cross. Yes. Why you divided those two cases? Sorry? Those two cases, G2 minus XPYQ. Both of them are the same formula, so why? So the difference is here that here we allow smooth functions. So here we have jets. What do you say? Like the infinite jet of this function at zero is non-trivial, whereas for this Casimir functions, the infinite jet at zero is just given by the constants, and we do not have higher terms. This is due to the fact that these functions here are non-smooth on R, whereas this functions here are smooth on R. But the way this functions are non-smooth is somehow again covered by the fact that so the flatness controls the non-instance of this function. controls the non-stance of this function okay and then for the higher Poisson homology groups they are actually well similar in both cases so in both cases they are just free modules over S0 and the degree one with one generator and in degree two just with the wedge of S2. The wedge of these two elements. And again, one can look at the linearization and deformation cases. And again, one has this result due to the four by basically reducing it as before to its resonant vector fields. That these are linearizable whenever tau is not of this form minus p divided by q. Now, what is interesting in this case is that That so, ah, okay. So, first one again has, in the case where tau is of this form minus p divided by q, one has this non-linearizable homology classes. But in this case, one also has homology classes in the cases where they are where, what do you want to say? Non-trivial homology classes for the cases where this without structures are actually linearizable. Which is a little bit surprising, let me say. A little bit surprising when it's like one. Yeah, because usually, I mean, there are some cohomology classes in H2 which one can usually do not influence the linearization question, which are those where the coefficients are either linear or constant coefficients. But in this case, we really have some flat functions. So that's a bit different than what one would expect. And well, the proof of these cases is very much related to what we did before, just this time we used a different identification. And well, we do not only use like formal case along the z axis and then the flat case along the z axis, but we actually reduced it further to get something which is um flat along this this cross here in in multiple steps. And and multiple steps. Okay. And then okay, I want to go as a last part to the semi-simple Lie algebras. So for the compact semi-simple ones, there's a general result by Pinsberg and Weinstein, which is that for compact semi-simple Lie algebras, one has an isomorphism for the Poisson homology in terms of the standard Lie algebra cohomology. The standard Lie algebra cohomology and just the Casimir functions. Now, for non-compact ones, one does not have such an isomorphism in general for smooth Boisso chromology, but what one does have is for the formal Poisson cohomology around the origin, one can recover this isomorphism. So in this case, for the formal Poisson cohomology of semi-semple ch one has that um isomorphism. As a modulus, generally. Sorry, what does it mean, formal? Formal means in terms of, well, the coefficients we are considering are power series, well, in the variables. So in this case, what x, y? For this reading. Well, I mean, for general semester, yeah, channels. Okay, now the concrete case of S. Okay, now the concrete case of SL2R. So in this case, the leaves are given basically by the level sets of this function. So I don't give the source structure explicitly here. But well, the level sets are described like this. So one has this one-sheeted hyperbolate outside, then one has this the the newpotent cone with basically three leaves, so there's the upper cone, zero and the lower cone, and then one has the two sheeted hyperbola. And then one has the two-sheeted hyperpolar inside this cone. And then, well, the Poisson chromology in these cases are described in degree zero by smooth functions on R, which we combine with this generating function f. And in degree one, we have somehow two generators, N and T. N and T, where N is a transverse vector field, so transverse to the leaves, and T is a vector field which is tangent to the leaves. But they are both non-smooth at the core. So, in order to make this actual smooth vector fields, what we can, so the singularities are very controlled again, and we can multiply them with flat functions. So, this here are flat functions at zero. Flat functions at zero, so this they will be flat just along the column. And then h will be a function which is zero inside the column. So for all the two-shared hyperbolic. Okay. And then in degree two, we just have the wedge of these two generators. And in degree three, the cohomology classes are represented by power series in terms of this. In terms of this function f. And then at last, I want to say a few words about the proof of this, which is also used for the proof of a couple of other Lie algebras, which I do not mention here. So we have the following idea. So again, well, we have already tweeted, I guess, the Did, I guess, the formal Poissochomology. So, what we are left with is the flat Poisso cohomology. And well, our Poisson structure is not regular, but because we assume this flatness, this allows us to treat this whole complex as it would come from a regular Poisson structure, essentially. And what we then do is we apply a spectral sequence argument in order to reduce it to what is called tangential Poisson cohomology. Called tangential Poisson homology. So Poisson homology on the subcomplex, or we look at the subcomplex of vector fields where all the legs are tangent to the foliation. So this is isomorphic to foliated cohomology on the side of the foliation. In case of a regular Poisson structure, in this case, we do not have regularity, but again, this flatness allows us to treat it as it was regular. As it was regular. So we find an isomorphism between the tangential complex and the what we call flat foliated complex, which mimics the idea of computing foliated chromology. And in this case, well, because this foliation is unimodular, so it's generated by a closed one, closed vanishing one form, one can realize actually. One form, one can realize actually the complex for foliated cohomology as a sub-complex of the Durand complex by watching with this closed one-form in this case. So that's what we do here to describe the flat-foliated complex. And then the isomorphism is given between the tangential Poisson complex and the foliated complex. Complex and the foliated complex by the map associated to, well, in the one direction by the map associated with the pi vector, and the other one with the ephi symplectic form. Okay, and then as a last step in order to compute the Poisson chromology, what we do is we compute this foliated chromology, and this we do by using a contraction to a chromological skeleton. So in this case, So, in this case, so what is the idea from cohomology to skeleton? We want the skeleton to contain some of the cohomological information of all the closed leaves. So, outside, right, our leaves are essentially cylinders, so their homology or their topological information is contained in circles, whereas in the in the two-sheeted type of polar these are essentially planes, so their topological information is contained in points. Information is contained in points. So the skeleton we choose here is just the xy plane and then the z-axis. And what we do is we use the contraction to the skeleton by an infinite time flow. So we flow along this vector field, which is here drawn by these arrows. And on the skeleton, we have the foliation which is induced from the We have the foliation which is induced from the foliation outside. And basically, via this infinite time flow, what we can do is we find an isomorphism of the foliated cohomology of what we defined before and what we define as a flat-foliated complex on this skeleton by separating basically the plane and then the real line. Real line. And that one one can compute directly very easily. Then, so the difficult part is really to show that this infinite time flow behaves well and does analytically some weird things at infinity, basically. Yeah. And I was a bit too fast, which I was not expecting, but that was my talk. So, thanks for that. Yeah, so questions for Florian? So in one of the earlier slides you had a question about whether when f of g, f of 0 is equal to 0 and g of 0 is equal to 0. To zero and g of g is equal to zero, whether that produces deformation of the Poisson, sorry, of this Lie algebra. Yeah, exactly. This slide. I guess I was going to ask, maybe it's something obvious, but like what do you, so what if you just add this, so what happens when you add this by vector to your existing Add this bivector to your existing bivector, it's just not integable anymore. You add this by vector. So basically, the triviality in homology, right, that tells you that this three po-cycle is actually a three-co-boundary. So you can find a bivector field which you can add here. But then again, if you take the bracket of this new one with itself. Of this new one with itself, right? So pi applied to this new chi basically gives you the corresponding co-boundary, but then you obtain other terms by the bracket with all the other terms somehow. And the question is somehow, can you find a sequence which ends somewhere? I see, I see. And yeah, so in a formal way, so just on a level of power series, I think that that's very well understood. Just if you consider smooth functions, then it's... I I don't know. I don't know. So, for the formal part of the chromology, it's an easy question. Well, I'm not sure how easy it is, but I think there one can compute it in terms of, I think, homogeneous degrees of the power series one has. And then, somehow, by vanishing of the cohomology, always remove the corresponding homogeneous degree L, let's say, and then what one has is something which has degree L plus one. And so one gets rid of all the bars. And so one gets rid of all the positions. I think. But if in the second case where g is zero, then the first equation is satisfied. Yes, so one really on C does satisfy. I was wondering, so you showed this result of against Brune and Weinstein about the the cohomology of compact seismic linear algebras. Does this hold for other Linear algebras? For other ERG browsers now that you know the entire list, you could go through the list. Does this hold for other ones in the list? I did not check it. Well, I mean, there is only a chance to hold it for the cases where one has free modules, right? I that executes already quite some. Okay, so but I did not check it, I don't I don't know. But it was a good question maybe to check. I have a similar question. Can you do this kind of theorem for the algebra? I think you asked me that already, but I yeah I don't know, it would be interesting, but I don't know. I also ask you a question which I think I asked you before. It's a different question. So can you use information about SL2R to say something about in general semi-symperial commodity semi-symperial? I still don't know. But th that is, yeah. I mean, I started looking a bit into what is it like? SO41, but I did not yet. Not expecting to compute the whole thing, but at least give some information. Yeah. I don't know. Some sort of Maya Viltoris for Poisson chromology that one might be able to use some of these results for Poisson manifolds which are not directly dual to Poisson? Yes, so there is a Mayaviotoris and I mean one also has a pretty good understanding of the regular part of the Pisochomology of a regular so manifold. So if one wants to compute the Pysochomology So if one wants to compute really Poisson comology of a Poisson manifold, then it's really up to somehow cutting out the singularities and then understanding how the cohomology used. And then one can clue it backwards might be to. Maybe for some nice three-dimensional for some manifolds you might be able to. May yeah, maybe. So I well I'm working on a project where we want to do this for Poisson for manifolds, for Poisson structures. For Poisson structures associated to left-shaped separation than four-dimensional ones. But the, yeah, I don't understand. What is known about how this Poisson homology of Lieutenant Related to the Poisson homology of D-singularizations? Can we say anything about the Poisson homology of D-singularizations? In terms of the kind of So, the only thing I can say is we and my PhD thesis, we also computed the Poisson homology of SO3,1, which is isomorphic to SO2C. And there basically I, well, one way we approached this at some point was using also this Kroten-Dick Springer resolution. And then one can designularize the precise structure on SL2C, where we use the real. Where we use the real Poisson structure. Upstairs as basically, so there the designerization is the codundant model of S2, and then one has R2, and the while group is S2. And basically, the Poisson structure is given by the Poisson structure on the two-sphere times one of the parameters plus the canonical the canonical well symplectic structure on the cotangent panel. Structure on the cotangent funnel. And for this case, one actually can compute it very nicely. So that would also be one question which I have in that direction: if one can generalize this to all complexing sample algebras. But I only have that one example which I computed, so I don't know. Okay, no further questions? Any questions from the Zoom audience? So yeah,
