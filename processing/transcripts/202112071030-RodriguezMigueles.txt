Well, first, thanks for the invitations a gustas to make Colin Kerrido y well this platform. This plateau baser is understanding the geometry of certain varieties that have complemented us. So, to put in context a little motivation of the problem, I have a little superficial case. This por eliminates classification, if we have a oriental superficial, with  The model of the discovery, and we are a polygon and identifying para delay. This optimos the superficial so three varieties there exist the analog or there are geometries. Entre las que están ver este pues las analogas, Eclidiana, especially products for there, and two, the Sol and Curient Universal Coordination of Lui is two. E s le dos. There is such and one of the papers is that the mayor are varied, son so son son, pergolicas. The system here representadas as possible a group of description: this and a little bit and achieve because between 35, 15, 50, 10, 25, 40. In these three, with number of cruces, nor queuing todos. Except 5 percolic in 2020 that we have the complementary, especially varied, is admitted a hyperbolic metric. That is what I amplify, and this bueno is a nice, and others that the land. And others that the logo is unfierized, a term of dad por per manifesto that all three varietates, all three varieties compact, admit a composition canonica. Empenazos that are geometric. And the other way, that we have very controversial that we can charge. We can have a infinity of metrics a superficial metric. Data superficial, a infinity of metrics and parabolic metrics that are submetricas, all the contrary. If a three-variant data infinito tres varied. If the admitte, that is unicorn, or una engine. And here this interest: this can be traditional to say, however, invariant geometrical environments in relation to some topological variants. And in this moment, we can establish a bonito problem that the program of geometric effective geometry that planta is in contrast to estimations effective. And computables fiéricos. This apart from invariants. This como motivation. Ok, so we can see the colours. Okay, so we're going to have to do it. Okay, so the three variety, we concrete problem, we're going to put our projects in the middle of the case. So, that's, we are like, okay. And this and the object that will be unitary superficial units that the space of directions unitaries in cases in the planet, Punto, that is this space of dimension 3 natural sigma. And minudo como loves obtainer pose una I decided to serve this orientada Besica. And a canonical manner in the unitary tension that implementes to mar the position and the velocity. For the dynamic parameters, the periodic orbit of flujo geodesic. Ok. Those tagitos across this queue is like the classic dysotopia, objects and rigid objects, and I can figure out this as a new unit and well interest is that this as a nude that has not dependent on the metric that is the principle. So this independent independence of parametric Okay. Now disultitude of the platicitology, very exit alliance, perfect of the curb modula, but this para los four. For the case, this superficial modular superficial and paramount modular. That topologically like this, there is more. It is implemented a disco with a point without. With a conical order, a point without it. Yes, this is the most topological image, and because many people are in studio establishments, the point of view is arithmetic, dynamical, topological, geometrical, like embroideries, pinsky, sarnacles, dogs, very much others, also. Well, one of the details is that it is. One of the tallest is that we are very clear that in the tangent unitary superficial modular superficial, it is 3. With our family very special. But that is one of these orbitals, and nothing. This orbit records that are here. This sentences can be. This sentences associated with detectamentevajopi, a Jedica service. So perspective is a classes of conjugation and perbolicas left. It is contrary to my values. That matters. Well, that are the same. No, well, regarding it. So, there are correspondence very well with other periodic orbits that are Lorenzo Lorenz del Gas American, Eduard Lawrence. So, this nudos of the So, these nudos of Lorenz because it is very popular, okay? So, the history of three stories that these periodic orbits have been in a flujo are Lorenzo who understands a model atmospheric model. So, what is this simplification if the equations are in control of an differential equation? No, that is a complicated thing or more simple, and what? Simple, and what if you want to see the idea? Yo, all the solutions of the orbitas. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, yes. This logio, that allumulated in this. What all if it accumulates in this attractor extraordinary Lorenzo? No? This Tucker, Williams, Beermann, and Guggenheimer, if a model masses simplified geometrical periodic orbits, that is cumulative in relation to these superficial, a ramification. And a ramification that they are like, average if there was a signal. False others, but that also important superficial queue as well. And well, we are alive in the podemos ver as matrix, we can associate the nudo que send reda in the nudo el treble. And associated estamatries, here we are. If this others are very good, this is in es3. When this is Dolbido, this US of the treble, and vido, y has a flu in retreat. Okay, so this is complicated, whereas more complicated metrics. So what we did is that one can Williams Beerman lo que seron esta quiue apoder este uni núbo. On my nudo, and it's a good pose that orbits period and here, for example, here is the first time. Espasas pora por abajo, por vajo por riba, esprezaja está. Todas están descriptas porjirar en loja decha de una forma, y lo rejo squída este estimo, all optimo sí. But what? But what we do, that we can differ the designer because the group is the two general practices of matrices and parabolic materials, so for the combinatorial comments, these same correspondence with the palabras in the primitives. Yahora, well that we have all resulted, also very good of this Carolin Cidis who. Series that we have the points in the infinite point in the universal coverage per book of points, we will have a very good thing that relationships the combinatorial relations of this pad with point infinite points, which have the age of disc. Yes, that has a tomos generated from groups of doceta. So, we have toddlers can see how this is not where the emphasis are not. So, this is a matrix that is conjugated But this point is in the infinite queen explain with infinite fraction continuous. That is why exponents periodic. Sky engama, and information infinitely codified with the palace with what disclosed initially. And well, an observation here is that you have the disease of periods of continuous fractions, but it is not in this same combinatorially. Communatorially, the number of palabras here in your palace can the control. The fraction continuous, because one, more, more, one about cadet. And the period of finites, because we don't rationalize. Ok? Bueno. This day, the concept.  And here the result is initial es que esto ti admit una agement geometry parole channo. And that is a more fully blatant. This valid and perbolica and infinite volume. Ok. For the people who have a little more interest in these puzzles, and that the world is that the observation is evaluated for many. En haces vibrados over false, or false conditions. That conditions are good that you can generate this. And that is a policy. The first thing that is irreducible, that the fundamental groups infinite group and that is. So this meta is changing our problem here that we have to contradict this one effective estimate or the invariant colour volume. Estimate volume in gamma en terminus of gamma, no projection. What information can the palace also appropriate from the geodesic? Ok, that is objective.   Look what a geodesic, no, and a corresponding view. And this geodesic, the puede described as a palabra in Equi Cal, and that algorithm. Finally, a matrix with center matrix to elemental movements of matrices with these two puestions. Now, how do you say, I can say this? Ok, sixteen. Okay, so we're going to superior volume. So, there are a form of superiority for varied propositions. Res validadic volume infinite volume: the volume of this variety based with a triangulation of your variety, and when it is the number of tetrahedral utilities to triangulate this variety. And that is an estimation. This triangulation has ideal. This number. Betres in 2020. Better is the volume of a convertible enslautes alpha, but it is irregular. So this pass una cara otra is a soméria of this group of people two groups of sommer. If you dig the fimo ya esceromo thorston que té say que volume simplica, sigua que volume. So what first result of the film Pinski Silverman? And ours is a constant positive constant, so that the volume is cotton period for the longevity of the geodesic. Okanto universal constant universal constant. No, it's a universal constant. If you send us notes, we can try some good as well, but obliterate many beneficiaries, many applications. In contrast, this crematoos que este que el volumen. This volume for 2 multiplicative for the number of other intersections. That is very intersections there in the superficial intersection. And the bonito of this result because I have a little bit of character is because it is valid for this invariant vaccine group of superficial groups. So that is different. Variante what is biene la continuación aquabos como apareceda. O se a papara este caso se para en lases en laces librados. If you can control their sessions that this optical, there goes a little, but this is a example.  And this nudo of the treble, the volume of this view, this complement of nudo, va estara cotado por el volume de other en lace má simple. Ma simple queen, this passage for this. All these are compared for this because of natural numbers that measure all this cost for this. But the period of mismanagement. The same. And theorem that theorem for modular superficial family can represent these fields that are represented here, like Yes. Are this families with the satisfaction in this? So volume of the correspondent fires and this palabra is cotada porocho. This is why the period more linear with the period. So here all the complexity that we have told in red paras families and reduce and when we do one of our bus. No, it doesn't. The example we work with. No, the event of this theorem is that it is valid for what we're going to use in our solo para tancient unitary superficial. And you can manage it, that no afforation. That affords us the Italian to lose yours, which are general if projects us simplified. This morning, this is what we have two because we have the longitudinal and number of intersection estimates, but the volume is across. No, we have no text, yes. Yes, we are the cooler queen to see families. Well, this ok to see this problem is noton, okay. OK, we have this and what we observe in this superficial ramification or the plant of Lorenzo. It is that the flujo que hace estas cosas, noce oce vapara cas, se regret loja, es mismo raja, oce va para la other oreja, o que hace ojira la mismo réja de este sentido, esquiado, o se vada acapaca. O es la dynamic, y corto. And if you're not here, what we obtain is a trench. As you know, I would say the trench aquí in Chiquito. Al corto que da algo sí. Y this identica con identidada en este, y este con esta. Y el fluco como va sí, que va pa. I see. So interesting, we're going to see one. Today is the first thing as well. But how for example this palabra que cuatro, equres, equis. And my regression. If all this are parallels, when we are parallels, but intersect, and this structure is true. Because the period and voyage for the truth is that this a society is a vector that is palable 35. And that is like this. I said, when you go in parallel, and when you bring it up, these altars are spaces, and they are 50 queues in parallel. So, one thing is like this, and it's like the machine of Enigma, as you parallel the roads, a cosmos. And it was embedded. So, if it is operation like myself and have the curve intersect here in the curb in Aquín el Curva intersect y vaca y síguna sirujía este veven estipo uno ka uno menos ka esto va ser estengido es a nio va ser unjido ve y despa. Intersecta y es ayo, logo jidar yes. And that modify the local mentee in this, not modify globally. Modification globally. On localment, that is a modification, but just what you do here. No, it is a modification local and not the same. So, we will see how much and projects of this. Estos enigmas. And regret. And regress the stack. Also, we're going to be able to see, but then we're going to see a projection. The projection of this, if you have all these things, all these trivial, this has a natural project. This form is one that is all complicated. And the worst. And the words all these projections audio. So basically, the idea of project is not that so that it is simplified because of a moment of intersections that proportional the period, one of two interesting pods. No? So what is the idea because I am. When it idea, because I see all this and agreed, because the idea is that agreed none affects the volume. What is it, my Megama como? This how the unitary other superficial. Other superficials that have Ronaldo agujeros 25 and union queen que loved, digital to buy how this projection is nudo del treble as affected local maintenance more than there are Simply only affecting the diva here so that you affect these ideas. So that will be these punchaduras and three intersections. So you have three, this has proportional. This time that proportionality period and between these intersections to my results because the bonito of this queen depended the general de la superficial or visible general only the importance. So it is not important. And the intersection of this curve, with this curb, is something that the period. So the product using the intersection. And well, top and if you can put it For the sixteen part, if you can put images or the magic, There is a numeric evidence that the same authors of the result of the superior aja and this evidence, and the numeric evidence that I in the modulation is cognizant. Cojero knows a geodesics that we have given. The possibility of a program that is not programmed to calculate volumes in the spheroid and this location. You compare the volume with the longitude, and they don't have this parcel, so you can linear correspondence. So, it's the question natural, and this is the case. The question natural sera, would exist a collection of geodesic collections, so the longitude of this infinite y the longitude is cost for the volume. No, no, this is for the volume and the respondent. This is a result that I believe that this exists a constant positive. This modulo factor that is the function of Lambert. And well, how we are the dynamic part of the many dynamic cases.  Este cremasi Martinez we más vargas pellets una geolísica este existe una delta between.  Okay. So it's going to be like this resultados consequences. We have the period of things that are cotandondas. So the theorem is that we are familiar with.  A geodesic geodesic, the geodesic, and this ergodic, and that measure, exponential. So, using the geodesic fluid, can be darn a notion of geodesic, for example, if you are a And there what the final point of where you can with the point initial, with a cognitive. And that you can see the class of Zotopia de Sarcurba, and that will be the chicks. Well, if we have this queer more combinatory and more visual. So, this positively exponential particular exponent, no? So, it is a family of what we have to do superiorly. Ok, so this. Okay, so this lawyer is our cotta that is that for the torso with a gujer for superficial. If it is a simple con una gujero, then the volume of inferior influence por vere. Por vetres between the numero de classes utopia, gamma arcos where in the superficial superficial conjero, but this curb is in this pantaloon. And also a men for this allego. So you eliminate that time. This para is this binomial, like the same in the superficial. This in the superficiency modular, we have two interests, and the colour seen a hero, no, and regrets. That is here, what if they are and this is a. Abriente de verdances, altoro con una jujero y aquí cuesto una de los levantamientos desta curva se de la sigente forma son heros alredor de la cuzpira casjios. Cajiros, and when I panted, well, I want to calculate the complexity of this. So, to the curb alpha, simple, puzzle calcula and cortex, the trace of the cortex, and the curb master. Hasí. So these jihads can concatenate these parameters in some distinct classes of class, because distinctions for all these curves, all these binomios, and that means the classes of classes, because we are levantament, this is not the same, it is. So classes mustopia que estengo almenos tengo este tengo perdo tengo tengo tantas como espreado sino que tengo tantas como como eso y es es laida entonces el problema que esquería platicar para ultimo y serari esta part dynamic esa. To compare in the volume, it compare with. So exist linear relations between the two. Well, this is Gracias. We have time to say, I figured, I would expensario theodic varies as a monetary, which is.  But what is this cojo? The variable toddler that this cogen suggests that the suggestions that proponent of the variable are not the associated baser and not pero that perspective like a chaminate elator. When the superior final suggestion is when the inferior volume is also congenial, The corazon of dark inferiors that para is the most difficult. Just the mellow de la recall correction of this product of Eagle Four Storm that is. That is what per bolica of infinite volume superficially incompressible. So let's say the volume of this variety, this paragraph is per volume. This inferiorly por el volume simplicity, the double variety to incompressible superficial. Coneso superficially incompressible 3:20 perfectly en double estimates your superficial per book, a variety of publicity, and a superficial cortex. So, all that copies of the pedas. Copy that copy, so this is the double y peg to the with the identity components of the board. And that's a variety of connects, but if it is parable the variable with this and this as a puzzle, you have to see this perbolic part. The parti per bolica because the perbolic part is decipher, solid volume. So, detect the perbolic and hyperbolic por the number of cusps. So, if you find the number of cusps and tines, that pass here with nudes in this variety, but many classes of nudes, tines in the Number 2, 2 in the number of cousins that is utopia of optivists. And how is this the first concern in pantalones that parallel establishment? Yes? Are you commenting? Hola, if you can say, this notion of definitely generic ideas, like a change of theory, that's very interesting. But there is the part that I don't know the geometric part. There are many work in the definition of the idea to groups of here, where we are moving with your palabras. But usually, Palabras, but usually the difficulty of situating the distribution that is not. So that is because I really are totally ignorant of the children, and well, there is a lot of people.
