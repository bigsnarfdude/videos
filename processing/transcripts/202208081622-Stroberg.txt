Alright, yeah, so thanks for bearing with the technical difficulty there. I'm going to be talking about concentration since incrowed environments. I'd like to start, let's see, if this might last talk of the day, so I get the acknowledgements out of the way first. Some of this was done when I was a postdoc in Santiago Chinel's group at the University of Michigan, along with another postdoc, Jackson Einstein. And then it's continued by a couple of students, Tobert and Alex at the University of Alberta. And I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me. That was kind, and most of what I'll talk about is here. If you're interested, okay. So I think we've seen a couple of talks already today about sort of this idea of measuring concentrations, right? Idea of measuring concentrations, right? And this similar paper by Berbing Hursel about how a receptor looks at or measures concentrations. All sorts of error messages here, so but as long as you can't see them, that's fine. And the basic idea, which I think has been put maybe better by the previous couple speakers, is that you get some time series of receptor occupancy. Time series of receptor occupancy of this diffusing light on the surface of a cell, for example. As it finds a receptor, some downstream process records that, and through that time series, you get some information about the concentration of this ligand in the environment. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, uh yeah exactly. So there is in reality, right, you have a ligand that comes and diffuses to the surface and you'll get a couple of rebinding events, right? You know, find the surface leaf, find the surface leave. And then sometime later, once this algorithm goes away, maybe another one comes in, you get another series of binding events, right? And the information about the concentration, or if you want to infer the concentration from this time series, really you're looking at the distribution of unbound. Really, you're looking at the distribution of unbound or survival times of an unbound sensor. And the reason for that is that if something's bound, you're getting no new information from the far field. You need something to come in from the far field to allow you to make that measurement. And so, really, it's the times when the sensor isn't found that tells you everything you need to know about the concentration in this case. And I think Andrew just talked about the sort of the limits here about basically the correlation time of this time signal and some binding probability, so that's sort of the effect or maybe a rate constant or something comes into play there, and an observation time. So you look longer, you integrate over a longer period, and you get a smaller error. So this is the mean squared error and the concentration. So, this is the squared error and the concentration measurement. But this is for, and it's been worked by Bernie Purcell and then others after that, to add some reaction-limited components to this as well. So, if you have some intrinsic rate at which this reaction occurs, it changes the bound. And this is done in the dilute limit. This is right where what we mean by that is that there's What we mean by that is that there's no interaction between the ligands themselves, or fusion doesn't change, rate constants don't change, things like that. But in cells, inside of the cell where there's lots of measurements to be made, it looks quite different. So this is, of course, a cartoon. But it's certainly not dilute, it may be diluted. Dilute, it may be dilute in a sort of ligand, but it's certainly not a sort of a free diffusive process. And to maybe make that point more concrete, I'm going to talk a bit about a specific example that I'm interested in that hopefully motivates some of this work. And that's protein folding inside the endoplasmic reticulum. So, the ER, for those of you who are not familiar, is this big Non-familiar is this big reticulated structure outside of the nucleus that kind of wraps it around. And about a third of proteins in eukaryotic cells are folded inside of the ER. In some cells, like professional secretory cells, like a beta cell, for example, pankaryota cells, it can be much higher. This is, for example, pro-insulin, the precursor to insulin. And the process is quite complex. Is quite complex where you have ribosomes studying the surface of the ER, and the nascent protein is extruded into the undoplasmic reticulum, and you have these shaperdones. This one's, for example, BIP, binds it immediately to make sure it folds correctly. You have this other slew of other proteins that are all interacting at different stages along this process. And sometimes it folds correctly, sometimes it doesn't fold correctly. Correctly. And so the cell has to, in order to sort of regulate this, somehow the cell has to know whether it's folded correctly or incorrectly and initiate some sort of feedback like because of that. And this is particularly true for, as I said, these pancreatic beta cells, which secrete insulin. And what you can see here is What you can see here is this is the pro-insulin production, so it's the precursor to insulin, as I mentioned, at a low glucose concentration and then at a high glucose concentration. The production changes by an order of magnitude or more. And what that does is, if you look, this is going to be, these micrographs are tough to see, but basically this is what the ER looks like at low glucose. You can see that it has these nice. You can see that it has these nice sort of cisterna. And then, if you have high glucose, or if you look at a beta-cell of diabetes patient, you'll see that it's very distended. And basically, what's happening is there's this huge buildup of pro-insulin that induces this volumetric change of the ER, so this is morphological change that's about three to five times in volume. But the protein copy number can change by. But the protein copy number can change by 10 or more times. So, what you end up with is a very highly concentrated environment in which you still have misfolded proteins, but most of them are folded properly or on the folding pathway. So they're protected by chaperones. And this way, they're really just taking up volume in some way. And that's what we mean by crowded. So they're sort of. So they're sort of occupying this space, slowing everything down, but you still have this underlying subset that have come off the folding pathway and need to be measured, or at least detected in some way so that the cell can respond to this. And not to go too far into this, but there's this whole signaling pathway that I won't talk about, but the idea is that they measure these unfolded proteins or misfolded proteins and either induce And either induce some response or they kill the cell. And that's what causes, or at least related to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and a bunch of other 15 floating diseases. So what we're interested in here is how does a cell measure those unfolded proteins in this very crowded ER? So there's a ton of other proteins around that may or may not be. That may or may not be folded correctly. And just the remainder here, we'll be first talking about how does crowding affect stimuli in sort of maybe a silly way, and then talk about a way to simulate this a little bit more efficiently, I think. And then just maybe a simple example of something you can calculate with this. So the first part here. The first part here, this is just a sort of a silly model showing how a cell measures, or a receptor would measure a ligand concentration, right? And so what you'll see is just a realization of different ligand configurations. When a ligand is on top of here, you count it. When you don't, you don't count it. And as you integrate that signal over time, you can estimate the ligand concentration. Okay, there's 10 in this case, by the way. There's 10 in this case. By the way, it takes a little bit of time, but eventually you get there. That's great, right? So now what happens, I'll say these aren't dynamics. They aren't diffusive motions. We're just doing, I guess they're dynamics in a different sense, but they're different realizations of configurations in this space. And so if you just add stationary, or not stationary, but at least crowders that are inert. Crowders that are inert but take up space, right? What do you get? You get some offset in the concentration that you measure, as you would expect because you change the volume. You change the available volume, so you're going to get some offset. Now, if you also allow some fluctuation in the crowders, you can do the same thing, and you'll eventually get to that same sort of offset concentration. But there's, because the crowder fluctuates, Because the crowder fluctuates, it's like an external noise source, and you'll get an additional time scale due to that, the crowder fluctuation. And so, this is sort of the measurement time or errors function of measurement time for different time scales for switching the crowder now. So in these pictures, at least so far, I guess what we've seen is that crowding, so I'm going to use phi as a fraction. Use phi as a fraction, the volume fraction of crowder. So as phi increases, we get a concentration that's dependent on phi, and then also an external noise source that's dependent on phi. But in those simple sort of simulations, I didn't, as I said, dynamics wasn't included. But in reality, the diffusion coefficient will change with phi. The rate constant will change with the amount of crowding. So if you have crowders around, So, if you have crowders around, different configurations are more or less preferred. Similarly, the diffusion is either slowed down or sped up in certain cases. And so really, and I should say that there's also, there's a spatial dependence to this too, if you have different concentration gradient away from, for example, a receptor or a cell surface. And so it becomes a real mess. And so we'd like to. We'd like to be able to at least simulate this, okay? At least simulate this, and including some spatial details, okay? And so one way to do this is I just do a Brownian dynamic simulation, okay, where we have some reaction that occurs, okay, within the crowded environment. And this is a simple example. And this is a simple example where you just have a ligand and a ligand and a receptor, and they find with forward rate K plus and dissociated with rate K minus. And there's been some work on, not by me, but other groups, have figured out ways to simulate this effectively, where, for example, how to do simulation. Examples. So, how to do simulations in a crowded space? And in particular, you decompose these forward and backwards rate constants between the bound and the unbound state into these intrinsic components, some reaction zone, and then some excess energy contributions that are a function of the local cry. Or more specifically, basically, we think of them as hard spheres, but in this case, they're not hard spheres. In this case, they're not hard spheres, they're interact with the soft potential. But they're hard spheres, you can't put two things on top of each other when they're dissociating. So you can incorporate conformational changes upon disassociation or association into this. And that's calculated, that's contained there. And so what you can do is you can simulate a system like this and get a time series for the switching with the presence of parameters. The problem The problem is that this is very computationally expensive because you're doing basically molecular dynamic simulations for a very long time in order to get a good estimate of this correlation function. And it's also heavily dependent on the rates which you choose. So if you have a slow sort of switching process, so if you have a slow association rate or a slow dissociation rate, you have long periods where you're not going to. You have long periods where you're not getting any new information about the system. Okay, so we're trying to figure out how to better calculate these things. And one way is to, instead of calculating the correlation function directly, we can use this formulation of the, it's called the reversible separation function. That, and this is the idea of the probability at time tau, given that it was bound at time tau. How, given that it was bound at time zero, basically, that the that it's not bound at time kile given it was found at time zero. And it only depends on a irreversible survival probability of a receptor and ligand contact. So that's, so if you have considered the system as irreversible, right, you start out with a ligand next to it, next to the receptor. Next to the receptor, and it has some probability of diffusing away or some return time to the surface of the receptor. Okay? So if we can calculate this, we can calculate the correlation function. And another caveat here is we're going to make the assumption that the off rate is low enough, or that these complexes are long-lived enough that the That the local surrounding, while it's bound, reaches sort of a local equilibrium distribution. And that allows us to decouple the bound and unbound states. So the sort of quickly go through the algorithm here is that we take a bound case, we do Brownian dynamic simulation in bound state without any reactions. We just get confirmation. We just get confirmations of basically trying to get the radial distribution function of the crowders and the ligands in the bound state. Once we have that, we then do a Monte Carlo sampling of those states, and that gives us the excess, basically the excess free energy of that disassociation process. And we also additionally get sort of an ensemble of just unbound states. So, what is the system? Alright, so what does the system look like just after unbounding? After unbinding. Then the next step is to do a bryodynamic solution in the unbound state, where again, this is irreversible survival probability. And you get a set of trajectories in the unbound state, and then you sample those trajectories for reactions in a certain way to get the a certain way to get the I basically get this excess binding quantity that allows you to get the forward forward rate. And importantly, you're calculating gamma here, not any of the intrinsic rate constants that end up in fitting parameters. And then once we have that, we can calculate details, we can calculate irreversible survival probability. Irreversible survival probabilities from that data. And yeah, from that you can get the autocorrelation function. Okay, so that's details of the algorithm, but long story short, to validate this, we look at a small system, and so the dashed lines here are poorly reversible simulations. The other lines are these quasi-reversible. Are these quasi-reversible signations? And what you see is you get very good, essentially identical agreement between the two. And importantly, so to compute a point with the reversible simulation, it takes to a certain degree of error, it takes, what, 10 days or so. To compute a point with this algorithm, it takes about two days. Takes about two days on a single computer. But when it is now followed by the second point curve of our intrinsic rate constant, to do it for the reversible case, I need to do the same simulation, so I get another 10 days. But using this, I get this entire curve, and essentially it's for free. And it goes for any of the rate constants, so k on and k off in this case. So, let's see, yeah, we've got a few minutes. So, one, I guess it's much faster. And two, it allows these concepts to sort of vary. So, if you think about trying, if long term, what we want to do is make a model of an experiment. And these aren't necessarily experiments in the measurable, but you could fit something, you could fit your Browning dynamics model to an experiment. Dynamics model to an experiment, and being able to sweep this parameter space is very advantageous for that process. Okay, so to maybe start at a physical question, can critique increase the accuracy? And just to make this concrete, we'll consider a case where the ligand and receptor are about the same size, and another case where we have a very small ligand that's being perceived by some big cell. Maybe you could think of protein. Maybe you can think of protein-protein binding, or something where you have a small molecule being detected by a protein. And we like to vary the parameter concentration and the intrinsic rate constant and see if there's an effect on something. What we find is for the protein-protein case, basically, no. So as you change the degree of crowding, you necessarily increase the You necessarily increase the sensing area. So you get a less accurate measurement at different degrees of pragmatism. For the other case, where you have a small eigen, you can find cases where this is the opposite is true, where you actually decrease the error measurement by increasing the crowd. And so this is, again, maybe not the best measure of the detection of a Measure of the detection of a signal. We probably want to calculate something like the mutual information for this. And Zober is doing something like that at the moment. But the idea is that really, if you're using the reversible simulations, you're really hosed if you want to calculate one, a curve like this, or even more specifically, a mutual information, or try to estimate something like a mutual information. Something like a mutual information, because you need a lot of simulation. But here it becomes feasible. And the reason, at least in this case, is that as you increase croton, for cases where the intrinsic rate is low, so that they don't have a great affinity, you can basically keep a ligand by the receptor longer, allow it to bind more effectively, and in that way. And in that way, you can have a better measurement at a certain level of cravin. So, what this tells us is that you can sort of tune a receptor to a specific level of craving. Whether that's the case in the plasmic reticulum, it remains to be seen. But that's something we're going to try to address with these simulations. So, I just to conclude, maybe something I'll leave you with is that. Maybe something I'll leave you with is that crowding really affects all aspects of concentration measurements. It changes things by the bit in terms of both the sort of external noise and then the actual properties of what we typically use as constants for a receptor, like a ligand-receptor pair, like a diffusion coefficient or a rate constant or something like that. They're highly dependent. Or something like that. They're highly dependent on the degree of crowding. So, what we've done is we've developed an algorithm for simulating this more effectively in crowded environments. And with that, you can show that there are certain degrees of crowding that are optimal for a particular ligand-receptor pair in some way. In some way. And then last, there are a lot more questions to be answered. If anyone's interested in crowding or information processing in the crowded environment, I'd love to talk more and find any collaborations. So, with that, yeah, thank you. You had your hand up. Thank you for the great talk. I wonder when you talk about crowding in the cell or in those environments, if there are many molecular motors moving around, causing the crowding things to also move a little bit in a maybe not really detail-balanced way, how would that impact the diffusion or kind of the ligand interaction and diffusion with the ligand? Yeah, so if there's some directed motion of a molecular motor carrying something, is that what you're talking about? You're talking about, or are you probably not really regular? Maybe you have many motors moving in a certain way, but not in a uniform way, and that might cause the crowded space to be sometimes swelling a little bit, sometimes shrink a little bit. How would it sell compensate for that? I don't know. Yeah, so that would, in some ways, I think what you're describing is the fluctuation in the crowding. Yeah, and so that would. Right. Right, it would cause all of these parameters to fluctuate as well. And whether or not that's, you know, at the first order, it probably just comes as an external noise source. But whether or not that affects, you know, maybe a receptor only receives a ligand when that space opens up a certain degree or the crotch falls below a certain point. I can imagine something like that, but I don't have to play sort of the example to give. Sort of the example to give of that happening. So I think I have a related question. So diffusion is an important part of your model, but inside the cell, diffusion is really constrained by the structure of the macromolecules that are found in the cell. And they're not just floating. It's actually a cytoskeleton, and there's all sorts of tubules and so on and so forth. So actually, the diffusion is not in three. Actually, the diffusion is not in 3D. It's not in 2D. It's somewhere in between 2D and 3D for a given type of molecules. Yeah, so that's a great question. So what I was particularly interested in is inside the endoplasmic reticulum, that's sort of where this was motivated. And in that case, you have both just not even the sort of structure of the cytoskeleton, but the structure of the organelle is in big sheets and then big tubes. And so you do have sort of. And so you do have sort of quasi-2D diffusion, there's quasi-1D diffusion, and then in some of these cases in the micrograph, you see it open up and swell, and then it becomes more quasi-3D. So I guess, yes, long-term, that's absolutely what we're looking at. If I had 100 graduate students, we'd have an answer. But yeah, that's a great question. Really interesting. So my question is around like when you have this not crowdings and the rest of the do you expect to also there be some non-specific bindings that are happening that's happening how can I show that there is a lot? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So if you have well if you have non-specific binding, right, that maybe that gets somewhat to the multiplexing that you To the multiplexing that you were talking about, right? So you really have maybe two different types of lightings, and if you can't separate them, it becomes noise in some way. And it makes it so that you can't measure them accurately. You can only measure sort of their collective concentration or something like that. So in that sense, there's a lot there are lots of cases where the Cases where the affinity is, right, it's a spectrum of affinities, especially for some of these unfolding protein sensors. They like a lot, basically everything, but they like unfolded proteins more. So there's, yeah, to give you a short answer is yes, when there is unspecific When there is unspecific binding, it will change this picture. But that's something we can simulate with this and actually test to see what degree of unspecified binding you can resolve, or you can still make a measurement. So it's really just crowding. It seems to me, at the beginning, you mentioned it changes a lot because of lab result density and stuff. So, do you think cells are actively adapting to this climate or it's like just robust to changes in feeding fasting cycles seems to be a huge yeah yeah so they I guess they they are probably rob um both both okay so they they have to be somewhat adaptive to it in order to to be able to to withstrain the To restrain the initial influx of new proteins, right, without changing really their environment. But then the entire protein folding program adapts if there's a high need. And you get a bunch more chaperones, you change the structure, and you do all of these different sort of adaptive mechanisms, hopefully bring the crowding down to a level where you can actually probably again control the system. Control the system. Did you hit the button?
