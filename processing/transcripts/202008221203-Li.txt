Hi, my name is Nali. I just finished a one-year postdoc with Dr. Dang on LED product inventory management and demand forecasting. Today I'm going to talk about a decision integration strategy for short-term demand forecasting and ordering for red-black cell components. This is more like an application for the inventory management problem. Problem. This work is a joint work with Dr. Dang, Dr. Cheng, and Nancy Professor Heddle at McMaster University. And it is in collaboration with Canadian Blood Services and the McMaster Center for Transfusion Research. Black product is crucial and life-saving treatment. Red blood cell can. Red black cell component is extracted from the whole black collection, as shown in this figure, separated from a plasma unit. And red cell blood component contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and a small amount of plasma. It has a fixed shelf life for 42 days, and there are eight it is usually given to patients with low hemoglobin. With low hemoglobin, according to choosing West Lake Canada, hemoglobin less than 80 grams per liter. Canadian Glass Services is the national glass supplier in Canada, excluding Quebec province. In Quebec, they have their own glass supplier called Fima Quebec. Every year, the cost for RBC transfusions is estimated about $300 million. $300 million in Canada. So, for this project, the overall objective is to increase the accuracy of RBC demand forecasting using mathematical models and apply inventory management techniques to improve the efficiency of the entire flat demand and supply chain in Canada. And more specifically, we summarize the key challenges in hospital biofuels, we direct and validate our We develop and validate a hybrid model combining a status forecast time series model and a machine learning model to forecast the future RBC demands using a large clinical database. We then propose an integrated autoing strategy considering a multi-period inventory problem that can achieve significant cost reductions as well as the RBC inventory level and ordering frequency. The main concept The main contribution of this study is that the model we propose can help hospital brand banks achieve a leaner and fresher inventory, leading to a lower day of inventory on hand, which may correlate with better patient outcomes according to multiple clinical journals, and can achieve significant cost savings if implemented successfully in hospital blood banks. This work has been submitted to operations researchers. Submitted to our patients research for healthcare, and through this link, you can find the submitted paper. The current BLEST supply chain in Canada is a centralized regional network consisting of two levels, the regional CBS Blast Distribution Center level and the hospital BLAT Bank level. For example, there is one CBS regional distribution center. CBS Regional Distribution Center at Brampton. It supplies the majority of demand for Ontario hospitals. There are in total nine CBS regional distribution centers across Canada. For each regional distribution center, they will prioritize their own demand first. If there is any unit in excess, they will determine centrally where to allocate those units. There are some existing challenges at CBS, which are strongly correlated with the challenges at hospital blood banks. First, CBS has no information on the blood utilization. This means that once black products leave CBS distribution centers, there is no direct communication between CBS and hospital blood banks on black usage. Second, they cannot observe the actual demand. The actual demand since hospital black banks tend to keep high inventory levels. As a consequence, it has been very challenging for CBS to predict future demand and plan donor collection. At hospital black banks, the current inventory management practice relies heavily on human decisions. First, the Blackboard outgoing decisions are made from human experience. There is very little quantitative Very little quantitative evidence to support decision making. And second, they have limited tools for inventory management. The electronic data system they are using are designed for clinical data collection, which is not for inventory management. Another example is that they are still using FAX to send the daily order form to CBS. So there is no electronic data records which store at hospital bloodbank. Which stored at hospital blood bank for historical ordering information. Third, they are facing different multiple demands, heterogeneous demands based on different requirements from multiple physicians and patients. So, as a result, hospital blood banks tend to cope with these limitations and uncertainties through holding excess inventory and making over. Making overfrequent orders. More details can be found on the submitted paper. We have conducted a thorough literature review on the demand forecasting models and the inventory management for black product. We found that most existing literature consider univary demand forecasting for RBC using time series models and in recent years using machine. In recent years, using machine learning models. To our knowledge, Cal D et al is the only one that studied the clinical-related predictors, such as medical diagnosis and hospital locations, to forecast the monthly demand of RBCs and the other two black components. For the research on the blood demand and supply management, publications mainly consider theoretical simulation models. Theoretical simulation models, and we found there is no study considered an integrated strategy from a data-driven demand forecasting model to inventory management strategies for black product, which is what we are proposing in this study. A short data description. The study is constructed by processing a large clinical database called TREST, including lat inventory data. LADE inventory data, laboratory test data, and patient characteristics data for four teaching hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. The study is approved by CBS and the Hamilton Research Asset Boards. The study identified over 360,000 RBC transfusions for over 60,000 patients during the study time period from 2008 to 2018. A daily aggregate dataset is constructed for the demon forecasting model development. Variables are identified based on clinical relevance to RBC transfusions. The variables with over 70% of missing values are excluded from the study. And for the residual variables, if there are missing values, computation methods are considered based on the clinical definition and use of variables. Of variables. All the variables for the model training and testing are normalized using the min-max method. The data from 2008 to 2017 are used for model training and data in 2018 are used for model testing. We process over 200 clinical variables. This table shows a selection of the variables included in this study. The orange has Study. The orange highlight part is the prediction target, which is the number of RBC transfusions. And the yellow highlight part are patient-related variables such as age, gender, ABL group type, and abnormal laboratory tests. The green part are product related variables such as product ABO group, age of blood, and is very rate. And it's very weird. The last three variables showing here are operational related variables such as day of week and RBC transfusion from line street. The structure of our proposed data-driven inventory problem is consistent with the structure of a data-driven use vendor problem in Puber et al. in 2019. This model consists of two levels. This model consists of two levels. The first level includes a demand forecasting model, such as a machine learning model with multiple demand predictors. And then the point estimates and the forecasting error from the demand forecasting model are passed onto an inventory problem to optimize orbiting decisions at the second level. So at the first level, we consider a hybrid demand for customers. Hybrid demand forecasting model combining a seasonal and trend declaration using Lowe's shop for STL model and the machine learning model extreme gradient boosting XG boost model. In this model, it starts with a time series decomposition of the prediction target. Then the STL residuals are forecasted by an X-tribute model using An estribus model using predictor matrix. And then the final hybrid forecast calculated based on the STL forecast plus the residual forecast from the SGBOS model. The reason we propose a hybrid model is because the STL model can better handle the long-term dependency and allow the seasonality to change over time. And the SGBOS model can better Better deal with the non-linear patterns in residuals using multiple predictors. So the combination of the two models can make the model more generalizable and robust. We consider two prediction targets. The first one is the next day's RBC demand, which is the daily demand. And then there is a transformed prediction for semi-weekly demand using the predicted daily demand. Using the predicted daily demand from Tuesday to Thursday and from Friday to Monday. The model is trained on the training data set, and the cross-validation is used for hyperparameter training. And then the model performance is evaluated by MAPE and the IMSC. The variable selection process is in an iterative manner using the training data set. Using the training dataset, and the results are reported on the tested dataset. This figure shows the model performance for the daily demand predictions. The black line shows the actual data and the dash, the blue line shows the model prediction from the training data. And the red line shows the prediction for the tested data set. For the tested data set, For the tested data set, the IMS is around 20% and the MAP is about 17%. This figure presents the variable importance from the daily prediction model. This information is quite useful for the clinical audience, but I'm not going to go into details in this presentation. We compare the We compare the hybrid model to another three models. First, we compare the hybrid model with a single SPL model, and we found that the accuracy of the hybrid model is significantly higher. You can see from this table. And when we replace the X-ray groups model with a linear regression model, the accuracy is decreased. We also compare the hybrid model with a long-short-term model. Model with a long-short-term memory deep learning model, we found there is no significant improvement. Since the hybrid model has a much simpler structure, it is much easier to implement it in the real system. At the second stage, we consider a multi-period inventory problem for hospital breath act. There are some model assumptions: fixed shaft life, first in, first out, withdrawal policy, and For sale withdrawal policy, and then we assume there is an infinite supply SPS. The order of events are as follows. An order is placed at the end of the day. Fresh units arrive in the morning. The inventory of each age is updated. Patient demand is satisfied during the day. If there is a shortage, a same-day urgent delivery will be made. At the end of the day, the remaining inventory is carried. Day the remaining inventory is carried over to the next day. The expired units are discarded at the end of the day. We consider two decision variables to control the accumulative loss due to forecasting errors, which are an inventory target and a reorder level. The inventory target defines an upper limit of the inventory level to avoid excess inventory. level to avoid excess inventory due to demand overestimation. And the reorder level sets a lower limit of the inventory level to avoid urgent deliveries due to the demand underestimation. This model is a modified version of the classical SS policies. This table shows a list of notation included in this study and the equation one defines the cost function in Defines the cost function in this study. It consists of four costs. The first part is the routine delivery cost. The second part is the inventory holding cost. And the third part is the same-day urgent delivery cost. And the last one is the wastage due to expiration cost. Equation two calculates the remaining amount after withdrawing products. After withdrawing products using first-in-first out policy. And equation 3 and 4 calculate the inventory dynamics. And equation 5 determines the number of units requiring same-day urgent delivery. And all the variables are non-active in this study. We propose an integrated ordering strategy where the order quantity is the predicted demand from the hybrid model controlled by an optimal inventory. controlled by an optimal inventory target, capital S star, and an optimal reorder level, small S star. The optimal inventory target and the reorder level are learned through the training data set by minimizing the difference between the average cost under the predicted demands and the actual demands as a full standard. So to generate the integrated RBA strategy, we first set the inventory We first set the initial inventory level at zero to be the mean inventory level according to the first three months of data. We denote I minus 1 to be the inventory level of the nine expired units at the end of period I minus 1. And the average cost can be written in this form. So the average cost for ordering by the actual demand, which Ordering by the actual demand, which considers as the gold standard, can be in this can be written in this form. To generate the oriented strategy, the procedures are as follows. First, we determine the optimal inventory target, capital S star. For a feasible set of S, capital S, we calculate the cost of each period using the mean of the predicted demand. Predicted demand from the hybrid model and the capital S minus the inventory of the period I minus 1 as the decision, ordering decision. And the outer cost can be written in this form for each capital S. Then the optimal inventory target can be determined by minimizing the absolute difference. The absolute difference between these two costs. And the second step, we want to find the optimal order level, small x star. Given we have known the capital S star, now we consider a feasible set of small s. If the reorder level small s is greater than the inventory level of period n minus 1, the order The order quantity of period i is the maximum of these two quantities. Otherwise, the order quantity is zero. The average cost can be written in this form for each small s. Then the optimal order level can be determined by minimizing the absolute cost between these two costs. Finally, we can calculate the The ordering quantity for each period denoted by small debt I star as equation six. This equation six states that if the inventory level of I minus one is smaller than the optimal order level, then the order quantity for period I is according to the predicted demand. Predicted demand of period I that can rise the inventory level to the maximum value of the inventory target, optimal inventory target, and the minimum value of the optimal order level. The procedure to generate the order quality is applicable for both the daily and semi-weekly demand predictions. Demand predictions. This table summarizes the result for four other strategies. The first one is consider the current practice using the actual data. And the second one is the ordering according to the actual demand, which is the base gold standard. And then the third column is the result for the proposed daily strategy. And the last one is. The daily strategy, and the last one is the proposed semi-weekly strategy. From this table, we can see the semi-weekly strategy for the order frequency. There is about 60% of reduction. And for the inventory level, comparing to the current practice as the baseline, there is about 40% reduction. And for the total cost, the semi-weekly strategy has a reduction about Has a reduction about 42%. And during the study period, there is no same-day urgent delivery and wastage observed. And this figure shows the costs over time using the test data set for the four ordinary strategies. The black line shows the current practice and the blue line shows the gold standard according to the true Standard according to the true demand. And then the red line shows the proposed daily outgoing strategy, and the green line shows the proposed semi-weight week strategy. As we can see, there is a huge cost saving, and this is mainly driven by the reduction in the inventory level and order frequency. To summarize, the proposed semi-wake phase strategy can achieve a linear. Can achieve a leaner inventory and fresher blood with low incidence of wastage and urgent deliveries. It can provide a fixed and reduced delivery schedule, which can reduce the human resources and costs. This kind of creates a win-win situation for both the hospital blood banks and CBS. As future work, we plan to explore the Plan to explore the optimality of our proposed ordering strategy in the setting for non-stationary demand. We also plan to apply the proposed strategy to other graph products. Our team has already started the work on the platelet demand forecasting and management. For our future long-term plan, we would like to develop an easy-to-use software application for. Software application for black hospital webbeds to generate the order decision based on the proposed algorithm and monitor the model performance. Here's a list of reference used in this presentation.
