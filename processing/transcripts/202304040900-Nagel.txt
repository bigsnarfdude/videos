Okay, so our first speaker for this morning, Adu Benago, he'll talk about polytechnic duals and metrics digital complexes with standardizer engineers. Thanks to Nina, Sarah, Satoshi, and Adam for organizing this workshop and inviting me to give this talk. It is based on joint work with Aya and Mutza and Hilbert, Motivated Groupsky. Martina and Alexandra Presman. Our project started at an online workshop. The graduate students were not organized to mitigate the effect isolation caused by corona, but two years ago. And so Satina and I gave series or five lectures and then worked with three students on projects. And one group decided to continue working after the end of the workshop. And I'm happy to present. And I am happy to present the outcome of this project. It is part of a growing body of work to study symmetric ideals or symmetric symbol complexes asymptotically. So let's start with some background. We want to look at seven invariant chains of ideas. Normally, it's just an ascending sequence, compatible, symmetric, square free monomial. Metric square-free monomial ideals. So let me say right away in this code, all ideals will be square-free monomer ideals, even though some of the results are true in greater generality. Now, by this is a sub xn, we just mean polynomial n variables over some field k, we fix the field. And then the symmetric group and letters acts on the variables. X on the variables a promotation maps xj onto the variable with the index i of j We say an ideal is symmetric if it's invariant on the action of the symmetric group so any element of the symmetric group maps a polynomial in the ideal onto another polynomial in the ideal now the last adjective is compatible and that just means you take an ideal You take an ideal in your chain, apply a larger symmetry group to it, you get monomials in a later ideal in the chain with the same index. All right, now you fix one square-free symmetric square-free monomer idea and say the least degree of the generator is k. Well, by symmetry, that means the problem. symmetry that means the product of the variables x1 up to xk has to be in the idea and now it follows in fact that the ideal is just generated by the orbit of this one monom so as a consequence if you have any such singling variant chain if n is large the n's ideal is simply generated by the orbit of this one monom If these were all the ideas we are interested in, it would be a little bit boring. So let's make things more interesting. And what we want to do is we want to consider these variables as just one row of variables in a polynomial ring, and we want to add more rows of variables. No, that was too much. No, that was too much. So more precisely, we want to fix a positive integer C, and now Rn is a polynomial ring. You have C rows of variables and n columns of variables. So in total, Rn has C times N variables. And now the symmetric group and the letters adds still other variables. Any permutation doesn't touch the row index, but it The raw index, but it acts on the current index as before. And now we can talk about sim and derived chains, and these are the same things as before. I n list in this parameter ring with C rows and columns of variables. It's symmetric, square free, and compatible. Any ideal of some index is compatible with the ideals of larger indexes. In particular, it's a sub-ideal. In particular, it's a sub-ide. Let's go to look at some examples and let's make our lives easy. So to choose two rows of variables and to save indices, let me use x's for the first row and y's for the second row. And then let's say i is the idea, just generated by x1 times y1, x2 times y2, up to xn, yn. And of course, that is just. And of course that is just the orbit of this one under x1 under the action of the symmetric ring of magnetics. And now it's not so difficult to see that the corrosion ring has always co-dimension n and these ideas have degree 2 to the n. Let's change the generating setup a little bit. Now we take products of parameters. Now we take products of variables x, i, y, j, but we make i and j different. But still, an ideal summer generated by just one orbit, and this time it's the orbit of x1, y, 2. Computing the dimension of the code gring is difficult. We get n. The second idea in this chain has just two generators. This has to be four, but if n is at least That if n is at least 3, all these ideas have degree true. Just degree true. So what we see, so these invariants with our listed become predictable if n grows. And I will refer to this fact as stabilization. In fact, it turns out that this stabilization always happens and And one instance of stabilizations is that the generators of these ideals i n look alike virtually. This is a result that has been discovered independently twice. The first by Cohen, full generality, then Aspenbrenner and Hiller did it for one row of verifies, and then again in full generality, Hiller and Saleret. And the result. And solve that. And the result simply says every similar chain stabilizes in the sense that there's a finitely set of square-free polynomials such that the n's idea in the chain is just generated by the sym n orbits of these monomials, if n is sufficiently large. And the point is, the same set of monomials generates these ID just the orbit generators for any As a consequence, it means that there must be integers n0 and t such that at n is at least n zero, the maximum degree of a generator in the n's ideal is exactly d will stay constant. So this stabilization of the generator set has also consequences on other invariants. So quite in general, we showed that remote that, for example, the cross-dimensions grow eventually linearly, and the degrees of these ideas will grow exponentially eventually. So they become predictable. Predictable as n grows. Any questions so far? Yeah? Do you have more precise information on the fitting of nerves? Well, they go polynomial. Each interval. Well, if you fix a homological degree and look at the single spot, there's not a problem for the number. But that requires a little bit more than what we discussed pretty in this. And what we discussed pretty if this is true. All right, then let's change gears a little bit and let's look at Alexander duals. So there is a rich literature studying a square-free monomial ideal, so there is a complex by means of this Alexander dual. So we want to do it. What can we say about the Alexander dual of such chains? But first, Let's record a definition. One way to define it. If I is a square for each one ideal, with these generators at one up to S, the Alexander dual is the section of S prime ideals, where the J prime ideal is generated just by the variables that divide the minimum generator after. Many generator after, and that's true, but if you take the dual of the Alexander dual, you get the original idea. Now, as I said, we want to study the Alexander duals of the ideas occurring in a similar direction. Probably good to look at examples and we take the same examples as before. So, who rows are variables? I n. Variables i n is generated by the sim n orbit of x1 variable. Very simple text. Because this is the Alexander. And then it's not so difficult to show, but the Alexander tool is generated by products of n variables where the i's variable is either x, i, or y. And that's a semantic ideal, so it must be. Ideal, so it must be generated by some n orbits. And in fact, in this case, the monomials in an orbit are determined by the fact how many x variables divide. We have degree n, so this gives us n orbits of minimal generators. Well, notice that means the number of orbits needed to generate these ideas. Generated priest ideas is not bound. This does not happen for the chain ideas and the ritual chain that we have seen by stabilization. So let's look at another example. Yeah, Jn. So this was the idea generated by the orbit of x1, y2. This time we have just three types of generals. Have just three types of generators in the example here. Products of all the x's, products of all the y's, and the products of all the variables divided by xij. So you have just three orbits independent of n. However, the maximum degree of a minimum generator is 2n minus 2. That's not bounded. Again, that's something that does not happen in the original cylinder in check. So, what means So, what these examples illustrate, the sequence of Alexander Durham has not the same property as the original similarity. Some new features appear. Still, the generators of the example somehow look alike and seem to become predictable. In fact, that turns out to be true all the time. So, to make this a little bit more precise, let's recall. Little bit more precise, let's recall our setup. So we have fixed the number of rows of variables C, we take a cyclic variant chain, I and this indices. We employ an array of C rows and columns of variables. Then our first result is quantitative information about the number of generators needed for the Alexander tools. The Alexander foods. More specifically, we talk about the number of siline orbits. We need to generate, Linux generates the Alexander group, and this number eventually becomes polynomial in n. You can bound the degree of this polynomial, and it's just determined by, the upper bound is determined by the number of works. A similar result is true if we look just of the minimum degree of the generators. So it was known that the least degree of the minimal generator of the Alexander rule is given by a linear function B of n in n. As n is growth, large enough, and then again the number of orbits of minimal generators of this minimum degree minimum degree grows eventually polynomially in M. Now since we have seen that the exemplar can be defined by means of a primary decomposition, the first part has as an immediate consequence immediate consequence for the original chain, namely the number of silic orbits of primary components must grow at a point. Must grow eventually, must grow polynomially in an eventually. The key to these results is an explicit description of the minimal generators that produce these Alexander duples given the finitely many orbital generators of the original chain. And we have seen by stabilization this assumption is always satisfied. Always set aside. Now, this description of the minimal generating set is somewhat technical and it has to be. So let me illustrate this by one more example, a slightly more complicated example. Let's take. So now let's take three rows of variants to x is y. Of variables. So x's wise z's, and that's it's still taking ideal, but it's just going to have one orbit, but now we take a degree six. And then it turns out, if n is at least four, the alexander divides are generated by the following list but more numbers. And now this is a busy slide, but just wanted to display a little bit what what's going on. There are four types of generators. Of generators. The first is just products of variables where we have a plus b x variables, n minus 2 minus b y variables, and n minus 2 minus a z variables, where a and b are non-negative, and the sum is at most n minus 2. And if you can't, this gives n choose 2 order generators. The second look orbits look much easier. We have just products by n minus 1, x, y, or z variables. That gives three orbits. Then we have three types of generators of degree n minus one, depending on some integer a, which varies between one and n minus three. And so that gives And so that gives 3 times n minus 3 orbit generators. And lastly, we have generators of degree n, again depending on some integer a, but varies between 2 and n minus 2. So this gives another 3 times n minus 3 orbit generators. So in total we get a quadratic polynomial number of orbit generators. Orbit general. And I hope this illustrates why I won't describe the generators of the Alexander in full generality. It is possible, but it takes some time. And so instead of describing these generators, I want to discuss a little bit the main idea, the main method. With the main idea, the main methods that produce these results. So, and the details are technically pretty demanding, but it can be grouped roughly in three main steps. The first step is simply characterize membership of the monomial in. Membership of a monomial in the Alexander tool. And what we show is that this membership is decided by a set of inequalities on the exponents of the variables of this such a monomial. And again, independence of the orbit generators of the GTJ. The crucial point is that the number of these inequalities is independent of n. These inequalities are determined by the order ideas of the letters of subsets of the interval C, so the numbers 1, 2, up to C, or by inclusion. The number of these letters ideals is just determined by C. And this step requires a human combinatorial result which reducts avoidance up to... We got voidance up to symmetry. And I hope to say a little bit about this later. But the point is, the first step gives us a generating set. This generating set will typically be far from minimal, so we have to prune it. Well, and that involves something that we that the visibility of monomers are. The visibility of monomulates up to symmetry. So in the classical case, it's very easy. If I hand you two monomers and ask, is the first monomial divisible by the second monomial? It's a piece of cake. I can do this. In our context, the question becomes, again, you have two monomers, first monomial and the second monomial, but now you ask, given the first monomial, then is a monomial in the orbit of the second monomial. In the orbit of the second monomule that divides the first one. And again, to decide this avoidance of the symmetry plays a crucial role. Once we have a minimal generating set, it's time to count. And for this, we use a bit of discrete geometry. We encode the orbit generators of the alexander rule as integers. Of the Alexander dual as integer points in a certain polyhedron, and then show that this polyhedron can be decomposed as a disjoint union of rational cones to which Alexander to which Erhard theory applies. And so Erhardt theory gives us in fact the desired polynomiality. All right, so that is the rough outline of Of our proof of the generating setup and also for the country. So I want to discuss a little bit this voids up to symmetry. So let me do this now. And this discussion won't assume anything. We will start from first principles. So. So yeah, so let's consider two and zero one matrices A and D C rows and columns Now we want to interpret zeros as empty slots in the C times M And the question is the first question we asked when does B fit into the empty space of A? And just to illustrate this I put down a simple example. We have three matrices and Example, we have three matrices and of course B1 fits into A as the overall illustrates. What about B2? Well, B2 doesn't fit, right? We have two problematic slots. And in fact, of course, I mean, this is a pretty simple question, right? How do you decide if E fits in? Decide if B fits into A, you just have to compare the columns of A and B with the same index. We have n columns, this gives us n conditions, and we have the answer. Well, in the spirit of this talk, we want to permute the colours. So what does so? So we want to allow permutations of the columns of B and then. And then the growth question becomes, well, then is there an element in the orbit of this matrix B that fits into A? We had seen previously B2 doesn't fit into A, but if you switch the summer in the third column, you get a new matrix that fits nicely. All right. Everyone on board with this problem? Well, now we may change it again. Now we want to modify the number of columns. So we turn our given matrix A and M columns. We turn it into a matrix with N columns just by adding zero columns. And then you can now have a matrix with N columns. You have a matrix with n columns. You choose another matrix. You ask for another matrix B. Then does it fit into B up to symmetry? And then we want to know how does the answer change or be as X increases. And that's the type of question you're interested in. And this avoidance of the symmetry answers this question. Symmetry answers this question, and in fact, a slightly more abstract question of this type, and that has helped us a great deal with those results, as I hope to have been. So I hope that illustrate questions about similar variant change chains can pose interest. Can pose interesting challenges. That we have some new tools to investigate. And in fact, I believe there's a lot more to be discovered, and certainly more tools will be needed. So thank you for your attention.
