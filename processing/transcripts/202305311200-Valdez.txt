Thank you, Marcara. Okay, thanks for inviting me, and thank you very much for being here today. Yeah, model theory. This morning, Claudio reminded me that I send an abstract having a quote from the Wikipedia. I don't remember sending that abstract. Maybe it was like. Maybe I was just like, maybe I was wrong, maybe both. I don't remember. But the thing, the story goes as follows: last time I gave this talk, at the end of the talk, one of my colleagues comes and tells me, well, what is this model theory you're talking about? What is it? So I tried to give an honest explanation of this, and it didn't seem to convince him. So I went to the people that I know that know model theory and ask, well, if people ask me what this is, what should I say? And so they said, And so they sent me to this book by Dirk van Dalen called Logic and Structure. And now I understand why they do that. And so you open that book, and in the first part of that book, quote, the book says, logic appears in a sacred and in a profane form. Sacred form is dominant in proof theory. The profane form is in model theory. So So, what I'm getting from this is that there is some sort of profanity in model theory. And then I went not convinced with this to our common text, which is the Wikipedia. And in the Wikipedia, I found something really interesting. It's not in the abstract. It's called, they say, model theory is often less concerned with formal rigor and closer in spirit to classical mathematics. So if you add these two together, So, if you add these two together, you get that there is some sort of profanity in the spirit of classical mathematics. So, this being said, I'm not going to answer what a model theory, what model theory is. I'm in my quest to understand this, but I want to convince you that there are some tools in what is called model theory that might be really helpful to understand big groups. Okay, so following Claudio, I would like to start just with the theorem. Just with the theorem. So here's the theorem. We start with S is going to be, so this is about a big group. So this is going to be an infinite type surface. I'm going to explain everything later on. And so the result is the following. You consider the mapping class group of this surface, and there are two statements to be made. And there are two statements to be made. The first one is that all conjugacy classes of the mapping class group of the surface are meager. If you don't remember what Meager is, you can look in the Wikipedia, but if not, it's just, it is a sense of saying that conjugacy classes are really small from the point of view of the. Are really small from the point of view of topology. So, but you can be small like the rationals inside the real line and still be dense. So, the question is imposed whether you're dense or not. So, the second statement is that map of S has a dense conjugacy class if and only if truth. If and only if two technical statements are satisfied that I will explain later on. The first one is that S contains no non-displaceable subsurfaces. And the second one is that there exists a unique maximal end. And of S. Okay, so this is the result. I'm going to explain the content. I'm going to explain how do you end proving such things or what do you care about proving such things and how model theory enters a picture. So before I continue, this is joint work on one side with Jesus Hernandez Hernandez and Michael Krusak, Israel Morales, which is in the audience. Israel Morales, which is in the audience, Anja Randeker, and Manuel Sedano. And simultaneously, this result was also proven by Justin Lanier and Nicolas Vlamis. And so I will refer later on. The reference for, let me see, do I have the reference? Yeah, so the reference for this is here. So this is us and Vlamier and Lanier and Vlamis the reference is this one so I think this is nice because the archive set who put it first so this is Lanier Lanier Blamis and I will refer to this work later on later on Later on. Okay, so let me explain quickly: infinite type means that the fundamental group is not finitely generated. I think the mapping class group, you will consider that I won't define what the mapping class group is, but it's just a topological mapping class group. Now, what's the topology? The topology is the compact open topology, and I will come back to that later. Now, I have to explain this to Explain these two conditions. The first one is being non-displaceable. So let me define that. So let me take S prime as subsurface of S. And I'm going to say that this is not displaceable if every time that I take, let's say, a homeomorphism of S, I have. Of S, I have that and I hit the surface with it, then I cannot separate the surface from itself. So what did I wrote? Nondisplaceimal? Yeah, okay. I'm sorry, I forgot to add one adjective here. S is an infinite type surface oriental. We only deal with the oriental. We only deal with the orientable case. There is a whole theory of non-orientable infinite type surfaces, and the non-orientable case is being handled right now by Perez Estrada, which is also in the audience. Okay, so second thing that I have to explain is what a maximal end is. And I'm really grateful by the definition you gave in the last talk because defining the order in the space of ends of a surface now, it's not going to be too complicated. Now it's not going to be too complicated. So, in the theory of infinite-type surfaces, well, they're classified by their genus and space of ends, and you can measure, compare, sorry, ends by their topological complexity. So let's say I take x and y, two elements in the end space of a surface that I'm denoting by ES. So these are the ends of S. Of S. I'm simplifying things here a little bit, but let's say that X is less or equal to Y if every time that I take a neighborhood, say, V of Y, I can find a neighborhood U of X and a map F, a homeomorphism. So this is going to be in home of S. In home of S, such that the homeomorphism F sends the neighborhood of X into the neighborhood of Y. Okay. Take a moment to parse that. Is this using our local, but using your home multiple local service? I don't think so. I think you need to ask for the homeomorphism. For a homeomorphism in the For a homeomorphism in the in the in the in all this of the surface okay so one remark is that or one comment is that i'm not asking f to send x to y on the nose so um this is uh this is my answer partially your question i'm i'm just asking to send um the neighborhood of x into the neighborhood of y by the way i didn't define this this one was defined um by uh catherine mann and castra raffi and um if you want And if you want an example of to work in your head for the moment, just take, say, the sphere minus a convergent sequence. And so if you want a picture, it looks like this. You have infinity, you have a convergent sequence. And so the maximal end in this case is going to be infinity. Okay. So this is not really a this doesn't make the space of n supposed. This doesn't make the space events a poset, but you have to do what was previously done: that is to define an equivalence relationship. And then the equivalence relationship is what was defined before. So this happens if and only if x less than y and y is less than x. And so you can define then an order if x is less than or equal than y, but you have that. You have that X is not equivalent to Y. And so this n-space modulo dar relation with this order becomes a poset, and then you have a sense of maximality. So this is an example of a surface with a maximal end. And you can think of examples of, I mean, it's easy to produce examples of surfaces that don't have this property. Don't have this property. Just take two convergent sequences. So there you will have something that has two maximal ends. And then if you're into set theory, I let you think about ordinals or any closed subset of the counter set. Okay, so I think I have defined everything in the theorem. So now let me give you some motivation on why do you want to prove something like this? On why do you want to prove something like this? So, motivation. Motivation. So, the motivation came, I think, from a workshop that happened in 2019 in Amy, San Jose, California, where some of us were here present together. And so, several questions about big mapping class groups were asked. I forgot to say something regarding big mapping class groups. Regarding big mapping class groups, and is that so this is a general fact, and is that map of S is a Polish space. Polish in the sense that it contains a countable dense set and it's homeomorphic to a complete metric space. So, in this setting, there is the so-called automatic continuity property. So, let me recall you what this is. So let G be polished. So we say that G has the automatic continuity property if every algebraic morphism from G to some separable topological group, separable meaning that you. Separable, meaning that you have a dense set in the edge is continuous. So I was feeling a little bit bad because I said, well, I'm not talking about algebraic topology or geometric group theory in this conference. But in this sense, maybe we can discuss this over lunch. This is some sort of algebraic or topological property. Property. So, yeah, you can find me later on. If this is algebraic topology or not. And the mapping class group, well, you can do also geometric group theory with it, but I'm not going to talk about large-scale geometry or Rossendah's theory on big mapping class groups. Okay, now why do you, how do you connect this to, I'm going to explain how do you connect this with Going to explain how you connect this with dense with conjugacy classes and what are applications of this property. So, two things that I recommend if this is the first time you encounter this property, the reference that I would like to give here, there are two references that I would like to give. The first one is a paper by Chris Rosendahl, which is called ACP for ACP for group homomorphisms. He starts in a really nice way trying to track this property back to Cauchy, actually. And then he makes a large discussion about examples and contra examples of groups that have this property. Maybe I should discuss this. So the second reference is giving you an example of this. So this is. Giving you an example of this. So, this is a theorem by Catherine Mann. So, I'm giving examples and then giving you applications of this. So, Catherine Mann proves a statement of the following. Let M be a manifold, a compact manifold. Maybe the compact manifold has a boundary. And so, then what can be shown is that the group of homeomorphisms of the Homeomorphisms of the manifold that are isotopic to the identity has the automatic continuity property. In general, proving that a given an example of a group that has the automatic continuity property is usually a theorem. It's not easy to establish. It's relatively easy to disprove. There are counting arguments, transfinite counting arguments to kill that. But let me leave you an exercise. Me leave you an exercise if you're bored on how to produce an example of a group that doesn't have the automatic continuity property. So, what I want you to... So this is a contra example. So the contraxample is to think of the real numbers with addition, but as a Q A rational vector space. And so the hint to show that this is a group that doesn't have the automatic continuity property is just to consider now the plane with the same operation as a Q vector space. Okay, so example, contra example. Now, what kind of applications can you get for? Now, what kind of applications can you get from this sort of result? Let me give you one. Let me see. I have several here. Yeah, so this was a question by Epstein and Markovic. And the question of these two people was: if so, the question is. uh so the question is uh does every does every every algebraic extension morphism from homel zero of the circle to homel of the disc The disk has a continuous is continuous. And so the circle being a compact manifold, then you apply man and you get that the answer is yes. So this is also a big group. So this is an application for big groups. And you may wonder: well, what there are applications for big mapping class groups? I will give you nothing. Nothing because I want you to read also Lanier Blamis. So if you want to look for applications, please go read to Lanier Blamis. They give applications for this. I think they are valid, these applications. I won't say more. Please also go read Lanier Vlad. So now, what else do I want to say? Automatic continuity? Okay, so I have to make. Continuity. Okay, so I have to make a link between automatic continuity property and conjugacy classes. Let me do that. And so there are several ways to prove automatic continuity. And one is through a property that is called ample generics. So let me tell you what that is. And then you see that this result is sort of bad news in some sense. So we wanted to show at some point. We wanted to show at some point that the or somehow understand when the mapping class group of an infinite type surface has or doesn't have the automatic continuity property. And so we looked at the following result. So this is a theorem by Chris Rosendahl. So I'm going to explain the content of the theorem in a moment. It's not that complicated. So let's say let G be a Polish group. Be a polish group such that for every n, if you consider the action of the group on n times the group, the Cartesian product, n times. So this is the diagonal action, coordinate by coordinate, diagonal action. Action if you consider this action and this action has a co-meger orbit, then your group has, then G has the automatic continuity property. So let me say this again. You're looking at your group, you look at its action by conjugation on itself, and you Itself and you can think of this action in any dimension. So having a commeager orbit means that you have some sort of a generic element. Co-migr means that the complement is meager. Thank you. And so, well, what you have to do is, in order to show that a group has an automatic continuity property, is to verify this. But then the first thing that I wrote says that this failed. Wrote says that this fails miserably in dimension one. So the automatic continuity property, if it has to be established for big mapping class groups, is not through this property that is called having ample generics. Okay, there are some other methods and yeah, I don't want to say more in that direction. Now, where am I? Are there any questions? So far, do they have obstructions today? they have obstructions to get this or if this is illoophole if they have any automatic communicative programming i think there is uh a group working on on on this direction and i think there are uh positive and negative results but i'm according to this report but yes but i'm not sure if i should comment um on this only people are working on this yes not me um okay but Okay, but that's another story. That's a good question. My guess is that, yeah, you should have both phenomena. And yeah. Let me give you an argument. How do you disprove automatic continuity? A counting argument. So since the property is stated between Polish groups and separable groups, so a continuous morphism between two such spaces is completely determined by how. Spaces is completely determined by how it acts on the basis. Basis should be countable. So, how many can you have if you think of bases as permuting open sets? So, you should have at most continuous morphisms as you can permute open sets. So, this is two to the cardinality of your basis. So, if you can show that there are more algebraic morphisms, then one of those shouldn't be continuous. Okay? Okay. Well, okay, great. Okay, okay, super. Now, let me tell you a little bit about how you prove such a statement. And so there was a crash course on train tracks, so I'm going to give you a crash course on Fresh View. Okay. Okay, so let me erase this one. So let me let me erase this one. And by the way, no, well, no, let me so please the second condition has to do also with this question or like which condition, sorry? Number two. Because you mentioned the first one is when I imply that you cannot use this technique to show mathematical technique, because the second one is related to this question or maybe? This question or maybe? I haven't thought about it. I mean, there's another way to prove automatic continuity, which is via the so-called Steinhaus property. But I don't know if the answer is I don't know. So I haven't thought about, but I think not. No, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, towards yeah. So, what's what's uh softness monster has just one end, yes, automatic continued, okay. Yes, and this is, I think, work of George Omato, right? Yeah, and the thing is that with the Lognes monster, you have a coincidence between. Lugnus monster, you have a coincidence between this group and the pure mapping class group. And so, George Stomata was able to show that the pure mapping class group contains a big product of copies of Q. And so, the counting argument that I gave you works in that case. Thank you. Okay, so crash course on free set theory. So, the first ingredient that you need for using this theory is, so it's going to be a little bit abstract, but keep in mind what I'm trying to sell is that this technology might work for your favorite big group. So, if you're thinking of big groups like, for example, the homeomorphism group of a zero-dimensional space. Of a zero-dimensional space, or you're thinking about the mapping class group of some really complicated graph. This theory can give you this sort of results or maybe allow you to show automatic continuity. So, the first thing that you need is a structure. So, yes. I'm completely ignorant about model theory. What part of this is the model theory? Where where is it starting from? The profane part. The profane part, the profane part it's about to come, so yeah, so there's going to be some profanity. I hope there are non-model theorists in the audience. If not, I um you can or what oh yeah, well, you can there's a line of people. Well, you can. There's a line of people that don't like me, so confirming the line. So, the first thing that you need is a relational structure. So, K will be the node structure. I'm about to tell you what a structure is. And for the applications of this theorem, I'm only considering relational structures. So, what is a relational structure? The first thing that you need is a set. That you need is a set. So there are ingredients for this. You need a set K, which usually in this part of the theory is denoted like this, and it's called the universe. This is just a set. The second thing that you need is what is called a signature. So, signature is what stands for abstract relations. I'm going to give you examples. Relations. I'm going to give you examples of this. These are abstract relations. And the way you denote it, these are just symbols. One way to denote it is something like this, where I'm thinking that this is a set and this is a natural number. And the third thing that you need is an interpretation. An interpretation. So, interpretation. So, what is an interpretation? It's a function that associates to each of these symbols r lambda and lambda a subset that is usually denoted by r lambda k, which will be just a subset of the partition product of your universe, sorry, k to the n lambda. K to the n lambda. So let me give you an example to bring this down to earth, what you should have in mind. One example of this is the curve graph, any graph. So the curve graph is an example. Think of, so example, an example of this is the curve graph. So what's the universe for the curve graph? These are isotopic classes of simple closed curves. I think for me, the most difficult. I think for me, the most difficult part to understand was what is the signature. So, when we define the curve graph, we just say adjacency is defined by these joints. So, this is an abstract statement that becomes concrete once you have a surface in your hand. So, the fact of having a surface in your hand and thinking now of the concrete graph that you get is the interpretation of your abstract relation. Okay? So, So, but this is not the only example. There are some other kinds of structures. Not every structure is relational. You can have, for example, structures that are like groups are examples of structures. And for those, you don't require them to have relations only. My relations could be empty. There is also what is called an arity function that allows you to interpret functions. So groups fit here. And one example that I And one example that I really like in this setting, if there are people that are interested in this, are the Boolean algebra of Kloppen sets of the group of homeomorphisms of, say, your favorite countable ordinal. This is an example of Boolean algebras are an example of structures. Okay, so far so good for structures. Now I have to tell you how to fit this. Tell you how to fit this thing into some sort of a group, big group setting. So, when you have a structure or when you have several structures, there is a notion of automorphism. So, think of the curve graph. What is an automorphism of a graph? It's a bijection of your universe that respects the signature in the sense that it sends adjacent things to adjacent things. Adjacent things to adjacent things and non-adjacent things to non-adjacent things. So you can think of the automorphism group of the structure you're thinking. And there, if you want to prove these kind of theorems, you need some useful results that tell you how to relate the automorphism group of the structure you're considering with the group you care for. With the group you care for. I forgot to say, in everything that I'm saying, I'm thinking of structures as being countable structures. So the universe is going to be countable for the moment. I mean, you can think of things that are non-countable, like the reals or whatever. So useful results, some useful results, useful results that we have because of classical theory are, for example, Are, for example, that if you consider the automorphism group of the structure given by the curve graph, this is isomorphic as a graph, but also as a topological space to the extended mapping class group. So here, this is as a graph, but also as a topological space. If you consider here the compact open topology, and you consider here the permutation. Consider here the permutation topology. So, here the topology is the permutation topology. Should I define what this permutation topology is? No? Okay. Okay, good. But what do you mean by as a graph? So that, no, sorry, not as a graph, as a group. I'm sorry, I'm dyslexic. Group is. Group is as a group, they're isomorphic, but they shouldn't be. I mean, yeah, yeah. So this result allows you to put this whole language, to use all this language to show something about the mapping class group, in the way that I'm about to explain you. So now I go back to Rosendal. Back to Rosendal and tell you what are the results of Rossendel that we're using. So if you're interested in Boolean algebras, you also have that the automorphism group of a Boolean algebra is going to be home. You will have the same sort of result if you put here the clopen sets of. Of uh, yeah, sorry, my dyslexia again. Kloppen sets of this uh space form a Boolean algebra, and the automorphism, the group I'm interested in, is the homeomorphism group of that. Okay, so let me tell you the following theorem. Um, there's a part that is going to be transparent, and another one that I have to explain a little bit. So, this is a really So, this is a really, really powerful result. I should put the names of Truss, Geris, and Rossendal. This is a monumental work, but so I'm going to use just one part. So, let K be a structure that satisfies technical conditions. Satisfies a technical condition. The condition is to be per se limit. Then you can say the following. Then the first thing is that the automorphism group of that structure has a dense conjugacy class if and only if. If and only if some technical condition happens that I'm going to say, and the second part, but you see the analogy between this and the result there, and the other one is that the automorphism group of your structure has a Commiger conjugacy class if and only if some other technical conditions happen. So, before going deeper into the technical conditions, Into the technical conditions, let me tell you that modified versions of the curve complex fit here. So the curve complex is not a Fresse limit, if you know what Fressel limits are. There's a natural obstruction for being a Fresse limit, but you can change the signature of the curve complex to make it. Of the curve complex to make it into a Frocelle limit. And so you can apply this kind of theorem. I'm not going to explain what a Froce limit is because I think this is enough level of complexity. We can discuss that later. Now, what is the condition? What is the magic condition? The magic condition is, well, there is this other class called Fp that I'm about to define. And the theorem requires FP to have what is called the joint. Is called the joint embedding property. I'm going to explain this in the context of the curve complex. This is abbreviated by JEP. And here, the other condition is, well, again, FP has the joint embedding property and another property, which is called local. Called local weak amalgamation property. I don't know if this is what they mean by profanity, but this is enough words. Okay, so look, this is not that difficult. I'm going to try to convey you an intuition of what these words mean and give you an idea how one might apply this theory. Might apply this theory for your favorite big group. So let's discuss first what the joint embedding property is and what the a little bit about what the weak amalgamation property is. And then at the end I will discuss what FP is and how you show that. Okay, here we go. So let me consider when you have something like the curve complex, you can consider within the curve complex finite simplices. So in this language, I'm going to consider, say, A and B substructures, finite substructures. Think of them as being collections of curves. As being collections of curves, these joint collections of curves in your curve complex. And then I have to define what it means to A be embedded into B. I mean, if you're thinking of graphs, this is natural. You will say that A embeds to B if there is a subgraph of B, subgraph of B that is isomorphic to A. It's the same thing for in this setting. In this setting, you will say that A embeds to B if there is a finite substructure, if there is a substructure of B which is isomorphic to A. So there is a notion of embedding things, one into the other. And this I need to talk about the joint embedding property. So the joint embedding property is defined as follows. What does this mean? This means that every time that you take two finite subsets, Finite substructures of your big structure, there exists another finite substructure, C, such that you can embed A into C and B into C. Okay, joint embedding. Now, if I want to talk about, yes. If I want to talk about yesterday, no, yeah, you're right. Yeah, I copy. Yeah, you see how much I master the. You see how much I master these things. Um, yeah, yeah, because if I, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right. Thank you for the remark. I use these things somehow as a blog box, and I'm trying to understand. Um, yeah. Yeah, for the other one around. So they do they want to use this copy to this proof like reasons for communal classes. The existence of Commiger class? Yes, you want to show that the map in the mapping class group, you don't have this property, so you won't have Commigration No, maybe, sorry, give me a second. Maybe I copied this wrong. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Let me state this properly before I put more. So the automorphism group. The automorphism group, let me think. You want to show that every conjugacy class is meager, then what you have to what you want to show has commeager Jugaclass. If you have If you have this property, correct? So, how we apply this machinery to show the theorem is that you will show that this property is not satisfied. Then, this implies that there are no commiger. No, yeah, yeah, no, you were right. You have a media thing, basically. I'm being recorded, dude. I mean, and then you wrote it again. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so I'm making probably a big mistake. Let me do the following: let me check what is written in the theory and then put the correct statement for the sake of precision. Okay? Yeah, there is some sort of uh yeah. Yeah. Not only this, Lexia, but there is this sort of black force near where you are in the, I mean, in front of an audience. And yeah, so, but give me a second and I make precise statements. That's the least I can do for you. Well, here's the moment where my co-author saves me. Okay, found it okay. No, yeah. No, yeah, I was right, I think. Yes. So this thing has, yeah, non-meager, non-meager. So this is the correct statement. Sorry, this is the correct statement. You want to show that every conjugacy class is meager. So you want something that tells you that you have something that is non-meager. If and only if. Non-meager. If and only if there is some property that characterizes this, and this property is that this class has what is called local web. Now, the way that I prove the theorem is by understanding what this local WAP property is and showing that it doesn't matter what big mapping class rule you give me, this is not satisfied, and hence you don't have non-migr conjugacy classes. Meger and Geographic glasses. Yes. So about the substructures, I mean, A and B are finite substructures of the structure K. What does that mean? Does that just mean that A and B are finite subsets of the universe and you take the induced significant yes? So if I take the union of A and B, wouldn't that be a substructure that would automatically fill? Structure that would automatically fill JDP for everything? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where are you wrong? Is that it's not true that every time that is no subset of K is the requirement for being a substrate? You have relation, you have a You have relations, you have a signature and you have relations. Yes, it's not, it's not true that every subset of a graph, I would say yes. Yes, yes, you're right, you're right, you're right. If you only have relational structures. If you only have relational structures, yeah, you're right. If you only have relational structures, you only have the joint embedding property. But no, this is this is something there should be something wrong because if that's true, then this will always be true. And then you will always have a dense conjugacy class. Correlational structures. And yeah. So this wouldn't be a theorem. Yeah. No, but you're going to have, for example, two subgraphs, one automorphism between two subgraphs, you're going to promote two even to that large neuron. So you can't jointly embed these subgraphs inside another graph. Okay, okay. Yeah. What is written there? A and B are substructures of K. There exists a C also in K. The C also encoded. I think that is for relational structure. If that was the definition of substructure, then I don't see any obstruction to JEP. Let me see. No, the joint embedding properties then. Yes.
