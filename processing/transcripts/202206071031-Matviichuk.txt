So I'll I'll be talking about log symptom manifolds. So this is a type of object that we already seen in the previous talk. So I'll be denoted them by triple. So there is a manifold X, which is smooth for me always, a complex manifold. Then there is a Then there is some divisor, meaning it's the hypersurface inside this X that is allowed to have similarities, but like it's not allowed to be fat device, like it's reduced device. And then there is a two-form which is closed, a log symplectic form. So the form has a simple poles along D. And since the form is closed, that's enough. Is closed, that's enough to say that it's an logarithmic form. So, in general, logarithmic form means that it has simple poles along D, and its derivative has simple poles on D, but its derivative is zeros. And I just only require that it has simple poles along D. And there is one extra condition, simple condition that when you take total H power of omega, it's non-zero everywhere away from D and it has simple poles along D as well. Just as our philosophy. Just as it was okay so um so let me start so in principle I'll want to consider D with more general more complicated similarities than normal crossings but I'll start for the beginning of the talk I will assume that D has normal crossings for now. Only normal crossings singularities. So it could be smooth, but whenever it has similarities, it always locally looks like intersection of bunch accordion hyperplanes in C. Okay, so pick any point inside B and you can define a local Find local invariants of this well-symptomic structure. So let me enumerate the components of G near this point, except that, okay, yeah. Um so let G one through G uh be irreducible local, irreducible components. Irred usable components of G. So by assumption they're all smooth and they intercept this firstly at B. So you can define a number B ij. So for every pair of indices. Ij. So for every pair of indices ij for every pair of indices i and j that are indexing these components, you can define this nice topological invariant by residue. You can integrate the form omega along some two-dimensional torus which loads. Which locally looks as follows. You have two smooth components coming together. You can draw a two-dimensional torch by taking one circle, where in complex worlds we can take a circle along the divisor here and another circle here, which is orientation consistently, and you obtain two torus by taking the product of these two circles, and you integrate the four. And you integrate the form, and you obtain some number which is called by resume. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. I guess by convention, they add two by i haven't squared i being square root of minus one. Not this i. Okay. Not this I okay. Uh anyway, so it's uh it's just complex number that is manifestly well defined uh up to like after change of coordinates you get the same number. It doesn't depend on the coordinates at all. So it's a local invariant of a log symplectic manifold. So it's clear that if you if you have two isomorphic log symplectic manifolds, they'll have the same collection of these numbers. Sorry, what is Sorry, what is P here? What is what? What is P? P a P is just any point inside the divisor and I choose irreducible components of divisor locally. The origin in the diagram. Oh yeah, P is here. P is this perfect. Okay, so. Okay, so they are they are well defined up to loc local analytic isomorphism, but in fact we can prove more. So this result, I mean I'll attribute it to Brent because I know that he's written it in one of his papers, but it was probably known to before him, so some of it is was probably known. Some of it was probably known, but because it's like very, very, very basic result. So it said the following. So if you have two log symplectic forms with the same divisor, and I'm still assuming that G is a sort of simple normal crossing, or just normal crossing. Then, if these two forms have the same by residues, then they are locally isomorphic. So then So then omega 1 is isomorphic to omega 2 via a local omalitive isomorphism. Moreover, you can choose this isomorphism to be like to be in the identity component of the Component of the so anyway, you can start with identity and deformity. So it's just Mother argument as usual. You can start with identity isomorphism. You can construct a motivation and then apply modern argument and that gives you local analytic isomorphism. So this is a nice result. It tells you that if you know that two forms have the same direction, then well they are isomorphic. And there are a little bit But there are a little bit, so let me just restate this result now in a little bit nicer form. So, what the problem so far is that if you fix manifold x, then it's possible that not all collections of bioresidue will have corresponding omega. So, for some collections, you may not be able to find loxy-plattic structure, and moreover, even if you can. And moreover, even if you can find block symplectic structure realizing it, like expression for it is going to be a little bit annoying that you will require to add some silly terms just to make it non-degenerate generic. So the discussion is only around one point, no? Yeah, just a local, yeah. So let me just restate this result in a little bit nicer form because um I believe that it's kind of I believe that it kind of makes things look much nicer. So let me define, let me consider one nice case when the dimension of the manifold is precisely two times the number of components of the gibeisers that we need. And then I can define the following And then I can define the following log symplectic form. I can view, so x locally looks like Cn and I can view it as a log cotangent bundle of the Cn over 2, which is CK. So I can take So I can take just a, you know, log cotangent bundles have canonical log symplectic form on them, just the usual cotangent bundles have canonical symplectic form. So here my divisor is just uh magnitude locus of the first uh product of the first k coordinates. The first k coordinates. And I can also modify this log symplectic form by taking any collection of Bij and adding these terms that have higher order. They have order two in a way. I mean, they have order one along each of the devi components of the device, but they have both along two components of the device. Two components of the universe. Okay, so I can define so this is like just literally expression for canonical log symplectic form on the tangent bundle and this is some people call it magnetic curve because it's now uses current in electromagnetism. So you take any kind of this nice form on the copy of the CK lump. Copy of the CK along the base anyway, and you pull it back to the attention bar. So the first one, should it be xi? P x i all over p and x i plus 1. Here I'll leave it like that. So I want to have poles only around these components. I don't want to have poles around x i, x k plus 1. Xi, Xk plus 1 is equal to 0. Oh, yeah, you're right. Sorry. Yeah. Thank you very much. This is hypothesis. Okay, and now I want to say to make a statement that every lock symptom with normal person divisor locally looks like this. Divisor locally looks like this. But I obviously have to resolve an issue that, like, these forms exist only in a certain dimension, which is 2 times k. Let me just define a little bit more general notion of isomorphism. So let's call omega 1 and omega 2. We call it Call it maybe said to be stable equivalently equivalent if Well, X. So they allow to leave actually on different spaces. Maybe let me instead of writing X omega 1, instead of writing just omega 1 and omega 2, I'll just write X omega 1, maybe X1, Omega1 and X2, Omega 2. They're allowed to live on different spaces, but I require that they coincide up to symplectic. Sound, you know, or voice first. You may need some plugin factors on both sides. You want to allow us plugin factors on both sides? Like you capture some voice lights? Yeah, I think that's pretty long up there. Okay, let me let me add symplectic factors to both sides so that it's clearly symmetric. But I think it's just uh it doesn't really matter. But you again thinking about this not as being very local or on the point. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, I want this to be like symplectic germs defined in the neighborhood of a port. And why is no longer have faults? Yeah, why is it honest symplectic space? So for the for a lot of purposes For the for a lot of purposes, this definition is just as good as the germs being isomorphic because well this symplectic summon usually doesn't really affect uh uh Poisson geometry of the space. For instance, when we're talking about Poisson homology and Poisson cohomology, all this just disappears because this kind of contractible space with symplectic form is not Poisson cohomology. Anyway, so now I can just restate this lemma in this much nicer form. X1, Y1, X1, Y2 are not symplectic. They are all symplectic. Yeah, this summons here that I add symplectic, not look symplectic. Something that, okay, every normal crossing looks symplectic let me say germ, meaning defining the neighborhood of A. meaning the defining the neighborhood of identity in the neighborhood of one point is stably equivalent to c to the power 2k with this with this very nice form maybe I'll do not even Very nice form, maybe I'll denote it by omega b. So if you fix by residue matrix B, then this is what we find. So for some B. And you can also argue uniqueness if you cannot require the stabilizer. uniqueness if you cannot require the stable isomorphism to be in the comp identity component, in the connected component of identity isomorphism. If you said it right, and also have uniqueness. But okay, so this statement now tells me that if I want to kind of study any local properties of log symplectic manicals, I really need to think about these ones. Okay. And so in particular, if you have yeah, if you have non-concrossing dividers, then I'm easy to talk about all oxymplectic manifolds lock. With me I want to. Let me now talk about Possomology of such things, unless there are some questions. So we heard about Poisson Common from Foreign Stock yesterday. I still assume that G is normal crossing. And so what's crossing homology? Just quickly to the talk. So we take all the polyvectors and we consider differential bracketing. Consider the differential because the bracket can expect its countenance bracket with pi. And that squares to zero because pi is plus one. And pi is, of course, coming, I'm assuming that pi is coming from this implemented form. Okay, and so this Poisson homology, but a little bit of difference from Florian's talk that I want to consider this as a sheet-like object. I don't want to just like look at the global population. At the global polyvectors like homology, I want it to be able to evaluate at every open set. It's shear form, like maybe complex of shifts actually. But yeah, the point is that I want to calculate it locally and then learn how to block less. So the idea of calculating post-emplomology, somehow it Somehow it's a little bit complicated to calculate it all at once. So we're going to split it into some parts. I'm going to define something called the weight filtration. But a little bit of warning, so Andrew was talking a lot about weight filtrations that exist on forms, on drama forms. And I'm going to consider that. And I'm gonna consider the analog of that that exists in polyvectors. Now we saw this notion used in one of the Rams papers, who's also talking about normal crossing log symptomatic manifolds. And somehow turns out to be very useful for this question of quasi-homology. So, how it's defined, so it's gonna be increasing filtration. Is going to be increasing filtration, and JPs of this filtration is going to be defined by the following. You allow, in polyvector, you allow at most J components to be not tangent to the divisor, while the remaining ones will be tangent to the divisor. So it's like you start with So it's like you start with omega z with w0, which is just polyvectors that totally respect the divisor. They always tangent. Each component is tangent to the divisor, that's w0. And you get something bigger where you w1 is when you allow one component to be not tangent, but the rest are tangent. And if you keep going, it's well, it ends at some point. Well, it ends at some point, at least you can say for sure that when n hits dimension of the manifold, when the index hits the dimension of the manifold, then you just get all points. But it may terminate earlier. It may stabilize earlier, actually. So, what we do to calculate, yeah, I should say this is a joint work with I should say this is a joint work with Brent Pim and Travis Schedler. So what do we do? To calculate Poisson cohomology, we calculate Poisson homology of the associated gradient of this function. Associated gradient. And so what can what what do we check? So it's pretty straightforward. It's pretty straightforward to say that uh to to to see that associated gradient with index j uh is supported on closures of some strata and the strata in question have to have exactly what I mentioned. Exactly what I mentioned J. So for instance, if your component D, if your divisor D has three components, then if J is, for instance, three, then you look at all triple intersections of the divisor. So those will be like a dimension three manifolds and I'm by by S I mean points where exactly the three components meet. Three components meet, not four or more. But as closure, there will be places where at least four components meet, and at least three components meet. And so this group J is zero outside of these closures. But on the closures, you can give nice Interpretation, nice, you can express this associated gradient nicely by the following formula. So differential, for some differential, I have to say it, uh so let me say it now, that it respects this weight filtration. So it sends uh WJ to WJ or maybe lower. WJ or maybe lower. And so, in particular, you get induced differential associated grade. And so, what this one looks like is looks like the Ram complex of certain Poisson connection on S. So this determinant of the normal bundle, maybe I'll put closure here. So determinant of the normal bundle, it's easy to check that it always inherits structure of Poisson connection coming from bracketing with phi and then And so this line bundle has Poisson connection, so you can take it's the RAM complex. So instead of forms, I'm taking here polyvector because it's Poisson connection, not the usual connection. And now we prove a proposition about... You want one polyvector, then? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The Poisson connection is defined on S, but it's not smooth when you On S, but it's not smooth when you go to the boundary of S, which is like when S meets other components. So, I should write like this. So this delta S, which is not like a boundary, but it means that never this codimension J stratum intersects, it has, like when you take closure, it includes codimension J plus 1 and J plus 2 strata. So this is like union of codimension J plus 1 strata. So, okay, so this so far is just reformulation of the problem. So I still need to explain how to calculate this. Well it is, but uh but the nice thing about the setup is that it's actually quite doable to calculate all these summons. Each dimensional J structure potentially contributes to the Poisson homology complex and we can tell exactly when when it does and when it doesn't. So first, if First, if the modular vector field of the globally defined Poisson wave vector phi is a transverse To the simple IP use of S then the summoned, which I really should uh come up with a notation for it. So let me denote the summand. Let me know this sound. Maybe by HS mainly not by I mean not by P as polyvector, T for polyvectors, but so that the statement the So that the statement that this chain complex is a cycle, so its cohomology is zero in this case. So if it so happens that modular vector field is not tangent to the symplectic leaf of S, and it's actually enough to check just for one symplectic leaf, because this S is always a regular manifold. And yeah, you just, it's enough to check this condition just for one simplicity. So if modular vector field is transverse, then this stratum just doesn't contribute anything to the Poisson commodity. So you can disregard it. Now let's consider the other case when the modular vector field is tangent. To do the same thing, to the symptomatic use of S. Then there are two cases here to consider. 2A. Let me start writing. So our result says that if modular vector field of the global wave vector is tangent, it's like eclipse of this regular or some submanupiple. regular or some submanupol s, then actually we do have some contribution to the cohomology and we can say that we can say a little bit more about it now depending on whether S is a symplectic or not. So it's regular manifold but it's possible that core rank of the bivector is smaller than dimension of s sorry rank of the bivector. So if rank of the power The if random of the pi restricted to S is smaller the dimension of S, then the Poisson homology of this summand is infinite-dimensional. Remember, I'm I'm talking about this as a sh as a shift, so I want to when I say post-homology, I really mean that I want to evaluate different open sets. And the statement about infinite dimensionality is true near any point of S. This is kind of result this is kind of situation kind of bad because like you get a lot of chronology classes. Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. So H0 is what in dimensional but the rest ones Correct? Yeah. Correct? Yeah. Okay, and then the the most nice like interesting case when you do have contribution but it's actually controlled in a very nice way happens when you put the rank of the restriction, the rank of the vector on the strata is exactly equal to the dimension. So we have symplectic stratum which well S itself is symplectic, but when you take closure you again could possibly obtain logarithmic poles. Could possibly obtain logarithmic poles. Most likely you would obtain logarithmic poles on the closure. So, what happens in this case? Then, this summon, well, I guess maybe you can already guess what happens here. If I have selective manifold, then I can turn this plus some connection to just usual connection. Uh so this is not super surprising, first? Super surprising, of course. But what's nice about this flat connection is that we can calculate all the invariants you want in terms of cohomology class of omega. So it's monodromy around like loops in S and residues. Of this log connection and log connection. So it is allowed to have poles around on the boundary. So residues along the boundary are computed purely in terms of the drama cohomology class of that. Class of the log syntactic form in the complement of the device. Okay, that's kind of like one of the main results. Do you have any questions? Questions? Maybe just explain to me again. I'm not much what this means. Oh, yeah, sorry. So is this okay so far? It's like you have, I'm saying that you have Poisson connection on this S bar, which is smooth manifold. So it has Poisson connection with coefficients in this line bundle, which is determinant of the Of the this S-bar inside the big manifold X. But that's Poisson connection. And I'm saying that the associated gradient of the Poisson cohomology is isomorphic on the chain level actually, even before going to Poisson to the cohomology. So isomorphic to direct sum of such things over all codimension J-stock. But now I explain a little bit. But now I I explain a little bit further how to calculate this direct summons uh depending on the Poisson geometry of S, which is Poisson submanifold of X. And the answer depends crucially on two things, depends on whether the modular vector field of the global Poisson bivector, when you restrict it to the stratum, whether it's tangent or transverse to the symplatic lips. Tangent or transfers to the symplatic leaves, so it has. Somehow that's very important for this complex. So if it's transverse, then Poisson homology just doesn't summon just doesn't contribute anything to the Poisson homology. You can find a contract in homology here. But if it's tangent, it contributes something to the Poisson homology. And if the manifold S is not its The manifold S is not itself symplectic, then the contribution is infinite dimensional, at least locally near the stratum. But if it's finite dimensional, then you can actually obtain a very nice answer. Sorry, if it's yeah, if it's if the symplectic, if the stratum S is symplectic actually with respect to the restriction of the bivector, then you obtain some nice answer for this plus of homology. So it's finite-dimensional, but moreover, you can You can uh express this summon as the RAM complex for some uh flat connection that possibly has poles along some normal crossing divisor inside S-bar. I think just a similar conclusion would be that the columnology is just Conclusion would be that the colonology is just concentrate zero on a smooth point. I mean, it's the Durham complex. Final statement should be that it's. Oh, here it's Durand complex, but if the connection has poles. Yeah, but if it's local, if you're looking locally, right, then it's just a dimension zero, which is. Well, but what can happen that S, for instance, is two-dimensional, so this is possible that S is two-dimensional. And then S-bar has two components. S-bar has two components, so maybe delta 1S and delta 2s. So it's possible that this log connection has poles along some normal crossing divisors. Then when you take the RAM complex, it's actually, it can potentially be in degree 0, 1, 2, not always in degree 0. But the value for this drama complex with coefficients in the flat connection, at least locally, it can completely be calculated in terms of residue. Be calculated in terms of residues around these components. And when you talk about global, you have to know a little bit more information, you need to know a monogramy of this flat connection around all loops. Then you can also calculate it very explicitly. Yeah, I think maybe it's what uh who said it's like um H zero. It's like the H0 is essentially Casimirs of S and the rest ones are just this H0 tensored with the drum complex on the leaf space of S. Polyvectors on the leaf space, yeah. Except the leaf space can be bad, so it's not automatic that leaf space is nice space.  So, yeah. So, using this type of format is like now experience you can calculate personal chromology in pretty much all the examples you want, as long as you have good handle on the omega. And from Ethereum, yes, I think that's the same thing. Yes, more or less direct corollary of this, but I'm not sure how it was. Let me state. So, theorem said that, okay, so the same assumption, you have normal crossing divisors. So, this is look simplectic. And uh here's normal crossing. It looks normal crossing singularities. It was come across its similarities. And then for some homology of this manifold. Manifold is locally finite dimensional if and only if X has finitely many characteristics in bike eclipse. I'll show what that is. So, everywhere locally means that every point of X has a small neighborhood where this property holds. And characteristic symplectic leaf means just symplectic leaf such that modular vector field is tangent to it. So somehow, yeah, it's kind of very important that we consider these both these properties as local properties. So it can happen that final dimension, so that Poisson homologies. That poisson homology is infinite-dimensional in some neighborhoods, but when you globalize somehow, it becomes collapses to something finite-dimensional. So, there are examples like that. But at least when you know that Poisson homology is finite-dimensional everywhere, that's a nice case because you can really try to globalize and do the calculation on the global level if you know, if you have good control about all local contributions. But this type of manifold, when the Poisson combinology is not what we find in the national everywhere, we c we we use a a special trick for them. A special term for them, we call that them honomic. And uh sorry, so actually in in in the preprint we we defined sorry, definition was given in the earlier work of Brentpin and Trader Schadler and they actually defined it a little bit a little bit differently. They just consider certain G module that exists canonically here and they require that G module to be holonomic, which is like standard. Which is like standard definition in the theory of demodules. But essentially, it amounts down, both down to this condition. So I think conjecturally it's equivalent. So I'm kind of stating here a little bit differently from the paper, but it's conjecturally equivalent definition. But for the purpose of today's talk, let me just go into G-modules in the last 10 minutes. So that's what holonomic means. And so this result says that holonomicity is equivalent to this geometric condition on characteristic leaves, but you see that this geometric condition is actually doesn't refer to the fact that G is normal crossing. And we conjecture that the theorem before is true. Theorem before is true for any log symplectic manifold without contusion on the D. So no for if there is normal crossings that we we can prove it. We can prove it. But it's not all examples, like we tried some other examples, and it seems to be always hold. So another piece of evidence beyond the normal crossing case is this Hilbert schemes of Poisson surfaces. So what holds for Hilbert's thing, if you take surface and you take anti-canonical divisor If you take anti-canonical divisors, then well, there is Poisson structure of S that has this anti-canonical divisor. And let C be normal causing, so meaning it's a curve that has at worst nodal singularities. Then when you go to Hilbert's scheme and induce Poisson structure from S to this Hilbert scheme, Of this Hilbert scheme, that's the result of what I change that post-construction on S always induces post-construction on this Hilbert scheme, then the divisor becomes much more complicated, it has more complicated singularities than just like normal processings. Nevertheless, we can prove that this Hilbert scheme is holonomic, and we can also prove Uh that it has finitely many characteristic leaves everywhere. So the singularities here of the divisor in code to cover scheme are actually much more complicated than normal crossings. I'm not sure how complicated they are. It's kind of like I'm not sure about that. But they are definitely not normal crossings anymore. But nevertheless, this projection is true for Kubernetes schemes. And so we kind of stayed this conjecture. With much less material than the prepared, but let's see how much time. Ten minutes? Yeah, ten minutes. So what is characteristic moves? For these characteristic leaves. So, sorry, characteristic leaves are symplectic leaves, such that the modular vector field is tangent to them. So, they are the ones that could cause trouble. Yeah, 2A and 2B. But are you talking about the significant use of all about this cortical elements of the stratification? Is this somehow done by analyzing what happens to personal combo under these table equivalents or or not? Yeah, for top of cross-off case, it's it's exactly how it's done. As in this proposition, this called This proposition is called the direct sounds. And for Hilbert's scheme, okay, I should say that this is almost a theorem, and we haven't published it, but the proof seems fine so far. So for Hilbert's scheme, we find degeneration that is normal crossing. We prove it. Degeneration has this property, and so by there is some kind of upper semicontinuity for Poisson homology, prove it for the property itself. I was going to talk about deformations and group weight integrations. So, this talking about deformations would take longer than 10 minutes, and I don't really know much about. And I don't really know much about report integration, so I can tell you everything I know in 10 minutes. Everything I have to say, I guess. So the big kind of interesting problem, which I will formulate a little bit maybe. If you have a look symptomatic manifold and no assumption on G. And then is there symplectic repoid For this x pi, where pi is inverse of omega, that is birational to just the product. And uh roughly by rational means that you can remove some. That you can remove some small subset of x cross x, and you remove some small subset of symplectic repoid, and they become isomorphic after that. So it seems naturally that, well maybe, like the question is, is there a symplectic repoid and how to construct it, of course. It seems that one necessary assumption that we need to assume is That simple actives are a nice sort of, let's say, algebraic implicitly assuming that manifold x is quasi-projective manifold, smooth quasi-projective manifold. And then if simplicity required like Symplectic repoid like this exists, that is also algebraic, then well, symplectic leaves are just orbits of action of symplectic repoid, something algebraic and something algebraic. So the orbits are known to be also algebraic. Algebraic, I mean just like no, there is no irrational rotation or anything like that. This seems to be ne necessary condition to assume, but suppose we have that, is it always true and how to construct? And then you're asking, like, do you want to actually move forward to also do algebraic or yeah, yeah, birational is kind of like, yeah, it's kind of uh it's a quasi-project, I want it to be quasi-projective, so open subset and projective variety. So So there is a result of Von Heri and Li privacy that if you assume the divisor is actually smooth, the one for singularities then they provide this construction when you take per dropoid, which is Pergrowpoid, which is an integration of system of many people that are synplectic. And then they do some series of blow-ups and remove in some strata to obtain this lactic report for the log syntactic manifold. But yeah, I'm not sure, yeah, I don't think this was pushed much further this case. Even like for normal crossing case, I'm not sure if there is a nice construction that always works. Well, it won't. Always works. Well, it won't always work, you have to have some assumptions on the plateau case. So, what exactly are those assumptions and how it works? I don't even think it's sorted out for a normal crossing case. I would want really to do this for more general log-symplatic manifolds. So, we do have some result in this direction that really concerns the Hilbert schemes. Again, I'm gonna state this. Again, I'm going to state the result, but it's not published yet, so it's possible that it has some mistake. Let me just state it as a work in progress. So if S is a given Hilbert scheme of some surface and C is a curve, some economical divisor. So it's zero plus construction S And I don't I don't assume anything about it. There could be any symbolic you want. That could be any symbolic you want. And the syplectic groupoid can be constructed in the following way. But if not this m, so we're going to define some modulus space. I'm going to take any pair of points in Hilton scheme. So by Z1 and Z2, I mean zero-dimensional sub-schemes, Hilbert scheme, with fixed multiplicity, so with fixed length n. So the modular space will consist of these pairs. And also, one additional piece of information I need isomorphism, in appropriate sense, isomorphism between the intersections of the of this Of this zero-dimensional sub-schemes with the degeneracy curve on the surface. But this is, I have to correct this. So far, it's not exactly right. So I want this to be isomorphism. And how when we try just this definition, it's somehow you quickly find that it's very, very wrong. So you have to take the stands of product in the direct sense. So you have to take not just So you have to take not just set theoretic intersection of zero dimensional schemes with C, you have to remember some extra data. So this is derived tensor product. And you want this to be isomorphism and cohomology. So quasi-isomorphism. And this the claim is that And the claim is that this actually forms some scheme that is not derived, that's honest, meaningful honest scheme that is smooth and it carries the symplectic form. And it has source and target map would be just taking Z1 and Z2 correspondingly. And it is birational to the product of two copies of Hilbert's scheme because when you take Z1 and Z2, so that Z one and Z two so that they lie away from the divisor, then both the standard product is just going to be completely zero, and the only isomorphism will be just the zero quasi-isomort. Module, yeah, there is appropriate equivalence relation to these things. Module of that equivalence relation, there is only one. So generically it's birational. So generically this n. So generically this m looks like two copies of the first two coins it's a kind of like a little bit of evidence for this problem that uh you know I ho hope that it's true in some much greater generality. Some much greater generality. But yeah, we don't know. So that's it. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nicola. Are there questions? So you kind of, if you remove, if you remove some, you could mention one like higher, some small part, and it becomes. Some small part, and it becomes just an open subset of this. You can just take so this product has symplectic form, you restrict it to the open set, and so the part of the theorem is to check that this symplectic form extends nicely without falls over whatever you removed. But I think Travis, oh sorry, I think Brent was saying that he had some other description of this, some nicer description of this. Of this, some nicer description of this syntactic form. So maybe he can explain that later. I'm not sure. But like a cheap way would be just to take from here and restrict. You can write down the tangent space in terms of some X group in terms of pairing. Very similar to what Lokai does for the moduli sheets on the cube. Further questions? Anybody online have any questions? Good question. So can you describe in terms of that? Can you describe in terms of that matrix Bij that's um I can the answer is kind of interesting a little bit bizarre but very very explicit the question is can I describe holonomicity condition in terms of the matrix of my residues Bij of the normal crossing case? So k here refers to the number of components that meet locally, not the dimension of the manifold. So we're talking about local picture here. So the luminosity is local condition. And then Local condition, and then so then x is homonomic if and only if for every subset of indices between one and k any subset such that has cardinality. Has cardinality, odd cardinality. The following condition is true: that you take principal submatrix indexed by these indices of I. Its row span, take the rows and take linear span, does not contain. Uh does not contain constant vector for instance constant vector consisting of just all ones. You have to check this condition for every odd-dimensional subset of this set. For small dimensions, it's pretty easy, but yeah. For higher dimensions, it's a lot of conditions to check, but it's very concrete. The row span of this principle submatrix does not contain one one. So for instance, if I take something like So, the bar residues are symmetric necessarily. So, if I take this, then if you just subtract from the first row, third row, you obtain 2, 2, 2. So, you can divide by 2, obtain 1, 1. So, this one is not holy. That's the simplest example of not holy. What would you say is the relationship between this class of fossil structures that you're looking at, with these bioresidues and so on, clustered fossil structures? Right, right. So in cluster algebra, whenever they have this like cluster matrix. It's like the cluster matrix, they define Poisson bracket, which is coefficients are given by this matrix. But somehow it seems that the coefficients of the bivector, somehow they don't really carry meaningful information. So they're really coordinate dependent. Seems, yeah, you can, if you change coordinate, bracket changes. So here it's important that we deal with the inverse. Important that we deal with the inverse matrix, which is four coefficients of the log four. And that has topological information, coordinate-free definition. So I think these bioresidies are inverse of that cluster matrix. Except maybe in cluster world, this matrix actually has well-defined meaning. But when you just go to all normal cross-imposed manifolds, these coefficients of the pi vector don't seem to have any good meaning. While coefficients of Good median, while coefficients of the log form do. Can you say that a cluster Poisson structure is of that type? A type that are defined. Yeah, okay, so yeah, in cluster algebra, I think they don't necessarily require that the matrix is non-degenerate, but if it is, it's exactly of this type. It's exactly the type of a log symplectic with normal crossings that you can study. I see. So do you think so because they're in in that in that area, they In that area, they have local normal forms or log normal forms on a Zariski open set. So, what do you think about that? I mean, these results were local in the analytic topology. And what's your opinion about the risky topology? So, how my personal feeling is that it's wrong to work with the risky. Feeling is that it's wrong to work with the risk etopology when you deal with Poisson geometry, because, like, the simplest questions. So, you can have two Poisson structures that are isomorphic analytically, but not algebraically, but they'll still have the same pyresides. So, they should be kind of the same, but there is no algebraic isomorphism between them. But again, maybe in the cluster world, somehow they just restrict to the Poisson structures, where it doesn't matter whether you somehow. Doesn't matter whether some somehow maybe for them the risky topology is the same as analytic, but sure. But yeah, my personal opinion is that the proposed angel rather do this analytic topology. Because for instance, yeah, and yeah, Darbut theorem is not true in the sky topology. Just possibly any further questions? Uh let's thank Nicola. Let's thank Nicola for that. Okay, and before everybody runs away for lunch, I'd like to remind you that we're having a group photo now, just outside the building. And everyone on Zoom, please stay there, and they'll take a gallon or two. Thank you. Suddenly doesn't seem to uh take a while to go.
