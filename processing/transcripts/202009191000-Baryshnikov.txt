Thank you to organizers for inviting me here. So it will be the closest Blackboard, closest approximation of Blackboard talk. So yeah, so the plan is I will be talking a little bit about where this problem is coming from, the genesis of it. And we walk through the definitions because there's slightly Just slightly non-traditional. Then we'll talk about some motion planning, then the result, examples, and depending on time and the general mode will go into some proofs or not. Okay, so what is the story started with a couple of results, and I became aware of them thanks to Michelle Farber. So this is Ethereum. Theorem. So there is this very beautiful theorem by Stenislaus Gaul, I think about 2000, which goes as follows. So assume you have just X, which is close, compact, simplicial complex. I think that was his setting. And he was considering the and he was considering the configuration spaces of distinct points in x. So essentially he was taking this x to the power n and reducing, removing all the diagonals. So removing all the diagonals where the diagonal is just set points where K L. Just set points where KL, the K and L points coincide. So, anyway, and then he was looking at just Euler characteristics of this object, the standard, you know, your standard good friend, Hamadopian variant Euler characteristic. And he arranged them into his exponential generating function. So, here, considering the world characteristic of this space. All the characteristics of this space and multiply them by t to the power n divide by n factorial. So and absolutely amazingly turned out that it's a rational function. Turn out that it's a product over all simplices in x of the following terms. So we have the product of linear functions actually, like so it will be one. So it will be one plus minus one to the dimension of your simplex. And here you have one minus the order characteristic of the link of the simplex multiplied by t so number of brackets one to three one two three multiplied by this variable t and again put into the power of the dimension of the symbolics okay so So here, of course, D of is just the dimension, and the link of the simplex is just sort of the base of the cone. So you take the point in the simplex, you take some transversal section and the base, so it will be locally conical. So the base, the base of this transversal section will be the lean. Transversal section will be the link. So, this is the link of sigma. Clearly, it doesn't depend on the point in the simplex. Okay, so again, it's nice and pretty unexpected formula and obviously quite intriguing, where it's coming from how we can generalize it. So, this is one result. Another result was coming from somewhat earlier work by Bjorner. Work by Bjorner and Lovis. I think it's the several works, you know, corrupted in 98. In this situation, they had this, so the space they were considering was, you know, just Euclidean space, but their configuration space were unusual. So they were considering configuration space. Configuration space of no k equal points. So configuration space of n points, which are of them no k i equal is exactly what you would expect. So it's just collection of distinct points from which you remove all the diagonals, all the diagonals over the subset of size k. So this delta i is just a collection of It's just a collection of so i is subset of indices and this diagonal says all the collection of the points i1 is equal to i2 is equal to all the way to ik, where i is just a subset of indices of size k. Okay? So in other words, you allow, so if you consider no k e. So, if you consider null k equal, k say 3 or 5, then you allow up to k minus 1 points to occupy the same position, but no more than that. So, k points are not allowed to sit in the same place. So, those places, those spaces are sort of underdeveloped, but they're beautiful. For example, this M3 of R says this. So, this configuration space for this non-three equal guys, right? This no three equal manifold, it is, you know, it's a very nice counter, you know, cousin of the braid manifold. So it's k pi one space, you know, it has very nice fundamental group. I mean, it's a beautiful space and sort of like mirrors in many respects. Sort of like mirrors in many respects the braid space, but underdeveloped people not studying it. I mean, and sort of it's also plain braid. There is a plain braid group introduced by Renault or maybe earlier. And so like tons of parallelism between those spaces. So those spaces are, you know, they are there. There's no k equals spaces. They have natural, you know, rather natural structure. Rather natural structure, and you know, it's very natural to consider them. So, so there's so interesting, but shy cousin of the great spaces. Anyway, so what is this work about? I wanted to generalize everything you saw. Everything you saw. So I want to work with sort of my exotic. So, what's the exotic configuration spaces? So, I want to like rather general non-coincidence conditions. So, I want the conditions which would generalize this not k equal, but maybe also to different types of points, different types of particles. Of particles. So I will have some colors. So take some. So my points can have colors. So you will some space C of colors. And my non-collision conditions, I will be describing them by some, I will just write down explicitly. Write down explicitly which collections of which points are allowed to be in the same place. So there will be some ideal of allowable collisions. I'll call it J, and it will be sitting in just this set of all possible vectors of colors, right? So element here. vectors of colors right so element here it will be saying say three two is like three blue and two red particles right and i will be drawing those ideals in such a way so something like so this will be zero one two and i will say okay so i have block here means okay let me just color them this will be blue This will be blue. This will be red. So this means that I allow the block is there. I'm allowing two blue and one red particle to be there. And the fact that it's an ideal means that if I allow that, I allow any smaller quantities. So I'm always allowing at least, you know, one particle should be there. So I'm considering ideal, so I'm allowing some number of colors to consider. Colors to consider. So, this idea, which I'm drawing now, I'm allowing something like two, three, three, four. So I'm allowing up to four red particles to be in the same place, up to three blue particles to be in the same place. But I'm not allowing three blue and one red particle to be in the same place. This is forbidden. So this is my ideal. So this is my So, this is my ideal. So, this is my J, the ideal of allowable configurations. And my configuration space is exactly that. So, my configuration space generated by this ideal of X and S is some collection of n colored points. So, it will be just X to N, where from each. From which I remove all the diagonals which are forbidden. So I remove all these diagonals. Clearly, I remove everything which is above them, right? Hence, all forbidden diagons. Okay. Questions so far? Good. No, no, go ahead. Okay, let me just break chat so that. Okay, let me just bring chat so if I see if there are some questions there is a question. I just wondered why it's called an ideal. Is there an algebraic reason? Oh, just it's like it's a terminology is coming from combinatorics. The people talk anything which is downwards, you know, anything downward containing, they call it ideal for whatever reason. Okay, thanks. So you have this partial order of the port. So, you have this partial order of the points and whatever, you know, if downward close set that you like. Anyway, so this is what we want to study. And, you know, one can ask, okay, why we study those. So, the big question, of course, is why we should be interested. Well, I became interested in this project. I became interested in this problem from the viewpoint of the motion planning. So imagine you have some terrain, some collection of robots moving there. And robots can be of different shapes and sizes, right? So you can have some corridors and, you know, like three tiny blue robots, and one giant red robot can feed. And two giant red robots. Two giant red robots can fit, but not more. So you can think about conditions of those robots. You don't want to be in the same place for size reason, or maybe they just became too irritable. Or you can think about your politically charged neighbors. You don't want them to be mixing in some particular way. So you can easily imagine situations where those categorization space have practical applications. And why we want to study topologies with the space from the U.S. Study topology of this case from the viewpoint of robotic motion planning. Well, so here's this notion. So it's, I call it topological complexity. It is a problem which actually the practitioners are, you know, encounter quite often. So imagine you have some terrain and you have some, you know, forbidden blocks. So, you know, it might be buildings, so it might be. So, you know, it might be buildings, so it might be this diagonals you want to avoid. So, this is my configuration space, and I have some robotic swarm or some whatever. I'm planning motion in this configuration space. Again, in our context, it's just I just plan the motion of all the robots on the Amazon fulfillment center so they don't collide. And my motion may be some, you know, some trajectory, whichever it is. Trajectory, whichever it is, right? But of course, as everybody in control theory knows, the life never runs according to the plan. So you can find yourself, you can find yourself somewhere else, you can find yourself here, and still you want to join your trajectory. You want to, you know, like the control mechanisms, the feedback loops, they steer you back to where you want to be to those, again, whatever trajectory. It might be a stable trajectory, everybody should be there, or it might be periodic trajectory. Be there, or it might be a periodic trajectory, like you're scheduled patrolling, or whatever, some trajectory. And if you deviate from it, you want to get there. However, it's immediate that if your homotopy type of your ambient space is different from the homotopy type of your attractor, the way you want to be, then such a planning mechanism is impossible. There should be some places where your planning will encounter some discontinuities. Continuities, right? So, you know, at this point, you will be deciding to go here or you want to go there, which part of the loop you want to join. So, there will be some discontinuities, whichever feedback loop you create, there will be some discontinuities you will have to do to just forced on you by the difference of topologies of those spaces. And those discontinuities from the viewpoint of, okay, so I'll just put it down. Of okay, so I'll just put it down for the record. So it back is forced to be discontinuous if how multiple types of your configuration space broadly understood, just the space. Broadly understood, just the space where your planning happens and your attractor don't match. And you can ask, okay, so those discontinuities is something where your, you know, like status, like standard feedback control is not working. You have to make some decision. You have to toss a coin, you have to, you know, ask what to do. So this continuity is a problem when you do any actual Do any actual coding, we have to write any actual controller for any actual system. So, like you're Boeing 737, you'll start, you know, don't know what to do in some particular situation. That's what you want to avoid. So, there is something, some problems. And, you know, the more complicated this discontinuity set is, the harder the life is. And it can be even quantified. So, even the decision, so I want, you know, like I find myself on this. You know, like I find myself in this configuration space and I want to check: am I in this continuity space or not? And you can ask, okay, how many operations, how many computing operations, how many logical comparisons you have to do to just answer the membership question. Am I on this discontinuity set or not? So, if the topology is complicated, if the total beta number, say, so there is again, like Bjorn and Lovis and Yao created a beautiful theory. Created a beautiful theory like lower bound topologically based lower bounds for the membership problems, which says that if your total bits and number of your set you want to be to just to decide whether you are on this set or not, so if the you know this set is complicated from the you know like homological viewpoint, then the computation just to answering this equation will take a long time so. So, this mismatch between the topology of the configuration space and the topology of your attractor, which is typically just like extremely simple, it's a point or a circle. This mismatch can have very dire real-life consequences because your robots will spend increasingly large amount of time just deciding, okay, this is special configuration. We don't know where I should. We don't know where I should go here to the right or to the left. To prevent the deadlock in those situations, you need to do something, and this something becomes more and more difficult. Anyway, this is my emotion planning pitch for those for why we should study those numerical characteristics of those spaces. And of course, ideally, we would know the total beta numbers, so all beta numbers, and you know. Numbers, so all beta numbers, and you know, like product and everything, but this is hard, and we're resorting here to much easier questions about the order characteristic of those exotic configuration spaces. Questions about this segment? No questions. Good. Okay, so let's move forward. So let me promote. So let me formulate my main results. Main result is a formula. It's a formula which is analogous to. Oh, I forgot to mention. Sorry, guys, when I was talking about those, this formula, I forgot to mention that they had also this configuration spaces also had nice formula. How I forgot that. Sorry about this. So if you look at this sum of, so one of the results, so Bjorn and Loewes proved that the sum of Euler creates. The sum of Euler critiques of this in all three equal spaces over R and again, if you take this exponential geometric function, so it's given by the again rational function. It will be 1 minus t plus t squared over 2 factorial, and so on, plus minus this t to the power k minus 1 divided. So it's partial, you take this partial e to the minus t and cut. e to the minus t and cut it off at the k minus first term and then take inverse of it reciprocally okay so this is the formula for the exponential generic function this no k tree equivalent you know like so now my main result so main result is the following so this is the theorem which says that so again like we have this uh x is uh so x can be So, X can be, you know, like you work for some, you know, or minimal setting if you like, but you know, everything can be triangulated. So, you can think about sub-analytic sets or part, you know, piecewise linear, simplicial complexes, whichever you want. So, so consider some compact again, compactness is we can relax it a little bit, but you know. Relax it a little bit, but you know, for now, let's just consider compact again, we just sub-analytic set, anything which can be triangulated, and J is any this ideal. Then we can define those configuration spaces of X on n points, and n will be colored now. N will be a vector of colors. So, n is now not just a number of points, but you're asking how many points of each color are there. Many points of each color are there, and we take these guys and we form the generating function again, spinal generating function. But now we count for the colors, so it will be z to the power n divided by n factorial. And we take the sum, okay? So z to the power n will be just z1 to the power n1, and so on, times z. The total number of colors will be c, right? So something like that. Right, so something like that, and of course, n factorial is just the n1 factorial times nc factorial. So take this exponential generating function, multivariable function now, and this will be equal to the following product. It will be equal to the product of phi j, I will say in a second what phi j is, of the product over all strata. Of x, and he will be one of this stratum again times z, this is my variable, and taken to the power minus one to the power dimension of the stratum times the characteristic of this, oul characteristic of the stratum. Okay, so So okay, where? So what is phi of j? So phi of j is the exponential generating function of my ideal. So I'll take this, so phi j of z, it will be just the sum over all vectors belonging to the ideals of z to the m divided by m factorial. divided by n tutorial. So if I have something like this so this term, so 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, so this term will be contributing z1 z2 squared divided by 1 factorial, 2 factorial. Okay, so this is what will be contribution. I take sum of all these terms. Okay, very simple. This is just enumerating all the terms. Enumerating all the terms in my ideal. Ideal, by the way, can be infinite. I'm not requesting the ideal to be finite. It may be infinitely many allowable configurations. So you can allow all red points, you know, any number of red points to be in the same place, say. Okay, so what is this one of Z? It's okay, so like the pretentious definition is here Z A dual. The pretentious definition is Verdia dual of just constant function one on x. So the better definition is you take the point, so this is your stratum, so this is your sub-analytic set, you take the point of the stratum, and you take some small ball around this stratum and take the intersection of your of your stratum, sorry, the intersection of your x. So this is the So the recipe is the following. Take some point X in your in the stratum sigma, take Euclidian ball of small radius around X, intersect with your total space, right? So you're looking at what happens nearby, and take the order characteristic of it. So when So, when epsilon goes to zero, it stabilizes, right? So, it's the limit when epsilon goes to zero. And this stable finite value is called this Verdi-dual value. So, this is a function constant on each stratum, obviously. So, it's like some constructible function on x. Okay? Okay, so this is the main formula. Let me just underline it. And let me go and discuss some questions about the formulation of the formula. Okay, let me go and run some examples. So, by the way, just to prevent creation, so this. So, this okay, so the formula, of course, is not correct. It's the sum of Euler characteristics of this guys, right? And this Euler characteristic, so we'll be like, there are several versions of Euler characteristic. One of them is sort of constructible Euler characteristic when you triangulate the set and take the alternating number of simplices. This constructible Euler characteristic is, you know, nice and equal to this usual Euler characteristic if the set is compact, but if it's If the set is compact, but if it's not, then it will be different. The constructible Euler characteristic is good because it's additive. The usual Euler characteristic, homotopy invariant one, is not additive. So kind of, so here we're dealing with the usual one, the useful Euler characteristic, which is homotopy invariant, which makes, of course, the formula more difficult to prove. Anyway, so let's run some examples. So let's reconstruct the Gauss formula. So first of all, our ideal, just one color, there's just usual context space. So our generating function will be just one plus z, because we have just two allowed, you know, zero and one. And one just two points configuration allowed zero and one, that's it. So, this is our generating function. So, my dualizing function, how you can define it is exactly, well, you can see that if you take this some point on the simplex and you know, the link, so the link, sorry, my small intersection, some small ball. Some small ball, Freyus epsilon around point X, intersecting point X, will be just equivalent to just the dimension of this simplex times the cone over the link, right? So if you look at that, then immediately you see that Euler characteristic of Oliver criteristic of that will be just one, so it will be just the minus one the power dimension of the simplex times one plus this again minus one to this dimension of the simplex. Sorry, one minus or a characteristic of the link, right. So you take that and it substitutes on the formula. So we'll have this exactly that the sum of this configuration or a closeristic configuration space of X or N T n divided by n factorial will be exactly equal to the product of all simplicities of one plus minus one to D sigma times this one minus chi of link. Chi of link times t to the power d of sigma, sorry, minus one to the d of sigma, which is exactly Gauss formula. So Gauss formula just immediately follows from that. And let me just, so again, I want to just show how to compute something with this formula, like very easily. So let's consider some space which looks like Some space which looks like this: the union of two-dimensional disks connected at one point. Okay? So this is my x. And so what is my idealizing function? So for any boundary point, it will have the small intersection, it will have one piece of dimension one and one piece, open piece of dimension two. piece open piece of dimension two so it will be minus one plus one so it will be zero so all boundary pieces by the way this is standard situation if you have any boundary point the one the dualizing one dualized one will be zero there so it will be zero in these points so those guys contribute nothing any point within an open stratum of course will contribute minus one is so this will be equal to it will be sorry one minus one to the power Minus one to the power of the dimensions, it will be one here. And the only interesting, last interesting place to define: so this is so what is the what is my function at this point? So if I look at the small vicinity, if I look at the small vicinity of this point and count, so I see four one-dimensional simplices, one-dimensional cells, two-dimensional cells, and one zero-dimensional cells. And you count dimensions, you'll see that it's equal to negative one here. You'll see that it's equal to negative one here. So I have everything. So I have negative one in this point plus one in the two-dimensional guys. So my formula, so the sum of this order characteristics t to the k divided by k factorial should be equal to the product over this guy. So it will be 1 minus t. it will be one minus t to the power to the power one so this is coming from from this point so power one because it's zero dimensional one it will be one plus t to the power two so two is this two two dimensional cells that's it so if you open the brackets we'll get uh one minus uh it will be one plus t minus t squared minus t to the third. squared minus t to the third. Or if you rewrite it, it will be 1 plus t minus 2 divided by 2 factorial t squared minus 6 divided by 6 factorial t to the third. Everything else is 0. Okay, so far so good. So let's look at this number. So this number tells us that all the characteristics, so immediately we see that all the characteristics, this configuration space of two points here, it should be equal to negative 2. And it's quite easy to see that it's And it's quite easy to see that this configuration space is going to be equivalent to a graph, to something one-dimensional, to one-dimensional complex. So this will be equal to one minus the first Betes number. So the Beta number should be equal to three. The first Beta number, there will be three non-trivial generators, one-dimensional generators in this configuration space. So what are those? In this configuration space, so what are those generators? Well, one of these, like two generators are Pelimian ones, so we have one point and another one rotating around it, right? So the standard Pelimian generators in both of these chambers on the left and on the right. And the third one is much more interesting. It is this, you know, this is the eight loop. So imagine, you know, some chase, the first particle chases the other, and they moving in this eight figure. Moving this eight figure between those two chambers, and you can quite easily see that it's the third non-trivial generator of this one space. Anyway, so this computation just to show you how easy it is to compute those error criteria, and quite often you can just immediately reconstruct your space, understand what is the, what you know, everything you want to know about the space. Okay, let's move on. Let's move on. So the no k equal spaces there is it. So again, no k equal species, which again, they were introduced by Jorner and Lovis, and they were studied pretty extensively. And they were studied extensively because it's a very nice example of some subspace arrangements we can interpret, you can understand them, and importantly, computers. Understand them and importantly, computer science, theories of computer science, so we have like people spend a lot of time studying them. And you know, like in our situations, again, our phi j what we allow is just the up to k, so up to k minus one particles, they're all the same color, they're sitting in the same place. So you have k minus, well, so it will be just one plus uh plus z plus all the way plus uh. z plus all the way plus z to the power k minus 1 divided by k minus 1 factorial. So if you take this configuration spaces, which I, the form of configuration spaces I decided before, so no k equal for, say, R1 and you know n points and C to the n divided by n factorial. So again, the formula says we have just one cell. We have just one cell, we have just one cell of dimension one. You can say, of course, it's not a compact set. I will, you know, I will give it to you and say, okay, this space is matter-equivalent to a configuration space for the just closed segments, and the boundary points contribute nothing. So it will be just equal to, you know, one minus, so my is equal to negative one. Is equal to negative one on this on R1. So it will be minus minus t sorry, it will be phi j of minus t to the power minus one, which is exactly equal to this formal which you had before. Okay, so the known results can be easily constructed. So let's look at some other results. Example, so apartheid spaces, configuration spaces. So you have, you know, you have two colors, blue and red, and any numbers of And any numbers of blue colors, any number of blue points can congregate together, any number of red points can congregate together, but you're not allowing any red and blue to be in the same place. So my ideal would be, what will be ideal? It is two-colored space. So now I'm allowing all points sitting around here. So zero points and any number of blue points and zero points of red. points and zero points of red and any number of red points any number of blue points and so my phi of j will be quite obviously given by exponential exponential of z1 plus exponential of z2 because i'm summing them with factorial weights minus one to account for recounting so yeah so you can look at So, yeah, so you can look at those spaces and immediately compute whatever you want. For example, if you consider the sum of this order characteristic of this configuration spaces for the apartheid ideal for the two-dimensional sphere. So, okay, the sum of all over n1s and n2s, I'll be very specific: z1 to the n1. Being very specific, z1 to the n1, z2 to the n2, n1 factorial, n2 factorial. So it will be given just by you know e to the z1 plus e to the z2 minus 1 squared. Just so in particular, this Euler characteristic, it will be equal to so it will be equal to two. to 2 if either n1 or sorry if both if both n1 and n2 are non-trivial so if you have this uh so if there are you know if there are no points of one color then it's easy it's just you know like it's just like two to the power n if there are some points of different colors then all basically always equal to two anyway just uh this uh those examples just show how um how easy How easy it is to compute everything. If you have graph spaces, so you know, there is a lot of interest about configuration spaces on graphs, you know, and we know quite a bit about them. So we can, you know, this quite a lot of information was gathered among, you know, in particular by some of the participants of this conference about the configuration spaces on graphs. But what about no? On graphs, but what about not like exotic configuration spaces on graphs? What about not k not three equal configuration spaces on graphs? They're extremely interesting and very, very little known about them. However, all your statistics, we know everything, right? So because if you have a graph, say one-dimensional CW complex, then again, this Then again, this say, yeah, so then this again, the sum of this order characteristics of configuration spaces will be given by the product. So essentially, the denominator will have a denominator and will be just Just is the number of edges of here. We'll have just minus this vector z. And the numerator will be more interesting. It will be the product of those overall vertices, the product over vertices of one minus so this will be a valence here. So, this will be valency, valency of vertex V times Z. So, here again, you have very explicit formula. I can look at it and analyze it. For example, you see that if you have a boundary vertex, if your degree of the vertex is equal to 1, the vertex doesn't contribute anything at all. Because the phi in this case evaluated at 0 will be just 1. If you have vertex of degree. If you have vertex of degree two, so you have this minus z here, so this vertex will cancel one h exactly as it should, right? So it shows that your like supports the idea that your origin characteristic is homotopy invariant, doesn't depend on triangulation of your syntax and so on. So you can, again, it's very explicit formula. You can really like play with it. And if you have some computations about bits and numbers, you can. Know like bits of numbers, you can easily verify it using this formula. Anyway, so this is uh let me stop my public about the examples, questions about the examples. Okay, let's move on. So now I have about you know a few minutes to talk about the proofs. So, how you how you prove it. Okay, let me move on. So So, the proof obviously, you know, again, by definition, our configuration space, again, we have vector of colors, it will be space from which you remove some forbidden diagonals. So, what we can do, so we'll take various forbidden diagonals, various Various forbidden diagonals, various subsets of this collection of colored points, and you remove some of them. So, in principle, you can say, okay, if I had just my added, if I had some additivity, then I can use some version of inclusion-exclusion formula, or equivalently, I'm looking at some Milburgh's function on this partial-order set of these partitions which satisfy my condition. Which satisfy my conditions. And it's very nice and very developed, and very sort of easy-to-use machinery of combinatorial operations with those MEBUS partition functions and generating functions on them. So everything would be just working fine. So this inclusion, sorry, just sorry, Merbus function functions formalism. Plus some knowledge of, if you know, knowledge of all these characteristics of the diagonals, would result in a formula. The problem is that, of course, this, you know, the Euler characteristic which additivity works is constructible Euler characteristic, which is not homotopy invariant. So you have to do something. So, you have to do some preparations. So, it works only for constructible statistics, not for your homotopy invariant one, which means that you have to do some preparation. So, you have to do some compactification. So, this space, as we defined it, is not a compact space. So, we have to compactify. A compact space, we have to compactify it. How we compactify it will make our diagonals a little bit fatter. So, the most of the sort of work you have to do is to fatten those, to do some complectification work. So, you have to regularize your space, embed into something, then fatten your diagonals so that take some open vicinity of those diagonals, make sure that it doesn't change the homotopy. The doesn't change the homotopy type of your space, and then apply your formula, then you apply your additivity apparatus. And this can be done. And again, I'm not going to details, they are sort of relatively boring. So, again, to emphasize is that the so there's like two. That the so there's like two parts, so we have the proof is two parts: combinatorial. So we have this generating functions for partition posets, the partial ordered sets formed by partitions, and there is like a deep relation between those generating functions. Relation between those generating functions and the various, you know, this, I mean, there is a big again material theory talking about material species, which allows you to interpret those pretty easily. However, yeah, whoever the you know the so this is uh one assumption and another one is the ge geometry. Another one is the geometry. So it's in fattening the diagonals. Okay, so all details are in the preprint, which is my web website. Sorry. Yeah. So So I will refer them to the air. Okay? So I think I will stop here. Thank you. Thank you very much, Julie. Are there any questions? Go ahead, Julie. Hey, I was curious if you could do anything with J not downward closed. Like, what if you wanted to guarantee that there were no robots that are alone, for example? For example, uh, like you wanted at least two robots in a place, or always a red with a blue, or something like that. Yeah, I, I, you know, I didn't, I didn't think about it, you know, obviously something can be done, but you know, you have to I met with this approach. No, no, no, no, right. It makes sense again. Like the same apparatus should work, you know, like the fat and equal diagonals should work, and this, like, menotaxics should be probably reworked. Like metaphorics should be probably reworked a little bit, but again, probably not that much. So, there is always some iteration of inclusion-exclusion arguments. Again, I just didn't do it. Thank you. Any further questions or comments? Julie, I would have some questions. Let's see, this Let's see, these exact configuration spaces that you've been describing, say in the case of X is a graph. Is it known? Well, a fourth question in this workshop would be what is it known about the multiplicative structure on the cohomology ring for these spaces? Okay, like essentially nothing is known about. Essentially, nothing is known about the cohomologists. I think nothing known about Bayesian numbers outside of the configuration space, outside of the standard configuration spaces with the, you know, just no two points allowed to sit together, I don't think anything known about beta numbers of those spaces for non-Euclidean spaces. So, you know, there was some work done for those exotic configuration spaces. There was about some work done by, you know, a student of mine in Euclidean space, sort of, you know, like where the points sit and say on the plane or somewhere. And then, you know, there is some, you know, you can say something about the homologist, there is some version. There is some version again, like it's a long story. You know, there is little cube right, you know, acting on them. So there is sort of like some generative results around there. But for general spaces, for singular spaces, I don't think anything is wrong at all. Not even the Betty numbers, eh? No, not Betty numbers. I mean, not in general. All right. I mean, like, no, no, no, no three equal, I think. No, no, no, three equal. I think for no three equal spaces, no three points allowed to be together on a graph. I think this is already nothing is known. Oh. Can I say, look, I want to say there was a workshop in California in this San Jose. And there is a group of people, Ben Knudsen and his colleagues. They have very nice. His colleagues, they have very nice results about Betty numbers of configuration of usual configuration spaces of graphs, for example. That's right, yeah. So again, we know quite a bit about usual configuration spacing on graphs, and indeed there is like, yeah, so some results about stabilization, for example, would be like it's very initial to believe that they should be true because, again, like there is obviously symmetric group acts, and you know, like you can ask the usual standard, you know. Like, you can ask the usual standard, you know, set of results, and you know, probably they can be derived relatively easily in this setting as well. Uh, but again, and I don't know anybody was doing it. So, yeah, there's a big window to apply existing results. Good. Thank you. Thank you very much, Julie. This is a Thank you very much, Julie. This is a wonderful talk. So, now, if there are any further questions, we have this break now, and we can now switch to the chat rooms if you want. And we will resume for the next talk.
