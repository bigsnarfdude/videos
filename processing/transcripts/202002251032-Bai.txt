I'm going to more focus on about the science and also some of the problems that I want to work on. And some of them are more unique to this specific study and population. And some of them are more general. Some of the general things that I want to learn. So the specific name of this study is called nurture. So this is an observational study of This is an observational study of about 600 mother and infant diet. So, the goal is to examine the effect of caregivers on the infant's weight gain, trajectory, on the general development, milestones, so on and so forth, of the babies during the first year of life course. And the mothers were recruited during the pregnancy and then after the delivery they were followed every month, essentially, either by the phone or Either by the phone or as an in-home visit, and they will do specific measurements during the visits, which you will see on the next slide. So, the PI of this study is Sarah Neal. She used to be at Duke, and right now she's at Hopkins. So, this is a schedule of the assessment. As you can see, that while they were recruited, they did some of the essentially the basic Some of the essentially the basic characteristics of the demographic or socioeconomic status, so on and so forth. And then after the delivery, they will essentially have phone visits. They will have phone visits every month, starting from the first month. And at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, they have a home visit. So during each of the visits, they measure different things. They measure different things. For example, for the phone visits, they collect information about self-reported either physioactivity, sleep duration, breastfeeding, something like that. And the most important thing for our interest is actually the home visits. So during the home visits, what they do is that they give the babies an accelerometer, and the baby wore them on the ankle. And the axlometer is. And the actualometer is a GD3, is an FT graph, FT sleeve, and then it was sewed in waterproof sleeve and that was fixed actually on the ankle. And it's waterproof, so you don't really need to take it off during the shower and everything else. And also the moms, they were not supposed to remove the sleeve, because it's actually a little bit tight on the ankle. It's actually a little bit tight on the ankle. And the cool thing about that is they customize all of the sleeves. So if you want to take it off, you have to cut it. And then after you cut it, you are not able to put it back. So that's why it's actually easier, a little bit easier for us to identify some of the missing data. So because what will happen is that if you cut it, you will not have anything later on. And so the infants, they were the monitor continuous. Infants, they wore the monitor continuously on the ankle for four days, and they were trying to include both two weekdays and two weekends during the four-day period. So either the study, for example, starts on Thursday and ends on Sunday, or so on and so forth. And then some of the analysis that we did right now only focused on the daytime physical activity, which has been used in some of the literatures before, which is 7 a.m. Before, which is 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. This is not, this is just a very brutal way of doing things. It's not very accurate. Actually, so there are definitely better ways to define those kind of periods. But I'll leave it here for now. And the data that we collected, obviously, the raw axialometry data, and they set the sample rate at 30 hertz, 3 axis, and then we will have, we will have. Um and then we will have we will have counts excellent data uh which is essentially less than one hertz uh usually one hertz uh one axis and depending on uh depending on how you actually aggregate them. Um and the the very interesting thing about this study is that it has a very regular longitudinal structure, the data collection. So there are four visits for most of the babies. Some of them might lose one or two. So generally you have the visit at third, sixth, ninth, and twelve. At third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth month. And generally, you will have at least four days of data, and some of them were actually for an extra day or so. But we actually removed all of the extra things to keep it tight. So I'll give you an example of how the raw data look like. As a previous speaker says, it's very hard to look at all of the data just like this. So this is a raw 30 Hz actual amateur data for 30 hertz extra lemon data for 24 hours for a 12-month-old baby. And as you can see, that generally you see some of the movement during the night, but generally sedentary, I would say, because you see less of a variability or variation of the data. And then during the daytime, you see big chunks of this messy data. And generally, it means that the baby was moving. And then there are different aggregation methods. And then there are different aggregation methods, which I will not go over, which aggregate this kind of data into counts data. And the counts data are usually presented in either a second by second level or minute by minute level. And a lot of the analysis in this current field actually uses a minute by minute data because you still have 14-40 minutes during the day, which is very abundant for a lot of the For a lot of the research, if you only want to know the general level or trajectory of physical activity. And another example of how the data look like. So this is a particular baby, and the red and the black curves, those are different aggregation methods to aggregate the 30 hertz data into second by second level over here. Over here. And then we actually averaged, simply averaged all of the different days for that baby during each specific visit. So for example, on the first, this panel, those are all of the baby's data averaged across the time, across different days at the same time. And this is 24-hour trajectory of the baby. And then this is 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month. So generally, Totema. So, generally, what you actually see is that the babies are having a little bit more physical activity or more concentrated physioactivity during the daytime, especially around between like 7 a.m. 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in this shaded era. And another thing about that is, for example, some of the babies, they essentially have more physical activity during the night, potentially because they woke up and they. They woke up and they need to eat something. And then, so, like during the daytime, they are in a very similar pattern. They sleep for a few hours and then stay up for a few hours and then sleep again. So, that's why you see more scattered physioactivity rhythm or this kind of a concentration along 24 hours, especially during the first half a year. And however, this phenomenon actually However, this phenomenon actually dials down. And as the baby was growing, he or she might develop a more, I would say, stable or normal kind of a sarcatum rhythm or the day-night cycle. So what you can see is that it concentrates a little bit more of the physical activity into the daytime, while sleep a little bit more during the night. And then this bottom red essentially only tells you that what is a daytime physical activity and nighttime physical activity looks like if you just very naively sum up all of them together. And essentially what you can see is that if daytime physical activity is growing and actually for this baby the nighttime is growing and one of the particular explanations was maybe it's due to the fact that these kind of activities Fact that these kinds of activities, so the baby either they're not sleeping very early at 7 o'clock or so on and so forth. But generally, if you look at 0 o'clock, 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning, there is less and less physical activity, especially during the miles 12. So our collaborators are inch. Oh, and also this is another example of all of the data that we have. But for this plus, we Have, but for this plus, we aggregated all the data from all of the subjects together according to their age, and then took the mean of the physioactivity count during the specific time of the day. And then as you can see that, you see a pretty clear kind of increase of the general physique activity level when the baby is growing, especially during the third. Third, it's been between the third, sixth, and nine months. And there is a little bit less difference between the nine-month and twelve-month babies. And mainly the difference occurred actually during the morning and in the afternoon. But generally, you see this trend of growing. So our collaborators are interested in the development of the baby. And then one of the first questions they were asking was about how the fat level of the baby. Fat level of the baby is changing and what is its association with physical activity. So, one of the ways to measure fat was called this skin fold thickness. And the skin fold thickness essentially is measured pinching the specific part of the body, the skin of the specific part, and then measure the thickness. So, generally, if you have more fat, it will be thicker. And some of the major error that they did at Some of the major errors that they did include the suposculpular and also tricep. And one of them is measuring more of a long-term adposity, and the other one is more like central adiposity. And so one of the most powerful kind of a way to look at that, of the long-term leanness of the baby, is to look at the ratio of those two. So in this plot, in this plot, I'm showing also the trajectory of the Trajectory of the baby's daytime physical activity is actually smoothed according to their quantile level. And on the y-axis, that's a subscalpular tricep skin flow thickness ratio. So if you look at specific time point, and you will generally see what's going on, and also on the right, it's very similar, it's a bulb slot, and you generally see is that See, is that if you have more physical activity, you will have a smaller SSTR ratio, which means that the baby is actually a little bit leaner. And that's actually true along all the time of the, along every visit. And if you look at visit 3, 6, 9, and 12, the same thing happens for all of the babies. So that's why our first paper was actually. That's why our first paper was actually: we did a very simple analysis aggregating all of the baby's physioactivity, total physioactivity level during the daytime. And then we fit a mixed effect model, accounting for the longitudinal kind of measurement at 3, 6, and 9 months. And we found out that essentially the two take-home messages was the first, the physical activity was increasing for the baby along the first year of life. Along the first year of life course. And then also the second one is the more physioactivity the babies did, the leaner with less fat level the baby had during the first year. And so while we were carrying, so that we finished the first paper and then we are actually right now actively exploring more topics of the babies. One of the particular things that I've been thinking recently. Particular thing that I've been thinking recently was actually a follow-up of Julia's work on the registration, the probability of being active during the daytime. So because we have the baby during the first year of life, and a lot of things are changing really fast. So I was wondering whether we are able to capture this kind of whether the baby was sleeping or not, and using some of the methods. And obviously we're not really able to detect sleeping, especially for the baby. Especially for the baby using the hex wonter. So, what I really consider this is more or less like the pattern of inactivity. And then, after, if we just run that registration methods directly, essentially registering the two peaks of the probability of babies being active. And in this plot, I plot all of the available days together and then sorted. And on the and then sorted them according to the age of the baby. So y-axis, that's the age of the baby, x-axis, it's time of the day. And then the red means that the baby is active, and the white or the yellow means the baby is not active. So essentially, what you see is that we're seeing a more and more clear boundary between, like over here, because essentially because the babies, they're getting more and more, they're shifting a lot of their physical activity from the night time. Their physical activity from the nighttime back into the daytime. And then, so that's why, when like over here, you see a lot of red, like in this particular area, and then less of the red in this particular area. And then a very similar thing happened during the noon time and later on. So, this is essentially my last slide. I won't talk about some of the challenges either to this data set or some of the To this data set or some of the general problems that I want to work on. So, obviously, the first one: a lot of people are asking: what do you mean by real physical activity of the infants? Because there are a lot of situations when their moms, their parents are moving the baby, swinging them, and then you're not able to really tell that apart from this kind of data. So that's actually a question that bothers us. And I don't really have any. Bothers us, and I don't really have any good answer to that. So, right now, what we're essentially our analysis assumes that this kind of an artifact physical activity introduced by the parents are essentially similar across all of the babies. But probably we're thinking it might be different depending on maybe the socioeconomic status or some other things. So, I would love to hear about your opinion if you have any suggestions of how we can fix that. Suggestions of how we can fix that. And also, the second thing about that is the impact of sleep at night and sleep during the day. So the babies are not like adults. So generally, we sleep at night for whole periods of time and then go on for a day during the daytime. But they are not. Especially in their early life course, what they're doing is that they sleep a few hours and then wake up and sleep another few hours and wake up. So how do you really account for that kind of sleepiness? Really, account for that kind of sleepiness? So, do you really define a daytime or nighttime according to, like, for example, the parent schedule? Because the parents, they have the daytime, so that's the daytime of the baby. It's actually an unknown kind of, I don't know the answer of that question. And then the third one definitely is how to really define the real sleep for the babies. And what a lot of the exoometry X13 data analysis data was essentially assuming a lot of the null movement periods are sleeping. But this might be complicated by the fact that we are introducing a lot of artifact physicity by the parents, for example, when their babies were not asleep and they were swinging the baby a little bit, helping them to get sleep. And in that kind of case, we're not able to detect that. And then such kind of things will actually introduce a lot of things. Things will actually introduce a lot of noise into our analysis, and so I don't really see a very good way of addressing those issues. And some of the general things that I am interested in, and some of them can be applied into this population. The first one is definitely the methods, quantify a circadian reason. And there are definitely ways you do that. For example, there are non-parametric, parametric models, and then you fit the model and then look at all. The model, and then look at all of the parameters that you estimated. And these are actually, people having been using those things: relative amplitude, IV, IS, all of those things to look at the sarcatum reason. I was just wondering whether there are better ways to do that, especially because the babies are a little bit different in terms of the day 9 kind of cycle. And then another thing is this sarcotomy rhythm development over time. So, the most naive way you can do that. So the most naive way you can do definitely is to look at the change of all of the parameters that you estimated and then to see how that changed. Actually, we have done some preliminary analysis and it's actually changing in the right direction. So that's exciting, but I was wondering whether there are better ways to do that by, for example, using some functional data analysis approach or something else. And also another thing that I would like to address. That I would like to address is to account for the day shift, daily shift of circuit readings. That can happen for the adults. For example, if you have shift workers, and then sometimes if we say, okay, we're looking at the daytime activity, they don't really have anything. Or they have a late start of the day, and then they have a late finish of the day. And some of those things were shifted. And then, so in a lot of my own analysis, we just assumed we just didn't do anything. We just didn't do anything for this situation. So I wonder whether there are better ways to handle this, especially if you only are encountering a few hours of the shift for a lot of people. And that could be a more serious issue for the babies, because essentially they have more sleep and awake cycles than the adults. And the last one definitely is composition data analysis. So I have some new things going on. I probably will be needing to do some We'll be needing to do some compositional data analysis. And I know that there are some standards kind of research on that. And I just want to learn more about how people are thinking about that and whether there are any more advanced methods of doing this. And that's it. That's all my talk. And thank you very much. I have a question.
