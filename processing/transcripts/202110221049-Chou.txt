Thanks to the organizers for having this conference. I was still looking for flights in the last week if I could possibly make it. But so I wanted to talk about two sort of half finished projects. Well, more than half, I guess, but two ongoing projects. And, you know, as one of the speakers said yesterday, you know, we don't know like in-person versus In person versus online. And it depends. If there's not enough time, I can just talk about the first topic. And maybe, maybe because we're short of time, that's what I'll do. So, right, the first topic is nucleation foci, and I'll explain what that is in X inactivation. And this is a project with a project scientist, Yolanda McCarthy, and Catherine Plath, who's running the experiment. Running the experiments on this. So, just as a quick reminder, the X inactivation occurs in females with two X chromosomes. If both are expressing protein, you make too much. So one of them gets shut down and the extra X much gets shut off. The gene expression is repressed. And it's called XI for inactivated X. And it's randomly chosen. So between in cells. So essentially. In cells. So essentially, females are mosaic. Some cells have the paternal X shut off, some have the maternal X shut off. You know, if there's no pathology in any sense, it's a random process. And what's interesting is that when the cells divide, it's the same X that's also shut off in the daughter cells. So you get these sort of clones of either paternal shutoff or maternal shutoff. Maternal shutoff. And so the details of this mechanism is still ongoing. There's been, as you can imagine, a lot of models and theory and hypotheses about how this happens. There's a lot of models on sort of negative feedback that one of them gets shut off, the other stays active. What does shutting off mean? You know, how is it shut off molecularly, mechanistically? And this is sort of the motivation of our. Motivation of our study, which is essentially an imaging study. So, what's known now is that there is, what I said was that the X inactivation, the inactivated X has all the genes shut off, but not all, right? So there's one, which is the exist, is transcribed, and the activated X, the X. Activated X, the X that's still activated, has that gene shut off. Okay, so it's kind of the flip, it's the reverse. And it is the thing that's produced is called a long non-coding RNA, in this case, exist, which is 17 kilobases. So it's a big RNA and it's not translated, but it appears to cover the exodus. To cover the XS, it's made and it appears to cover the X that will be inactivated. Okay, and it's only expressed in the inactivated. And this is full length exist. This is delta, just some part of it lopped off. And you can see that it has to be the full thing. Otherwise, it's not as confined. Okay, so that's a deficient exist. So this is shown to be a key player, right? And it turns out it'll be a nucleator. And it turns out it'll be a nucleator for other proteins. So, this is regular microscopy. This is 3D SIM super resolution. And very much like J before, don't ask me. I don't know how exactly it works, but it is a it's really interfering gratings and then reconstructing the image to get sub-diffraction resolution. So, here we could actually see these little clusters of Little clusters of exist. And again, the exist seems to only cover the inactivated chromosome, right? It rarely leaks out, except if it's defective here. So the first question, you know, very simple toy is just the scaling, right? What keeps it, what keeps this thing confined? And it's also thought that the exist expression. The exist expression site is mostly on, it's always on, right? So it's always producing. So if you're always producing, this thing will just flood the whole nucleus. This is the nucleus. But so therefore, it has to be some kind of degradation process, which I define mu. And just looking at this kind of very simple non-interacting picture of a diffusing particle, we have this length scale d over square root of d over mu, the degradation. And we want this to be roughly. Degradation. And we want this to be roughly two microns, right? That's the size of this X before it's fully compacted on order of one micron. So this means that the diffusivity, so that's wrong. That's a D instead of L. Sorry about that. So if the lifetime, let's say it's 20 minutes, okay, and we'll have some evidence on that later. The diffusivity is 10 to the minus 10 centimeters squared per second, which is small. squared per second which is you know small even for a small even for a large uh rna so this means that it's obviously in a in a very dense environment compacted environment and there's a lot of theories about you know where these clusters form they're in kind of like open spaces or not and people start thinking about uh using models of anomalous diffusion for it but i'm not going to go there for now we'll just say that this diffusivity is small which means This diffusivity is small, which means that it has some kind of interactions with the chromatin, right, with the DNA. So it has some kind of relatively strong, let's say, maybe nonspecific, maybe specific interactions. So that's the first thing to really, this is sort of the global constraint on this problem. Let's see. Let's see. Oh, sorry about this. I did not have my video. Sorry, you could see my lovely face. Okay, so, all right, so what else do we know from the imaging, from the super resolution imaging? That sort of balancing the fluorescence, normalizing the fluorescence, we see that each of these little dots, each of these little clusters. Dots, each of these little clusters really is just two. So it's really a dimer of exist. Okay. And there's 50 to 60 roughly of these foci. And this is when you're out of S, right, when you're not replicating. And we can measure the foci sizes using these, the super resolution. And here's the sort of sizes, the volumes, the typical number. And you see the focus. Sorry. The density is about the same. So, from this, we estimate that there's two exist per one of these green dots. Now, so this is in the inactivated X chromosome, but the genes we know from painting experiments, right, we label certain genes, express it, and image it. We show that they're kind of sort of uniformly distributed. Sort of uniformly distributed throughout this X, right? There's about a thousand of them, genes in this X. So they're spread out everywhere, but we only have 50 or 60 foci. Okay, so how does that, you know, how do these foci actually suppress or repress expression? So, of course, as I mentioned, the model on this thing, on this axon activation, there's been many models on liquid-liquid phase separation. Phase separation, the chromatin is some kind of a liquid that segregates and it's covered by droplets of proteins or some kind of complex structural configuration that's often then invoked. So we just started off and just thought, let's take a step back and just look at the images and see what we can say. Another feature. Another feature is that the number of foci doubles at division. Okay, so but then after that, so the daughter cells go back to 50 or 60, but it roughly doubles after the chromosomes have been doubled. So here you could see this is right around here. It's hard to tell here, but it's doubled from early SNG1. Oh, sorry, I pressed the wrong button. Sorry, I pressed the wrong button. Okay, so that's exist. Now, what else, right? It's not just the exist. So we looked at other proteins, right? SPEN is one. This is known to be a suppressor of expression, a repressor. There are other proteins. There are genes that are known that are suppressed by That are suppressed by span, but some of them require others. So it's again a sort of a heterogeneous effect, right? It's not just this does this. The stoichiometry for repression is really unknown. But what we do find is that around the exist clusters, the green GFP label exist dimers, there are aggregates of these proteins. Okay, and so this is shown using multiple dyes and multi-channel imaging, super-resolution imaging. This is just a picture of what's going on here. So you have all the different colors of all these proteins in here. And this is not the highest resolution, but there's some hope of maybe getting actually imaging the stoichiometry of each cluster for these proteins. And that's something that we'll probably need in future. We'll probably need in future models. So, okay. Then the next sort of natural study would be to use FRAP, right? Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We zap roughly the chromosome. So this is my spot, the dashed circle here. Let's say this is the chromosome, and I'm roughly going to take the whole thing and just zap it, photo bleach it. The red here is the exist expression site. Expression site, we'll assume that I just said that the diffusion is relatively slow, but it's still shown to be fast compared to exchange in the clusters. Okay, so here's a cluster of two exists with the proteins around it. After photo bleaching, nothing is fluorescing. That's a time zero. And then there's some kind of exchange, right? So the exist has to diffuse out or detach from the cluster, and then a fluorescing one can come back. And then a fluorescing one can come back in. All right, so we have this off rate and an on rate. And I label the one here, meaning there could be more than one site, right? Especially when we're going to do FRAP on the proteins themselves. So the simple, a very simple model for this is just to define fluorescing concentration, non-fluorescent photobleach concentration, right? This C-steady state is the concentration that I calculated from that. That I calculated from that expression diffusion degradation model, right? It's just when new stuff is being made and it sort of permeates the nucleus. It's the bulk mobile concentration, and it's this concentration that exchanges with the photobleach molecules in the clusters after photobleaching. CI is the stoichiometry, and I here is the different types of sites. Is the different types of sites, right? So we can imagine that there are different nucleation configurations where some proteins, the same protein, the same species is in a tighter binding site or a looser binding site. So typical would just take I, you know, just take one or two sites because, you know, at best you can fit a couple exponentials, right? So from this kind of model, right, this detached. Right, this detachment and then reattachment, and I'm assuming attachment could be different for fluorescing or not fluorescing, which you know, probably isn't, these two are probably the same. One can just solve for the fluorescent signal, predicted recovery, right? It starts at zero and then it recovers. And all these parameters, the stoichiometry, the k-plus, this k-plus. The K plus, the K on over disso over K on plus dissociation, this ratio, this all combines into a fraction, basically a filling fraction, an effective filling fraction of that site, okay, with their detachment rates. So really what we're fitting is these two numbers. So for every curve, we have two numbers if there's only one type of site, right? So we could have two types of sites and we have four parameters. Two types of sites, and we have four parameters, and that still provides a reasonable fitting. And so, here's what we find: so the exist, you see the recovery. So, this recovery is for the this very quick, it doesn't start at zero because this is the free compartment that gets filled quickly by production, right? And then this slower, so there's a very fast exponential in here, if you will, and then there's a slower one. If you will, and then there's a slower one. This is the exchange with the clusters, and this is just the free fraction that's recovered very quickly. You can see that the exchange occurs over about 30 minutes for the exist, right? This is exist. And for this protein, cis1, it's also 30 minutes or so. For the others, the span and these other known repressors of expression, we're talking 100 times faster, okay? Times faster. Okay, so we're talking, you know, a few seconds that there's recovery. So, what does this mean? This means that the exist and combines with the cis, right, to form a strong, to form a strong, a stable nucleation foci. And then these proteins, they aggregate around them. We see them through the imaging, right? They're higher, they're more concentrated near the foci. More concentrated near the foci, but they exchange very quickly. So the picture is sort of starting to emerge that this is some kind of a cloud. You form these clusters with a fuzzy cloud of these repressor proteins. So then we also looked at the trajectories of these clouds, of these foci, try to get some idea. Try to get some idea about sort of the environment that they're in because there's always a lot of talk about that they're in sort of void spaces in the chromatin, and when the chromatin gets compacted, you know, things can't access the expression sites and things like that. So this is, you know, many people do things like that. And Jay just talked about something, you know, very related. So we're looking at these trajectories. And of course, many people in this And of course, many people in this case also model it using this anomalous diffusion and stuff. But I thought that, you know, this is in a very confined environment. We're looking at sort of finite times. I mean, we try to try to image these trajectories for as long as we can. But basically, we had about a thousand trajectories. We centered each trajectories about the center of mass, the average center of mass. And we wanted to infer. Infer the effective potential that the foci is sitting in. And so, I mean, Jay also talked about this. So, you can use a kernel density estimator. Or what I like to do is just a cheap trick is just to take the cumulative estimation. Assume spherical symmetry and go from the center of mass, increase a sphere, and then just count how many points. Just count how many points of your measurements fall inside the sphere. Take this cumulative, all right? Take these point, uh, the point data, make the cumulative out of us, and then and then fit. Okay, so we just parametrically fit to match the CDF, and that gives you a density, right? This density here. This is a density of points. And from this density, you know, you could use some kind of model for defining an effective potential like this. Like this. Just a kind of a Boltzmann density function. So if we do that, sort of the easiest way we found is just to find, use a, start with a trial function, assume it's a quadratic potential, and then add corrections to it, and then find these coefficients. Okay. Find these coefficients from fitting to the data and then reconstruct your density and then take the, and then find the potential. The and then find the potential through this. So, this is just a very cheap, you know, no Bayesian or this or that or anything, just a quick, quick and dirty approach. Here are all the, or a subset of the trajectories, trajectory positions, averaged overall, you know, many different foci, of course. Here's the cumulative, do a fit, it seems pretty good. And we find that day two to day four, this is where. To day four, this is where most of the X inactivation occurs. We don't find a difference in the effective potential, even though we know that the inactivated X is compacted, is being compacted from day two to day four. Not that much yet. I think by day eight, it's more compacted, but these are mouse embryonic cells, by the way. So we find, you know, at least. So we find, at least in this kind of analysis, we don't see too much of a difference in the effective potential of these foci. Okay, so again, this sort of contributes to the story that the foci are kind of stable, possibly some specific interactions. From the painting, there doesn't seem to be much correlation with where they are in terms of where the genes are. So they're, let's say, you know. They're let's say, you know, randomly distributed, at least 50 or 60, but they're pretty stable in position. They're in some confining potential. They have a cloud of protein around them, and that is supposed to inactivate the X. And that's where this work is more ongoing, and that's where we're still trying to figure out. We have some ideas that we're playing with. So here are the conclusions. The proteins are new. Proteins are nucleated heterogeneously nucleation. It's a heterogeneous nucleation process by exist. And this is one, really. Those are the slow core particles in the clusters. They're stable throughout the life cycle. So how do these diffuse clouds suppress expression throughout the XI? So let's say this is a schematic is the XI, the green is the exist, the red little clouds of the proteins repressor. Clouds of the proteins, repressor proteins. Now, these 50 or 60 of them with these little attractive clusters, is that enough to increase the concentration of the span and the self and the other proteins to repress the expression here? So that's, I can say much more about that, but that's actually a very subtle point. You know, when you think about a nucleation cluster, A nucleation cluster, you think of sort of an attractive site for these particles. So, if you want to solve for the distribution, you would see a peak, right? And so that would be your cloud. But in steady state, right, if you use a deterministic model, the on rate on a nucleation site, on a nucleus, the protein nucleus, the on rate and the off rate are matched, right? For a cluster to stay at a stable size. At a stable size. So you'd expect actually there'd be no flux, and you'd have kind of a uniform distribution outside the cloud. So right now, what we're trying to do is higher resolution images and try to get a picture of what are the properties of this cloud, right? How fuzzy is it? How big is it? What's the extent? It's hard to image because the concentrations are low, lower, right, outside the clusters. But we have some models working. But we have some models working on that. So that's it for this story. How much time do I have? I would say you could go to 120-ish. How do the people in the room feel? Is that okay? Yes, I think so. Okay, I have another, right? So this is another. Sorry, this was Eastern time. Yeah, 20 over the hour. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over the hour. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. I got it. Yeah. Okay. So, no, I'll be quick. I'll be quick. So, this is this is anyway, there's more to the story, but I just wanted, you know, since it's nearing the end, there's just some food for thought. And it really relates to a lot of the previous talks in this conference, which is very nice. At least the technology to address these kind of problems. So, the other problem, which is a little less Problem which is a little less related to cell mechanics, but it's also looking at cell populations, different cell populations. And this is a model for structured populations of HIV integration sites. So this is, yeah, I think I could, in this audience, I can go through this very quickly. So you've got HIV, this life cycle, and a successful infection would be the integration of the HIV. Be the integration of the HIV genome into the host cell genome. Okay, now, so this would be it. The typical model is to look at the populations of T cells that are infected, not infected, populations of the virus, and then there are, you know, these are the standard mass action HIV models within host HIV models. So, but of course, in the modern era with all this relatively easy sequencing, this is. This is ART, right? So, one of the questions is, of course, you apply ART, antiviral therapy. You knock down the viral load to nearly undetectable limits. But if you cease it, there's viral rebound and you're never really cured. So, the idea is that there's some latently infected cells or cells that are resting, that don't die, that don't produce HIV. That don't produce HIV and are sort of quiescent. And they sit there and they can be awoken to produce HIV once the art is ceased, if it is ceased. Okay, but these latent cells, now one wanted to look at whether, you know, there's a question, how much do they proliferate, right? Even though they're kind of quiet, they're latent or quiescent, or quiescent in quotes, they're not producing viruses, but they're not. They're not producing viruses, but they're not dying, but they can proliferate. So, the difference of the proliferation versus new infection is the HIV integration site. So, if a virus, if a cell produces virus that infects another cell, the integration site is randomly, you know, more or less randomly distributed. The genome of the HRV is much shorter than the human genome, so it randomly just inserts itself somewhere. So, the site location will be different. So, the site location will be different. But if this cell replicates, right, like in this case, then everything is copied and you get the same integration site. So, one can take samples from patients to look at the distribution of integration sites. And this is the, here's some data. This is years after ART. These patients are still on ART. And you see, some of these patients just have one cell with that integration site. These are ranked, right? These are the most. site. These are ranked, right? These are the most abundant clones, second most abundant, third most abundant, et cetera. These are the most abundant clones ordered like this. So these patients have only, they only have one clone that has two cells. So in the sample of blood that was taken, they only found two cells with the same integration site. So that means that cell, you know, roughly, let's say, divided once. Roughly, let's say divided once, the original infected cell, and then these didn't, right? So you have this data, you can see it's very variable. There's no pattern in time. So the question was how to even begin to model this. And what we came up with, so these are the clones across different time points for different patients. Okay, so I'm going to. Okay, so the uh so how do you even model this? So the idea is to uh this is a standard HIV within-host HIV model, right? You have the uninfected cells, this is a vector of cells, different cell types. They get infected, they become, the genome is inserted. This activated cells produce virus that go on to infect other cells, but then they can transition into resting cells or they can be lately infected T cells that can brew. Latently infected T cells that can proliferate. So that, you know, you can have a vector of cells uninfected and a vector of infected cells. And the model would be, this is, again, this is the standard mass action within a host HIV model. So these are for the uninfected cells, right? They decrease by getting infections. There's a growth matrix for them. There's thymic output, right? The T cells are made by the thymus. The T cells are made by the thymus, let's say, or produced. So, what about the infected cells? So, it turns out the infected cells, we can use a structured population model, an age-dependent model. So, the age here is the age of that clone, right? So it is the cells that have the same integration site, have the same age, because we're assuming that every infection gives you a new. Gives you a new integration site. That's probably quite a good approximation. So it simply turns out to be this McKendrick type equation. These are vectors. And then these cells, these infected cells, can produce virus. And this is the virus concentration. And that virus concentration goes back into here. So in a model like this, So, in a model like this, what we can do, so you can solve it by the method of characteristics. So, here's a schematic. These are infection events, and the three different colors are three different types of cells that got infected. Let's say, let's say here's an infection event. This is the time course. This is the viral load. Here's you applied art, and maybe here you ceased art. And these are the trees. And corresponding to that are the characteristics. Of the characteristics of that age-structured model. So each characteristic now has three possible species that can interconvert. And you just want to find the species that exists past the start of ART, right? And let's say it's N3. These are the quiescent cells or the latently infected cells that don't die. And then if you stop ART, these will recover, they'll come back up. And then you can measure. back up and then you can measure you can measure their their abundances um so right so there you know the problem is kind of part of this problem is linear part of it is non-linear you've solved the non-linear part put it into the to the boundary and initial conditions and you can solve this using method of characteristics for each of the different sections before and after art these are matrix exponentials so it's it's sort of quasi analytic and it turns out And it turns out we still can't compare with the clone abundances because those are discrete. So in order to discretize it, we have to integrate a period and time which corresponds to roughly one new cell being infected. So we take these slivers, integrate that, and then we can. So that's this. Let me just finish up. This. Let me just finish up, and we can try to fit to the data. These are the data. Sorry, this is a model, the data I showed a few slides back. These are the clone abundances. And we can look at different growth rate functions. So we're exploring these different growth rate functions. And this growth rate function you see here is these lines mean that it's higher value, so it has an effective growth rate. So, it has an effective growth rate. These are bursts. So, even though it's an ODE model, we can include bursts by putting in a stochastic growth rate function. So, these are when T cells get activated, when you have sort of antigen presentation and you get a flu or something, right? They will give you bursts of proliferation, and these proliferation events are what we hypothesize to be causing the abundance. Causing the abundances in some of these patients back here. In some of these patients back here, right? And then these didn't have any proliferation events. So I'm out of time. So let me just close. Yeah, so these are different models that we're trying, and we still have to do the fit. So in this case, So, in this case, we looked at populations of different viral integration sites in the context of HIV infection. So, that's it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any questions? Perhaps first from Zoom participants. I see Jay's hand. Can I go? You can go ahead. Okay, good. I have a question about the potential that you estimated from your tracks, which is really cool. Is there any chance there's an upper limit on the density that you can track, that you can recognize? In the video. An upper density? An upper limit on the density, how dense you can resolve tracks in the foci. You mean if different foci overlap, you know, if they sort of crowd on each other? Yeah, yeah, they tend. Yeah, yeah, they can. Yeah, no, they're fairly well separated, even though you can't tell it here because we put in the fiduciary marketer here. But they never, so, okay. So how much their spacing is, let's see. Yeah, I guess around here they can start right around half a micron is where they would kind of start overlap. Would kind of start overlap, but we just track one at a time. We just assumed they were all independent, of course. Okay. But yeah, I mean, probably not, right? Okay, thanks. Hey, I have a question too. Hey, Tom. Yeah, hey. This is Jeff. Hey, on the on the HIV market. On the HIV model, I didn't completely follow. So do you have like the nonlinear part is basically running as a nonlinear differential equation and then it's driving these individual linear trajectories where you can solve with method of characteristics. Hold on, hold on. Here. Yeah. So these are, this is the vector of infected cells. And this is the age. And the age is measured by when the founder. When the founder cell was first infected. Right, but these are independent lineages. Like you track, in principle, these are independent things in the thing. Yeah, okay. Yes, yes. I'll send you a link. Okay, thanks. Okay, okay, yeah. But they, but some of these will generate virus, and then the virus goes back to infect the uninfected cells. So that determines the intensity, the rate. Determines the intensity, the rate of new generation of new found new lineages. Yes. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. So you, but you still get your sort of viral dynamics code, which you plop at in red, I guess. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You still get, you still get the, so, so, yeah. So if this were given, let's say, then it would be a trivial, this would be just a fully analytic solution. If V and the number of uninfected cells. The number of uninfected cells are given. So, if you can measure the viral load in time and you can measure the uninfected cell abundance, right, of the different types. Then you just take this and plug it into this. And this is exact. But you can argue that since it's a very small fraction of cells that go latent, that you could argue that That most of the cells doesn't really matter what integration site they have because they're going to die anyway. So it's only a few of them that kind of get selected to go into the light. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, that, that, yeah, that appears to be, yes, exactly. Cool. Thanks, Tom. Good. Thanks. Yeah. Any other questions? If not, let's thank Tom again. Thank you for a nice talk. Thank you. All right. So we're ready for the next speaker. Whenever you want to share your slide, we have Carlos Floyd.
