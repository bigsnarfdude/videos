Yeah. It's been a great week. I'd like to thank the organizers, Howe and Harold, for inviting me. I'll be talking about the rough Euler-Poincoura equations theory and calibration. This is joint with Dan Cursan, Daryl Holm, and Torsten Nelson. So I'll start with a bit of motivation, and then I'll talk about the variational principle. I'll take a specific, I'll talk about Specific, I'll talk about the rough incompressible oil system. I'll talk about the calibration problem, which I've not solved, and then I'll simplify and talk about just the estimation of a noise coefficient for FBM-driven equations, and then I'll conclude. So, this is from a paper concerning stochastic parametrization of weather and climate models. And climate models. And I've taken some sentences, I could not write them better. So, despite the increase in computing power, the multi-scale nature of geophysical fluid dynamics implies that many physical processes can't be resolved for the foreseeable future. And there is an increasing need to develop parameterizations that adapt to different Adapt to different scales. And the paper that I'm referring to is about stochastic parametrizations, and they say that stochastic parametrizations are essential for first estimating uncertainty and then reducing model errors even in the mean prediction. And they talk also about triggering noise-induced regime transitions and Transitions and capturing the response to changes in external forcing. And they're already, for the MedOffice, they already use stochastic parametrizations. So, this is the motivation for my work and what I'm about to present. So, I'll start off with the decomposition. So, what you have is you can understand it as a rough path in the diffeomorphism group. Alternatively, you can just consider it as a flow of rough diffeomorphism. As a flow of rough diffeomorphisms, you have a smooth and time part, and then you have a rough part. U will be C alpha. I'm not going to go much into regularity except when I present the results on the actual PDE. So you have a geometric rough path, and then you have some smooth vector fields. What we'll do is, from a principle, derive the vector. Principle, derive an equation for this given that we know this. Afterwards, we ask the question: how can I actually determine psi and z? That's the calibration problem. But let's just, this is sort of the next thing I'll, oh, it's not working. So, here is a bit of motivation as to how you might get at that decomposition. So, let's just consider. So let's just consider a deterministic fluid flow. So this is the usual setup of deterministic fluid dynamics. And let's just decompose that diffeomorphism into a fluctuating and mean map. So far, I haven't really specified what they were. You don't see where fluctuating and mean come from. So if you take the derivative on both sides, and then you invert a matrix. And then you invert a matrix, you can see that you can get phi t epsilon satisfying this with some μx and some fluctuating vector field. Okay, so this you might start to think like that it looks a bit like deterministic homogenization. So here is where a big assumption can be made, where you can say, okay, let's suppose that there really is a scale decomposition. Let us suppose Let us suppose that there exist nice coefficients and an ergodic Y process Y, that those coefficients look like this, which means that I make a big assumption that says I fit the homogenization framework, for example, of what Shumei Li and Gehringer have presented on earlier this week. And then I say one hopes and expects that if everything is nice, That if everything is nice and you go into all those assumptions, that you might end up with something like this. So that's a motivation. It's a big assumption to assume that there is a separation of scales. There is no necessarily a reason why you'd have this, but at least it's a formal motivation as to how you might arise at that decomposition at the level of the fluid flow. Okay. So now I'll move on to the variational principle. To the variational principle. So, invected quantities for fluids include things like temperature, for example. And so, in the Euler-Point-Caré framework, we just assume that all the invected quantities of the fluid that are of physical interest lie in some space of tensor densities. There are many other things besides temperature, but that's just an example. And what constitutes advected quantities is well that they're pushed forward under. That they're pushed forward under the flow. And did I skip? Oh, okay. It's okay. So the point is that when you push forward via the flow, you can show that the dynamics of that satisfy a rough transport equation. And here, it's the lead derivative along a vector field. So if A was a scalar, then this would just be something like u dot grad A. More generally, dot grad A. More generally, it can be anything else. You can take the lead derivative. So this actually, a general result is that if you take a tensor density, then you can show that this is just basically an application of the rough chain rule to manifolds. It says that if you take the pullback, then the pullback along the flow satisfies this, and the push forward satisfies this. Satisfies this. And in particular, if I just push forward just something which didn't have any dynamics and was just tau naught, I arrive at the that I have as something which is infected. So this is the variational principle. So I'll just briefly give you a background, which I don't have in slides. Arnold, Vladimir Arnold, realized that you can derive That you can derive the fluid equations, the ideal fluid equations, from a variational principle where you treat the configuration manifold as the diffeomorphism group. And this was subsequently extended to derive other fluid equations, quasi-geostrophic and other things like this. So what you're looking at is what's called the Kleptsch variational. Is what's called the Kleptsch variational principle. So there are various ways to derive the fluid equations through a variational principle. So let's just look. We take a perturbation. You could think about this as taking the advected equations that you usually have in the deterministic case and taking a perturbation. And here, this is, these take values in the space of invective quantities, and this is a duality bracket. So there's a natural There's a natural candidate for A star. So, what you see is the duality bracket. What you see here as L, is you see here that vector field U, and you see the avected quantity. All the physics is embedded in the choice of that Lagrangian. And so, if we didn't have the rough fluid dynamics, if we didn't have the rough component, and we just took variations of this, we would arrive at the deterministic fluid equations. Arrive at the deterministic fluid equations. So we make a perturbation in this constraint, but leave the Lagrangian alone. And when I take variations, I take linear variations in u, linear variations in a, linear variations in lambda in their respective space, and I can characterize what the critical points are. And when you take the variations in u, you get what's called the momentum. The momentum The momentum lies in the dual of the vector fields. And if you don't have a Romanian metric, then there's a canonical dual. It's the space of one-form densities. The one-form eats up the vector field, and then the density component you have you can integrate over to give you a real number. So the momentum lies in the space of one-form densities, and you have here this might not look exactly like a fluid equation, but in the next slide, I'll do an example. But in the next slide, I'll do an example of the incompressible. And so you see here that the infected quantities come up on the right-hand side. So when you go to take delta L, delta A, you're also going to have to integrate by parts. And when you go to do that, you get this diamond operation, which in geometric mechanics is called a momentum map. There's this canonical one form on the tangent bundle, and from that you can get And from that, you can get this thing called a momentum map. It appears in geometric mechanics and physics everywhere. So these two equations are the equations of motion. This is just the adjoint variable. If you want, you could think about this as like a Pontryagin maximum principle type argument where you introduce the adjoint variable. Okay, so. Okay, so we have these equations, and as a result of the way we've defined the variational principle, you can get what's called a Calvin circulation theorem. So in the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are an alternative way to derive the equations, you have this Lagrangian. If there is a symmetry of the Lagrangian, then no other theorem says that there's going to be a symmetry. Neuther's theorem says that there's going to be a conserved quantity. And there's this relabeling symmetry, which is broken by the introduction of the advected quantities. If there were no advected quantities and we were incompressible, then the Kelvin circulation theorem, which I'll explain now, would just make that this derivative is equal to zero. So what you see here is the momentum density. So this is, you divide by the density, which is an invective variable, and you integrate over a loop. And you integrate over a loop, which is carried along by the flow. And so, this is, I mean, one of the fundamental aspects of fluid mechanics is this Kelvin circulation theorem. And you see here, you get this, the full rough flow appearing here, and then you get sort of like just the momentum appearing in the integrand. And I, yeah, so Kelvin had first derived the Kelvin circulation theorem for fluid dynamics. Circulation theorem for fluid dynamics, but the observation is actually once we have this variational viewpoint, we can see this just as an application of nodes there. So that's why their name is attached to it. So it basically says that if I relabel the initial points of the Lagrangian things by a fixed diffeomorphism, it's not going to change the Lagrangian. But this is broken when you have invective variables. Variables. Okay, so let's do an example. So let's just take the kinetic energy Lagrangian. So here we have u and we have our only effective variable is simply the density. And so this is just the usual kinetic energy and you could write this in this way, which might help you see that when you take the variation in u, you get just some You get just something which is u flat tensor with row dv. Now, why this thing? So, I'm imposing a constraint on you that it's divergence-free. So, when I go to characterize the dual of the divergence-free vector fields, I have to mod out by exact forms. So, the natural candidate for the dual is these one-form densities modded out by this relation. Densities modded out by this relation. Okay? And then delta L delta A is just this. And then you get this is your term that's going to appear on the right-hand side of the equation. Okay, so now it's working. So the equations that you get from the variational principle look very much like the Euler equations. If I removed this, I would have du/dt, I'd have the covariant derivative, and I'd Covariant derivative, and I'd have the pressure appearing on the right-hand side. Now, if I'm on the torus, so I've switched to the torus here, I have the option of modding out biharmonic forms. And this is useful because then you can go back between the vorticity and the velocity without having to worry about the constant. Like, think of how, whenever you're working on the torus and you don't want to have the constant, so you can apply Poincaré, that's the harmonic constant. So, that's what's appearing on the right-hand side. So that's what's appearing on the right-hand side. And here you see that the density just satisfies a continuity equation. If I now assume homogeneity, that the density is just constant, I arrive at the rough Euler system. And if you take the exterior derivative, so you can always rewrite this in terms of the lead derivative and absorb everything into the gradient of the pressure. Into the gradient of the pressure. So when you take the exterior derivative of a lead derivative, it commutes. And so you get exactly that the vorticity satisfies this transport-like looking equation where u is related by the inverse of the curl. Okay, so I'm not going to go into the solution theory for rough partial differential equations, but you can go and look on archive, and there's a series. On archive, and there's a series of papers where we study first the Navier-Stokes and then the Euler system. And so I'll walk you through this the statement of the result. So these can be made sense once you have a rough partial differential equation, you can iterate and get a Taylor expansion like a Davy-type expansion, and you can study the solution theory this way. And so what you have here is: I have an n-star, which is not the momentum. Have an n star, which is not the momentum. This is d over 2 plus 1. And I take m greater than d over 2 plus 1. And I look at the L2 Sybil of spaces. So where does this come from? What does this practically mean? It means if I have something in Wm2 where M is greater than the integer part of D over 2 plus 1, it means I have an embedding. And it means that the gradient of anything in that lies in L infinity. And that's actually where the... And that's actually where the condition comes from, and this is what's needed to get the solution theory. So, for all you in that space, these are mean-free as well, and xi, which are very regular, I'm not, it's quite regular that we need the xi's to be, then there exists some maximally extended solution, u, where what we have is what's called a Bialcato-Mino-Blow criteria. Bialcato minor blow-up criterion. And it says that you can extend your solution provided the L1 L infinity norm of the vorticity is integrable. Now, before you derive the Bialcato-Maido-Blow criterion, the first thing you might derive is just that the gradient of U in L infinity is L1 integrable. But this is, it looks weaker because the vorticity is just the curl of that. The vorticity is just the curl of that thing. So the Bial Kata-Maida blow-up criterion was sort of surprising because it says that the only way it can blow up is if the curl actually has this finite. And in the case of dimension two, if I go back to the vorticity equation, in dimension two, I can identify the vorticity with a scalar, which means that this satisfies a scalar transport equation. And both you and psi. And both u and psi are divergence-free. So we know all LP moments are finite. You can just integrate and find that out, which means that the L infinity norm of the vorticity is finite, which means by the global criterion, I can extend my solution. So I have global solutions of the 2D Euler system. Okay, so now we have a principle from which we get an RPD. We have a solution theory. Okay, can we actually do any computations? Okay, can we actually do any computations with this? So, this is sort of the next phase of the project. And let me just describe a strategy as to how you might try to calibrate these, the xi and the z. So the variational principle, it determines u given you know xi and z. So that's what, right, we have this equation for u if we know xi and z. If we know psi and z, then we can reconstruct the avected quantities. Okay, so one strategy that's been employed in the Brownian setting is you perform a direct numerical simulation to obtain the original flow. This is the original deterministic flow that I introduced before the homogenization. And then you have to choose some filtering operation to apply. To apply to that map, which gives you the slow-scale map. And then, once you have that, you have to be able to find the xi and z from it. So, this is almost like saying, okay, well, the problem is then, how do you find the parameters in the homogenization problem? And that has been a Has been studied for a while by Pavlovis and Stewart and various other people, and it's a non-trivial problem, even in the Brownian setting. And there's not much known, yeah. Sorry. So just to be clear, when you say calibration, the data is G, so to say. Yes, let's just assume that I have access to a simulator for the actual original dynamics. And then I can apply some operation to coordinate. Can apply some operation to coarsen it, and I want my rough equations to match that in some way. That's what I would think is a way to calibrate these models. And that's actually what was done by Dan, Darrell, and Colin Cotter, and Wei Pan. They've been working on this problem for the Brownian setting. And let me just say that when you actually go to simulate the rough partial differential equations, you want to do it. Equations, you want to do it perhaps at a coarse scale and just get the core scale dynamics, but you don't want time to be in the continuum. You also want a coarsen in time. Because if I have a large dimensional space RDE, then if I make time very small, that's very expensive. So if I start to course in time, there's reason to think that actually having something else other than Brownian motion. Having something else other than Brownian motion might actually help. And that's, but all of this needs to be verified in numerical experiments. That's the calibration problem. I'm involved in a few different approaches as to how to try to do this. One thing I was speaking about to how was like having a generative model. You could maybe try to take, for example, the deterministic equations, choose different initial conditions. Choose different initial conditions whose projection onto the fine grid is the same to create an ensemble and match that to the noise. For example, it could be fractional noise. So I don't have any results to show for this. But when I was speaking with Torsen about this problem and we've been working on it, we sort of asked a simpler question, which we couldn't find an answer in the literature. We asked: if I take a fractional Brownian motion and I look at its rough path lift, and I know H, how can I determine psi? No homogenization, just a much simpler problem. So, you don't observe V, you just observed? Yep, yes, yes, I should add that. You just observed X. So. So, and if this was a Brownian motion and psi k was constant or not, you would just take the quadratic variation. And suppose I observed it in continuous time. Let's not even discuss the problem where I have coarse times. Then I could take the quadratic variation and I would have a very simple way of beginning to estimate psi. So the first thing we thought is: okay, I'll just take the p-variation along the sequence. If I take the p-variation along the sequence and I choose the right p, then actually the p-variation of the fractional Brownian motion along a uniform partition is just ch times t. But that's the case only when I have one fractional Brownian motion. If I have multiple and I go to take that p-variation, then I don't get a very simple expression. I don't get a very simple expression. Is that clear? So then, and we started to do numerical experiments with this. So then the idea that I sort of, that Torsen and I spoke about was, well, can we take like a scale two variation and somehow mimic what happens in the Brownian setting, which we hadn't seen anywhere. So So we let me give a definition. I let pi be a sequence of partitions with vanishing mesh. I say x and z have finite alpha scaled covariation along pi if that exists in C01 and is a bounded variation. Then, I mean, the proof is quite simple. If I take the uniform sequence, I can prove. Sequence, I can prove that this scaled variation is just t and it's zero if they're not, these are into, okay, these are independent, the fractional Brownian motions. So then you have to make this result. Okay, in order for this to be useful, I have to be able to apply this to a rough differential equation. So I let x denote a solution of a rough differential equation. Of a rough differential equation and assume the driving path has finite alpha-scale variation along the sequence. Then, okay, there's a bit of a jump, but I can apply the rough chain rule and get f of xt b dot grad psi.grad f to get something scalar value, which gives me something else which looks very much like this, and then I can take its scaled variation, and I get exactly this. So once you have this result, if you know for the case of fractional Brownian notion what that is, then you get something that you can actually compute from only the observable. We have not done the nonlinear case. So what you do is, I mean, this is just the loss we came up with. We'd say, okay, take some admissible. Take some admissible class of F's which bring you down to a scalar. This you can compute, the alpha scale variation, where alpha is 1 minus 2h from the data. And you can also compute that. You can do this using, so this you compute from the data. For example, let x have one component for the moment. Let it be 1D. I'm just going to take f to be just that one component. I'm not going to introduce another f. I just take x. Going to introduce another f. I just take x, I compute it, scale of variation. I know that it should match this, where as long as I choose the right side. So the data that you start with is the problem. I give you one long trajectory of messages, or I give you independent samples from the voicing. No, one long sample data. One long sample. And that's the flu. One norm sample, and that's a flu, just one feast initial conditioning. Yep, one one solution. One solution to the flu. Yep, one solution. Then I can minimize this. The case, the very simple case, is just I fix some sort of basis of my vector fields and I have linear, linear in theta. And then, in which case, this is a linear system, and you can solve it. And this works. And you can solve it. And this works. I have experiments on Python, I can check that this works. And we're starting to work on the non-linear case. And are there any questions about this? Yeah. How stable is this when you have noisy observation? We've not done these experiments, but what's left is to do all of the experiments. And this I'm working on. Working on. There is, of course, in the finance context, there's a huge literature on basically the scalar version, I would say. Yes, and you know that it's not, it is very sensitive to this. Yes, but there are also methods which go beyond just the quadratic variation which improve the so right. Maybe we can talk about it after I present. After I present. So to conclude, I've reviewed the derivation of the Rough Euler-Poincaré equations from a variational principle. This gives us a way of, assume we have a decomposition, which can be motivated from deterministic homogenization if we assume there's a separation of scale. Then, in the specific case of the incompressible fluid flow, we arrive at the rough Euler-Point-Courier equation, the rough incompressible system. Then, using the theory of unbounded rough drivers, Using the theory of unbounded growth drivers, we've developed a solution theory for that PDE. I've discussed the calibration problem, which is ongoing work, and I've just given a very simpler, a much simpler problem to determine a noise coefficient. If I take a fractional Brownian motion, how could I find it? Not in the multi-scale setting. What's next is to do experiments with fluids. And this is something that I'm one of the even One of the even simpler problems, if we know that we can do this for finite-dimensional equations, let's just suppose we observed the actual rough fluid equations. I could use this to determine the size. So that's something we might do an experiment with, where we just assume we had observations from the rough fluid equation. In principle, I could use this to determine what the xi's were if I actually, if the path was a fractional Brownian motion. That doesn't tell us how to go from the deterministic. How to go from the deterministic equations to that, but at least it's sort of a step in that direction. And yeah, so I'll just present some references. That first slide, which talked about stochastic parametrizations, comes from this paper by Werner. The solution properties of the Euler equation were published in JFA as of this year. The variational principles paper was published in Advances in Mathematics. And there are the two papers by Shumei Li and her student. There are more you can go and look. And oh, that's an interesting paper that we can speak about after.
