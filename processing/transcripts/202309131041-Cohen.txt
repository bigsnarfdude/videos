Motivation for it is to try to address this grand challenge of printing 3D organs. And in particular, I'm working with this guy. This is Larry Banasser. What he's holding up for you is an ear. This is a replica of his daughter's ear. It's made up of collagen and other sort of biomolecules. And the idea is that if we want to print passive organs like this, we're already there. But the real question is: how do we start to print any? How do we start to print any tissue or organ? What about organs that have mechanical properties that are specific? And the kinds of things that I'm thinking about are the types of tissues that you see here, from cartilage, which I'll talk about today, to things like tendon. This is your inner vertebral disc. All of these tissues have very interesting structures associated with their collagen matrices, and the way that they're organized in the tissue gives them their unique properties. Tissue gives them their unique properties. Okay, so today I want to focus on articular cartilage. That's the cartilage that coats the long bones in your joints. And I want to think a little bit about how this tissue is organized and what sort of principles, what sort of physical principles can give us some guidance in understanding its function. So articular cartilage is awesome when it's healthy. We don't feel it. When it's healthy, we don't feel it, we can go about our days, but when it starts to get degraded, that's when things go bad for us, when we develop arthritis. And this is characterized by pain, joint mobility problems. It affects something like 46 million people in the United States alone. 25% of all visits to the doctor will be associated with cartilage in some joint or another. And it has an annual cost of about $120. Annual cost of about $128 billion to the economy. Okay, so it's a big problem, and if you can make even small progress in this problem, you can make a, there's a lot of financial motivation to do so. Okay, so what do we know about cartilage in terms of its structure? This is work now that's coming from very long ago, already in the 1920s, and more recently with the SEN. And more recently, with the SEMs in 2011. But the idea is the following: that if you take a look at cartilage from the surface down to the bone, it has sort of characteristic structures. So near the surface, the collagen fibers are arranged parallel to the surface. But as you go down to the bone, they're organized perpendicularly to the bone. And it's thought, or at least the paradigm up until we started working on this, was that it's this structure that gives cartilage its different. That gives cartilage its different mechanical properties. And in particular, different arrangements of the orientation of these fibers could help in things like shear or compressive properties, etc. Okay, so that is, you know, for example, people thought that the perpendicular fibers here resist compression, that the horizontal fibers here resist shear. And we wanted to start to think. We wanted to start to think about this sort of structure and the mechanical origins of this. And in particular, we wanted to pay attention to the surface properties, because it turns out that if you take a look at animals, all the way from mouse to human, even horses and elephants, the surface structure is the part that's preserved. So you can have very different thicknesses of the deep part of the cartilage. Of the deep part of the cartilage, but the surface is always the same. Top few hundred microns are preserved. Okay, so the question was: why is that, and what's so special about that region? So, when people looked at the mechanical properties of cartilage, initially they just sort of measured the whole thing in bulk, and they found that it has a modulus roughly like a rubber eraser. People did a little bit better in the 1960s, or in 2002, they Or in 2002, they cut the cartilage into three pieces, measured each part independently. And then in 1996, Schnegel started doing video recordings, but they were pretty low resolution, and we thought we could do better. And so we started making devices. This is a tissue deformation imaging stage that you can buy. We worked with Harris Scientific to make one, and you can buy it from them. And the idea is that you essentially have a little piezo that's driving one of these. Piezo that's driving one of these plates in an oscillatory fashion, and the other plate is connected to a force measurement device. And so you're essentially shearing the tissue, measuring the forces that it takes to shear the tissue, and because this thing is sitting in a solution, in a little bowl that can contain the solution, you can image from below with a confocal microscope. And typically, you're not imaging all the way through the depths of the tissue, but even the surface is aided. The surface is aided by imaging with the Confolo. So we stain the tissue with a dye, TTAF, which is an all-protein stain. We then photo bleach lines on there. And just from watching the lines, you can already tell that something super interesting is happening. This is the surface of the cartilage. The bone would be something like, you know, five of these images down that way. And what you're seeing is that these lines, as we shear the tissue back and forth, Lines, as we shear the tissue back and forth, are not staying parallel. They have this S shape. And that's telling you that right around here, you have a highly compliant region. If all the tissue was uniformly stiff, then these lines would simply tilt. The fact that you have some sort of bend in them tells you that there's a region in there that's highly compliant. And you can measure that. So if you So, if you know the strain, okay, the local strain associated with the tilts of those photobleach lines, and you know the forces, you can compute the modulus as a function of depth. And so that's what we've done here. And the nice thing about cartilage is that it's uniform in the plane here. So, the only dependence of the modulus is with depth. So, you can average over the plane. Okay, so when we do that. Plane. Okay, so when we do that, we find is that the modulus near this surface region, that's the part that's preserved in all the animals, is actually about an order of magnitude more compliant than the deep zone. So this part right here is much, much easier to shear than the other parts. You can also look at the stress versus strain curves. And if you plot the stress versus strain in this Lissajous curve for the deep zone, the red zone. For the deep zone, the red curve, you basically get a hook-in response. So, this curve is: you're going to get zero stress when you have zero strain, and that builds as you strain the tissue more. But if you take a look at the surface, you see an ellipse, and that tells you that the tissue is dissipating energy. This is like a work, a PV work diagram. And the idea here is that the bigger this circle, the more area it contains, the more energy is being dissipated per cycle. Dissipated per cycle. So when you think about cartilage, you think about it as a shock absorber, but it turns out that only this surface region here is doing any of the shock absorption. Okay, so this region is super important for cartilage function. We've shown this both for shear. We have other data that shows it also for impact. This is the region that's protecting your tissue. And that's important practice. That's important practically because there are procedures called debridement where the doctors will go in, and because cartilage is cartilage is cartilage, you can just shave off the surface and then everything is all good. But when you do that with rabbit cartilage, shave off the surface, now all these little black dots, which used to be chondrocytes, the cells that are in cartilage, are gone after a few weeks. That tells you that they're all being exposed to very high strains and therefore dying. High strains and therefore dying because the tissue is no longer as protective as it used to be. Okay, so this is at least one practical consequence. Okay, so how does cartilage manage to change its modulus by so much? What's going on that differentiates the surface from the deep zone? And this is where we wanted to try to investigate things. And so, in general, the paradigm. Paradigm is that this polymer orientation determines the mechanics. Remember, the polymer orientation near the surface is horizontal, and the stuff near the bone is perpendicular to the surface. And so maybe that's what's controlling things. And so we started measuring the properties of these polymers and trying to correlate them to the stresses and the moduli. So, in particular, you can use cross-polarizers to look for polymer orientation. Polymer orientation. And indeed, we see that near the surface you have a very highly aligned polymer collagen matrix, and that's not nearly as aligned when you go deeper into the tissue. You can also look at the orientation at the polarization index. That's how much of the material is aligned. And when we did these measurements, indeed what we saw that both the polarization index and the orientation angle had little peaks. Had little peaks up here. The problem is that this only happened over the first 100 microns. And that actually, if you remember, the modulus decrease, the compliance in the modulus, that lasted for the first 500 night points. So when we ended up trying to correlate the two, the modulus with the polarization index, or even the angle of the fibers, we got very poor correlation. Poor correlation. So that paradigm is not right. There's something different going on. And we wanted to figure out what it was. And so now I'm going to just tell you what the strategy is for determining what's happening. So cartilage is a tissue that's primarily controlled by its extracellular matrix. And in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, there's two components that are important: collagen and agracin, which is a type of proteoglycan. Type of proteoblycat. The agrekins are charged brush molecules that are attached to hyaluronic acid chains and they're like a secondary intercalating network inside of the collagen network. Because they're so charged, they draw in water and they tend to swell the collagen network. And so the idea is that if we want to develop a framework for understanding the shear properties, we might want to do something like this. Maybe we would measure. Maybe we would measure the concentration of agricultan and collagen as a function of depth in the tissue. And the nice thing is that cartilage already has a nice variation of those molecules, and so you might get some sort of data smattering that looks like that. The next thing you might do is try to measure or associate with that the modulus as a function of depth. So each one of these points here gets a modulus attached to it, and now you have a three-dimensional data set. To it, and now you have a three-dimensional data set that tells you what the modulus is as a function of the concentration of both aggregant and collagen. You could also put in enzymes that degrade the aggregant. Now what you do is generate a data set where the aggregant concentration is zero and the collagen concentration is variable. And so then you could associate with those a modulus. Now you'd have two different curves in 3D that would constrain some sort of model that you would build. And then the idea. Would build. And then the idea is you find a model that is constrained by those curves. So that's the idea. And the question is: can we do that? So the first thing we have to do is create a measurement framework. So the idea is that you take little plugs from condyles of cows. The students really like these experiments. They get steak for dinner every Thursday. You essentially dissect out the little plugs. Little plugs. We're going to either degrade those plugs so that we get rid of the aggregant, or we keep them undegraded. You bisect the plugs into two halves. One half goes into measurement of the constituents. Okay, so measuring the collagen and the aggregate. The other half goes into our mechanical measurements. And then you do some calibrations and compare the two, and you should have the ability to see what the concentrations of the constituents are. Concentrations of the constituents are, and what the measurements of the mechanics are. Okay, so here's an example. This is a histology slide of a piece of cartilage. This is again the surface all the way to the bone. Well, maybe not quite all the way to the bone. What we're standing for here is agrekin. Agrecan is the proteoplycan molecule with the bottle brush, and you can see that it's more red here. There's a higher concentration here than here. But that's not very quantitative. Very quantitative. So let's do FTIRI. So we're going to take the Fourier series of the infrared image and we're going to then look at the absorbance as a function of the wave number. And we can then calibrate separately what pure collagen looks like in the signal and pure agrekin looks like. And then we add these two with appropriate coefficients and then we can get a fit for our spectrum. Fit for our spectrum, and that allows us to figure out how much of one and how much of the other we have. Okay, so that's how we do the concentrations. If we degrade the aggregant, you can see that this part is no longer dyed red. That's because we've removed the agrekin from there. And so if we look at this little section of the tissue, we have zero agrekin added to the collagen in order to make up the signal in that region. Okay, so far so good. Great. Great. Now I have the composition versus depth. And what we find is that the collagen is basically unaffected by our degradation. The blue, which is the normal tissue, is the same as the red, which is the degraded tissue. But when I take a look at the aggregant, now I have the red completely down at zero. I've completely removed all the aggregant as compared to the blue. Why is it so sharp? Because this is the front that the enzymes degraded up until. Enzymes degraded up until. So everything over here is the same because there's no enzymatic degradation. And so now I have these two curves: one for the undegraded tissue, okay, the blue dots from here and here. You can see that both of them have depth dependencies. You go from low at the surface to high deep near the bone. Same thing for the aggregate, low at the surface, high deep near the bone. That's why this is basically a diagonal on this xy plot. On this XY plot. And I have the degraded collagen. I'm only going to take the data up to here. Okay, and so that's what I'm plotting over here. Next, I try to do the measurements of the modulus. And so we're going to do very slight oscillations, so small amplitude oscillations. We're also going to be sure not to compress the tissue. So there's some tricks that we had to do there, but basically we're just like gently probing the tissue and it's Gently probing the tissue in its uncompressed state. And by looking at the deformations of the photobleach lines, we can back out the moduli. And so now we have the shear modulus as a function of depth for the healthy tissue, which is the blue, and the degraded tissue, which is the red. And you can see differences between the two curves in the region where we degraded the tissue. So that allows us to get the modulus as a function of, for example, the column. As a function of, for example, the collagen concentration. And now we can build up these two curves, okay, that we promised you in the very beginning. So far, so good. All right, good. Next. Technically, you bleach the stripes, but there's a lot of structure in your images. Do you really need those stripes? Can't you just do the stripe field? You can, and that works too. But give you more data. Not really. So we've done both like. So we've done both like PIV, you know, tracking of the cells, and sometimes it gets confused. Anyway, they're both comparable. So I don't think that there's any, you know, the stripes are... Anyway, they're comparable. I don't think there's any point in defending one or the other. Okay, so the question is, how do we build a model? And the thing that I want to sort of point out to you is that when we take a look at the shear modulus, it's varying by over. Modulus, it's varying by over an order of magnitude. But when I take a look at the collagen concentration, it's only changing by less than a factor of two. So very small changes in the concentration of the collagen can give you massive changes in the modules. And to us, that reminded us of phase transitions. Okay, this is exactly what happens when you're near, for example, a critical point. Example, a critical point. And phase transitions in biology have a nice distinguished history. Let me just remind you that critical points sit at the end of first-order phase transitions in thermodynamic systems. And people have shown that these kinds of analyses that you are used to from your stat-mech thermodynamics can be then transported over into non-equilibrium systems like biological membranes, in this case, cell membranes. Case cell membranes that were analyzed by Sarah Beach and Sarah Keller. And the one that we're going to use for the purposes of the cartilage is the one that Fred studied, which is rigidity percolation. And maybe Mumita told you a little bit about this in her talk. And so the idea here is that if you take a look at the modulus as a function of some bond occupation probability on a lattice here, there's going to be a There's going to be a minimum bond occupation probability below which the system is not percolated. And therefore, if you apply a force to one side of the system, it doesn't get translated to the other. But as you go across this threshold, you start connecting up these regions, and then the modulus shoots up. And because the modulus shoots up from zero to something finite, you can get infinite orders of magnitude. You can get infinite orders of magnitude for very small changes in concentration. So that's the idea. So, again, what we're going to say is that we have some sort of rigidity percolation phase transition. And if we start with a dilute network, there's no percolating clusters. It's floppy. And as we start adding bonds to the network, you start getting rigid clusters which can transfer forces. The system no longer is floppy. Now you start to have... Now you start to have a modulus associated with it. And as we increase the number of bonds, eventually things sort of saturate, the system is fully percolated, and the modulus plateaus to its asymptotic value when the lattice is completely full. So in terms of our picture, the idea is that if you take a look at the lattice for points up here, you have a nearly fully percolated lattice. Fully percolated lattice. Okay, so that's deep in the tissue. But if you look near the surface, then you're just at this threshold where you have percolated, but you're still in this sort of early part of the phase, above the phase transition. What are the units for the concentration? The units for concentration are, ah, that's a good point. They're probably like milligram per milliliter, but I have to check. But still, really odd. 100 milligrams per million. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it's. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because in tissue, they're much higher than anything reconstituted. So that's because in tissue you get bundles of collagen, and they're much thicker, and they're much denser than what we know how to make. And so is it, are they short? I mean, is there some structural way you could rationalize that they're not percolated at 100, for example? Yeah, I mean, everything here is percolated. So the Is percolated, so the idea is that you're just sitting a little bit above the phase transition versus very far from the phase transition. So you think the percolation threshold is well below? Yeah, it would be somewhere here. I don't know if it's well below, but it's somewhere over here. Okay, but the tissue is intact. Even the surface part of the tissue doesn't fall apart. Okay? But percolation depends on connectivity, not concentration or action. That's correct. So you can make a percolated That's correct. So you can make a percolated network. Well, again, it depends on the structure. So if I can make fibrils and you know, collagen has all these hierarchical structures, so you can jam a huge density of material into these. The third there is a 10% high. That's a 10% volume production. Is that actually? I have to see. I have to look at what the actual units are. So I want to. So, I want to make sure that I got that right. But they're not really isotropic, either, are they? I mean, they're not all along. I mean, they're not randomly distributed a couple of times. Well, it depends. Near the surface, you have aligned fibers. Near the deeper parts of the tissue, they're much more isotropic, or they're perpendicular. In the middle, they're isotropic. So, depending on where you look, this model is basically considers a nearly isotropic system. Nearly isotropic system, and we're just thinking about concentration rather than the alignment. The alignment is going to come into play when you start shearing the network and getting it sort of aligned. If they were aligned and short, wouldn't that make them less percolated? Yeah, depending on how they're connected. But one of the mysteries is it's not really terribly well understood how they're all connected. Connectivities that are well understood. Yeah, but um uh empirically can you just rotate the thing 90 degrees and do the measurements and that's how no no we did the polarization like like testing some chemical properties if you if you rotate at 90 degrees if there's some way back direction of the cartilage yeah yeah yeah um there what's interesting is that you're mostly going to be dominated by the deep zone because anything that the surface zone Anything that the surface zone does is going to be, you know, like it's not going to resist the deep part. But you can still ask if the deep zone isn't the same if you do it, you know. Yeah, yeah. So you can do things like cut off the surface, and then the deep zone is to first, for small amplitude oscillations is the same. So I cool alignment. How does the alignment affect this as well, right? So you know you have like the tangible. I'll get to alignment in a second. I'll get to alignment in a second. Let me tell you how I think about that once I establish this. I think they're also thinking about the connection with concentration. One thought is that one does not actually know what is really the subset of the structure that it's responsible for. I mean, it can be proportional to concentration, but the amount three that would correspond would be a sumset in that result. Yes, that's true too. So that would be another complication. Okay. So let me keep going. So now the idea is that if you have the aggregate molecules in there, you would have some sort of background gel that is further connecting the collagen fibers. Okay, and so in this particular case, we model the agreken as a uniform gel. You could model it as a secondary network. It has a secondary network that connects to the first network, but here it's just a uniform gel. And if we do that, then we can fit these data with this blue line. Okay? And so now you have a system where you have a rigidity percolation transition from the primary collagen network reinforced by a uniform background gel, whose properties primarily are due to the concentration of the aggregate molecules. There's other things in there, like hyaluronic acid concentrations, etc. Like hyaluronic acid concentrations and stuff like that. And you can fit both of these curves. And now the idea is that because we can fit both of these curves, we can also fit all the stuff in between. And we've also fit other people's data at this point as well. Okay, so this is the surface that comes in. And now I want to talk a little bit about the implications of this surface. So first of all, this surface is highly non-linear. That means that if I go and I reduce the concentration of collagen, I can change. Concentration of collagen, I can change the modulus by a factor of two. If I go and reduce the concentration of agricin, I can change the modulus by a factor of two. But if I do collagen and then agrekin, I fall into this deep hole and I start decreasing by a factor of 10. So it's highly non-linear and it depends on the pathways along these surfaces. And so now you can start to think about all of the different things that are going into our model. So the cartilage properties that we might care about are like the collagen properties, the About are like the collagen properties, the aggregate concentration, hyaluronic acid, collagen concentration, and then these are the parameters in our model. And Jonathan actually had a super critical role to play in this. What we did was we tried to measure most of these things, pin them to measurements from the literature. Okay, so we did as best as we could to eliminate these, and I think we had like two or three parameters that were slowed. And of course, there's other things that we're going to have to care about, and these might be important for future developments of more complicated models. But okay, so we created this model. We can predict mechanics during pathways of disease. So for example, you might think of degradation of cartilage as following different pathways along the surface. And so being able to measure where your collagen, where your cartilage mechanics are using something Mechanics are using something like a non-invasive MRI measurement, where now you're replacing the collagen and agricultan concentrations with T1 rho and T2 star measurements, for example, might give you an idea of where your cartilage is sitting at different points in its depth and whether or not there's something that you should do to go in and fix it or you should leave it alone. Okay, so that's one implication for having such a surface. A second thing is that this. The second thing is that this is an example of active tuning by the tissue. And what I mean by that is that the tissue seems to be sitting in the primary network right at, right above the, at least in the surface, right above the rigidity transition. And what it's doing is it's using the aggregant network to zoom you up and down that rigidity transition. And that's important because collagen reorganization in tissues takes months to years. Takes months to years. It's a very slow process. Whereas aggregant is something that can be changed over a time of days. And so what it's doing is it's sort of this active tuning of the mechanical properties, probably in response to mechanical forces that the cells are feeling from the network. I want to say one more minute on cartilage function. So here's some early measurements that we had. In this particular case, That we had. In this particular case, I'm looking at the modulus as a function of depth. Here again is that deep, that surface region. And what happens when we strain the cartilage is that you get strain stiffening of the surface region, but the deep zone doesn't stiffen very much at all. And so the idea that we have here is that if you're near the rigidity transition, as you start to strain by large amounts, not linear anymore, but now by large amounts. But now by large amounts, you have an alignment of your fibers, of your collagen fibers, and eventually as they align, you start to get higher modules because of that alignment. And that's stuff that Fred has seen before. Here's an idea of what it might look like in the simulation lattice. You pull on these two threads, this thing rotates, and now you start to activate all of your stretching forces. So you go from bending to stretching. And in And in Fred's paper, they did a nice job of trying to understand the sort of implications of stretching versus bending in this rigidity transition. The upshot that I want to focus on is that if you eliminate all of the bending interactions, the critical point that's sort of underlying all the physics is the one associated with stretching interactions. And the idea then is that as you go from a system that is un System that is unstretched to one that is stretched, you can essentially move this line over. So you can start to get rigidity at lower bond probability numbers. And if you're sitting here, right, at some value that's associated with a modulus that's low, if I start to stretch the system, I move from this curve to being controlled by that curve. Controlled by that curve. And that's sort of the way that you get the strain stiffening. And without going into too much of the background, this is the way that I'm thinking about the problem, is that you have critical points that are associated with each of these different lattices. In the isotropic case, you might be sitting near one critical point, and as you start to stretch the lattice, you may be moving to a different critical point, and whether that critical point is going to be a point. Critical point and whether that critical point has a just a different bond occupation probability threshold or whether or not it actually has different power laws is an interesting thing for understanding the underlying physics. If it's different power laws, it means that it's a different universality class. And then you start to get something called crossover scaling between critical points, which is something that is done quite often in the thermodynamics literature. And we showed Thermodynamics literature, and we showed is appropriate for shear thickening suspensions. So, again, this is Fred's paper, and the idea is that if you're sitting here, even if you're not percolate, even if stretching alone doesn't percolate you, as you start to strain the tissue, you go from floppy to rigid. So, our question is: can I just think of that as an orientation? Okay, of the shear as an orientation taking you from one critical point to another. To another. And very briefly, we've done some simulations on this where we've gone from isotrophic to oriented lattices and minimized the energy to calculate the moduli. And then when we plot the modulus as a function of P minus Pc, we get this critical scaling exponent F. In the isotropic lattice, we get 1.6. That's pretty close to Fred's 1.45. And when we start having oriented lattices, Having oriented lattices, this F moves to a much different value. And so we think that we're seeing crossover scaling associated with orientation of the network. Okay, so that's the story that I wanted to tell. I think that this idea of rigidity percolation is also going to be important for many of these other tissues. And it's this interesting sort of way of thinking about how. About how function is organized in biological tissues, maybe even in epithelial cells and things like that, to start thinking about what are the properties associated with one critical point, how are they changed when the system moves to a different critical point, how does the cell and the tissue organize those transitions, either as a function of what you're doing to it, or chemically, it could be just changing the sort of properties of the response in order to. That responds in order to change the way that that tissue responds more globally and develops more globally. And then the last thing that I'll say is that this ability to constitute something right above the rigidity threshold and then have the supporting network drive you up that transition is a super powerful idea for printing organs. One of the main problems in printing organs is that if you want to put cells inside, you can't make the network too dense. Make the network too dense, otherwise, the nutrients don't get to the cells. If the network is too dense, then the cells are starved, etc. So, what if we build these organs at just above the rigidity percolation transition and then start putting in the cells that can tune that network by producing the proteoglycans rapidly? So, that's sort of the gestalt of what I wanted to say today. All right, thanks. Thanks. Sorry, these are all the people who did it. Let me just point out: Mumita and Jonathan were responsible for the theory, and the stuff on the orientation was done with a very talented undergraduate in Billy. Yeah. Very intriguing. I can't quite know that people have ideas. One of the demise of this is that it's so sensitive so that it's how quick do you maintain the fastness of this transition. My guess is probably a lot to do with the mechanics itself. Yeah, the critical points are only sensitive if you're sitting at the critical point. So if you can maintain a distance from the critical point, then everything is fine. And so for example, in the cell membrane world, So, for example, in the cell membrane work, two of the proteins are supposed to have these critical point sort of phase separations, but there's 21 other lipids that are on that surface that are controlling how far away you are from that critical point. And the same thing could be true here. The cells, just due to chemical responses from mechanic, could be supplying you with more collagen, less collagen, in order to put you some distance from the critical point. So none of this depends on being exactly. So, none of this depends on being exactly at the critical point. Nevertheless, as we've learned from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, the critical points control not just that point, but the whole sort of physics of what's happening around them. And that's the essence of what we're trying to state. My second point, second question is, do you see more about critical slowdown? Do we see critical slowdown? I can't. I can't. We're not observing the tissue as it's forming. Okay, so we're not doing any morphogenesis studies. We just get the tissue once it's formed. So I don't know that I can answer anything about that and how it sort of develops during the formation of the networks. We're just characterizing the result. But I guess the array of children. Yeah, I mean if you have ideas of a measurement that I can make to test for those concepts, I'd be happy to talk. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. I'm just going to ask everybody about salt today. I had always understood that cartilage mechanics were partially due to the osmotic pressure of the counter islands, a highly negatively charged thing. Negatively charged. Yeah. And so does that play any role? Yeah, sure. So when you, the proteoglycans are highly charged molecules. And so they draw in water. And that swells the collagen network. And in fact, that swelling of the collagen network is important for understanding the behavior under compression, which Jonathan will talk about on Friday. And so I left it out of here. But the basic idea is that if you have a swollen network, That if you have a swollen network and you compress it, then you're going to be driving the water out. The collagen fibers become more compliant. And depending on whether or not you're in this region that's near the phase transition or the region that's highly cross-linked and far away from the phase transition, you're going to get a different response. And so we have predictions for that based on Jonathan's work, and we're now testing those predictions out. So it's a great question, and it's the Great question, and it's the subject of our next study. Yeah. I have a very naive question. How do we talk about the controls? What do they do? Do they synthesize the polymers? Yeah, unfortunately for you and maybe even for me, there aren't very many left. But in the beginning, what they do is they will control things like collagen production, they will control aggregant production, and the aggregant production. Production and the aggregant production they control very rapidly. So the cells are vital for measuring through mechanotransduction pathways that we're also studying what's happening to the tissue globally. They're doing signaling between them, et cetera, to sort of organize the response of the tissue collectively. But they're not, if you take the chondrocytes out, the mechanics are unchanged. So they're not directly influenced. So, they're not directly influencing the mechanics, they're influencing the production of all the extracellular matrix components that make up the mechanics. So, you generate tissue by introducing stem cells and I told that to my doctor only told me I was crazy. Well, no, I mean so what happens when they when they when you have a damaged piece of cartridge, they'll take some of it out, and then they will seed it with And then they will seed it with chondrocytes and try to regrow the tissue. But those are, you know, those implants provide beautiful images and totally crappy mechanics. So at the end, the problem with almost all currently available replacements is that they don't match the mechanics of the native cartilage that's already there. And that's a recipe for disaster, because if you don't match the mechanics, you get... Because if you don't match the mechanics, you get peel off when you start using the tissue. And this is why we're so interested in understanding the depth dependence and recreating it in a printed organ, printed piece of cartilage. So we're working on it.
