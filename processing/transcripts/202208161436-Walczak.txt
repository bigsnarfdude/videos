I'm going to speak about colouring older graphs. So let me start with some introduction about colouring graphs with excluded structures. So the basic definition and the notation. The chi will be the chromatic number of the graph, so the minimum number of colors which are necessary. Which are necessary to colour the graph properly. And whichever type of graphs I'm considering: undirected graphs, directed graphs, or ordered graphs, the colouring, I would always mean the proper colouring, right? Just the ordinary proper colour. No other colourings will be considered here. Okay? So in both in the Both in the topics of colouring or in external graph theory and so on, one often considers classes of graphs which are free of some structures. So, for instance, we fix some graph H and consider graphs which exclude H either as subgraphs or as induced subgraphs. So, the next motivation, the next definition is motivated by this. By this, so I will say that the graph H is a chi-bounding if, and now there are two versions of this definition, depending on whether we consider induced or non-induced structures. So in the non-induced sense, that means that non-induced H3 graphs H3 graphs have bounded chromatic number. So there is some absolute constant that bounds the chromatic number for every graph which excludes H as a non-induced subgraph. And in the induced sense, so induced chi-bounding, which means Induced chi bounding, which means that induced H3 graphs form a chi bounded class of graphs. So that means that there is a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers such that for every H3 in H3, induced H3 graph. H3 graph, graph G, the chromatic number of G is bounded by that function of the peak number of G. Okay, so if we are excluding some graph H, which is not a complete graph, if we are excluding it as an induced subgraph, then in order to bound the chromatic number, we also need to exclude large clicks, because otherwise a complete graph will be Because otherwise, a complete graph will be free of age and will have a bit of a large chromatic L. Okay, so what can we say about these two terms, so our classification, which graphs are kind bounding and which are not, in those two settings, induced and non-induced. So, first of all, there is this famous result by Erdas that there exist graphs with arbitrarily large girls and arbitrarily large probabilities. And the arbitrary large chromatic number. So, this implies that if H has a cycle, then H is not chi-bounding in any of these two senses. Okay, by the way, observe that if a graph is non-induced, sorry, if a graph is induced chi-bounding, that it is. induced chi bounding that it is also non-induced chi bounding. So the being induced chi bounding is something stronger. Okay, so this follows from Ergesch's result. And so now let's consider the converse of this statement. So let's consider the following statement that if H, I mean not the converse, but say Say that if H has no cycle, then I would like to say that H is hydrogen. And now there are these two cases, the non-induced case and the induced case. So in the non-induced case, this is easy. This is true and This is true and it is easy to see. So we can say that if a graph excludes some forest as a non-induced subgraph, then it will have bounded average degree and therefore the chromatic number will also be bounded. However, in the induced case, this is the famous gel. This is the famous Gerfer-Sunder conjecture. So it is not known, it is conjectured that this is the case, that if H has no cycle, then it is conbounding, but the conjecture is in general wide open. It is known to be true for paths, it is known to be true for some special kinds of trees, but in general it is open. So in the industsen case, this is the Giar function. The other function some conjectured okay but anyway we have some conjectured characterizations of graphs which are chi bounding but they are chi bounding if and only if they are they don't contain any cycles. Okay, and one more thing which is worth noting here is the following reduction. Reduction that in order to prove that some graph is chi-bounding, either in the induced or non-induced case, it is just enough to prove that for connected components. Okay, so H is chi-bounding if and only if every connected component On edge disk. Okay, so this is the situation for ordinary graphs. So then before going to ordered graphs, I would like also to mention what Like also to mention what happens for oriented graphs. So we consider chromatic number of oriented graphs, so each edge has an assigned orientation, and then we are excluding also oriented graphs either as an induced as an oriented subgraphs or as induced oriented subgraphs. Oriented substance. Okay, so in the non-induced case, this problem, so the problem of characterizing which oriented graphs are chi-bounding and which are not, it was, I believe, first considered by Berg in 1980. And basically, the characterization is the same. So the characterization So the characterization is that the graph, the oriented graph, is non-induced chi-bounding if and only if it does not contain a sign. And in the induced case, this problem was first studied by Jar Farsch in 1990. So he asked the question which The question which oriented graphs are high-bounding and which are not. And in particular, he observed: so, I will use this board to draw some examples. So, I will be drawing high-bounding structures and structures which are not high-bound. So Giarv√°s observed that this kind of disoriented path, oriented this way, is not chi-bounding. And the reason is that if we consider shift graphs, which is one of the standard constructions of graphs with a large chromatic number, so just to recall, the vertices of a shift graph are intervals, and the two centers. Are intervals and two such intervals are connected by an edge if and only if they touch like this. Okay, so now we can orient this graph in the natural way, say from the left to the right. So such a path would mean that, okay, this interval touches this one, then this one touches this one from that side, and this one touches this one from that side, but then this one touches this one. Okay, so this as an induced path is not Kyrian. Okay, and then shortly after, Keystad and Trocker gave a dedicated construction to show that this kind of path, just an oriented path on four vertices. Unfold that is not high-rounding in the induced way. On the other hand, it remained open for a long time some problems of the kind which of the structures are chi-bounding. So, for instance, the other two oriented parts on four vertices, like this one and this. And this one. They turned out to be high bounding. So there is a recent paper by Trudnovsky, Scott and Seymour from 2019. They proved that these structures as induced they are pi-bounding and also induced stars which are oriented in both ways. In both ways, they are chi-bounding. One could try to formulate some bold conjecture characterizing ordered graphs which are chi-bounding or not. For instance, saying that a graph is chi-bounding if it has no cycle, which may be arbitrarily oriented, like forth and back, anywhere, and for instance, no this and No, this and no such path, and no such path. It is conceivable that something like that could be true, but I think it's quite a bold conjecture, so I don't have any support for conjecturing something like that. Okay, so this was about oriented graphs. So finally, we go to ordered graphs. So ordered graphs are graphs with a linear order on the vertices. Okay, so there is some Okay, so there is some linear order on the vertices and some edges connecting those vertices. And then when we are taking a subgraph, either non-induced or induced subgraph, we want to preserve the order. Okay, so this is a notion of induced ordered or non-induced ordered subgraph. So for instance, to motivate considering this kind of Considering this kind of ordered structures, notice that we can provide characterizations of some known classes of graphs in terms of excluded induced ordered subgraphs. So for instance, class of graphs which have an order that excludes something like this as an induced order subgraph, these are comparability graphs. These are comparability graphs. For graphs which have an order which excludes something like this as an ordered subgraphs, these are chordal graphs. This condition is basically saying that there exists a perfect elimination order for coordinal graphs. Okay, so yes, so this is now we are on to order graphs. And the non-induced setting of ordered graphs was considered in the recent paper by Maria Senovich, Jonathan Rolin, and Austin Wittard So So they provided a lot of conditions when ordered graphs are chi-bounding and where they are not chi-bounding in the non-induced sense. So in particular, they used also shift graphs to show that some specific, so now we are considering. Specific, so now we are considering non-fixed case. Graphs which they call bonnets, which look like this. Here there is an edge, here there is an edge, and there is some edge between these vertices. So this may look like this, or it may look like this, or it may look like this. And also the symmetric situations, so we can reverse the order. So, we can reverse the order and consider the other three cases. This is what they call bonates. They are not chi-bounding, and they have the following nice characterization of non-crossing patterns H, which are chi-bounding and which are not. By non-crossing, I mean that something like this does not appear. This is a crossing in an ordered graph. So, if some Older graph. So if something like that does not appear in H, then they show that a non-crossing H is sky bounding if and only if our H has no cycle as before. We need As before, we need to exclude cycles for the very same reason, because of the Herduch's construction. So we always need to exclude a cycle. And no volume. Okay, so this is a characterization of non-crossing patterns, but then when it comes to patterns which contain crossings, the situation is much more complicated. Is much more complicated and it is not at all clear what the characterization could look like. So, for instance, some of the orderings of P4 are chi-bounding and some of them are not chi-bounding. This was also considered in that paper by Axeno Girlin and Minkert. So, for instance, these two These are two non-induced. This is not kai-bounding and this is not chi-bounding. So tax construction, appropriately ordered, index code, this kind of stuff, while non-induced paths like this or Or this or this, they will be kind of okay. So that was about the non-induced setting. So finally, we go to the induced setting. And here I heard of this problem of characterizing, or maybe not exactly characterizing, but as But a specific problem asks you whether for some specific graphs H, whether this H is induced chi-bounding or not. I heard it from Istvan Thoman when I was visiting Lausanne several years ago. I don't think it is published anywhere. So, for instance, he So, for instance, he asked me the question whether this kind of crossing structure is chi-bounding or not, or more generally, whether every ordered matching is induced chi-bounding or not. So, what he realized is that maybe let me write let me write it here. Induced non-crossing matchings any induced non-crossing matching is chi-bounding. So this is why this was the first open case for Istran, the first interesting open case. And also I would like to mention what is the motivation for studying this case, because the motivation comes from geometry. The motivation comes from geometry. There is a class of geometric intersection graphs called outer string graphs. So these are intersection graphs of curves which are attached to some, say, horizontal line and they lie on one side of that line. So for instance, those curves may look like this. Okay, and I have a result with Alexander Locke saying that this c class of intersection graphs is chi-bounded. Graphs is chi-bounded. And Istvan observed that if these graphs are ordered according, like from left to right, according to those points where they are attached to the horizontal line, then this is excluded. What requirements you have, what condition? No requirements. The only requirement is that the curve touches this line. touches this this this line and it is supposed to to lie entirely above the line. And that's it. They can intersect arbitrarily many times. Okay? But still we cannot build this as an induced subgraph. Because what would that mean? That would mean that this curve should intersect this. And now this should intersect this, but no other curve should intersect and there is no way to do this. Okay? So for instance, Okay, so for instance, showing that this is chi-bounding would cover this result about outer spin graphs. And actually, that's the case. So James Davies observed that this matching is excluded as an induced, like it is chi-bounding. It is chi-bounding, it is induced chi-bounding. And he observed it using also one of the recent results by Scott and Seymour. So Scott and Seymour considered graphs which they call bananas. So for instance, this is an example of a banana. And they have a theorem saying that for every fixed banana, the class of graphs. The class of graphs excluding that graph and all its induced subdivisions, like all its subdivisions as induced subgraphs, that this class is pi-bounded. And James observed that there is no way of ordering these bananas and its subdivisions that would avoid this kind of crossing. So the consequence is that ordered graphs excluding that are charging. But like the But like the heart of the proof lies in that result by spot and C1. But still what remained was this more general question by Istvan Thoman whether what happens for general matchings as induced ordered separates? Yes? Yes, and the main result that I would like to advertise today is by Martin Griansky, James Davies and myself is that any induced that any ordered matching let me write induced ordered And this is a new result even in the non-induced case. So it was not known whether in the non-induced case all matching all ordered matchings are chi-bounding or not. Are chi-bounding or not? It was known for non-crossing matchings because, like, this result, for instance, includes the non-crossing matchings, but it was not known what happens here. So, okay, so this is like a main result. I'm afraid I will not have time to tell you to tell you. To tell you anything interesting about the proof, maybe let me just say that the proof proceeds in two stages, mimicking those ideas used by Scotts and Seymour in most of their series about chi-boundedness. So, the first step is to show that the class of graphs is what they call two-controlled, which means Too controlled, which means that if the chromatic number is sufficiently large, then there exists a vertex such that its second neighborhood will have a large chromatic number. And then there is the second step, which is to use this fact in order to prove the actual hydrologists. And then for this first step, so proving this fact that it's two controlled. The fact that it's too controlled, we have a really nice argument which uses a modification of the breadth first search layering, which is not exactly the breadth first search layering, but it is a modification which is well, which is better suited to studying older graphs. And then the second step is just applying the machinery of Scott and Sebour, as in particular that machinery from the fifth paper of their series, which is called Chandeliers and Strings. Called chandeliers and strings, and it's really long and technical. Okay, what else can I say about that-induced setting? So, together with the optimology, we have characterized uh like similarly to this result, we ca we have characterized non crossing graphs H, which of them are induced chi bounding and which are not induced and And which are not induced, and which are induced, not chi-bounding. So, namely, a non-crossing H is chi-bounding if and only if H has no cycle, no No P4 as an induced subgraph no induced P4 and none of these structures get induced, which is like an anonymous requirement. Like an analogous requirement to having no bonnet from this result. And again, the fact that these structures are not high bounding is proved using shift graphs. Because basically, if we order shift graphs lexicographically, first according to the left endpoint and then according to the right endpoint, then this ordered graph will look like this, that the right neighborhood of every vertex is a connected interval, right? That interval, right? Because all intervals that start here, so all intervals which lie in the right neighborhood of this one, they will form a contiguous interval. So this is why this is not chi-bounding. And this is not chi-bounding because we just consider shift graphs ordered in the opposite way. Okay, so just to complete So just to complete this list of what is chi bounding and what is not with some more examples. So for the induced, this is not chi bounding and also the reverse one. And then also for shift graphs, we know that basically all T force, so here we were we could exclude some T force as We could exclude some P4s as already as non-induced patterns, but some of them excluded as non-induced, they bound the chromatic number. Okay, if we exclude this thing as an induced ordered subgraph, then this is actually the same as excluding this. The same as excluding this in the oriented graph sets. So, from this Kirstat and Trotter construction, this implies that this is not chi-bounding in the induced sets. Okay, and also some other patterns like those which are there. So this is wrong, sorry. Is wrong, sorry. I was supposed to write this way. So, for this, we have a dedicated construction, and those other ones are excluded also because of the shift graphs. Here, there is one more that I could include, which is chi-bounding and as induced and it is not induced chi-bound. not induced chi bounding. And then all stars are chi-bounding as induced subgraphs, which is again a consequence of this result by Chudnovsky, Scott and Sebor. And two more examples which are which are not chi-bounding. These are non-induced graphs like this. Graph like this, and Rose McCarty realized that an appropriate order on Buring graphs excludes this. So, I would like just to end with listing some open cases, like some minimal open cases where we don't know what the answer is. So, in the non-induced world, we don't know what the answer is. We don't know what the answer is for this graph and for this graph. And then in the Indius world, it's difficult because in some way this Uh this seems like almost doable. So uh for instance my my colleague Lefdurai uh tried like almost had a proof that this is high bounding but there was a gap in the proof and then we were unable to fix it. On the other hand there are a lot of supergraphs of this that just by adding some more vertices and some more context when this is not Kaiba. So, if this is high bounding while those other ones are not, it would mean that it would be very difficult to provide a characterization of what is high bounding and what is not. Okay, and just let me finish with those open cases for the induced sense. This is open, this is open, and this is open. And these are the three minimal ones where we don't know the answer. And if it turns out that all of them are not chi-bounding, then we would have a really nice characterization of when a pattern is induced chi-bounding and when it's not induced chi-bounding. Right? So we would need to exclude everything that we are excluding here plus exclude this, this, this, this and this. Called this, this, this, this, and this. And that would be the exact characterization. Okay, thank you.
