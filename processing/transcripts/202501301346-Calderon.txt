Chance to speak, especially being able to do so virtually. I was really excited to be there in person with y'all, but life intervened as it will. So I'm very grateful to have been able to still be able to participate virtually. And so I'm going to be telling you today about some work, which is really in terms of hyperbolic geometry and about dynamics on moduli spaces. When I was looking at the abstracts for this conference, I noticed that I was the only. Abstract for this conference, I noticed that I was the only person not to have the name Markov in my abstract or my title for abstract. And yet, I do think this work is quite related to some of the questions that we've seen this week. And so we should go ahead and dive in. Oh, I should also say that all of this is joint work with James Farr, pictured on the slide here. So I want to begin with something that you surely know. You surely know. It's how to count lattice points on a square torus. Right? So on a square torus, here I mean just R2 mod Z2. So if I take any simple closed curve or perhaps isotopian class of simple closed curve, that corresponds to a lattice vector. And as long as I don't go around the simple closed curve twice, that's a primitive lattice vector. So that means the simple closed curves correspond to primitive elements of the integer lattice. Or here I'm just going to write homology. Lattice, or here I'm just going to write homology, and this is a great parameterization that you learn in algebraic topology one. And it allows us to count too. Because if we wanted to count the number of simple closed curves, gamma, ones with length at most L, right, instead of counting integer, instead of counting geodesics, we can count lottus points. So here we're just going to count the number of v and the perimeter. And the primitive image or lattice, whose let's say L2 norm is at most L. The things which are some big distance L away. Great. And well, we know how to count these because the integer points are dense, right? And so this grows like L squared. And in fact, because we know the density of primitive points inside of all of the points, we can even identify the constant as a 6 over phi L squared. Vi L squared. Great. So you all know this. We also know, though, that in this, if we want to count Markov numbers, we don't want to be counting flat curved geodesics. We want to be counting hyperbolic geodesics by their length. And so a similar story holds almost verbatim for hyperbolic puncturatori. Next slide, please. There you go. Please, there you go. Um, so by a miracle, essentially, uh, in low-dimensional topology, um, simple closed curves on the once-punctured torus still correspond to primitive elements of the homology. And so, if we wanted to count the number of simple closed curves on a once-puncture torus, for example, the modular torus, right, the equi-inharmonic one, then if we wanted to count their solutions, right? Their solutions, right? This using sort of the go-between via trace and hyperbolic length, this is like counting the number of solution, the number of Markov numbers. This number of simple closed curves, it was proven as we saw in Christopher Rolloig's talk, I believe, and in a couple other, mentioned a couple other places. McShane and Riven proved that. Mick Shane and Riven proved that the length of a curve actually extends to a norm on homology. And so this is pictured on the right-hand side here. And so this number of simple closed curves is length of most L. This is just the same as the number of primitive integer lattice vectors whose norm with respect to this other new strange, you know, piecewise polyhedral, but infinitely many sides norm, we just want this. We just want this, actually anything in the riven. We want this to be norm to be at most l and this gives us the same sort of asymptotics, right? Because we're just counting integer points inside of a norm, a convex norm ball. And so this is asymptotic to some constant times L squared. All right, where this constant again is essentially just the area of this ball with a proportionality constant for how many of these are primitive. All right, so this is a story that we've already seen. So, this is a story that we've already seen today. And so, I want to actually tell you one more way that hyperbolic geometry comes into the study of the Markov equation, though. So, we've seen that already, a couple of times mentioned in this conference, this hyperbolic geometric reformulation of the Markov unius. The statement is equivalent to four equi-inharmonic chorus asking if I have two simple closed curves at the same length. I have two simple closed curves at the same length, are they on the equatorian harmonic forest? Are they related by an isometry? And so that's what we can call that property star. And I don't have anything to say about the unit conjecture, but being a Teichmerry theorist, I might, you could also think about asking this question not just for this one fixed forest, but of course, for all of them. So, a very valid question is: well, for how many? Question is: Well, for how many hyperbolic puncture tori does this condition star hold? All right. So, for example, maybe this is just true, a statement that's true for a generic subset of a moduli space. Maybe it's true for everything for almost everything. Maybe it's true for. For almost everything, maybe it's true for almost nothing. And unfortunately, the answer is much more complicated, or maybe fortunately, right? That we have things to prove. But work of McShane and Harlier, they showed that the set where this is true is dense in the space of once punctured tori. But also the complement, right? The set of tori for which the analog of the unicity conjecture is false. The humidity conjecture is false, is also dense. They also proved more things about this set. So, much more structure there, and I recommend you read this paper. I think it's also another overlooked paper, sort of in the study. But they didn't prove this just for one spartori, right? You might as well, this question asks makes just as much sense for arbitrary higher genus surface, arbitrary hyperbolic surfaces. So, how about for how many? So, how about for how many hyperbolic surfaces does this hold? And in fact, they prove this for all g and n. So, the set where the analog of the unidentity conjecture is true is dense, but its complement is as well. So, here by MgN, I'll just remind you, I mean the moduli space of genus G and cusped hyperbolic surfaces. Hyperbolic surfaces. All right. And so this is another way that sort of the unicity conjecture is in fact this way it manifests in the question about hyperbolic geometry. Okay, but we could ask our this result of McShane and Parlier. What they actually have to do is that they look at the sets where there are two simple curves of the same length and the Of curves of the same length, and they analyze them, and then they take the union over all possible pairs of simple closed curves. And if you have ever spent time trying to draw longer and longer simple closed curves or pairs of curves on a hyperbolics on a surface, these get very, very complicated very quickly. And there are a whole heck of a lot of them. And so instead of asking for this every possible pair, we might ask: what if we were. Pair, we might ask, what if we require, for example, alpha and beta to be disjoint? Or more generally, what if we require them to be in a single mapping class group orbit? All right, and so I have a theorem that I want to tell you about, it's sort of a generalization. Want to tell you about it's sort of a generalization of this McShane Parliament results, but its motivation comes more from the dynamical side. So one quick recollection about hyperbolic geometry. So a reminder, if you have a hyperbolic structure on a n times puncture genus G surface, you can describe it in terms of finitely many parameters. If you, by fixing a pancy composition, a collection A pansy composition, right? A collection of curves which cuts my surface into three whole spheres. Then I only need to describe the length of the pans curves because those lengths tell me what the geometry is, together with the twisting about how I glue together each of those pans curves. So that means I need only 3g minus 3 plus n, that's the number of pants, coordinates, one for length and one for twist for each of the curves. All right, and so in particular, I might as well, if I just want to say, I might as well, if I just want to say, okay, I want disjoint curves whose length are the same, why don't we just take all curves of the pancy composition to have all the same length? So if I fix all of the lengths equal to L and take all possible twists, well, then all of a sudden, right, I fixed some coordinates and then I've got a sort of r to the 3g minus 3 plus n. But once I've done a full twist, right, But once I've done a full twist, right, I've come back to an isometric hyperbolic surface. And so a full twist gets me back to where I started. And so doing this gives me 3G minus 3 plus n torus, which I'm going to say T L. This is immersed inside the moduli space. And so this is in particular a torus where all of the curves of the pants decomposition have the same length. And you might ask how much of the moduli space does the And you might ask, how much of the moduli space does this fill up? And so Nikani conjectured that as you take these lengths to infinity, you're taking all the lengths equal to some number, but you're letting that number go to infinity. These Tori, in fact, equidistribute inside a modular space with respect to some certain Lebesgue class measure, which I'll make precise a little later. So, in particular, these tori are all, the union of all these tori is deaths. these tort is debts right so a vast improvement on the mcchain ribbon result mcchain parliament result excuse me and the theorem due to myself and bar and last year is that well okay for n is equal to zero fine but this is true this is true um along most Along most sequences. Again, which I will make precise and closer to the time. All right, well, pause for questions because I can't quite see people's faces on the Zoom. All right. So this is a result, you know, very similar to the it tells you about the set of surfaces which have a pantsy composition all of the same length. But it is also sort of very intimately related to these counting questions that I started off the talk with. And in order to tell you how, I want to, again, remind you with something that I assume many of you know. That I assume many of you know, which is how to count points on a count of a square torus using dynamics this time. Can I ask a question? Oh, yes, of course. What happens if n is not zero? Yeah, if n is not zero, I'd imagine this also holds. Sort of, as we'll see, this theorem is built on the sort of the backbone of a very large theory that has been developed for n is equal to zero. I don't want to say just because. I don't want to say just because of our laziness, but it should probably also hold for N non-zero. It's just that there is more work to do there. Okay, thanks. Yeah. So here you're fixing the combinatorics of your pants decomposition. Yes. And so you say for each such combinatorics now, I let L2 to infinity and I plot this by one. And I've got these Lagrangian sub-manifolds which you could distribute this. Yep. Yes, and this doesn't depend on the combinatorics of the PFC composition you started with. All right. And so I want to tell you how this related to counting problems. So classically, let's count some, let's count G dash on the square torus again. So here, right, I'm going to go ahead and So, here, I'm going to think about my square of torus as R2 mod z2, and I'm going to label the two vectors, 1, 0, and 0, 1 by a and b, just so I don't write vectors. And it turns out that the integer, primitive integer homology is one single mapping class per orbit, one single SL2Z orbit of one of the vectors, say A. And so that means that the condition that the L2 norm or the length. L2 norm, or the length, maybe I should say, of, so here, the length of v on x, right, this being at most l, well, sorry, if I write v is equal to ga and then use the equivariance of the mapping class group action, this is equivalent to just saying that the norm of a on g inverse x is a most l. All right, and so that's. All right, and so that means that I can turn my counting problem for my counting problem for counting geodesics on a fixed X into counting orbit points inside a region. So if I wanted to count the number of points whose length is most L, this is equivalent to counting the number of orbit points of my original surface inside some level L horrible. Level L horrible, and so I should ask to tell you where this lives. This horrible, so it's not quite in the entire Technoise space, but rather this G is only defined up to the stabilizer of A. And so this horrible is in H2 mod the stabilizer of A. And so here's our picture. If I have a given point. If I have a given point, sorry, I keep this map. If I have a given point x, I look at the set of hyperbolic, or sorry, the set of flat tori where my given vector a has length the most l. This is the horriball above some height. I think it's one over l squared, but I always get confused without doing this off the top of my head. And then I want to know how many of these orbit points are. Into how many of these orbit points are there inside of this horrible ball as I push farther and farther down? And the asymptotics of this count will exactly give me the asymptotics of the count that I wanted before. All right, and now here's where the dynamics comes into play. At the moment, we've just been reformulating everything. And the dynamics kicks in because these expanding horriballs equidistribute inside the modular curve. And so this is a very classical result. And so, this is a very classical result that I would assume is known to most people. And what that means is that they equidistribute to the hyperbolic volume. And so that means that they wrap up over the curve sort of equally. And so that means that if I wanted to count the number of pre-images, number of these orbit points that are inside the horrible, then counting this for one point and counting this for any other point, it's essentially the same. It's essentially the same. And so that means that this count will be asymptotic to the volume of the horror ball divided by the volume of the modular curve. And making this precise and actually computing these volumes will allow you to come back to the exact same estimates, 6 over pi L squared. All right. And so that's the classical picture. All right, and so that's that's the classical picture. Um, it lets you turn an equidistribution problem into a counting problem, and it turns out that this McShane-Riven result also has a similar formulation. You can deduce a counting problem not just from the expanding norm ball, but also from an equidistribution problem on moduli space. All right, and so whereas this for flat tor was classical, um, the picture for, oh, I guess I didn't add it, end up adding that. This picture for hypermode. End up adding that. This picture for hyperbolic quarry, I think, is really due to Mirzakani. All right, so I'm going to just sort of amend the slide as I go. And so now what we're going to do is we're going to fix a hyperbolic torus, X, a once-punctured torus. If you want, it's the anharmonic torus. It could be any other one. Similarly, we could consider it tomology, but now. etymology. But now, if I have any given simple closed curve gamma, they all live in a single mapping class group orbit. So here I'm writing mod, but if you want, you could write SL2Z. And so similarly as before, if I wanted to, I'll replace here. Or if I wanted to, I'll replace here norm with length. So if I wanted to consider the things, the gammas which have length at most L on X, right, the hyperbolic length, this is equivalent to considering the gamma. Sorry. So if I have alpha in the mapping class group or root of gamma, and if I want to compute if its length is the most L on X, then that means the length. On x, and that means the length of gamma on g inverse x is also at most l. And so we can do the exact same thing. If I wanted to compute the number of length here, the number of points whose length at most l, this is the same thing as the number of g inverse x in the given horror ball. But now this horror ball is sort of different. This horror ball is just the sublevel set of some length function. And it is sort of no longer. It is sort of no longer a nice hyperbolic horriball anymore. This is some other set, which I guess it is periodic, so it'll look like this. But it's some region where the length is at most L. And as you let L go to infinity, a similar thing holds. These get pushed down. They unfortunately don't get pushed down sort of in the same rate as a. Get pushed down sort of in the same rate as a horror cycle because otherwise you could just deduce one equity distribution. Um, all the same, Mirzikani proved that these expanding horribles, now they in fact do equidistribute. And now, even though they're the same thing, I'm going to write inside of M11 because this is the moduli space of genus one things. Right. However, one caveat. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah? So, in the case, in the classical case, we even know that the horospheres. Yes. We also know horror spheres equidistribute here as well. And would it be the case also for hygiene? Yes. Yes. All right. And so these. All right, and so these do equidistribute, but now the limiting measure is not the hyperbolic measure anymore. So here, the limiting measure is not uniform. And so that means that when we end up wanting to count the number of orbit points inside of this horrible, equivalently the number of simple plus curves whose length is at most L, this is there's some weighting constant here, b of x. Here, b of x. And this b of x turns out in up to some global constants, which you know you have to end up computing. This is the exact same thing as the area of the McShane-Riven norm ball. And so again, this dynamical point of view also recovers the counting result we saw at the start. All right, and now the reason that I like this is because. Reason that I like this is because, I think, as Christopher Laird has alluded to, this question makes sense for any genus, right? For any genus, any number of punctures. So, let me tell you a little bit about what the measures are, tell you some theorems, and then we can wrap up. And so, the limiting measure, this thing that I said was non-uniform, comes from the natural symplectic structure on Mgn. So remember that a point in Mgn, we can determine it in terms of the coordinates of a pancliffe. The coordinates of a Pancy composition, right? The lengths and the twists. And it turns out that these are actually Darboux coordinates for a very nice symplectic form, which, I mean, you can do symplectic geometry with it, or you can just take the top wedge and forget that it was symplectic and get a measure, the JPEG measure, which I'll call just denote by mu wp. And so this is kind of a uniform measure on moduli space, is one way to think about it. And moreover, there's also an, but I said this limiting measure is non-uniform. And this comes from the existence of some certain asymmetric norm on the cotangent above the local moduli space. And this is exactly what I was referring to, I think, in the problem session other day when I said Thurston norm, because Thurston was the one who found this asymmetric norm. And in particular, from this, you can you define this you can you define a function b of x on moduli space which is just the volume of the ball the unit norm ball with respect to this norm generalizing the machine driven one all right and now as christopher lloyd has pointed out this uh you might ask about this question in higher genus and the theorem of mirrors And the theorem of Mirza Cany says that this does, this Egwitz distribution holds in hyerogenous. So, here I'm going to fix a simple closed multicurve, gamma, to be gamma one through gamma n. And I'm going to take the analog of an expanding horosphere or expanding horror volt. So I'm going to take the set of, I'm going to take a tuple of all of the lengths of gamma, and I'll say maybe I want their L1 norm. So the total sum of the lengths to be at most L. That's some region. That's some region. And I'm going to take the Vapieterson measure, the uniform measure restricted to this. And I ask what happens as L goes to infinity. And she proved that these equidistribute now not to the uniform measure, but to this B of X times the Vay-Peterson measure. And from this, sort of using the exact same go-between between counting and distribution we saw before, she was able to prove. Able to get at another proof of her famous theorem that for all x, the number of alpha in the mapping class group orbit of a single given simple closed curve whose length is at most L, she's able to prove that this is asymptotic to a constant times b of x times l to the 16 minus 6. All right. And of course, you can ask, And of course, you can ask all sorts of questions like this, right? You might ask, okay, well, here's this L1 norm. So I'm counting with respect to the sum of the lengths. What if I wanted to count with respect to, I don't know, the max of the lengths or the L2 norm? And so that's the result of Francisco Arana-Herrera and Ming-Kun Liu independently. They proved that these sort of LP horror balls equidistribute. Core balls, echo distributes, and more general versions of this as well. All right. I want to compare this now, though. So these equidistribution problems, they have applications to counting, which in terms of the Markov numbers gives us sort of a generalization of this counter-mcchain and ribbon. But unfortunately, these sorts of results are not enough to say anything. These sorts of results are not enough to say anything about Twistori as before, because, so I know everyone knows what an LP norm ball looks like, but just to highlight it, right, the L1 norm ball sort of in the set of possible lengths looks like this. The L infinity looks like this. And if you're looking, you're asking just about the twist torus, right? The set of things whose lengths are all equal, it's a very, very small dimensional set. And so, uh, And so, despite this, sort of using completely different techniques, we were able to prove that, again, here's the theorem again: these tori equidistribute along almost all sequences. And now I'll actually tell you what the almost all means. By this, I mean there is some set of positive density or full density, such that as long as you take your scaling exponentially and you're living inside this set of positive density, then you do equidistribute to the same. You do equidistribute to the same measure that you might you should normally expect. All right. So the proof of this, of course, is not the focus of my talk. It sort of is very different than the other proofs of equidistribution. But sort of lying at the heart of it all is there are these dynamics on this moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces, which I think are a very fruitful subject of investigation. Which I think are a very fruitful subject of investigation and hopefully can be tied to Markov numbers in the future. Thanks for your attention. Questions for Erin? Yeah, I have a question. Yes, go ahead. You can hear me, right? Yes. Okay, firstly, in the last theorem. Okay, firstly, in the last theorem, do you know that it's not true? Why this you put this extra condition of density one? Yes. So this is a. So thank you for the great segue into the slide that I had about how do you prove this. So in fact, the way that you prove this is sort of not by actually proving anything about this dynamical system. Instead, we prove things about quadratic differentials. And so Um, and so you know, those of you who have been around the block a couple of times have heard probably about some about dynamics on moduli spaces, but it's usually in regards to quadratic differentials, flat structures, counting on billiards, things like this. And there's a huge theory developed to this point due to many, many, many people. But you know, the key sort of the crown, the crown jewel is this theorem of Eskinger's Canyon Bomani. So I understand the method, the method leads to, but you have. The method leads to, but you have it's actually false, right? No, no, so it's we don't know if that was my question. Yeah, no, it's probably, I would imagine it's it's still true. Um, so what we'd end up doing is that specifically we invoke a theory on the flat side, we invoke a theorem of 40 that needs density one, and then we just pull it back. Okay, no, no, I understand now. Okay, the second 40 actually conjectured this should be true or without specifically a version of this should be true. Should be true without density one. Without density one, yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. That's that's what I thought. Um, I have one more question, and that's connected with what I was saying in my talk. So, my understanding is that when you do this counting with Mirzakani's theorem, if you pass to a subgroup, because that's what we need to do when we sieve, yes. And if you ever do all this for the character variety of genus G and N punctures in general, you will need this and we. You will need this, and we always had in mind to use Mirzokani. And then you do have a remainder term which comes from this exponential mixing, which is already getting very involved. But the dependence of that exponential mixing rate on the subgroup, at least Francesco, who I spoke to a lot about this, does not know how it depends on the subgroup. He could not make that effective. That was a point in my lecture that in the once Point in my lecture that in the once-punctured torus, the only way I was able to get around that, or the student of mine was able to get around it to make effective what we were doing, was to use your first counting, just in the Riven-McShane case. Oh, yes, yeah. And that's where I said there's this theory of non-Eisenstein series, which is what gives you the theorem you want there, of Selberg for non-congruence groups for which you can make everything. Groups for which you can make everything effective. So I'm just pointing out this difficulty that at least Francesco said, as far as he knows, nobody knows how to do. Maybe you know. So instead of counting the mapping class group, you take a finite index subgroup of the mapping class group and count those orbits. And then, as a function of the index or some effective bound, you want to know the exponential mixing rate in order to get a In order to get a remainder term in this count. And that, I think there's a very interesting problem there of making that exponential mixing rate. How does that depend on the index of the size? Yeah, no, that's a great question. So I think this specific version that I've been talking about. So in fact, there is a geodesic-like flow that is playing the role here. And we know it's mixing. We actually haven't yet proven exponential mixing. Yet, proven exponential mixing. I've got ongoing work with FAR, which is, I think, very close to done. We're rather up to writing down awful estimates where we are working to prove this. I think that of all of the arguments that could be made sort of uniformly effective over finite index subgroups, this one might have actually the best chance. This one might have actually the best chance of working, the one that you stated, because I actually don't know off the top of my head, but I think that there's a work of McGee who McGee maybe who proved something about this. Yeah, yeah, he's trying to, he's got some expansion property there. You're correct, going through the symplectic group. Yeah, so the result that James and I are proving are is we're using the mixing rate of the technogenesic flow to say something about the mixing rate of. Say something about the mixing rate of the analog of the geodesic flow here. And you can actually make that, you can say, you know, what goes to what. And so, if you have effective, uniform effective rates on the technical side, you should have uniform effective rates on this side. But I guess I haven't thought about that much. Okay, yeah, thanks. Yeah, I don't want to take up all your time. Wonderful. Thanks. Thank you. All right, well, let's think of Erin again. I think you should have given the audience a chance to ask him a question. I feel very bad. I don't give the audience a chance. Okay. I feel bad. Mr. Florida, if you have a question, like I know it's actually the official question, we can just talk in the next 10 minutes before someone else. Why in the last 30 minutes? Why is there no constant depending on the last pair? Ah, no, you don't have the size. You had the volume of X, which had nothing depending on your tacks. Say one more time. At the end in the conversion. At the end, in the convergence, you had convergence to the volume of x times as a test measure, but you have no dependency on the multi-curve. No, yeah, there's no dependency here. It's that because kind of all multi-curves are going to have the same constant, they kind of essentially so yeah, I mean, I think the thing to say is that when I was doing the when I'm taking the sequence of measures associated to the Torah, I'm always right. The torrent, I'm always right, they're flat tori, and so they have an natural big measure, and I'm always scaling that to be mass one. Yeah, but no, but now how you're not in the toi, you've got this multi-curve in the, when you've got this dance decomposition. And which depends on the, on the, on the, on the fact that you've got a dance decomposition or not. Sorry, are you talking about in the counting theorem or in the equivalent? The last theorem on this slide. The last PRM on the slide, the one where you're giving the equidistribution of the horrible modular space. Yes, so yeah, if you want the horrible, yes, so if I want the horrible, then sorry, I'm trying to share and I'm sharing the wrong thing. Let's go. Yeah, so you're saying this theorem, yes? Um no, the last one of this one. No, the last one on the last the one yes here at the bottom there yeah but nothing which depends on nope so I think the thing you might want to think about is this Mirzakani result about the oh shoot about the equidistribution of these expanding horribles. This also doesn't have a constant here. So the limiting the limiting thing is oh so I guess I should divide this by mass because I should divide this by mass because this is B of X mu V Peterson is not technically a probability measure. So, whatever. But so there isn't a constant here. The constant, this frequency constant that you might be thinking about, this appears when you're actually trying to compute the mass of the horrible. Oh, right. But this is interesting to do normalizing by first. Yes, yeah. And so, yeah, in fact, right, what this Yeah, in fact, right, what this sort of standard averaging and unfolding argument tells you is that this count is asymptotic to the mass of the horrible, and so or maybe b of x times the mass of the horrible. And then, so that means this constant comes from the mass of the horrible. And yeah, it turns out that yeah, the this mass is asymptotically L to 60 minus 6 times the frequency constant. And the reason for this is because the frequency constant arises as Frequency constant arises as the Kensavich volume of the moduli space of ribbon graphs, which is what happens when you take lengths to infinity. Sorry, that was a lot of words. I don't know if it made any sense. Yeah, good sense. As a side comment, Jack Reesert and some collaborators, they showed some non-equidistribution results in the linear case for some, they need, they need, so if you think of your multi-girls as Your multi girls as giving you Lagrangian in the symplectic case. So they're not working in the symplectic case, they're working on projective spaces, but they find some Gaussian, but they don't have integer coordinates, whereas you do, you've got multiples. They found certain conditions, but sometimes they do not have equal distribution all the time. So so maybe this comes to the fact that you really need this almost for almost every For almost every density one, but there are some special directions. If you go in the modular space, there are some special directions which are kind of to your fantasy, and then they will have a it will go too much in some direction and then too much in some other direction. I don't know, but in Donino case, that's what it can be done. And so that that the limit doesn't actually actually doesn't exist. It's not just that it doesn't converge to the expected thing. Just that it doesn't converge to the expected thing? You can find coupled couples. It was a conjecture of that was always true, and they found a couple examples. Then they found a couple of examples of using this approximation of Yukon. No, I will say this statement that the Tori equidistribute is not true. Is not true for every, if you fix any.
