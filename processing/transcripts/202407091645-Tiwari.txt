So, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to give a talk here and also bringing these nice people together. I got to learn a lot about branching problems from real settings, and I'm very curious to know about PRDIC and log of those kind of things. We started the day with representation, branching rule in case of PRIC setting, and we'll end the day with a talk from the same area. So, first, oops. A brief outline of the talk. Again, so in the morning you saw that, okay, in the case of periodic setting, you take, we care a lot about irreducible superfrespital representations and we restrict them to maximal compact subgroup. In this case, I'll take one particular group, which is C11. I'll define this and then I'll provide an explicit description of how these irreducible supercospital representatives. Supercospital representations look like for positive deaths. And then we will restrict these to one particular maximal compact subgroup and provide an explicit description of branching rules when we do this restriction. And during this talk, we will see addition on generic characters, a method for constructing representations of maximum compact subgroup in this case. And we'll end with some results. So let's start. Okay, I'll fix some notations in the beginning. Again, I'm taking a non-Archimedean local field with residual characteristic P0 equal to 2. And I consider a quadratic extension of this field. And it's unramified. Since it is degree 2, Galois group consists of two elements. And I denote elements of this Galois group by I and sigma. And for any element A of B, sigma of A denoted. element a of b sigma of a denoted by a bar let o e and o f denote the ring of integers of e and f respectively and in the morning we saw that they each have unique maximal ideal and we denote math frac p e and p f to denote these maximal ideals respectively and varpa is generator of this maximal ideal unramified extension so we can take the same prime element and we set valuation so that the valuation of varpa is one The valuation of pi is one, and we also fix an additive character of f which is non-trivial on the string of integers of OF but trivial on the math flat Pf. Okay, so what is U11? So it consists of matrices coming from N to E that preserve the Hermitian form represented using the matrix J, which is 0, 1, 1, 0. And if you want to see an explicit description of this group, all those matrices, A, B, C All those matrices ABCD, ABCDL from E, that matrix entry, they satisfy this kind of relation. Remember, A bar was sigma of X. So A bar D plus C bar B is one. And if we take column-wise entries, A bar C and B bar D should be an element of root epsilon F. And its Lie algebra has this nice form where in this case, now you have U V Y Z coming from F. Uvyz coming from F. So, why do we care about branching groups? So, rule for this group is a quasi-split group and its derived subgroup is SU11, which is also isomorphic to SL2F. And it has a very nice center. So, the center is norm1. So, this notation here is norm one element of this of E over this quadratic extension that we fixed. This quadratic extension that we fixed in the beginning. Okay, so next step: we produce all irreducible supercaspital representations of positive depth for this growth. So we'll use Addula U method for constructing these representations. So we need the datum. So first thing here again, since we only care about positive depth representation, we have very small subset of the original datum set you saw in the morning. Saw in the morning. So you just need a sequence of twisted Levy subgroups. You have a rank one group, so we'll just get one length one sequence, and the first component will be an anisotropic tori or elliptic tori of G. Next, you need a point that is contained in the building of T and in the building of G. So if you remember from the morning, T is compact, so it consists, it represents one single point in the building of G. Point in the building of G. So we have no other choice but to take that point as y. Then we need some positive real numbers. Since we will be dealing with half of this real number a lot of times, so we fix s to be r by 2. And again, once we have these three things, we need a g-generic character of this anisotropic torus of depth R. And this character is going to be realized by an element of the Lie algebra of tori on this. Tori on this ocean. Okay, so what are these things in our setting? So, first, what are our twisted levy sequences? So, up to conjugacy, we have the following four classes of anisotropic Tori Fg, and they are isomorphic to these, like, for example, the unramified ones are isomorphic to norm one element times. To norm one element times norm one element of extension E over F. And the two ramified ones they correspond to norm one element of this quadratic extension. And another thing that I forgot to mention here, this is the building of U11 in the case of P equals to 2. And here, the last column in this table corresponds to these points in the building of 3. So, in particular, for Particular for the first unramified torus, you can take the centered point, and the second unramified torus is this point, and both unramified correspond to somewhere in the bit, like the bit point of this edge. So now we have twisted levy sequence, we have point corresponding to this twisted levy sequence. Next thing was G generic characters, and these are. So, what do we mean by five? What do we mean by phi is realized by some element of the torus of Lie algebra? So, again, in the morning you saw that if you take r by 2, then this is abelian group and you have nice moi isomorphism. Then, by when I say phi is element realized by an element of some gamma of the Lie algebra, I mean if I take any element in this quotient that is x. quotient that is x plus tr plus and I see its image under this map and I evaluate phi this is nothing but this remember this was the character we fixed in the beginning this is character of your at of our additive group which is trivial on P and non-trivial on O so psi of trace of gamma times X so in particular in this case gamma is going to be a matrix of this form and trace like one Like one can compute this like two plus two matrix. And so we have depth r condition as well. So in this case, it boils down to the valuation of b being exactly equal to minus r in the case of t unramified and minus r minus r when t is ramified. Since valuation for entries in f take integer value, so you can see that when t is unramified, we have integer depth. When t is ramified, we have half. T is ramified, we have half plus z kind of tests. Okay, so we have all the components. So, next thing was to produce a representation of, to extend this character as far as possible. In principle, we produce a representation of this group using all the datum that was given to us. And it turns out to be character in our case when T is ramified or when T is unramified and R is odd. Unramified and R is odd. Otherwise, also rho is an irreducible representation of degree Q, and you need a bit more work in that case. But Adler in 1998 and you in 2001, they proved that if you have this data and you compactly induce this representation, you obtain an irreducible supercuspital representation of G of depth R and all positive supercuspital representations of G arise. Cospital representations of G arise in this way. So now we have our candidate for which we want to study the branching rules. Any questions? Or did I go too fast? Okay. So up until this point, you only need to care about that this is our candidate for restriction. So what is the meaning of lawyers saying illiterate representation of TV? Representation of the VQ. Yes. This is the in the finite field case because we are considering depth R representation. So if you have Gx, GxR plus, so you go into the finite field case. So all these, once we restrict it to K, the resulting representations are going to be finite-dimensional. We just need to know whether they are irreducible or not. Irreducible or not. So this is our group that we consider. So we have U11 of OF. So we had the building in the beginning. We had special point, which was the center. So if we consider special stabilizer of that point with respect to the group acting on building, you obtain a maximal compact group and we denote this by K. And we want to restrict the previously constructed representation to this maximal compact. To this maximal compact server. Now, using Machi theory, one sees that, okay, so this further decomposes as direct sum of compact induction from k intersection Ty comma S G to K up log G. And this G is coming from G is double coset representative K mod G mod T G Y comma S. So these G Y comma S and everything. Y, s and everything comes from microscopic filtration. Okay, so first is we want to know whether these represent these components that we see here, are they irreducible? We also care about these double coset representatives. So proposition, a set of double coset representative in this case is the following: it's just the matrix of this form y pi to the power minus t 0 0 y to the power t. 0, 0 to the power t, and your torus is unvarrified. In the other case, you have identity, this matrix, and the same matrix, but anti-diagonal entries. Once we have double-possited representatives, we have more or less an explicit representation that we want to talk about whether it is irreducible or not. So, these components that are occurring in the previous page, they are all irreducible, distinct. distinct and of depth which is given in the table below and of degree q to the power d minus 1 and q square minus 1. So this depth depends on the torus you're taking and the double coset representative as well as the depth of the representation you started with. So we prove this result by explicitly constructing representations of k up to equivalence and whatever representation we construct using Clifford theory we show that okay there are Using Clifford theory, we show that okay, that representation is going to be irreducible, and we show that this representation intertwines with that. They will have the same depth, same degree, one of them is irreducible. So, this has to be irreducible. Okay, so I will provide a sketch of the flu. So, remember when we were constructing these irreducible supercaspital representations, we had a character pi of depth. We had a character pi of depth r of the torus, and that was realized by gamma of which was the element of the Lie algebra of torus. So we take the same gamma and alpha of t is your double coset representative. And this is your special point in the building. So if you twist gamma by alpha of t, it is going to be an element of this space. This is your Lie algebra of the group, and we are considering this particular filtration. Then set this group. Then set this group. So this might look scary, but in the case D odd, this is just a normal subgroup of your group K. That's where Clifford theory comes into picture. And we define a character of this group using this twist of gamma in this manner. So eta d of g is psi of trace of the same element and g minus i. Okay. Okay. Then, in the when the way you have the datum is like this centralizer of gamma is going to be the tori, and one can see that after some computation that eta d the centralizer of eta d k has to be a twist of this tori times our group j d then another thing to observe here is like our character phi of phi like our character phi of phi of, if we twist with alpha of t, it is going to agree with eta d on the intersection. And if we denote psi phi alpha t, gamma alpha d, the unique character that extends these two characters to this group, then from Clifford theory, because we set everything so that everything falls into place, this representation is going to be irreducible, representation of depth 3 and degree q to the power d minus 1. degree q to the power d minus 1 q squared minus 1 um there is something to note here that if d is odd everything is smooth and in one step you get like you apply directly clifford theory and you get the result but when d is even you need to do some more work like it's kind of a tower and you apply clifford theory in two steps to get the thing and next is to show that okay the representation we obtained here is actually intertwined with representation Intertwines with representation, we had to begin with, and the depth and degree also match. And this is irreducible by construction. So this is going to be irreducible. So while doing this construction, we realized that, okay, we proved that our representations are irreducible, but we also provided an explicit construction of all these components occurring in the decomposition. So we can summarize this thing in the following theorem. In the following theorem. So we had three, not actually four conjugacy classes of twisted Levy sequences, two, one ramified and two ramified. And for those, the points were zero, half, zero, one and half. And if we restrict to K, we have this kind of decomposition. So here you have a that's zero piece. In all other cases, you don't have. So you have. have so you have r r plus 2t phi of alpha of t tau of alpha t so this notation comes from the construction here so d denotes the depth pi comes from the representation you are dealing with and gamma is also like phi is realized by some element of the real but the story doesn't end here so if we go back to the construction we realize that if i take d sufficiently big enough Take D sufficiently big enough, then instead of taking gamma of alpha, if I just pick a nil potent element in this coset and follow the same construction, then x again gives a character of Jd. And in fact, x is the same character as eta d. And in this case, the centralizer has a singular form. It's center times some matrix like unique for the kind of things. So you have one b0, one intersection with. You have one B01 intersection with K and JD. So if I take phi restricted to center and extend it trivially to E, we again see that phi agrees with this character chi on the intersection. And again, let's phi comma x denote the unique extension. You get that, okay, this representation is irreducible of depth d and degree q minus q to the power d minus 1 and q square minus. And in this case, Modesty and in this case, this representation is actually equal to the representation we constructed using the semi-simple element like the twist of gamma. And with a slight modification, one can prove that for any D, you can construct these representations using the potent element. They are going to be reducible of this kind of degree and depth, but they might not be equal to this. might not be equal to this. But we want to find okay upon restriction to which subgroup they can be said. Okay, then you have some nice properties. So for that, let's define two things to make it more precise what we observed here. So we have group, we have V algebra, we can talk about a joint action in Nilpotent orbits. So one sees that in this case, the nilpotent orbits are parametrized. The nil-portent orbits are parameterized by 0, 1, and y, this kind of matrices. And let for x delta above, let us denote its g orbit by n of delta. Then these g orbits further decompose as disjoint union of k orbits. The important thing to note here is if I take delta equals to 1, I get all even depth things. If I take If I take delta is equal to y, I get all odd depth things. And this is just some notation. I denote if I take X t, that I mean I'm taking the image of power pi to the power n minus t under this thing. Then for a central character phi, we define the following representations, which is of k tau n1 phi. This is direct sum of d belonging to 2z because if you had one. Because if you had one, we only had even possibilities. S d x d phi, so we take this nil potent element and the central character, and same way we define these representations when I take var pi is delta equals to var pi. Then we already had that when d is greater than 2r, this representation st phi of alpha t gamma of alpha t is equal to st phi, x. But what happens in the other case? What happens in the other case when d is from r to 2r? Then we have that okay, if we restrict these representations to this subgroup gxr, then it is indeed isomorphic to restriction of representations coming from nilpotent elements. So how we can state this nicely? This is the following theorem. If I have an irreducible supercaspidal representation coming from Jku datum t, rho, comma, y, for. comma rho comma y comma phi and then of depth r then upon restriction to gx r plus phi decomposes as follows things fixed by gxr plus and then restriction of representations of k that we denoted by tau n1 comma pi and tau n bar pi comma phi and one thing to note here is like we are getting depths um greater than r Greater than r, so it's not the entire thing. We are taking d strictly greater than r plus one, greater than or equal to r plus one. And another thing to note here is that if I have the point which I should have mentioned, when you have the unramified torus, then only one of the orbits appear. But in the case of ramified, you have both. Ramify, you have both elements from both orbits are obtaining the decomposition. Okay. Future work. So this was just for unramified extension. One can talk about branching rules for ramified extensions. And in that case, a lot is already known as well. We know JQO data. We know all conjugacy classes of an isotropic. GaC classes of anisotropic tori. We know there is a work by Lewis Trets, who has constructed all irreducible representations of U11 in the case of ramified. So one can see, okay, which of these representations are actually occurring in the decomposition. And the answer also, the number of crystallis sequence and a lot of these depend on minus one being a square or not. One can talk about branching through. One can talk about branching rules for principal representation, and whatever one can go to higher rank cases as well and try to see if there is any pattern. You heard about types in the morning, so one can address the question of unicity of types because you have representations explicitly. And I don't know if it is already written, one can also try to write down. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any question or remote? So in your slides, if you build this representation, if you look at the copy of it, and then you show what the constructions are. So there. So you are assuming that R is not zero? Yes, it's all about zero. And that's not if it were that freedom, would your query still say something? So we believe that is already in the literature depth zero case. We just need to find and write it out explicitly. I have not dealt with depth zero at all, so I cannot comment on that. So, you are you talking about these representations or the one this representations of G or K these no so yeah that would apply if you can see it. Can I give us how it decomposes? I think we expect nice results, but I don't know. Maybe wild conjecture will be perfect. But basically, yes, this is all multi-fixed. So we can speak over into that.
