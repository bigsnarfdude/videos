As the title says, I'm going to talk about some three-dimensional pseudo-manifold groups. This is work in progress, which I used to anyway, never talked about work in progress, but this mostly is joint with Lorenzo Raffoni, who kind of asked me the question that got this started. Some technical parts that I may or may not get to talking about real explicitly are work that I'm doing with my graduate students. Our work that I'm doing with my graduate student, Colby Kelly. Where do you want to do? Work in practice. So here's the kind of, here's one way to frame what we're doing is this general question of which hyperbolic groups are cubicles. Are cubulated or cubulable or cubulable? So I'm going to take it that everyone kind of knows what that means. So I'll just say it. So cubulated. By cubulated, in this context, I mean that the group acts properly and co-compactly on some cat zero cube complex, right? And lots of good things follow. And lots of good things follow from that. So we can filter the question by thinking about the Gromov boundary of G. That's not necessarily the right way to do it, but that's what I'm going to do. So, and we can start with some easy cases, right? So, if I know that the boundary is zero-dimensional, say it cantercept. Dimensional, say a cantercept, right? So if I think about maybe this is point zero, if I think about boundary of T equal to a cancer set, then it's all of them. Right? So if I have a hyperbolic group whose boundary is a Cantor set, then it's virtually free. a candidate set then it's virtually free and so there's a there's a and more more over there's an action a nice proper open packed action on the tree which is a catzero cube complex right so going up a dimension I could think about the boundary being a circle and so it's well so it's it's a hard theorem but it's Hard theorem, but it's sort of a well-known hard theorem, right? That if your boundary is S1, then you're virtually a Fouxian group, right? But actually, you don't need that to see that these things are always cubulated. It's actually quite a bit easier because if I take any infinite order element, it's going to generate a codimension one subgroup. And so pairs of endpoints of blocks of. Pairs of endpoints of loxodromics are dense in pairs of points at infinity. And so that means that I can separate any two points at infinity. Here's I've got two points at infinity. I can find a lot of dromage that looks like that. And so then the Berger on wise criteria tells me always, even without using the convergence group theorem. So all. So this is a consequence, if you like. This is a consequence, if you like, of Perger-Mys. And that actually allows you to make the proof of the convergence criteria easier. That's right, that's right. So CF Markovich, who leverages this to give an easier proof of the convergence criteria, which is that these things are always folksies. So I'm going to skip over all the other one-dimensional things. Things in the interest of time. But maybe I should just say out loud that for other one-dimensional boundaries, sometimes they're accumulable and sometimes they are not. So we saw about random groups. Random groups always have one-dimensional boundary. And they're sometimes a property T, right? And they sometimes are cubelable. So maybe I'll just say other one-dimensional boundaries. So. So but not some others. Okay, so uh what about Sierfinsky carpet boundaries too? Zivinsky-Carpent boundaries, I will skip over. So Zippinsky-Carpent boundaries are very closely related to what I'm about to say. So I want to talk for just for a couple minutes about the boundary, the possibility that the boundaries has two. So, in this case, we really don't know. But here's, there's a conjecture, right? So the Canon conjecture says that they are, right? Okay, that's a reformulation of the Canon conjecture. Let me explain it. So, in this case, so when. So when boundary G is homeomorphic to S2, G is cubiclated if and only if G is finite. So this forward direction is A result of Peter Hosinski building on earlier work of Vladimir. And the reverse direction, if T is Kleinian, well, Khan and Markovich found lots of surface subgroups. And then again, we can appeal to the, they found enough that you can appeal to the Barge Ram Yes. To the Bergeron-Wise criteria. We'll say plus Bergeron-Wise. So you can reformulate the Canon conjecture. So the Canon conjecture says that the boundary being S2 implies that the thing is Kleinian, or virtually Kleinian. So I should say virtually here. So the Canon conjecture is that boundary of G coming back to F2 implies that G is quantity. Did you mean to say cubulated? Yeah, it's a re sorry, reformulated is cubulated. Well, sorry. Cubulated. So reformulated. So I reformulated. All right. So today I want to talk about it. Oh, right. And so to answer Henry's question, so if I had a boundary equal to a Krabinsky carpet, then Kapovich Pliner said I can double that to get something that's boundary is S2. And so if I do the Canon conjecture, then that would tell me that that thing looks. Conjecture, then that would tell me that that thing was actually, that I had, I had, you have to double the three-manole group to get a three-manole group case. So the Sierpinski-Carpet case is closely related to this. Today, I want to think about a different thing. We're going to consider a different two-dimensional case. Two-dimensional case. So the boundary of G homeomorphic to a Pontryagin sphere. Sphere. Which I'll abbreviate just PS, I guess. What is that? So I'm not going to give a formal definition. So PS is a limit Inverse limit of a kind of a sequence of polyhedrons. So I could start with some triangulation of a surface, and now I can take every two simplex and I can replace it by a handle. So right? Right? And now I can retriangulate and I can add more handles everywhere. Okay, so I'm not drawing an arrow. I'm just adding more handles. Okay, all right. So that's one way you can think of it. It's sort of an infinite genus surface. But there's more than one way of building an infinite genus surface, right? I could just make an infinite genus surface with one end and then compactify it. I do not mean that. I mean this thing where I'm adding genus everywhere. I'm adding genus everywhere. So this thing is sometimes the boundary of a hyperbolic group. So this occurs, so this boundary space occurs as the boundary of, say, X if X is the universal cover. Of a three-dimensional negatively curved pseudo-manifold with not, you know, with some orientable three-dimensional negatively curved pseudo-manifold with Negatively curved pseudo manifold with some hierogenous links. Okay. Let me be clear about what I mean by a three-dimensional pseudomanifold for today's talk. Okay, so today A three-dimensional pseudo-manifold is a three-dimensional simplicial complex so that the link of every vertex, let me say for all vertices V, the link of V. Vertices V, the link of V is homeomorphic to a connected closed orientable surface. So if all those surfaces are S2, this is just a manifold, right? But I want to consider the case where some of them are not spheres. Not spheres. And in that case, if I can put a negatively curved metric on it, I can think of the boundary at infinity by, you know, I take a little, I can think of the boundary of infinity of a cat minus one space as an inverse limit of metric spheres. I can think of, if I take a little ball around one of my singular vertices, I get some positive genus surface. I expand that ball. I expand that ball and I grab more vertices, and I'm adding more and more genus sort of in all directions as I get bigger and bigger. So I'm going to get the Pontriagan series in. I've been thinking of that as a metric object. Yeah. On a topological thing. The Pontryagus here you should be thinking of as a topological object, more or less. Yeah. More of a topological object. Or less, yeah, more of a topological object. But it is a compact metrizable space. And there is a, there will be a canonical quasi-symmetry class of metric, but I'm not going to do anything with that. The pseudo-manifold that you should be thinking of is a metric object, because I'm going to be, I'm particularly interested in when I can put a locally cat minus one metric on this thing. Which thing were you asking about? So is there only one on the route and screen points? Yes. That's a theorem of gender people telling. Is it playing? It might be Swikowski, I'm not sure. But it might be older than that one. Yeah, it probably follows from Sikovsky. It follows from some theorem of Swakowski. Or it could have been claimed by Netflix report. Okay, it might be older than that. Yeah, it's probably older. But yeah. I forget the guy's name first. Okay. Can you do the same thing in higher dimensions? Sure. I'm not going to talk about that. Okay, so to this question about whether these things are cubulated, so many of them are, right? Right, so many g equal to pi one of, say, a negatively curved three-dimensional pseudo-manifold R-accumulated. And there's various ways you can get to this. You could build. This. You can build them as finite index subgroups of right-angle Coxeter groups. You can do things with hyperbolization, trying to damage hyperbolization using some work of LaFont and Rafoni. But more generally, like if I take a A hyperbolic three-manifold with totally geodesic boundary, oftentimes I will be able to cone off its boundary components and get something that is cubulable. So that's using Wise's malnormal special quotient theorem. Okay, so many are cubulated, and so the theorem I want to talk about today is that some of them are not. So this is. Our theorem with Lorenzo is that there exist three-dimensional, negatively curved pseudo-manifolds which whose P so that pi one of P is not controllable. So, what does it mean like from the both? I mean, locally cat minus one. Yeah, this is locally cat minus one. I mean, which implies any kind of negative curve you want. The metric away from the singularities can be made for money. If you like, but obviously, not at the singularities, because it's not. Obviously, not at the singularities because it's not a manifold. What have we better now to do? Okay, questions questions about this about the This, about what I've talked about so far. So, I want to take the rest of the time to say something about the construction. So, if there are any more general questions. So, construction, so our construction. So, part one: What's the opposite? What's the opposite of being cubulated? T. T. Property T, right? So it's the opposite of being cubulated because if you have a property T group, it's got these very strong fixed point properties. In particular, any action on a, by Niblo and Reeves, any action on a, oh, thank you, on a cat-you or Q complex has got a bounded orbit. So we're going to build Some two-dimensional groups with property T. So obviously there are lots of ways to do this, but we're going to build them in a particularly nice way. So maybe I'll just say here, though, why we want to do this. So by theorem of Michael and Reeves. Here we go with Bull and Reeves. These have fixed points when acting on finite-dimensional cube complexes, cat zero cube complexes. So if I can fit, and they're infinite groups, so if I can fit one of these inside my group. So, if I can fit one of these inside my group, it's it obstructs its capabilities, right? So, and then part two is to do that, is to stick them inside of three-dimensional pseudo-manifolds. So, embed these in 3D pseudo-manifold groups. Okay, and this uses the This uses a kind of a reflection trick and some coning. So with a warped product. Okay. Okay, and hopefully I'll be able to explain what I mean by some of that. This, by the way, this part here, the coding with a work product is That coding with a work product is where my joint work with Phobie County is. Part one of Relies. Okay. Okay. So maybe I'll just. So the construction in part one is closely related to work I did with Henry and with Alex Lobotsky on these generalized k-fault triangle groups. The groups that I'm going to describe are finite index torsion free subgroups of those. So So, so maybe I'll just say that. So, related to the right, so let's fix K. Uh k to be 18. Really, it can be uh prime that is one mod four plus one that is at least seven. You know, anyway, it's more general, but we're going to fix k equals 18. And now it's a consequence of work of Lovatsky, Phillips, and Sarnak. Oh, sorry. There's a player that I haven't introduced yet, which is important. So theta is going to be this generalized theta graph with K edges, K edges into vertices. So that's some generalized theta graph. And what Levovsky-Philips Sarnay tells me is that there is. It tells me is that there's a tower of covers. Well, okay, they prove a lot, lot, lot more than this, but for our applications, what we need is that there is a tower of finite shoot covers. I'm going to call these gamma n's. All covering this generalized data graph so that, and they're regular covers, we'll have room for that. So regular covers so that one, the girth of these guys is going to infinity, and second, that the first positive. That the first positive eigenvalue of their normalized Laplacian is at least a half. Don't worry if you don't know what that means. I'm going to tell you how it's applied immediately. So there's a theorem of Ballman and Sharkovsky. Also, related theorem of Juk. And maybe I should mention there's also a better theorem that we don't need, but it's better. Of Oppenheim, that came later. Well, so I should put this in parentheses because I'm definitely not going to say what Oppenheim proved. But what it is, is that if I have a group G is active. G is acting on a cube, not a cube complex, a triangle complex, X geometrically, where X is a contractible triangle complex, so that for all vertices V, the This first positive eigenvalue of the normalized La Bausian is bigger than a half, then g has property t. And hence it has this sort of fixed point property for actions on cube complexes. So what do I want to do is I want to build a complex whose, well, I want to build an aspherical complex whose links look like these graphs, gamma n, for some large n. If the links are, so by the way, the contractibility of the triangle complex would follow as soon as all the links had occurs at least six. Least six, right? Because I can use non-positive curvature. So, great. So now I need colors. Green on a green board. Probably not going to work. I wanted to use green. Okay, I'll use red instead. So, what do I want to do? So, I'm going to take, so I'm going to let T0 be 0 be equal to, I'm going to take k times a hexagon. And so the hexagon is going to have alternating red and white vertices. And then I'm going to glue them along the white vertices. So I'm going to glue, not the white vertices, along the white edges. So, what does that look like? So, here I'm drawing k equals 4 in the interest of time. So I've got a bunch of hexagons glued together along their white edges. And I've got theta in sort of three places. So, that's my T. So that's my T0. And it's an exercise which I was quite stumped by for a little while because I was trying to do the wrong thing, but it's really not that hard. You can ask me about it later, but you get stuck. So the exercise is that for each n, there's a cover of T0, a regular cover of T0, so that every elevation of a theta graph looks like gamma n. So there exists a regular cover Tn to T so that each elevation of theta graph is isomorphic to gamma k. Now, so what have I built? I've built a bunch of, I've got a bunch of hexagons, right? But those hexagons have these colored edges. And if I cone off the red edges of a hexagon, what do I get? Triangle, right? So I get a triangle. So I can take this cover and I can turn it into a triangle complex. And that triangle complex will have the links that I want. So coding off the theta elevations of Of in Tn gives a triangle complex on what's called Kn so that if I take the universal cover, it satisfies if I think about pi one of Kn acting on Kn tilde, satisfies the And tilde satisfies the Balm and Chaikovsky criterion. So this pi 1 of k and has probity 2. Okay. So that's the end of part one. We still have a few minutes spared. I still have nine minutes to talk about part two, which is good. Any questions about what I just did? About what I just did. Okay, good. All right, so part two is we're going to thicken and reflect. Reflect. And it's important to do this in the right order. When I talked about this before, I think I gave the wrong impression. I gave the wrong impression that people were confused about the order I want to do things in. I want to thicken Tn. Well, I'm pointing at T0, but I want to thicken Tn, and now I want to reflect it around and get a three-manifold, and then I want to cone the boundaries of that three-manifold. Let me say slightly more explicit. Slightly more explicitly. Let me draw a picture. So, this is my thick and okay, you get the idea. So, there's a, there's a, this is a, this is a thickened, so H0 is equal to a thickened T0. Easy, bro. Is it clear what I mean? So, this thing clearly embeds new R3, and I really just thicken it, right? Okay, so now I want to put some mirrors on it is where I really want to use three. I'll use yellow. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a picture of the picture. Okay. Oops. Same thing on the back. And same thing on all the other pairs of pants, you see. Right? So what have I drawn? I've drawn this trivalent graph on the boundary of the handle body. So this is the handle body. Drawn a trivalent math, trivalent graph on the boundary of the handle body. So though, and so and why trivalent? So trivalent. Why trivalent? So trivalent, because I want to make each of these, each side, a mirror, and so that those mirrors have right angles with each other. So they have right angles to each other. They should come together three at a time. So, okay, with mirrors at right angles, making right angles. Now I claim that this is a hyperbolic orbifold. And you can use Andreev's theorem to see that. So there's a quotient of this, so quotient by some reflections. And you get this prism, which I'm just going to draw like this. And I have, let's see, can I do this without looking at my notes? I confuse myself. I drew it upside down. That's okay. That's okay. Okay. Everything that's not labeled has angle pi over 2. Everything else has angle pi over the number that's written there, right? Oh, and I should tell you, where's the red? Just because I don't know, because I can't. It's right here. Yeah. It's right here. Okay. Notice where the yellow is as well. So everything that's marked two, well, not everything that marks two. Some of the things that are marked two are yellow, and some of them are not. And one of the things that's marked four is also yellow. Okay. Anyway, I can show it to you later. So those green handles, I mean, the red handles are there? That is right. So the red subsurfaces are in. That is right. So the red subsurfaces are incompressible. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So, Andrea's theorem, which my colleague tells me is due to Roeder, Hubbard, and Dunbar. I'm not going to write down the theorem. As before, I'm just going to tell you something that implies. It implies that this polyhedron has a unique hyperbolic structure, right, with the angles specified. So this polyhedron with specified angles. is hyperbolic. Okay, so I can lift that hyperbolic structure back up to my handle body over there, right? And I can make that handle body hyperbolic. I could make it hyperbolic in other ways too, but this is very concrete. Sorry, you had the body. Did you say it was an auditor at this point? It was an orbifold at this point, like is the yellow stuff. Yes, I want to think of this now as an orbifold. But the yellow stuff is the same. It's got an yeah, that's right. So these are right angles along every yellow thing. I also have a right angle here. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to choose only some of the mirrors. Well, I'm not going to do that yet. First, I'm just going to take a cover. So my cover, TN to T, gives me a cover of. To T gives me a cover of Hn to H, right? So Tn to T gives me a cover, and this is just an ordinary manifold cover, Hn to H not. This is a, maybe I should just say a topological cover or manifold cover is unequal. I'm not using the orbit fold structure yet, but a Yet. But Hn doesn't inherit an orbifold structure. I want to use, so we make Hn into an orbifold using the non-peripheral mirrors. Okay, red equals. Okay, red equals peripheral. Another way I could have said that is I want to use the simply connected mirrors, right? So I don't want to use these other guys as mirrors right now. Because what I want to build now is a hyperbolic three-manifold with totally geodesic boundary. So there is a short exact sequence, if I like, from pi. From pi1 orb of Hn to a certain right-angle Coxeter group. So this is a right-angle Coxeter group. And the kernel is normally generated by the ordinary fundamental group of Hn as a subgroup. So Oh okay, well carefully choose some w prime so that you can cite w as the index. And George and Free. And so this gives me a manifold cover. So if I look at, let's call this map pi. If I look at pi inverse of w prime, gives a manifold covered Of Hn so that Hn, let's call it M. So Hn embeds in a nice way in M and as just a space. And now what do I want to do? So cone off the boundary components. Of n, and then because we were careful, and this is where my work with Colby comes in. This m hat is negatively curved and pi one of Pi one of H n hat, which is equal to pi one of Kn embeds, and pi one of m hat. Thanks. Questions? Uh was not surface to get as the link, Nia, I mean Very, very high genus. Is there a possibility that any low genus? You always get something to go on, and then there's a. I think that's a really great question. It's true, though. If Denis is zero, it's always true anymore. But yeah, that's conjectured to be true. No, it's a three-dimensional pseudo-manifold group. So it's a three-dimensional group. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's a three-manifold group. So yeah, I think that's a great question. That's a great question. I'm just curious as to sort of how general. So it seems like you're saying that in some generality, these generalized triangles can be thickened, at least have colours that can be thickened to be. And it's roughly what the generality is, everyone's like, does that like how to do this? So I did something very special here, which is that for the generalized triangle group, all three corner groups are the same. Right. Right. Right. Right. And so that was what allowed me to solve the exercise. Right? So in general, it's not known whether these things should be virtually torsion free. But yeah, that's the key thing you need, really, is that it's virtually torsion-free. And then you should be able to virtually fit it inside of a three-dimensional silo. Yeah. Pi one of Knowledge. No idea. Great question. If anybody didn't hear it, the question is, is pi one of K n residually finite? It's hyperbolic. So it'd be great if you could show it wasn't. And I mean, you just said this works when they're virtually tortured and free or positive to visually find out that virtually. If they're positioned finding that virtual torture free, yeah, but I've designed actually the, yeah, but it doesn't go the other way. The the yeah, but it doesn't go the other way. I guess it's still question again I'm gonna start again in six minutes. Yeah, I need you to sell my stuff.
