 Very happy to have for our first speaker in the afternoon session, Thomas Brazilton, who will speak on Equivariant Narrative Junction. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to speak, and thanks for everyone who's online. And thanks for everyone who's online, who couldn't be here. So, today I'm going to talk about a program in sort of studying equivariant immune geometry. And sort of the jumping-off motivating question that I want to ask is this question of how is symmetry in maybe a classical enumerated problem. How is this reflected? How is this reflected in the solutions? So when I have the g-action on some sort of enumerative problem that I want to study, if I have some sort of symmetric object and I get an action on the solutions, is that action on the sort of type of question that we're asking. So as a motivating example, we could say that a smooth cubic surface Cubic surface like this, x, which is the vanishing of the degree 3 homogeneous polynomial for our variables. I'm going to say this is symmetric if f is a symmetric polynomial. So an equivalent way to say this is that the space x Is that the space X living inside CP3? This is an S4 space, where S4 is acting on CP3 by convenient coordinates. I get that points on X are sent back to points on X. And this action on projected 3 space is linear, so it sends lines to lines. And if I have a line on a symmetric cubic surface, when I act on that S4, I get another line. The question is, what are the S4 orbits? What are the S4 orbits of the 27 lines on top of a cubic surface? So maybe that's question one, but the question you should answer before that is, does it depend on X? That's the sort of flavor question that we're interested in. Question that we're interested in for the course of this talk. So, a broad outline for what we're doing here. I'm going to talk about a statement that will answer this in the affirmative. This is a version of equivariant, what I'll call equivariant conservation number that I approved a while ago. This leverages tools from equivariant homotropy theory. So it's a purely topological thing, but we can apply it to these situations. We'll see this example of lines on symmetric heat services and we'll answer this question. And then I want to talk about some stuff that I haven't talked about before. So there's a drawing. Haven't talked about before, so there's joint work with Candice on studying bi-tangents to symmetric plane recordings. I also want to investigate sort of the interplay between this geometric symmetry and algebraic symmetry arising from mono-driven drama groups that Stretwork listed on Vermont. And then at the end, if there's still time, I'll sort of describe who else is doing things in this area, what other people are looking at, what sorts of questions we're interested in. And now I'm going to erase all of this. Of this. Maybe I'll be clever and I'll beat this up. Okay, so conservation of number is a phrase, I guess, sort of made famous by Schubert in the late 1800s, but it dates back about 60 years earlier to Poncela and the French School of Projective Geometry. And it was this idea of sort of small checks. Idea of sort of small changes to parameters don't change the number of solutions that you see with a calic multiplicity. If I had some sort of qubit surface and I started to deform it slightly, the lines are going to deform and adjust, but I won't grow any new lines and I won't lose any existing points. The worst that could happen is they merge or something like that. So there's a lot of different ways you can phrase this. And I come from a topology background, so I'll phrase this in terms of the Poincaré Hoch the end, which we saw a version happen. Which we saw a version of in Mark's talk. And it was this idea of let's let e to m be, we will do this with a complex number, let's let it be a complex rank n vector bundle on a smooth, compact, complex n-dimensional manifold. And for any section, so I'll write general in parentheses here, but for any general topological section, sigma from n back up to E, we have the following equality. So I have that the Euler class of E is equal to a sum over the points or the components of the Over to the points or the components of the zero locals of sigma of some local index. All right, so what is this telling us? So this is saying I've got this set up right here. I've picked a section. You could think maybe if this was a tangent bundle or something like that, a choice of section would be a vector field. And I'm counting something about the vector field that depends on the choice of a vector field, but it didn't actually depend when I do this count. That's what this invariance of this Euler class is an invariance of the bundle. The spuler class is an invariant of the bundle down in this section. In this setting, it's the top turn class, but we could extend this. Maybe if we wanted to do oriented real bundles over oriented real manifolds, we could do an Euler class or some weaker notions of orientation that I won't talk about in this talk. Okay. So what are some examples? What are better sector general? Oh, continuous section, yeah. Some topological section. Okay, so what are some examples? Okay, so what are some examples? I could take O of n over CP1 and take it to Euler class. And what I'll get is N. And what does this mean in terms of this language? So if I picked a section here, a choice of section, a choice of section is a degree n linear form, and when it's going to have a rooted infinity with probability zero, so I can dehomogenize. Then I get a degree n polynomial in complex numbers. And the statement is when you count the roots of it with multiple. This statement is when you count the roots of it with multiples, you get n. So that's like a very fancy way to say what the fundamental theorem of algebra is. Another example that we've seen is this statement. So if I have O of M plus O of N over CP2, I get M times N. Again, a choice of section here is a choice of section of each of the line levels. So degree m and degree n curve on the plane. And when I count their intersection points with multiplicity, I'll get m times. Intersection points with multiplicity, all get f times n, and that's basically the f. But this is slightly more general. So a fun example, if you haven't seen this before, is to take something like two conics and take x times y and y times z and look at these. They don't intersect at four points. They intersect at a point on a line. But if you have the right definition of index, you can make sense of this line contributing 3 to the overall count. And this is this idea of residual intersection. Okay. So I'll do one more example, which again we all probably know, but I'll write it anyways. Which is if I take the third symmetric power of the dual topological bundle on GR24, I'm going to get 27. Okay, so what's happening here? So a choice of third symmetric carbon dual to a logical bundle. Symmetric carbon with dual topological bundle is a choice of basically covectors on each of these things. It's a choice of co-vectors on each of the two planes that you're cutting out in MGR24. Turns out every section of this comes from a global cubic form on all of the four-dimensional space. So a choice of this is a choice of cubic surface, basically. This is some cubic form. And what the section is doing is it's taking a point in GR24, or a line in projective 3-space, and it's plugging it into the equation for the. And it's plugging it into the equation for the surface and it's seeing is this zero or not. So when you count the zeros with multiplicity here, you're getting 27, and that's this classical Simon and Cayley count of 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface. A little bit again. So what's the plane, the role of the plane there in that cubic form? Oh, it's the. 2 is 1 and 4 is 3. Yeah, so half line 2 planes and halfine 3. Yeah, so affine two planes in affine four space. Or lines in projective three space, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'll be looking at all the lines in the middle. So indexing, and this is what they line on because you can go. For sure. Okay, so I'm interested in the following setup where e to n is again, let's say, complex rank-n vector bundle on a smooth, compact Smooth, compact, one-dimensional, complex manifold. And I'm going to let B be some finite group so that it acts on each of these things, and e to m is an equivariant vector bundle. And then what I want to do is, I want to take some section that respects the equivariance. So I'm going to let sigma be any section from m backward to E, which is G equivariant with isolated simple zeros. The simple is The simple is important currently. It's a technical assumption in the theorem I'm about to state, but it's something we're hoping to lift in the future. Basically, this is saying, you know, I have 27 distinct plots, so there's no multiplicity. These are the sorts of problems we can look at right now. Okay, so I want a version of this Poincaré-Hopp theorem. So I want some sort of Euler number in this setup that is a sum of. Up. That is a sum over local indices of a given section, but doesn't actually depend on the section. But we saw this in Mark's talk already when we tried to cook up an Euler number in the motivic setting. We needed to use a motivic cohomology theory because you want to use something that's really seeing what you want. And in this setting, we're going to use what's called a genuine equivariant cohomology theory. So if you're unfamiliar with these, I don't have time to explain them. But they're indexed on orthogonal representations of your group rather than just being. Rather than just being edges. So do you have a question? Can you see what is an equivalent vector bundle? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I've got some action on M, some G-action on M as a complex manifold, and I've got a vector bundle up top that also has an action. So this math is equivariant. You can also think about like I'm acting in the fibers and I'm moving around over points. If you haven't seen this, Siegel was sort of the first to study this, and his paper is still one of the most readable sources on it. So are real vector bundles in the sense of real K-theory a case of this? No. No, I don't think so. Well, real just on Z2 equivariant, that's why. Yeah, so but you would need that. Oh, I was checking on C, not on the answer. Okay. So all of this is the setup question. The setup, I should say. So in the setup, so for A, so A is going to be any complex-oriented genuine cohomology theory. If you don't know these words, don't worry about it. It won't end up being relevant. Worry about it, it won't end up being relevant. We get an Euler number and an equality that looks like this. I've got some Euler number that I'll decorate by little n sub g. And I'm going to look at all of the points in the zero locus of sigma, and I'm going to look at the orbit of them under g and then I'm going to transfer one. And then I'm going to transfer 1, which is some abstract class, up from the isotropic group of G to the whole group. And this is taking place in I not G of A. Okay, so this is more like, I'm writing this out so you can see the technical stuff that's happening in the background. But the words in here are maybe more for experts, and let me tell you how you use this. The idea is to pick. The idea is to pick the right zero sigma. The zero local local. So the idea is to pick the right cohomology theory here that's going to have this orientation data, but it's also going to be able to, you know, you'll be able to read off something that's pi naught. So the first example we might take is let A be complex equivalent K3. And what this And what this tells you is that the permutation representation, given by taking the zeros of some section and viewing them as a representation of g is independent of the choices sigma. So in this case, what this means is if I took a symmetric cubic circuit. What this means is, if I took a symmetric cubic surface and I looked at its 27 lines, that's a set of 27 points with an S4 action. If I viewed that as a complex representation of S4, it doesn't depend on the cubic surface state points. But this is not quite a good enough. Yeah. Something funny is happening here. I expected some kind of statement first that symmetric cubics, smooth symmetric cubics will not collect it. That will end up being true. Yeah. Sorry? That will end up being true. Yeah. That will end up being true. Yeah. Right, but you didn't say that. So somehow you just didn't need that. So it's really true, just from the setup. That's the part of the power of the topological thing, is you can make arguments if you know connected components in the moduli. You don't need these arguments if you use the topological machine here. It uses fewer hypotheses. We can talk about this more after, but yeah, it's an interesting thing. So, how do we use the fact that we're using k theory here? Pi nod of couple. Pi naught of complex k theory is a representation, right? This is a computation that you have to do, but this is basically what the transcript does, it does exactly this. Okay, so this is kind of a problem, though, because if I look at finite D sets up to isomorphism and I map to the complex representation ring of G by sending a set X to a permutation representation, this is not injective unless the group is cyclical. Unless the group is signing. So, what's entirely possible is I have two different S4 sets. I could count my lines, and the S4 might act on them differently, but you wouldn't see that using an Euler class value in a complex game thing. You would have to do something a little bit more clever. So, the theorem that you can end up proving is exactly the statement that. Is exactly the statement that before I said, sorry, that confuses me because I think we learned in the representation theory that the permutation representation of a group itself contains all the irreducibles? No, not at all. So the finite G sets decompose if you look at the Burnside ring of thin, for example. These are indexed on conjugacy classes of subgroups, but the representation ring is indexed on conjugacy classes of elements. In the case of S4, for example, if you group completely Or, for example, if you group complete this, you get an 11-dimensional lattice, and this is a five-dimensional lattice. It has a very big problem. Not bijective. There's examples of finite G sets that are not bijective with the G-action. They're not equivariantly bijective, but they have the same permutation representation. These are called Gasman triples, and they've been. Okay. So the theorem is that the G set G of sigma is independent. G of sigma is independent of the choice of sigma, not just the representation. And the proof again, maybe this is only for experts. You take A to B M U G and you use an equivariant version of the nilpoint scale. You actually pull back the Euler class that you get unique to the front-side ring. It is a complex phenotopical coordinate. It's not geometric voices. It ends up being a difference in equivalent setting. So this is like the technical setup, but we have something usable now. We have something we can do anywhere in geometry with. Okay. So no point has been really looking. So no point between really looking at the Burnside ring and this detects everything. Yes, so this is definitely in the image of the unit hot from the Burnside ring, from the sphere spectrum to NUG on PyNOT. And then the idea is to check that there's nothing else, that you're injected on PyNot, basically. And that's a consequence of impotence. But it's like a fancy version of the alpodence that you can find in Bardell Greenleans and Houseman. They're sort of work on a co-gram formal group laws. Okay, so the theorem is that the S4 orbits of the lines on any symmetric cubic surface are the following. So I've got 12 lines that look like copies of C2 sitting inside of S4. Of C2 sitting inside of S4, so they're like the left cosets of C2 and S4. You should say, okay, which C2? There's two of them up to conjugacy, so there's an odd copy and an even copy. One transposition and two destroyed ones. So I've got 12 lines that look like this. They all line in orbit. I've got another 12 lines that look like left posits of the even C2. And then finally, I've got three lines. These form a tri-tangent on your cubic surface. And these form an S formal T. And these form has formed T. So this is three. This is 12 lines. This is 12 lines. You can visualize this on the clutch qubit surface, and I'm going to in a minute, but it involves me pulling this down. And I want to show you other stuff about bitangents, so I'm going to wait. So I owe you a picture of this. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So there's a fun corollary. There's a fun correlation. Is this somehow related with the fact that you can always find double six configurations? This is something I'm curious about. It's definitely related, but I don't quite know how yet. Did you just ask about the vile group of E6? No, he asked about double sixes. Oh. But I'll talk about the vile group of E6 in a bit. So there's this theorem of Schlaifly from the Theorem of Schlaifly from the 1850s that says, okay, what if I was on a real smooth cubic surface? Do I have all 27 lines? And the answer is no, you can have three or seven or 15 or 27. Well, one thing that we notice is this S-core action just moves your coordinates around. Like it doesn't, if you used imaginary numbers to define a line, when you permute it, you'd still have to use imaginary numbers. So it's preserving the field of definition. And I automatically see, like, all three of these lines have to be real or complex. There's no combination of these that gets me seven lines. So you don't see seven lines on symmetric cubic surfaces. Don't see seven lines on symmetric cubic surfaces. And you can actually do a little bit better if there are only three or 27 lines on a symmetric cubic surface. On a smooth, sorry, on a smooth, real symmetric cubic surfaces. So 15, you might think, okay, these could maybe be real. The way to get out. Be real. The way to get out of that is to show that the S4 action actually preserves this additional structure on the lines that I think was first studied by Segre in the 40s: this hyperbolic versus elliptic lines. And then you use that constraint, this is something you're familiar with. You combine it with a rationality constraint, you can get rid of 15. Okay. So any questions about this stuff before we talk about bite titles? Okay. Cool. All right, so if I have, so what is a planar cordic, maybe a smooth planar cordic is the same as a canonically embedded embedded non-hyper elliptic hyperliptic curve of genus three. Three. So, these two classes distinguish hyperbolic and elliptic, is that the definition? These two classes in 12. Yeah, in an orbit, they're either all be hydrobolic or they're all be elliptic. So, mutual answer. I forget, it's in my paper if I'm not sure. I'm not sure which one. So, can I get behind? So, your general theorem, there is no version of this concurrently which actually. Version of this comparatively which actually incorporates these non-tribulated sections that it's much harder. Is that you had this condition of like zeros or something? That's harder, yeah. But if the section is equivariant, is it sort of automatically non-transverse? You won't. It actually is transverse. It'll be transverse, yeah. In the setting. So, because my cortex are canonically embedded curves, this means that the automorphism of the group of the curve extends. Of group of the curve extends to an automorphism on the holomorphic differentials, and therefore it extends to an automorphism on the entire projective plane. So if C is a cortic, it's a smooth planar cortic, but this tells you is that odd of C actually lies inside of PGR3. And therefore, it acts on the 28 by 2 words. That's a nice way. So again, we've It's a nice way. So, again, we find ourselves in the setting of a problem where I've got a G action on something enumerated. If we can set this up as an Euler number computation, then we can use this machinery and just attack them and sort of classify these things. So really setting it? We're looking at quartic curves in the form of a correct way. Yeah, plane quartics, yeah. And we're asking them to be symmetric or just any automorphism that happens to be there. If you have an automorphism, it'll act on the bitangents. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, but that's related to. Yeah, but that's related to like a really interesting question, which is what can this be? So a general quartic, a general curve of genus 3 that's not hyper elliptic won't have any non-trivial algebraisms. But the ones that do, you can say quite a bit about them. We've got this Hurwitz bound that says they're bounded above by 84 times g minus 1. We've got lower bounds on these sorts of things. We can look at this action on Bayerstrafts or on the holomorphic frame. On Bierstrass, on the holomorphic differentials. And this is something people classically did in the late 1800s to classify these kinds of things. So, is there a curve moves on orbits from 168? Yes, it's the Klein coordinate. Klein coordinate. So these were first classified by Beeman in 1896. Cantor had a classification about a year earlier. It's so completely. A year earlier. It's so completely incorrect, but I don't even really feel we should attribute it to him. But Vivon is definitely very inspired by the cancer. Not cancer sets, it's cancer with a K. Cancer. Okay, so these were classified by Vivon in 1896. Then there was a long period of time where, well, so Siani worked on this in the Italian School of Algebraic Geometry for a little bit. And then somehow everybody forgot this had already been done. And you find some theses from the 1970s. And you find some theses from the 1970s that redo this and do it also not correctly. And then finally, Dolgachev comes out and he's like, okay, I know all the old stuff. I know the correct classification. Here it is. And it's still not completely correct. And there's this guy, Barris, who was in Italy, who ran like a whole course on genus 3 curves, did the correct classification, emailed Dolbachev. It's like, okay. And now it's in the book and how it's actually correct. But let me pull this up first because it's really. It's a very interesting presentation. The end. People vote. It's just the number of likes. That's the demographic likes. That's the one that's current. I wrote like three pages of history on this classification in our paper, so you can ask me anything about it. Okay. So this is. Okay. Um so this is the lights. No, this little thing over on the side. You can move it I think. You can move it. From which computer though? I don't know where it's being shared from. Oh wait. Oh. Okay, well you don't really need to see it. Okay, so there's 12 different groups that you can have. I've got this one up top that's the maximal when the curve is gone. This is this Klein cortic. Herbspelling. This is this Klein cortic. I've got the IDs in the gap library if you're interested. And then we've got these equations right here. So the Klein, the DIC Cortic, this type 6 one, these are all unique. Adding as is the type 3 one. And the rest of them have got these three parameters, these A's and D's and C's and D's, that are allowed to vary. And these are actually all the cortics that you're seeing. So as these things are varying, the number of them is actually telling you about the dimension of this component in the moduli space. And we've got generators for. And we've got generators for what happened in PGL3. So, which one was the one that gave the low-batch shell frequency? Was that? Which one was the one that gave the low-bread shell miss? Originally, I forget. I think some of the equations were wrong originally. But they're all fine in this book now, as far as I know. Oh, yeah, P is the Pauli group of 40 or 16 that appears in all the equivalents. Also, quick show of hands, how many people know this? Circle and circuit. Okay, good. Okay, Candice and I thought we just said really bad group theory. This is like the central product. You've got some identification of subgroups of each of the centers, and you mod out the product by the diagonal of that. I didn't know what I had to work it up. Okay, so using this machinery, we can prove the following theorem. If I have any group that appears in that list, so one of these 12, and if I take any smooth quartic whose automorphism group is that G, then the action of G on those 28 by 10 doesn't depend on the choice of C. Of y tensions doesn't depend on the choice of C. It'll act on these independent choices of I curve. And we can compute it in each of these cases. Again, I don't recommend you read this right now. This is in our paper, and we'll have it. Or you can take a picture screen. But there's some interesting things happening here. So for the Klein cord, it's acting transitively on the bytechings. This is something that was known to Klein. This is something he studied and was very interested in. The rest of this, to my knowledge, was not known. So, in some sense, this is kind of like a continuation of Klein's work, which is studying, again, how the symmetry is acting among these different things with liquids. So, where does the S3 come from in the quarter? I mean, I could tell you what it is as a subgroup, like PSL2. No, no, no, my question is: can you see an S3 in words of automorphisms of the? Automorphisms of the client mortic, which acts trivially on the right end. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You can write it down explicitly. Morally, why it exists, I don't care. So in a complex case, you can also see these pipelines, the shadows, right? You can. Yes, yeah. Absolutely. And that's one way to do this. 28 is 27 plus 1. That's one way to do this. But it's unclear how the symmetry translates to rules. So for the symmetry, the picture is 10. Symmetry with the picture functions. Yeah, because you have like PGL4 symmetry versus PGL3 symmetry. So it's a little unclear how that works. But if you take one of these groups and embed it into another one. Yeah, we'll talk about that. Okay, so let me show you some fun pictures. This is the Klein cortic. This is the type 1. When you graph this out, you see three real bitangents that we graphed in a now very famous shade of green. And the four real bitangents, the existence of however number of real bitangents. However, number of real bitensions you have is very related to the topology of the builder. I'm seeing one oval here. So, if you know about Hilbert's 16th problem in the classification of real cortex, that's very related to how many real bactained you seeing had worked in soy then. Unfortunately, the real topology of the curves doesn't seem to be related to the symmetry in any meaningful way. We've got another fun picture. This is the type 4 cortic. This has some S4 action, and the lines that are here in green. And the lines that are here in green lie in an odd C2 orbit for S4. We're not seeing all of them over the reel, some of them are complex. And the ones in pink are S4 and minus 3. And then we've also got this type 10 quartic. This is one of the ones in this moduli of climate 4 things that has three parameters. It has 16 real bitangents. These all form, they're acted transitively on by the Klein quarter. And then you've got these extra things, which are different copies of C2 and K4. Different copies of C2 and K4, and those are all living over the complex numbers. Any triple points on the UMS? That's another very good question that I don't know the answer to. Yeah, there's a lot of things you could ask here. Okay. Right, yeah, so Mark asked about subgroups. So this is the lattice of subgroups and inclusions. We found this in, well, in something that referenced Hen's PhD thesis from the 70s, which is one of these things that reproved all this stuff. Things that like reproved all this stuff. We've got some new stuff that's not in the original thing, these special values that allow your automorphism groups to grow, and the dashed lines I'll explain. So what's happening here is you have each of these inclusions, and for us, just due to like restriction and basic group theory and equivariant homotopy theory, if I had some S3 quarter, kind of looked at the action on the bitangence, when I restrict the action to C2, the answer we computed here gets mapped to the answer we computed there. map to the instrument there. So all of our computations are compatible with this subgroup structure. But I also want to point something out about this subgroup structure that is maybe obvious to some people, but maybe not obvious to others, is we have these sort of free parameters that let you vary. And what that told you is like the dimension of each of these components. So that's sort of, you should view these as cells. And then you've got these special values where as I'm moving in the family, somehow geometrically, my cortic starts to look really nice. It starts to look really nice all of a sudden and it attains an extra symmetry and that allows the anomalous group to grow. And these special values, you should think about that as gluing theta. So, this whole subgroup structure, this is a recipe for building and stratifying the modules of the true coordinates. So, how do you find these special values? All quotes. Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, okay, sure. All coordinates. So, how do you hunt for these special values? If you're Klein, or if you're If you're Klein, or if you're people in the late 1800s, you are just like walking around with a mass of amazing identities that projective, like homogeneous polynomials satisfy, and you just know them off the top of your head. And you're just like, boom, oh, if A is equal to 1, I've got this change of coordinates that I can do this type of stuff. It's really cool, and it's really beautiful, and it works, but you miss a lot of stuff. And I think because group theory hadn't fully crystallized at this time, that's part of the reason there's so many gaps in this classification. The correct way to do it is to maybe look at the C3 that's sitting inside of PGL4, and we have, or PGL3, we have explicit things for it, and look at all the ways you can conjugate it to lie inside of C6. And there might be different, I mean this one there won't be, but when they're not abelian, you might have different conjugacy classes. And then you change the equation of it, and then you take the additional symmetries and you act on them by the equation to see which specific values you have. And there's certain cases where you actually don't have any ways to clue this. Don't have any ways to glue. So there were these arrows in the original subgroup lattice, but they weren't pointing out, you know, in these old papers, they were sort of like, oh, you can glue, but there's actually no values for which that works. What's the bundle whose Euler class you're computing for this? Yeah, it's a little bit involved. There's a really good overview of it in Isabel Boat and Hannah Larson's paper on bitangents. And also there's like a slightly worse version of it in our paper. Slightly worse version of it in our paper. Okay. Cool. Any questions about this before? Oh, I'm assuming we're in all time. Sorry, I was actually a little confused by your answer to Andre's questions. At the top one, you have cosets of an S3 sitting inside of PGL or PSL going to PSL or something. But like that you said, there is actually an S3 software that acts trivial a little bit like that, yes? Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. It's not the same S3, though. It's slightly weird here. So the parameters, you might have to sort of change coordinates and introduce new parameters. But that would make it S3 more mobile. No, no, no. Because it's not necessarily conjugate to this S3 in the big group. So it might be a different action on the base space than on the equipotel. Right, but it is true that on a type Ortic, there is an S3 that exists. Why does it think it's a general solution with BSF27? Why is it not normal? Yeah. Shouldn't be because BSL2 is something. I'm just yeah. Oh. It might be normal, I'm not sure. But that's a simple group. But in the ambient group, I see what you're saying. That's what it's meant. Yeah, yeah. Okay, we should talk about that later. All the different embeddings you can All the different embeddings you get, like from C2 and all these different things. If you put everything in PGL3, you're saying they're all conjugate. Is that there's no reason. No, no, definitely not. So, why would you get the same answer? If you're changing the action on something, you have the same group, but it has a priori a different action on whatever model. It's because the Euler class doesn't require that group to be the full automark. Root to be the full automorphism group, but just requires it to act. Yeah, but it doesn't depend on the action. It does, it does. Oh, you're saying, oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, so maybe there's a... What's the right way to phrase this, but? Yeah, sorry. So I guess for, yeah, for, okay, if I have a Pauli group action that extends to this by a sort of specific way, on that one where it extends the restricted. On that one where it extends, the restricted action is the same, but not necessarily for all the ways that it can extend. But it's okay, can you feel it's a tiny way? It is weird, yeah. So if you have different conjugacy classes, it might be different, but in the cases where you get an extension, you have both of these, right? So it's fine. All right. Okay, brief palette cleanser. Everyone was showing photos of BAMP. And last time I was here, it was like the dead of winter. It was like 10 degrees below zero. It was like 10 degrees below zero. And I thought, oh, it'd be so fun to show everyone what it looks like when there's snow on the mountains. And then I woke up today and there was snow on the mountains. So I guess this is maybe less interesting though. All right. So I promised you a picture of this. So this is the Kleft cubic surface. And these are these different, this is odd, this is even. And then I've got this tri tangent right here, these three lines. And it's important to remember that those are there and that they form a tri tangent. And now we're going to get rid of the visuals. Unless anyone wants to look at this for longer. Oh, actually, it's a triangle. The red thing is a triangle. The red thing is a triangle, yeah. And then the other ones have triple lines, it looks like. Yeah, some of them do, for sure. That's a tri-tangent? Yeah. Is it a triangle? I'm not stating anything about the tritangents other than I've got three lines here and they are in a tritangent. That's important to remember. Oh, it's when the three lines are coplanar. Yes, you've got three points of intersection. Yes, you've got three points of intersection, but the tandem points. You maybe flashback your list for classifying the groups. Yeah. So the classification, like this one. Oh, yeah. So, right, but it can be the one where you actually give for the various cortex invariants of that and so on. You're looking at S3, then you're going to. So it does say, I mean, you give the rules as well, so somehow it does say that I think what Mark's asking is true, that there's a unique C2, unique quantitative class of C2s in PGL3C, which realizes symmetry aspects. There's something unique about room appears only in quantitative classes. Yes, yes, okay. Thanks, yeah, that's exactly it. So there's no other C, there's no other C. So there's no other C, there's no other custom kind of other C2 variables, but we only have three variables. One minus one minus two is the same. Yeah, thank you. All right. So the very last thing I want to talk about is this idea of Galois groups and a new root of Galois. So I'm not, I won't define this formally. The big idea is that. The big idea is that the Galois group of an enumerative problem is the extension, maybe let's say, over the field of parameters. And the extension is of the field of solutions. I'll make this, I'll give an example which will make this precise. But the first real thing written about Galois theory, the first legitimate tome, was Jordan's work in 1870. And he had this as an example. This is something he wanted to look at. When we were developing Galois theory of fields, he was also like, here's a numerative problems. Let's look at, you know, I've got some parameters that are kind. Let's look at, you know, I've got some parameters that are defining something downstairs. I've got some parameters defining solutions. Let's study this. And so he wrote this, and then nobody really did anything with it for 100 years. Like the Dalmat closure. Yes, it'll be... Wait, sorry. Extension? Yes. Polynomials and n variables. Yeah, it's the normal closure of it, maybe. Whatever. Yeah, no. So this sat for about 100 years, and then Joe Harris has this amazing. Years and then Joe Harris has this amazing paper that we probably are all familiar with, which is Galois groups and integrative geometry. And what Joe is able to prove is that the Galois group is equal to the monodrome group. So let me do an example. I could look at Q. Example. I could look at cubic surfaces, which is P19, so 20 coefficients. And I can chop out the discriminant locus. And I've got this sort of space that's limited here. And I think about this is C adjoined as algebraic variables, A0 through A19. And then living over this, I've got some cover. And this is the incidence variety. And this is the incidence variety of 27 lines. And the idea with this is this is a branch cover. What does incidence mean? I mean, the variety of 27 left, it's white branch one. Yeah, exactly. And it's branched over the discriminant bonus, right? Yes, yeah. So it's not branched over that. Oh, sorry, yeah, branched over P19. Oh sorry, yeah branch over P19. Yeah, let's do it. Nice. Okay, so it makes sense to either, you know, look at, okay, adjoin more variables that correspond to the variables you need to define the lines, and then mod out by the relationship they're being on the lines. That is some big field extension of whose normal closure I can take. Or I could take a point down here, let's say after I chop out the discriminant locus. Let's say after I chop out the discriminant locus, and I can look at classes in ply one and lift them and look at the automorphism that they induce on the 27 elements in the fiber. I mean, it's not a finite overload. I mean, this doesn't actually sound as a finite overload without development. So, right, so you're okay because you're thinking, that's a microcraft. Yeah, cool. So, it's not, I don't, it's not even a branch. It's not a branch. Oh, I see. No, I see. Yeah, you can. I think you really want to have to blow up the cover of a word to chat with the rest. Okay. So the classical result is that the Galwaku of this is the bio Group 6. Galua of the cover. Yes. Galwaku of the cover of the problem, depending on sort of what language you're using. So, what this means is that if I look at all of the loops that are generated, all of the loops in the base that go around the discriminate locus, I lift them, I get elements in the symmetric group on 27 things. These end up being the incidence-preserving automorphisms of the Schlafely graph. So, here's a question you can ask. Do you know what the fundamental words of that of that Of that P12 constant discriminant on this. Probably. But it's, I guess, I don't know enough the top of my head. So it's like this one. You might have different components for the discriminator. It's very sensitive. So you can ask, what is the Galois group of lines on symmetric cubic surfaces? Okay, so what do I mean by this? I've got some locus in here of symmetric cubic surfaces, and I might start at one and do some sort of loop that stays inside the symmetric locus. And I might do deformations that only live in the world where I have symmetry, lift them, and then just see what subgroup of the value of V6 do I have. So an S4 symmetric. Yeah, S4 symmetry. So I think this is interesting, but I also got a lot of people who I I also got a lot of people who I really respect to also think this is interesting, and that I think is the more validating part of this. So, I had floated this, and Frank Satilli had done some sort of preliminary computations on Galois groups of lines on S5 symmetric multi-three folds because he was like, that's a cool problem. I was hanging out with Benson Farb earlier this year, and we were chatting about this, and he really liked this problem for the reason that this is a very well-studied flavor problem in geometric group theory in a dynamic. In geometric group theory and in dynamics. But in all of those cases, the topological group that you have for your cover is continuous, it's infinite. And you use that topology in some way. So this is like, it has that flavor of problem, but you don't have access to tools from type Miller theory and things like that. So you sort of need different things to talk about this. And the symmetric cubics are also like a some projective space minus the discrete policies? Yeah, it's a linearly embedded P2 that you drop out the discrete locations, yeah. Okay. All right, so. Alright, so proposition is the, I'll call this maybe the symmetric monodroming, the symmetric Galois group. This is contained in the normalizer of S4 in the value group of V6. So we have to say what is that S4 living in the value group of V6? There's eight numbers. Living in the value of V6. There's eight non-conjugate copies, so that's four living there. So you have to find the right one. But once you do that, you can prove this type of proposition. And the proof sketch is basically Luna's slice theorem. This is an etal version of the slice theorem from differential geometry. And what this tells you basically is when you act via the normalizer, you get some sort of universal deformation space for S4 symmetric cubics. And when I act via monodrome, it leaves that S4 intact. By a monodrome, it leaves that S1 intact. So you can land inside of this. And this has order 96. So it's not the full 51,000. We've really reduced the monodroming. But we're still not quite there. So what else can I say? Well, if we remember that red tritangent, I had those three points. And bio group of E6 would act transitively on these tritangents. But that specific tritangent is common. But that specific tritangent is common to all of the symmetric cubic surfaces. And so it's stabilized by the Vile group. And the stabilizer of a tritangent in the Vile group is an index 45 subgroup. That's how you prove that there's 45 tritangents. But it's more than that. It's pointwise stabilized by the Vowel group. So another proposition you can prove is that the pointwise stabilizer So, by which I mean it stabilizes each of the points in the, or each of the lines in the tritangent. So, of the S form on D8 tritangent, this contains the symmetric monogram. So, I've got two conditions here. I'm constrained in this sort of thing that's coming from differential geometry, roughly, and I'm constrained. Geometry rough width. And I'm constrained in this sort of thing, and this is coming from this observation that you've got these comic trectangles. And this is a group of order 192. So I'm contained in this, I'm contained in that, I'm contained in the right intersection. So the lemma is that the symmetric monjomy Is either trivial, cyclic of order 2, or decline 4 group. So this is not, the intersection of these is not K4, it's K4 times K4. So you have to be a little bit careful here. But what you can do is you can talk about, okay, well, what would monodromy actually do to these orbits? I've got these like three orbits of lines with S4 actions. We understand these pretty well. You can study all these things, they end up being. You can study all these things, they end up being everything in here is going to be involutions, and these have some sort of the decompose into different transpositions, and the number of those transpositions actually ends up being very important. And so you can do some sort of very rough group theory analysis of how S4 is living in the Valve 156, and you can reduce the symmetric monodermy is the Galileo group of the cover when you're the lines over there. Yeah, yeah. So I'm confused as to how. I think it's in how they could like the limit is saying that it's more than the proposition. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So the limit's stronger than the previous proposition. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you need the proposition. Okay, so this is surprising. I think at the end he's going to tell us what it actually is. It's in suspense. Okay, so this is surprising for a few reasons. The first one is that it's not big. There's this philosophy of like big monodroming, that people talk about, that monodroming groups tend to be very, very large. And the fact that we can get this down, there's most four elements in it, is very interesting. And it's also not what the experts expected when they talked to people about this problem before starting it. I mean, the section that's tried with Siddharth Ramana, probably should have said. What's also interesting is this K4. K4 doesn't intersect the S4 that's living in the value of V6. It intersects it trivially. That S4 was the symmetries of the cubic surface and the symmetries of the lines. Remind us what your answer for what the representation, the S4 representation was of those 27 lines. Yes. Like the sum of three lines. Am I good on top? S4 mod C2. S form on an odd C2, S form on an even C2, and S form on A. With that group then sort of, it can't change that. It has to be the same. The K4 does not live in the S4 at all. It only intersects the S4 at the identity. So that's under my surprising bullet points. Why is that surprising? I'm living in the symmetric locus. Everything has an S4 symmetry. The lines have an S4 symmetry. If you want to witness that. The lines have an S-board symmetry. If you want to witness that S-board symmetry by monodromy, you have to leave the symmetric locus. You have to do a loop that goes outside of it and comes back. Which is very strange to me. I don't still understand why that's true. So this is somehow a statement that goes almost opposite to what it pairs. Yes, absolutely. It's very different and super strange. So the OR that I can clarify the OR and the lemma that depends on something, or you just have exactly the example of this case. We can, yeah, if I intersect these two constraints, I get a case. These two constraints, I get a K4 times K4, and then you can do an analogous of this. You can do an analysis with the cycle types of each of those things are enough, and you can get it down to one of the K4s. Roughly. Right, so you haven't solved your problem anymore. No, he's being coy. Just let him go. It's, yeah, yeah. That's what it's faster. That's what you're doing. Okay, so see you're in progress. Is the Gala group is K4? Thank you. That's why that was a level. Alright, how do you prove this? It's a theorem star because we're not done proving it, but I'm going to tell you how you prove this. We just have to show there are two distinct Distinct non-tribute loops. Right, that's all you have to do. You have to find two loops and show they do different things, and they're not the ideas. All right, well, how do people do this in the real world? They do it by something called homotopy continuation. So I've got my base space right here. Let's imagine I've got, you know, here's my cover, and I've got these fibers up. My cover, and I've got these fibers that live upstairs, and they do something. So, what you might do is you might say, okay, let's pick a specific symmetric cubic surface, and I'm going to solve for equations for all the lines sitting above it. Then, what I want to do is I want to see, okay, what is the induced permutation, and can I prove that that's what this is? So, what you would do with a computer. By the loop that comes back. Oh, you choose a loop. Yeah, you pick a loop, yeah. You choose a loop. Yeah, you pick a loop. Yeah. So let's say I picked a loop already. Unless it's my computer calculation follows. I'm going to do a computer calculation. Yeah. Okay. So what do computers do? They do a little Newton's method to slide over. And then they do another Newton's method vertically to get back to the curves. And then they do it again. And you keep iterating, and you track these loops through, and you go around and you come back. This is something called And you go around, you come back. This is something called homotopy continuation. What's up? Yeah, you got a little path downstairs. You're homotoping by T. You're doing little epsilon steps to get around. So this is not a new idea. I mean, this is very, very old. But if you've been sort of paying attention to what's happening in computational algebraic geometry, In computational algebraic geometry, over the last five years, there's been an absolute explosion in what we're capable of doing with this. There's this homotopy continuation Juliet package that came out in 2018, and it's just like orders of magnitude better than anything that came before it. And this has seen applications not only in pure math, right? In like computational algebraic geometry, numerical analysis, this is also in computer vision, in robotics, and mathematical chemistry. If you are interested in any of this, just watch any talk Ray Instrument Philosoph has given in the last five years, and he'll talk about. That's given in the last five years, and they'll talk about this. But there's an issue, which is: I've got two paths, and what happens when they do this? How do I know, if I'm a computer, that I didn't accidentally jump between the paths and exchange them? You run your program, you do this. Your computer has no way of knowing. It did what you told it to do. So, what you have to do is you have to do something that's relative. You do something that's relatively new, this is within the last 10 years, called certified tracking. And this basically guarantees this doesn't happen. It makes your steps small enough, does analysis as you move through, so that you are certain you avoid something like this. And it does more also. It sort of guarantees that none of the things go off to infinity, none of them merge. These aren't things we'll care about, but that's not enough. Okay, so the problem is that there's not really any supported software for this right now. There's stuff that was about There's stuff that was about 10 years old by Anton Lincoln and some other people. There's some Rust package that came out by some French group of mathematicians last year that apparently is really, really great, but I don't know how to use Rust. And there's Tim Duff and Keeson Lear working on building this into Macaulay 2, but it's contingent on building complex interval rhythms into Macaulay 2, which is like an internals project that's slated for next summer. So we don't really have software to do this, but the second we do, I know what the loops are. I know what the loops are, and you plug them in, and it definitely will be K4. We've run enough of these computations, but we're certain that's what it is. So it's just about finding the right software and plugging it in. So, how does K4 act on those lines with respect to this representation number? Yeah. Right. So you've got one of them completely interchanges these two orbits. Okay. And the other one swaps stuff inside one orbit but leaves the other fixed. And this is always. But leaves the other fixed. And this is always fixed, otherwise. Okay. It looks like an outer automorphism in S4? It didn't live inside the S4. It only intersects S4 at the identity, yes. It wouldn't be normalized. It will be the normalizer, yeah. Okay, so in my remaining. I started a little late, so I'm going to take two minutes. I want to say what else is going on in these sorts of areas. Well, maybe let me say, I'll say one last thing about this product, is you've got the, we prove this theorem, and then you get that it's K4, and that's like an interesting theorem, and it's fun and all. But the next thing that I think you really want to do is you want to study this monodromy via variation of hot structure of the symmetric cubic surfaces, and witness this monodromy as living in there, and sort of reprove the theorem from that perspective as well. I think that'll reveal a lot more about why it's capable. Reveal a lot more about why it's paid for. Okay, so who else is doing what in this direction? There were three undergrads, Linds, Liz, and Elrod, who, for those of us who were at PCMI recently, there was this experimental math lab that they do out there where they give undergrads a project to work on and they go and do it. And unbeknownst to me and Candace, there are these three undergrads. In Canvas, there were these three undergrads just like looking at our theses and trying to do equivalent to numerative geometry, which was a little bit terrifying at first, but then ended up being really fun. So they worked on studying phase use theorem in the context of symmetric paper surfaces. And they got some really cool results. They got a lot farther than I think I would have in three weeks where I am undergrad. So I'm encouraging them to write this up. So Iverson Wang is an undergrad at Colorado College. Colorado College and it's mentored by Luis Garcia Puente. And he's working on lines on symmetric, so S5 symmetric when to threefolds. This was an open problem that I floated at Frank Sitteri's birthday conference over the summer. And Luis emailed me and was like, I have this other guy who's working on it. Irishman's also gotten very Just working on it. Irishman's also gotten very far. Computing S5 orbits of 27 S4 orbits of 27 lines you can do by hand. Computing S5 orbits of 2,875 lines is not something you want to do by hand. So this is very much a computational problem. Michael Zhang, who is a graduate student at Washington, is working on the 315, I don't know if this is going to mean anything to anyone, but ace is agetic tetrads. Anyone, but as a jetic tetrads, bitangents. When I have bitangents, I can pick four of them and look at the eight intersecting points and ask if they lie on a common conic. If they do, I call it an ausogenic tetra. There's a classic computation that there's 315 of them. So you can ask, what does that conic look like? Does it have symmetry? So there's interesting questions that Michael's working on. And the last thing I want to mention is work with myself and Zhang Kang. And this is, I'll say this is real symmetric cubics. So John was my master's thesis. She's now my master's student, and now she's a student at that part of Chicago. The idea here is that you've got like this P2 that's your symmetric hewed surfaces, and I've got this discriminant locus that does all this weird stuff. And in the complex numbers, I can loop around these and come back, and that's what creates monodrumming. Over the reels, you can. That's what creates autodramming. Over the reels, you can't do that. So you have to cross. And when you cross, as we said, you lose your 27 lines at branch at certain points. So this means that my lines that have equivariant, they merge equivariantly somehow, and then they unmerge equivariantly. So there's some sort of equivariant wall crossing that's happening that I super don't understand. That's one thing we want to work on. And the very last thing, also in this project, is you have each of these chambers. You can ask what's happening in each of these and how big are these relative to one another. And there's a way to do this by work of Altab Carlson and Toledo from 10, 20 years ago, where if you have a cubic surface, you take a degree 3 cyclic covering, you look at a degree 3 fold, you look at the variation of hodge structure of that, and then you take the period mapping, and you can visualize the moduli of real cubic surfaces as a hyperbolic ball quotient. When you do that, you have access to the theory of Copsett groups, and it allows you to compute relative. Theory of Coxider groups, and it allows you to compute relative volumes for each of these. And you can make statements that say like 33.3%, it's not a third, it's like 33.4% of cubic surfaces, real cubic surfaces have 15 lines or something like that. You can do that without a probability distribution. It's all coming from hyperbolic geometry. So, what we're interested in doing is doing the exact same thing, setting up the moduli symmetric cubics as a hyperbolic ball quotient. It's not that I've started doing this, but then So, not that I've started doing this, but then using this theory, it's like pure relative volume to the various chambers. And I'll wrap up there. So, beautiful talk. So, the two examples you presented were sort of philosophically and
