I've learned lots of stuff already and look forward to watching more videos to be honest. And the only thing I'm missing is those hikes. So I hope Robin is going to post pictures at some stage. So I'm speaking today on mapping objects for Orby Spaces. And for those of you who haven't seen Orby Spaces, I will be introducing them. It's a joint work with It's a joint work with Laura Skull, and also, at least the beginning part of it was joint work with Vesta Kufal, Carmen Rovi, and Courtney Dache. That part of the work has been published, and Laura and I are working on completing the second half of the project. So, informally, Orbi spaces were originally introduced by Sedake as manifolds and Manifolds and were, and they are, as I said, informally, you could think of them as spaces that are locally given as the quotient of an open subspace of Euclidean space or any other space you like by the action of a finite group. The point is that I don't just want to have that quotient part. I also want to know where it came from. So I want that information about the group. That information about the group there. And so Thurston studied them under the name of Orby Faults, and then they became Orby spaces once we started looking at them because we actually don't want to worry right now about the smooth structure. So that's hence RB space is better than RB faults, although I might slip occasionally say RB faults. So they were introduced in terms of atlases, so local information in terms of atlases. So, local information in terms of Atlas charts. In my thesis, I introduce them as a particular kind of topological groupoids, and that's the representation that we will be using today. Just to give you a nice example, here is a print by MC Escher with an illustration of one of the wallpaper patterns. And if we take its underlying space, we would end up with just a triangle. Would end up with just a triangle, the fundamental domain. And but I don't just want the triangle, I want the information that there were Z2s along the boundary and the dihedral groups of order six on the corners. And so I could do that with an ATLAS, but I can also do that by giving you a topological group point. The quickest way given this representation would be to say, well, I take space of objects to be R2. Space of objects to be R2, and the space of arrows to be the product of R2 with the discrete group that goes with this particular wallpaper pattern. And the source map of the group point is given as the projection, actually the second projection here, and the target is by the action. But if you were like, well, but how did you know that you had that nice representation in terms of? That nice representation in terms of a wallpaper pattern. I could also do it with just local information. And so here's again that underlying space. And now I'm just looking at one of the corners and say, well, this was the quotient of a disk by action of the dihedral group of 46. And I can do the same thing for the other two corners. And if I make them big enough, that will cover the whole thing. That will cover the whole thing. And so, in that case, each one of them will give me an action group point for the dihedral group on the disk. So, we have three of those. Without doing anything else, I would have three corners, but not a triangle yet. So, then there are these pieces here to tell you how to glue those things. You, how to glue those things together, and you may, if you want to think about that, each one of them goes with a particular kind of reflection. So, for instance, the green one here connects the three things with the solid line with the other three, which would give you three times three is nine, um, but um, times two is eighteen because we have the action where the set two. Action where the set two, and another times two for giving the inverses get you to 36, if you're wondering where that came from. Okay, so what's important about the group points you have just seen is that the isotropic groups are finite, so the groups that keep a particular point fixed are finite, although the overall group may be infinite, and that the group points are etael. And so, in the sense that the source and target map are etael. Target map, I tell. So that finite isotropic group is translated into that combined source target map is proper, and that means that we have a closed with compact fibers and source map is it down. And so those are our orbit group points for today. Sometimes people might work with a larger class, they make one close on the monitor equivalents. Strictly speaking, I might have to do that once today, but all the other group boys will. Today, but all the other group points will satisfy this property. So, today, Orby spaces are proper etau groupoids. Okay, so what are maps between them? Well, at the very least, you should allow for your groupoid homomorphisms. So, those are pairs of continuous functions between the spaces of objects, spaces of arrows, and commuting with all the relevant structure maps, so internal continuous functions. Continuous functions. But that's not enough. I just gave you two groupoids to supposedly both represent the billiard orbifold. And you would, if you think about it for a moment, be able to see that you can't make those isomorphic with just these maps. And here's another example. If I take a manifold, I can turn it into an Orby groupoid by either just taking the manifold itself for the space of objects. Manifold itself for the space of objects, space of arrows, and take identity structure maps everywhere, call it GM. And I can also take some atlas for my manifold and take the disjoint union of the charts as my space of objects. And then the space of arrows becomes the disjoint union of the pairwise intersection of the charts, etc. There's obviously a map going from GU to GM, but also quite obviously. But also, quite obviously, not one the other way. So, but you have just seen the first example of what I want to call an essential covering map. And so let's introduce those on the next slide. So an essential covering map, in order to give you one, I need to start by giving you, well, a collection of opens of GNOTS. I'm for tonight, because I have to. I'm for tonight, because I have 20 minutes only, going to say that it's a locally finite collection of opens, and I'm going to assume that all my spaces are para-compact and locally compact. And I don't require this to be a covering of genotype, just want it to meet every orbit, because I'm thinking of being essentially surjective rather than surjective on objects. And then my space of objects for the domain group point will be the disjoint union of those u's. Union of those use and these map on the space on the objects is just the inclusion embedding for each component of the use. And then for GU1, I define it using this pullback here. That pullback says that if I have defined phi in this way, it's fully faithful as a functor. Fully faithful as a functor. So now we are fully faithful according to this part, and we are essentially surjective according to the first part. So this is also what we sometimes call an essential equivalent, except it's a very special one because I only want the ones that come from these coverings. They satisfy the conditions to give me a bicalculus of fractions and the And the by category of fractions, I'm going to take a couple of shortcuts and just tell you a very nice representation for it. The arrows will be the standard six spans with an essential covering to the left and an arbitrary map to the right. You can think of this as it's a map from G to H, but it's represented on U because it needed a particular breakup of the space. It couldn't be defined on the whole space at once. Whole space at once. For two cells, this is where I think I'm very nice in this particular bicategory fractions. I don't have to take equivalence classes. I'm just going to have a pseudo-pullback on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, I can just take the transformation that I really like to think about. So the pullback is there to kind of set up the frame so that I have a transformation from phi to psi, but it's going to, of course, from phi after p to psi after q. The p to psi of the q, and that's all. So, because I'm working with these locally finite covers, this makes sure that my home groupoids are small, so I can hope to put a topology on them to turn them into mapping objects. Furthermore, just to, if you haven't heard the word meritor equivalent before in this context, groupoisodite. Context, group points that are equivalent in this bicategory of fractions are called morita equivalent. Okay, so what do we want from our mapping objects? Well, we want an exponential, which means we would like to have that writer joined to the products. And it would be nice if we also had a bicategorical enrichment, which would mean that I need a composition that is giving me a morphism. Giving me a morphism. And that was the part that we had problems with in the past. And today I can tell you that we have a solution for that. So that's the part that we are really excited about. And so just to say now, the second part, in principle, there are lots of solutions to that one. But what we really want is that it's the same solution as to the first one. And the solution to the first one is unique up to monitor equivalence. So we can now actually show. So, and we can now actually show you that we do have a solution that works for both at the same time. Sorry, Direct, by solution, do you mean a notion of composition? Yeah, so indeed, a morphism of composition that is actually going to work with the same, like you could put some different topologies there and it will work. I mean, take discrete or indiscrete to something stupid. But what we want is that the same topology that I'm using to get this guy, I also want. I also want there to work for the composition. And it won't work with the functor, but it will work if you allow yourself a morphism of or big groupoids. So we have a span. And so that's what I will show when we get there. So just to tell you what's happened in the literature so far, Wei Min Chen tackled the problem in 2006 and groupoids had. Groupoids had not become as well known yet at that point. So he used a different representation for RB faults or b spaces. And which made bookkeeping really hard. And he writes in his introduction, it would be really nice if somebody could do this in terms of group points. So that's the answer to his question. He also did think about enrichment, but he could only tell us that the composition was. That the composition was giving a map between the underlying quotient spaces of the Orby spaces. So you take the mapping spaces, you get the underlying Orby spaces, or the underlying quotient spaces, topological spaces now. He had a continuous map there. So we are able to upgrade that to a map of Orby spaces there. Dave Cartudi and Barang Nui were working more in the same vein as where we are working because they were working with stacks, but they were working with the market. Stacks, but they were working with a much larger class of stacks and didn't bother to sort out whether if you started with RB spaces, you would end up with an RB space again for a mapping stack because it wasn't their question and they thought it had been answered by Weimin Chen, so don't worry about it. So we can now nicely show that that actually happens. Okay, so for topological groupoids, everything works. I mean, as long as you assume that your spaces are locally compact, then you Then you can do this, or you can even go more fancy and work with case spaces. But right now, we don't want to do that, we'll just assume local compactness. But then there is a groupoid that gives you the mapping group point and gives you enrichment as well. So we'll take that and try to lift that to our bicategory of fractions. So the humps in the bicategory of fractions are actually, this is without topology right now. Actually, this is without topology right now, just as categories. There are two filtered pseudocorlimits of HOMS in the original bicategory that you started out with. And so we want to lift that and say, well, let's take the pseudocolimit of the topological group points instead and see what we get that way. So, well, if you and from now on, I will assume that my domain is compact because otherwise this won't work. So I'm assuming well, orbit compactness to be precise, for K. Orbit compactness to be precise for K. And if you then calculate the topology becomes with that pseudocode limit, we get that the topology on the space of maps is going to be, so this is the space of these spans. It's going to be the disjoint union over the epsilon u's and the essential covering maps. And on the right, and then you take the map. And on the right, and then you take the mapping spaces for the right-hand arrow. So the G map from K upper star U into G. So this is the part that we knew. So this is just the maps from here into G. Okay, upper star, I meant. Okay, fine. Okay, so we get a disjoint union there over all the different coverings. For the space of arrows, remember we have the. Of arrows, remember we have those diagrams. I'm going to consider the left-hand space side here again as my indexing part. That is just playing a discrete role, basically. So I have a disjoint union over the pairs of essential covering maps in 2k. And then I need to give you a topology for the compatible triples of arrows because beta is an arrow from P into J1 and fin. From p into j1, and phi and psi are sitting between those group points, and that can be done with this particular pullback diagram. I'm not going to go into detail because we don't need it for the rest, but just let you know that's all can be done. And if you do that, you end up with an exponential. So we have the exponential in the bicategory of orbit group points, however we However, be a little careful about this guy. He's proper, not a tau in general. And so we want to find a Moriter equivalent smaller groupoid that is a tau. And that would have done all the design. And that will also be useful for doing the composition. So that's the next thing. We were inspired by the definition of a display. By the definition of this part, by Weimin Chen's paper, he had the notion of admissible generalized morphism. And when I looked at it, we were like, wait, we can turn that into something for groupoid as well. So this is the groupoid version of his admissible morphisms. What I'm going to assume first of all is that this U here consists only of relatively compact opens. So opens for which the closure is going to be compact in K. Is going to be compact in K. And we furthermore require that all these phies are extendable to the closures. And if they're extendable, there is a unique extension. So I'm not taking all phies, only the ones that extend to the closures. So I'm really working with the closures, except I don't want to say that because I would not have any tau groupoid in the middle. So we'll write a map for the full subcategory. For the full subcategory of OMAP on the admissible morphisms. However, I'm not going to use the subspace topology. So this is quite subtle. Don't use that topology. Topology is the following. I am going to take, I said I had unique extensions, so I'm taking those extensions. And I'm defining the topology, the compact open topology. So that. Um, so that thank you um the um epsilon use uh so that basically things work out that way. So I'm using the compactor from the closures, not just the compactor from the space. And I can do the same thing on the space of arrows, and everything works through. And then finally, I can say, well, a swing curt going from an arbitrary cover to one of these covers gives a One of these covers gives actually rise to an essential equivalence between OMAP and AMAP. And now AMAP has all the properties we want so far. This one is proper and etal. And let me quickly say something about enrichment. So you would like to compose. So what's the problem here? Well, I would want to compose a span like this and a span like that. And if I let, so that's done by finding another cover so that I can. Finding another cover so that I can complete this square here. And the problem is, if I let phi wiggle a little bit, that cover can change. And that's not a good thing because, remember, they had a disjoint union over those covers. So you would go to a different connected component. That doesn't feel very continuous. So, what you want to do is you want to take a particular cover and say, let me find all the pairs for which I could use. Players for which I could use this cover to compose and to make the composition. And if I can do that in a way that it looks open, I can take that as part of my open cover for this product on which I'm going to define the composition using W. And so I first break the product up into these pieces and then define composition on each piece. And that is what we would call an What we would call an essential morphism of a generalized morphism of Orby spaces. So, the way it works then, if I take a W here, I can take its image, I'm going to be a little lazy, write it like this, I take its closure, that's compact. Now, if I have that W, I would hope there is some V that likes to that I could map into. So that's a V of W, let's say, and then I take epsilon. And then I take epsilon V of Vw. And now I just need to make sure that this compact subset gets mapped into that open one. That's the description of the compact open topology. So basically what I can do is if I define, I take all the phi size such that phi of this compact closure maps into the epsilon v of the corresponding. To the epsilon v of the corresponding v, which I called sigma w here, then I can use w for the composition. And now we have on this particular open subset, we have a constant w on which we do this, and this will be continuous. Moreover, there's a unique one here that actually makes it commute, which is even nicer. So, conclusion then is that if I have eta proper para-compact local. Have etal proper para-compact locally compact orbit groupoids, then an orbit-compact K A map will give the exponential, it's etal improper. And the sub-bicategory of orbit-compact Orby spaces is enriched over orby spaces as a whole if I take a map as the mapping objects. I have examples, but you guys will have to ask me in Gavita. Guys, will have to ask me in Gavatan. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Derette. Any questions for Durrette? We have about seven minutes. So if one of your question is, can you show me one of those hidden examples? I bet she would love that. I'll ask on behalf of the group. We have the group. I appreciate this. So, first of all, if your Orby space happened to just be a topological space that are nicely glued, then so there's no non-trivial isotropy, then this A map is actually equivalent to just map of XY. So that's nice. If I have discrete groups and I just take a point with the discrete group acting on it, then it turns out, so if you think Then it turns out, so if you think about what the natural transformations are, so first of all, the maps are, of course, group homomorphisms. Natural transformations are given by conjugation. And so this is very handy, because if we now look at a triangular billiard, if I want to look at maps of the Z2 points into the triangular billiards, if I collapse my group, then I just get the billiard back because I'm just taking points now. But if I want to insist If I want to insist on actually sending Z2 to a Z2, then I end up on the boundary. But the different boundary pieces are conjugates in D3. So this actually becomes a circle of Z2 points. And if you then think for a moment about how the Z2 further works here now, it actually becomes a Z2 circle. So this whole circle has a Z2 acting trivially on it. Acting trivially on it. And you can play further with that if you take a segment with said two endpoints, sometimes called that a silver interval, and we map that into the billiard. Then the space has two connected components. On the one hand, there's the component for just sending it in as an Sending it in as an ordinary segment, and on the other hand, there's the component which maps the endpoints to the boundary. But it doesn't matter where I put them on the boundary because you can move them around the circle and it remains, those are all connected. If you put another point in the middle of it a cone, then you can do more. And if you just put a point with a cone, that doesn't make a difference because this point just could fall. Difference because this point just could walk around still. But if you actually make a different space, you put this at two points, but for the rest, keep a whole circle, which we can do now. You couldn't do that with Orby faults, but Orby spaces you can. Then we can get the loop stuck around the midpoint until you have walked around of, yeah, and basically it's stuck because you can't really get it unstuck. So that's. So, there's other fun things to be done there. We are looking further into cool examples. And then also, there's just the whole question about the homotopy category of orbifaults where this will become useful. But that's a bigger story for the future. Good, excellent. Any other questions for Direct? We have about, I'd say, 40 seconds liberally to let Susan put her slides up. Okay, then I suppose we can reapplaud. Thanks, Derette.
