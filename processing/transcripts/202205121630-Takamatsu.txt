Thank you for your introduction. And I want to express my gratitude to the organizers for giving me such a great opportunity to talk these topics. And yeah, okay. Please let me start with the title that the criteria for controls written. This is a lesson on Joey 12th. This is a basic non-joint work with Atarukawakami and Shoyo Shikawa. They were my colleagues. And actually, this talk is also related to the joint work with us and Hiro Motanaka, Yago Vitasek, and Peter Oko. It was already explained in Yaku's talk, the first talk in this conference. The first talk in this conference, and in Egypt's talk, our paper is written as a KTY, the six people's paper as a KTTY. So I want to distinguish them by this notation. But basically, please talk with KTY paper. Okay, so and today I prepare four sections. In the first section, I want to give some introduction. Give some introduction and the definition of quite programmes splitting. And in the second section, I want to explain our main result. And in section three, we give some, I will talk some applications. Actually, our main result is a kind of a criteria, so I think it's better to spare the time to explain some applications. And the final section. And the final section, I want to explain the sketch of proof. I think it should be some, it should be a very rough sketch. Yeah, anyway, yeah. This is today's plan. Okay, so I'll start with section one. Actually, I promised that in today's talk, REDC will be a algebraic cross-field of characteristic P. Okay, and first I want to recall the definition of a splitting. This is defined every FP scheme, so any FP scheme as a split. If I leave the progress map, Redis is a spritz as a websmosh and yeah, I think it's a very famous definition as explained. As explained in Yaku's talk, I explain and ensure that there are no pathological phenomena in positive characteristic algebraic geometry in some sense. And the most basic example is eptical case. So let me be epic colour K. Then Bingless read is equivalent to linearity of empty column. Of course, this means that no x-ray being not x-rayed is equivalent to supersing your And so, yeah, of course, a split makes a crucial role in the positive characteristical direct geometry, for example, or muon model program. But actually, for example, in higher dimensional case, for example, there are more non-specific varieties in some sense. Varieties in some sense. For example, for k3 subsidies, actually, non-expret is not equivalent to super singular. I mean, there are more non-expret varieties for QC surfaces. So I think it is natural to Natural to generalize the notion of wave split. And I think this is one of the motivation of definition of classical splitting. So, okay, I want to record the definition of quadrature splitting. So, I need some preparation. As before, red text will be a scheme over FB. And we write the rings and bit vector C by W and O X there because links of big vectors have a provenance map that exists proven. There exists a provenance map like this. I think it's better to write a push here and there also exists a restriction organ. This is just This is just a fast prediction. Yeah. Okay, so now we can state, we can explain the definition of control spread. This is defined by Yogu. The height of X is defined to be. Is defined to be the infimal of a positive integer such that there exists a following commutative diagram. The horizontal was a frogness and particular restriction. We request this map. This is a WNRX module from Meso, which commutates this diagram. And yeah, we promise that empty set, if your empty set is infinity, then high. Infinity, then I text defines give us a positive number of infinity. And we also give us a notion of quadratic problem splitting by quadratic split by But its height is a finite okay. So, yeah, I want to make some remarks on the definition. First of all, of course, the being it's high to height x is one. Height x is one if under leaf x is excluded indeed if n is if n equals to one this then this restriction map is more than the identity map so this dot r gives a splitting of robustness map so this is more than a split and the next remark is first of all the Is first observed by Buko. If X is a Carby over IP over K, then actually this, the notion of, by the way, this height is so-called excret height. And this excluded height equals to Equals to ultimate height over x, which was already explained in Jakob's talk. I'm sorry for that. In my talk, I don't explain the definition of arguments height because it's not crucial in my talk. But yeah, I want to emphasize that argument height is very important to Height is a very important invariant of a curve of ID. So, yeah, in some sense, a split height gives a kind of a reformalization of Robin's right reformalization of ultimate height. And we also note that for simplicity who X is a source projectile variety, then causing a hormone split. Quasi-Hermann split implies that the Royal dimension is zero minus infinity. So this quadrant split makes sense for like a final varieties or something like that as for example programmes. Horizontal program splitting. So, in this sense, this is also the generalization of our teams. Okay, now we can explain today's motivation, to its motivation. So, today's topic is and gives some criteria to confirm quadrupling split. Quadron split. So, chromosplitness. So, how to say usable criteria to compute height of hypersurfaces or modularity complete intersection cases. Okay, this is today. Cool. So, okay, let me go to the section two. Yeah, I want to explain my result, but first I want to give some remark if X is a projectable variety, so and grow our IT, then And it is embedded in your projective space. And here I do its coordinate ring by S and we put the its actual ideal corresponds to origin by M and then height over X is Over x is actually height of s over f and actually it is equals to height of localization of s over f. So if yeah, okay. So I'd campaign. Height can be computed by taking a fine quote. This is a very basic result, but this resulting shows that computation for local rank is essential for us. Yeah, so I want to work over such a situation and And I want to introduce some setting and notation here to state our main server. As above, it has to be polynomial rings and plus one variables polynomial length. And we take our into element A S. I want A S. Now we can take our monomial decomposition of A because the set of monomials gives a basis of S over K. So we can decompose a unique rate like this. Then we define the ritual one row A. Divided one of A to be to be A to the P minus the sum of Ai to the P divided by P. And this is element of S. Actually, because S has a positive characteristic, it is a positive characteristic, it is divided by P does not make sense. So this is a kind of a specific. So this is a kind of a simple equal, but if you expand this polynomial, then actually each time I have a coefficient which can be divided by p, so we can divide them formally, and we have everything yes. And yeah. And yeah, actually, because this conference is about mixed characteristics, such a such a yeah, such a relevant tool already appears in many talks, I guess. But yeah, actually, this delta one is versus controls a summation of W2. Two and so it's very important for us. So we give it some notation here. And next I want to give other notation x0 to the I zero, probably x n to the i n with Again, with exponent where is like this is actually gives a basis of FPUS over S. This FpS is pre-module robot S. So actually we can take a draw with this. And we write your besties as like this geographic and as a particular element, I take a U, it is a jar of. UR over X0 to the P minus one, probably about XL to the P minus one because it is an element of JavaScript, just defines S module from Fp S to S. Okay, now we have finished the preparation and I can see. I can steal the main zero zero one. This is the failure type criteria. Okay, first we fix our element F in S and we define that map theta. This is S module promotion. S module form for its formal horizontal F which S to S. And actually, this map depends on small w. Anyway, the definition is the element F push A to goes to U of F push A times delta one of F to the P minus one. And this is the differential of theta. Definition of theta. Then we can define the sequence of EBLs as the following. First, I define I1 to be the idea of generated by FTC P minus one and secondary. And the secondary inductive define. So, this is the definition. Define I s plus one to be theta of a push over is cap connoe will be plus equal to z p minus one. Note that inductively did this part is S module a sub module of which S and because theta is S module some S module home reson this theta Barbara is a sub module of S, so no other than EDL. And so this plus means a sum of EDL and IS defines the EDL inductively. find the EDR inductive. Then our main theorem states the height of S over F rows of N equals to the infimum over positive integer N such that I n is not contained in L to the P. L to the p. Note that this L to the P is opposed to X Pro, X M to the P yeah. This is our main server. I think it's a little bit complicated for at least for the first look. So Look so, anyway, I want to give some remark on the statement first of all. Actually, this details defines the inclusion sequence. Indeed, the first inclusion I1 is contained in I2 is obvious from the definition. And then one can define one can prove the next inclusion by apply theta rubber theta over so apply theta over f push rubber kept kernel u plus go to the p minus one then i one goes to i two and i two observe Size V, so we can prove this inclusion inductively. Okay, and the next remark: if we apply this one to the height one case, then height is one if one ref if to the p minus one. F to zp minus one is not contained in L P. And recall that this is equivalent to split. So we have this equivalence. But this is actually no other than Feder's criterion for splitting, which is explained in Kenda's talk today. Kendas talk today. So, in this sense, this server one gives a generalization of Fedo's criteria to quasi-splitting. Yeah. And we want to explain more remarks. This is a very important remark. Probably I'll catch. Microbial cases actually are more easier for cell one. We write this by cell two. So here, Carvial case means that the equi is a homogeneous of degree n plus one. So we suppose that. That so suppose to F is homogeneous of degree n plus one. Okay. Then height over S over F yeah, it equals to the height of S over F row S of N this equals. This equals to infimer over positive integer n, such that theta over theta n minus one over f to the p minus one does not contain the m to the p yeah. Yeah. So this is a very easy form because in theorem one, we should check that IN is contained in NP or not. For EDF, we should check for EDF. But in serum two, we should it subsets check only one element like this. Like this. So, yeah, this is very works well with a computer. And so this Carvia K serum harvest several applications, which will be explained later. So this is an important remark. And I want to give one. Give one remark, one more remark. Actually, serum one and serum two generalization to complete the intersection case. Actually, the statement for complete indiscretion case. Statement for complete indexing case is also not so complicated, but for simplicity, I will explain only hypersox cases today. Okay, so this is our main result. Okay, we go to the next section. Yeah, I want to experiment. Experiment application of these two servants. And because this is a little bit complicated for the first book, I want to give some example about computations, explicit computations. So, firstly, I want to explain the computation for RDP, rational data points. And I want to recall that if p is greater than five, then RDP is known to be explicit. And however, if p is less than or equals to five, then in general, it is not not excret. This was observed by Hara. Out by Hannah. So her first query is every RDP requasier split and we can compute height of them expressed. Here, I want to remark that Jakob already explained that in the paper KTTWY, it is proved that every KLD two-dimensional singularity is caused by Causes fit. So, our query is in some sense a little weaker form, but the point is we can compute expect height. And I believe that height is a kind of an invariant. And so, I believe that invariant of RDP is an interesting thing. So, I think it's Good application of our NASL. And so I want to explain some example of computations. So write P to be two and we consider E80 case. This is a notation in R dense classification of rational double points. Then in this case, In this case, it is x2 plus y3 plus z5 and it's to be three variables polynomial array. First of all, in this case, derivative one of f is easily computable because p equals to two. Actually, this is no other than some of the different. Of some of the different two terms of f so this can be written like this x two y three plus x t sorry x two z five plus y three z five and next I want to use a theorem one to To use a 01 to compute this height, height of S over F the localization. So to compute the height, I want to element in IN which is not contained in L P. I want to construct the element in IN which is not contained in L P. But I n because I n is defined inductively. If we want to construct such an element, we should first take an element in I1. So we start with I1. This is no other than generated by F because P minus 1 equals to 1. And this idea has this term, this element, XL. And we know that this XL satisfies. Xf satisfies that you have push Xf equals to zero because actually by the definition of you you can write them as written like this if I and J and K is I and J and K is odd. It will be done so this element and otherwise return zero. So therefore, to compute you or something, it helps to look times puts every Terms whose every exponent is odd. And actually, this x times f have no such terms because higher f is like this. So yeah, no such term. So we can we can conclude u of this xf is equals to zero. Therefore Recall that I2 is defined by like this. So I2 contain kind of this idea and by the above computation, this EDL have a theta of a push Excel so. So yeah, and this is no other than u over f push xf times delta one over f. So next we want to compute u of this one and so we want to find the terms of this element because every component every exponent is Every component, every exponent is odd. So, actually, there are only three terms of every exponent is odd. Three terms, which is the first term is x times x two times this one, y three z five and the second Second term is x times y to the three times this one. So we have here two. The third term is x times c to the five times this one x two times y three. So this right swish. Let's switch and actually these terms every term is like this x3y3z5 so this is equals to u over 3 times x3y3z5 and this is more than xyz2. C2. Note that this element is also contained in kernel U. So yeah. So similarly, I3 contains theta over F push XYZ two. Push xyz z2 possibly and this is no other than your push xyz2 times delta one away. So yeah, we should compute you again, but yeah, yeah, there are only three terms here, so this computation is not so complicated. So complicated XYZ two times this one only this one should survive. So this is error equals X times X three times Y times the seven. The cell and this is X times C3 and similarly this is also not contained in colour view. So finally we have an element in I4 like this and we can similarly compute this one. Yeah X C3 timers this one survives so as we I forgot to write the push here so we have XYZ it and finally this is on contained in L P. And actually, actually, by the direct computation, one can show that I3 is
