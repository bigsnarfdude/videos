So, I had to do it again. Well, so hello to everybody offline. And I would like to thank to the organizers for this series of conferences. And I'm glad to be here. So, the topic of my talk, it could be a little bit different, but I believe that it has I believe that it has a lot of common points with some of the works that I've seen during these days. So, this is a joint work with. Sorry, how is that? How does it work? Well, this is a joint work with Natalia Jernard. And indeed, the problem that I'm about to present was proposed to me by Natalia during a postdoc oriented by A postdoc oriented by Natalia. So we are going to explore the topological, or we are going to explore a classical map on the class of convex sets, which is the one given by the operation of taking polars. And we are going to explore some of its topological properties. And in particular, we are going to establish its relation with an open problem in topology called Anderson. Topology called Anderson conjecture. Okay. So Anderson conjecture is about the characterization. Where do I have to put that? Oh, yeah. No, no, I can't do it that way, so I'm going to use my hand. Okay, so Anderson conjecture is about the characterization of some classes of involutions on the Hilbert cube. And the Hilbert cube is the topological. The topological product of the interval negative one, one infinitely many, but countable times. As a topological space, it is very interesting and it has really nice properties. And I would like to share with you a few of them. So, every compact metric space is homeomorphic to a closed subset of. To a closed subset of the Hilbert cube. And if we drop the compact condition and we consider instead separable metric spaces, then every metricable and separable space is homeomorphic to a subset of the Hilbert cube. So this tells us that the Hilbert cube is a universal space for the class of matriceable and separable spaces. This work. This work lies at the intersection of convex geometry and infinite-dimensional topology. And I'm going to try to keep the minimum prerequisites from topology, but I like to present some other properties of the Hilbert cube. And when we are working with the cube, it is important to have different models for the space. So I wanted to share some models. Share some models for the Hilbert Keep. Here, the Hausdorff distance is defined as usual. Here, this is the distance between a point and a set. And, well, this is a classical result from Keller that classifies all the compact, convex sets of infinite dimension in a Banach space. Indeed, these classes of compact sets. Classes as compact sets have to be homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. And here, what I mean by infinite-dimensional in this context, we can think that we can say that a compact convex set is of infinite dimension if the affinity space generated by this space is not of finite dimension. And that's okay. Okay. This is a classical result from. This is a classical result from Scorion West and it's about the topological separable. Sorry? It has to be separable. No, it doesn't have to be separable. No, no, it's in general. Indeed, Keller proved for the case for separable spaces with the Hilbert space, but the technique can be extended to general spaces. So I'm going to, I was here. Well, other classes of S. Other classes of spaces that are used for modeling the Hilbert cube are classes of compact, non-empty compact sets. In this case, this is a result from Scurry and West. The topology on this, on the class of compact sets on the interval, is the one given by the Hausdorff distance. And this is a classical result, and it's about it. And it's about the topological properties. Well, it's a topological characterization of a class of compact convex sets contained in a given compact convex set of dimension at least two. So this in this in his in their paper, they proved that when we consider this hypothesis, then this space is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. Homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. So, okay. There's another relation between Hilbert cube and other classes of convex sets. In these cases, we don't have like the Hilbert cube is exactly the space, but we indeed have sets modeled by the Hilbert cube. Indeed, all the theory of the Hilbert cube. All the theory of the Hilbert cube regards sets that are locally homeomorphic to open sets of the cube. And this class of sets are called Hilbert cube manifolds. Okay, so from the same paper, if we consider the class of non-empty compact convex sets, then this space in though with the Hausdorff distance is homeomorphic to Distance is homeomorphic to the complement of a point on the Hilbert cube, and here we are using here. We always assume that n is equal, is greater than or equal to 2, because when we consider n equals 1, we actually obtain spaces of finite dimension. So, in a joint work with Sergei Antonio and Natalia Jernard, characterized the topological structure of the class of convex bodies. And here, of course, the topology is the one given by the Hauster distance, and they prove that this class is homeomorphic to this product. And if we restrict our Restrict our convex bodies to be origin symmetric. Sorry. So, just what does it mean? Class of convex bodies? What's a class? Oh, sorry. Here we are considering all the compact convex bodies containing interior points. Compacts, convex sets. So the class is like, I wanted to say, like, it's a family of all of them. With the Haufster distance. Yes. All of them is with the with the Haufster. Then it's with the Haufster distance, since okay, and then if we restrict our attention and considering all of the convex bodies that are also origin symmetric, then we have this result. So related to ellipsoids? Yeah, it's related to the peaks. The ellipsoids map one to one and then. So it's map one to one and then it's the previous result. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's what happened there. Okay, so we are ready to see what is Anderson conjecture about. So, well, this is the usual definition of an involution. If we have two topological space with continuous involutions and then And then what did I do here? So, we consider two continuous involutions on these topological spaces, and we say that they are cohogate. What happened? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. No estoy en la en la pantallia. Yeah. Okay. So two continu, a pair of continuous involutions are called conhugates if there exists a homeomorphism that preserves the involutions. So, in other words, if this diagram commutes. And Anderson conjecture was indeed. Was indeed a problem proposed by Erdie Anderson in the 60s about the characterization of the involutions with a unique fixed point on the Hilbert. So if we consider the probably the simplest involution on the Hilbert, which is the involution that takes a point to its opposite, Anderson asks if every continuous involvement is. Every continuous involution must be conhugged with this one. As far as I know, this problem was proposed by Anderson to James West during his PhD studies. It remains open today, till today. Well, this conjecture can be actually translated to the language of sorry to the language of group action. Of blue backs, which go back my slide just for a second. But what does it incline to that? Okay, just that the oh, sorry, the symbolutions are preserved by this, like this map is equivariant. Okay. Well, so in the language of group actions, every involution determines every continuous involution determines an action of C2, a continuous action of C2 on the Hilbert cube. And similarly, if I have an action, then I also have an continuous involution. And in the language of group actions, and there's some conjecture ask if does every continuous involution or sorry, continuous involution, continuous action. Sorry, continuous involution, continuous action on the Hilbert cube with a unique fixed point must be conjugate with the involution, with the action given by this. Well, Anderson conjecture all, most of the results that the big results regarding this problem are state in this language. And I would like to make some remarks regarding the Hilbert cube. The Hilbert cube. So the Hilbert cube has the fixed point property for continuous maps. So every involution must have at least one fixed point. And we are here the problem is for those that only has one. Okay, the Hilbert cube is a homogeneous space. So for every pair of points in the cube, I can find a homeomorphism that takes one point to the other. point to the other so in particular in the context of anders and conjecture we don't care what is the we we can freely choose the fixed point and finally the last remark is regarded anderson conjecture in other scenarios so indeed there is a standard way to construct uh given a finite a finite non-trivial group uh we can define we can find We have a standard way to construct a Hilbert cube such that this group acts on the cube and it has two properties. The first one is that it has only a unique fixed point. The second one is that the action is free on the complement of the fixed point. So the stabilizer of the isotropy group is Is trivial. So the stabilizer is just the elements of the group that fix the given point. Okay, so here I use this notation to point out that there is a standard way to construct this Hilbert cube once I have this group. So, Anderson conjecture in this context is as follows. this context is as follows. If I consider, if I fix a finite non-trivial group, does every action of this group satisfying these two properties must be conjugate to the one that I'm not showing today, but is behind this. So Anderson conjecture in this case is also open. And indeed, we can consider Are compactly groups. Okay. So now, what are we going to do? So we are going to define or to use a particular topology on the class K0 of closed convex sets containing the origin. We are going to prove that. That's what we done in the work. What we done in the work, and here I won't plan to prove it, but we will prove that this space is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. And the main problem is to answer the following. Here, I wrote in this way: what is the relation between the polar duality and Anderson's conjecture? In other words, In other words, we would like to know if the polar duality is an example, a positive example, or a counter-example for this problem. And here is where convexity starts. So the polar set, I'm just recalling its definition, and here was the standard scalar product on the field space. And it is always. And it is always a closed convex set containing the origin, and it satisfies this property. I like to choose these pictures because I like to emphasize that we are going to work with the bigger class of closed convex sets, not only those that are bounded or have interior points. Okay. Well, as I said, this is the notation for the class of closed convex sets containing the origin. Convex sets containing the origin. And well, the operation of taking polars is invariant in this class or preserves the elements of this class. It is also reverses inclusion by the bipolar theorem. We know that the polar of a polar of a element here is the same element, and the only closed convex set containing the region that is. Set containing the region that is fixed under the polar map is the Euclidean bottle. Well, sorry, what? And it's the only one up to our fine transformation. Yeah, yeah, that's something that we use in the world too. So, okay. So, no, no, we changed the meta. Oh no, no, we changed the metric to change the so what do you mean it's fixed the metric is fixed yeah no but we are going to see that we can change it but it is the same like there's no you change the Euclidean space that you're used the representation of the Euclidean space you're used to measure your all of this okay All of this. Okay, so the operation of taking polars and naturally induces a mapping on the class K0, which satisfies this property. So the bipolar theorem tells us that it is an involution on the class K0 with that unique fixed point. And the last one that I'm going to use at the end of the talk is about that, the property that it reverses inclusions. So with these two properties, So, with these two properties, point out a possible relation with Anderson's conjecture. Well, so our results. As I said before, we first require to fix a good or reasonable topology on this class, and this is done by means of the Atwood West West distance. So, well, this is the Well, this is the definition of the distance, but we can prove this equality in this class of sets and indeed establish a relation between this distance and the Hausdorff distance. So, I'd like to make a few comments. When we are working with closed sets in general, Sets on in general metric space, we can consider several topologies. Among them, we have the Fail topology, the Wickman topology, and the Adjut-Wetz topology. When we restrict our attention to the class of convex sets in the Euclidean space, then these topologies are the same. And we decide to work with the attach wedge distance because it is since we are used to work with the house. Since we are used to work with the Hausdorff distance, well, we have more intuition working with this. So this pair is a metric space. So just if I understand correctly, it's more the Hausdorff distance or down distance, right? K and K are bound and it's the Hausdorff distance. And then you somehow wanted to extend the Hausdorff distance in a meaningful way for a In a meaningful way, it's called the distance of unbounded sets. Yes, right? Yes, that's the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is in general done by for closed sets. And well, I'd like to like to like we can grasp some ideas on how this distance works. So consider the first quadrant. This is C1. Ayotravis. Let's control it. Control L sorry not to control any key box. So, well, if we consider the first quadrant and this closed convex set is the intersection of this quadrant with the Euclidean ball of radius and then we can consider this sequence of xn. Of xn and we can calculate its attest distance by means of the of our lemma. Yeah? Okay. So in this case, to calculate the attachment distance, we use these intersections. And indeed, when J is less than or equal to 1, these sets are the same. So the distance between them is 0. And if we consider J greater than N, then the difference is exactly J. References exactly j minus n. And since J is strictly greater than n, then we always know that this quantity is greater than this one. So the distance between, the outage wet distance between these two sets is precisely one over n plus one. And well, it tells us something that intuitively we can see, like we know. We can see, like, we know that even though these sets are compact, they approximate this, the first quadrant. Okay. And indeed, attach what's distance make or may it's more like consider more is consider more, gives more value to the points closer. Value to the points closer to or near to the origin. Okay, to the behavior of the sets near to the origin. Okay, so our first result is this one. The space, the class of this class of convex sets is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. And to prove this result, we used like standard techniques from Hilbert, Hilbert Cube. Hilbert cube manifolds. And well, this is the first result done by we also have a result from Wickman about the continuity of the polar map with respect to the Wickman topology. However, as I said before, the Wickman topology and the Dutch wet distance on this class generate the same topology. So in particular, Wickman. So, in particular, Wickman theorem proved that the polar map is continuous in this context. So, in this context, we now know that the polar map is a continuous involution with a unique fixed point. So, the question is, it is an example or a counterexample for Anderson's conjecture, and we actually prove that it is a positive. That it is a positive example for the conjecture, and the polar map is conjugate with sigma. So I won't sketch the proof, but since I like some of the ingredients from convexity that we use, I'd like to share some of, well, the fundamental aspect of the proof here. So after using some of the classical results regarding the Results regarding the Anderson's conjecture, what we have to do is to find a homotopy that in zero is the identity on k0, is the when t is equal to one is the constant map equals to the fixed point. And the last one is this. We require that the families of maps are Of maps are polar equivalent or preserves polarity. And that was the main problem we had when dealing with this because we didn't know so many maps on the class K0 with satisfying this property. And here is where appear a construction by Vitaly Millman and Liran Rotten. And Liran Rotten called the geometric mean of convex bodies. So, here we are considering by this by K0B, we denote the class of compact, convex sets containing the region in their interior. So if we have A and Q in this class, we define those sequences here. Here is the arithmetic mean of these convex bodies, and here is. Of these convex bodies, and here is the Minkowski zoom. And on the other side, we have the like harmonic mean of these convex bodies. So Millman and Rotten proved that the sequence AN is decreasing and the sequence HM is increasing with respect to inclusion. And indeed, they are converting sequences with respect with the house. With respect with the house during distance, and indeed the limit is the same. And with that, they define the geometric mean of G of A and Q as this limit. So what are the properties of the geometric mean that we use are the following. So, well, the geometric mean is Well, the geometric mean is symmetric. It doesn't matter if you start with A or K. The geometric mean of a convex body with itself, it's the same. And the property we require is that the polar map, sorry, the geometric mean determines a polar equivariant map. Also, it preserves the elements of the geometric. It preserves the elements of the general linear group and it is also continuous with respect to the Hausdorff distance. So now I can define the homotopy we were looking for. So first, we require this map. So this map, indeed, what is doing is just approximate elements of k. approximate elements of k0 by elements of by convex bodies containing your regions the only thing that it is done that this map does and when t goes to one then this Euclidean ball is small and eventually it goes inside this set so that is why we have this equality well the homotopy we were The homotopy we were, well, the homotopy we found is this one. And when t is equal to service identity, one is the fixed point. And on this part is the one given by the geometric mean of the bodies defined on the, of the, of the image of these bodies defined on the previous slide. So indeed, well, we know. Well, we know that the geometric mean is continuous on this class. So the problem was to, when we considering the convergence to zero, these points are near to C is near to zero. We have to, that was the difficult part of the proof. We have to prove that this sets That this sets approximate k. And well, most of the work is about to prove that this map is continuous. And once we did that, well, we know that the polar map provides an affirmative example for Anderson's conjecture. And we are now the other part of the work. Of the work regard dualities. So, duality on the class K01 was introduced by Shiri Arstein Avidan and Vitaly Millman. So, a duality is a map on this class that satisfies two properties. The first one is that it is an evolution. The second one is that it reverses inclusions. Then, in BS Longa, characterized B.S. Lonka characterized all dualities on the class K0, and he proved that the dualities are of this form when G here is a symmetric element of the general linear group. Okay, so when we are working with dualities, we are actually in the linear category and we are also working with involutions. So a natural Involutions. So, a natural question is: when does aguality is equivalent to the polar map? So, using the result from Slamca, we can just calculate this and we prove that if we have a symmetric, sorry, if we have a duality determined by a fixed positive isomorphism. Isomorphism, then this duality is if T is positive definite, then F is congregate with the polar map. If T is not positive definite, then F has infinitely many fixed points, and indeed the points lies in the class of convex bodies containing G or each. So, in particular, it tells us that duality is equivalent to the polar map if Equivalent to the polar map, if and only if it has a unique fixed point. But that's something that we like, we hope, we hope it was that way because if the if a duality, well, it's a nice property because if a duality has more than one fixed point that it turns out to be confugate with the polar map, then like the importance of a Euclidean ball is not. is not is not uh like the the it's not revealed revealed there in the in this in that context so well we have this result and then we can back to topology and establish new examples for anderson conjecture so we say that uh map on k0 is decreasing if it reverses inclusion If it reverses inclusion, and using the result from Slonka and our work, we have this corollary that provides a bigger class of examples for which Anderson's conjecture holds. So, and finally, now from this work, we can, we have, we have, we also have. We also have an alternative formulation of Anderson conjecture in terms of the class of closed convex sets containing the origin. And is this one? Is then every continuous involution on this class with that unique fixed point conjugate with the polar map? So what we prove is that Is that when you consider decreasing evolutions here? Yes, the answer is yes, but the possibilities are there and the problem is open since the 60s. There are a lot of work trying to prove this result, but I think that we are giving an absence. We provide a new example, but also we New example, but also we provide new tools to attack this problem. So that's what I wanted to share with you today. And I don't know why. Why just happened this to me? Well, what happened now? It doesn't change. I want to just put the last slide. So, yeah. So, well, thank you for being here. And this is the reference and the details that I talking about appear in this work. So, thank you. This work. So, thank you, everyone. Thank you very much, Adam Charpe. Hello from the people online. Are there any questions? Are there any questions online? Hello? Okay, well, there are no more questions or comments. Let's thank Fernanda once again. Okay, so now we're getting ready for the next part. Getting ready for the next part.
