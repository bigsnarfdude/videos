the organizers for uh for the uh all the effort uh they especially put in in in organizing this remotely which i know is always uh you know the the in-person things are more fun so i'm always grateful for uh people who are uh willing to actually put in the effort to organize these things and to keep These things and to people who are participating. And so here's the overview. So this talk is going to be, it will have a somewhat different flavor than many other talks here. I'll be talking about hyperbolic dynamics, which is maybe not the biggest topic in this conference. But I'll try to stress that there is actually a lot of There is actually a lot of relations with what was discussed earlier this week because the techniques, the underlying analysis, is micro-local. And a lot of underlying analysis is going to be hidden because it's in the older papers. And today I'll be talking about topological implications. But this topological structure has some formal similarity to Kochko homology and to the Ramco homology. Homology and to L to homology that was mentioned earlier today. So I'll try to emphasize what the formal similarities are. I'll try to also mention the essential differences, which means that we have to study things differently and the results are different. So, what I'm going to be studying is, well, I'll be studying the cohomology effectively of a certain complex, but the easiest. But the easiest way to package or to present it is that I'll be studying the order of vanishing at zero of the real data function. I'll define on in a few slides for the geodesic flow on a negatively curved free manifold. So that's going to be the main object. So it'll be a three-dimensional compact manifold. It will be negatively curved. I'll define the Royal data function. It's a meromorphic function on the entire complex plane. And then you can study its order vanishing at zero. And the question is, how is that related to? The question is: How is that related to the topology of the underlying manifold? Or really, that's to ask, is it related to the topology of the underlying manifold? And the answer is it's complicated. So, in a case when the underlying metric is hyperbolic, so it's constant curvature, this order of vanishing was computed by Fried back in 1986 and it's expressed by this simple formula on the slide, which features the first Betty number of this manifold. So, it's a topological. So it's a topological invariant. You could say, of course, you know, on any manifold, there's at most one hyperbolic metric in dimension three, but anyway, it's expressed using this topological invariant. Now, what we show, so the result that I'll present, is that if you take a generic perturbation of the hyperbolic metric, we'll do it conformally, but I think pretty much any kind of reasonable perturbation would do. Then the order of vanishing jumps. So it becomes. Jumps so it becomes four minus one times the Bayesian number, and this you know the formula of freedom constant virtual format twice the Bayesian number, so it changes. And this is joint work with Mikhail Usekic, Benjamin Kusta, and Gabriel Patornan. So the new results I'll be talking about. And so this is in contrast with the case of dimension two. So if instead of three manifolds, you consider surfaces of negative curvature, then the order of vanishing is always given by minus the Euler characteristics. Our characteristics. No matter whether it's constant curvature, variable curvature, as long as the genetic flow is an off, as long as you can define this object, it's always given by this simple formula and it's just topologically determined. That's older work with Sworsky that I'll mention some aspects of it because it inspired some aspects of our paper. And one of the motivations for this work is the Fries conjecture, which relates the value at zero of this theta function. Of this theta function to analytic torsion. So, our result doesn't say anything about the value of zero, but I'll still talk about other results by other people who deal with this because it was part of the motivation, inspiration for the present work. So, well, let me quickly go through the setup. So, I'll be dealing with a compass connected-oriented Riemannian manifold because I want to talk a little bit about dimensions we just mentioned. Talk a little bit about dimension, do just mention it. I'll just assume it's some n-dimensional manifold for now. Then I'll be setting the geodesic flow. So the geodesic flow is not a flow on the manifold, it's a flow on the sphere bundle. So here is the sphere bundle. So sigma is the manifold. M is the sphere bundle. So it has dimension 2n minus 1. This notation will be with us throughout. And pi sigma is the projection map from the sphere bundle onto the manifold. Now, one way to think about it, yet as a flow is as a concept flow. It flow is as a contact flow, so you can fix this canonical one-form on m, which is just uh vdx, basically, right? This notation is just it's in local coordinates. If x is the position and v is the velocity on the sphere bundle, it's just vdx. So, this form turns out to be a contact form, and then the geodesic flow is the corresponding contact flow. So, here's a definition of contact form, and then here is a definition of a contact flow. So, it's the, you know, the generator of this. So it's the, you know, the generator of the flow, which I denote by x. So x is a vector field on the sphere bundle, is a unique vector field that satisfies these identities with the convect form. All right. So the place where we actually need to have negative sectional curvature in this business is that if you assume that G has negative sectional curvature, then it's, well, it's a famous theorem due to Anosov, I think, that this geodesic flow is Anosov. As a flow is anosa. Namely, you can decompose the tension spaces to the tension space to each point in M. Again, remember, sigma is my original n-dimensional manifold. M is the sphere bundle. That's where the jet is a flow lives. So it's 2n minus 1 dimensional. So it's odd dimension always. And you can decompose the tangent space to this M, to the sphere bundle, into three pieces. So you can decompose it into a direct sum of three sub-bundles. One of them is just the flow direct. One of them is just the flow direction is zero and then EU, and the other unstable and the stable spaces have this property that the differential of the geodesic flow for large positive times is exponentially contracting on ES and for negative times it's exponentially contracting on EU. And these spaces are also invariant under the flow and depend continuously on the baseball. So that's the definition. So you have this exponential decay. So you have the stable and stable decomposition. And that's something that would table decomposition and that's something that we will use strongly throughout the throughout this work and another thing that you know won't want to shock many people here perhaps but i would like to also think about sub-bundles of the cotangent bundle to m because there will be a sample and microlocal analysis will be used and so um i'll define the dual unstable and stable spaces as done here so i kind of i switch u and f here so for Kind of I switch u and f here. So, for instance, the dual unstable space is the subspace of the cotangent of a cotangent space to m which is the annihilator of e0 plus eu. And similarly for the stable. All right, so that's basic notation that we'll be using throughout. So what's the real data function? So what's the dynamical data functional study? Well, it has a simple definition. It's kind of deceivingly simple, just like the Riemann data function, you could say, is even more deceivingly simple. Even more deceivingly simple, but it's a complicated object to study. So, this real data function is an Euler product over the lengths of all primitive closed geodesics. So, in negative curvature, closed geodesics, they form a discrete set. And the number of closed geodesics up to period T grows exponentially with T. So, if real part of them is sufficiently large, this product converges. Just a converging. Just a converging product, and then in that region, it defines a holomorphic function without any zeros because it's a product. Now, what's a result that's, I guess by now, it's maybe eight years old, but still fairly recent result is that this function continues meromorphically to the entire complex plane. So that's not trivial. Let's use this. Have this unorthodox property. And the first time it was, the first proof of that was given by Juliette Levarani and Polycott. And then Macieworski and myself gave a different proof relying on micro-local analysis. And we will use that proof in accessing the vanishing order zero of the function. So we'll be using this one. And it has a long history going back to conjecture of Smile out that back in 1967. I don't know how, well, I. I don't know how, well, I cannot count. I don't know how many years ago that was, but I'm pretty sure it was before I was born. So, all right. So what's the object that we'll study? So we have this real data function with a meromorphic continuation. I'll have to describe later a bit why it continues meromorphically, but for now we'll just believe it does. And then you can look at zero. So you can look at lambda equals zero, and that turns out to be a very special number for these data functions. Very special number for these data functions, and you want to define the vanishing order at zero of this meromorphic function. So, well, here's the definition. It's just the usual definition of vanishing order of a Meromorphic function at a zero. To say the vanishing order is equal to zero, it means that the function is holomorphic and non-vanishing at zero. All right, so the big question here is Big question here is: Can we describe this vanishing order in terms of topological invariance? And specifically, the topological invariance that we might be using would be the Betty numbers, which are called dk of sigma, which is just the dimensions of the Duramco homology spaces of sigma. All right. All right, so now I'll talk a bit about previous works, so what's known previously. I'll try to go a bit fast here. Task here. So, first of all, it turns out that this is not the most general object you can study. And what you can do is you can twist by a representation, which I believe has come up. I've been listening to two conferences this week. I think it came up in this conference, flat representations. Right. And the talk about the sentencer, right? It was flat. No. Anyway, I'm not going to embarrass myself. There was a talk about flat connections. Whoever did it, you know who you are. Whoever did it, you know who you are. And there was talk about flat representations. So you can look at the representations of the fundamental group, let's say, inside the unitary group, and you can equivalently think about flat connections. So that corresponds to these representations. And what you can do is you can use such a representation or a flat connection to twist your data function if you just take the term. If you just take the trivial representation, you recover the original one, otherwise, you get this twisted data function. The additional benefit of having these is that you can choose a representation so that the Duram complex is acyclic. So the Duram cohomology of the twisted complex, where instead of D, you use D with respect to the flat connection, has nothing. So there's no cohomology. And that is convenient for someone. For some of the questions here. All right. So in the hyperbolic case, so here I'll talk mostly about the hyperbolic case and locally symmetric cases on this slide. So in the case of hyperbolic metrics, so remember we study a negative Lekou manifold. The most basic negative LeCurve manifold is a manifold of constant negative curvature. So in this case, Fries had a few papers that studied this. And in particular, what he showed is And in particular, what he showed is that he computed the order of vanishing of the real data function in dimension two. Here's the formula, and here's the formula in dimension three, and both of them are just determined by the first Betty number, which is the only interesting Betty number in this dimension. And you can see that if your representation is a cyclic, then this two and four should really be twice Betty zero and four times Betty zero. So all basically, if your representation is a cyclic, then the vanishing order will be zero. Then the vanishing order will be zero, and then you can ask about the value of this holomorphic function. So the value of the real data function is zero. And that freeze computed to be equal to the square of the analytic torsion. So in keeping in line with the Chuen's talk earlier this morning, probably at least half of the audience knows better what analytic torsion is than I am, but it's a topological invariance. It's a number that's associated to each. Number that's associated to each such acyclic representation. And it has been extensively studied. So, Nanfries conjectured that the same relation holds for a class of locally homogeneous spaces. We conjectured that this relation that he proved in case of hyperbolic metrics is actually true in general or in more general situations. And this is a fascinating relation because, on the left, you have a purely dynamical object. It was something it was dispelled. It was something, it was this value of the real data function, which is defined using length of closed geodesics. On the right, you have a pure topological invariance. And well, at least from where I stand, it's somewhat complicated on that. So that was proved. So Freight's conjecture, this relation was proved for locally symmetric spaces and unitary connections by Shan, following earlier results by Moscovici, Stanton, and Dismuth. So that's also fairly recent, five years ago. And I should say. Five years ago. And I should say that everything on this slide uses the locally symmetric structure. So all the theorems use the fact that you have a locally symmetric space, which means it's a quotient of a Lie group by a subgroup and the lattice with additional conditions that make it rather algebraically rich. So you can use representation theory and crucially, you can use Telberg's trace formula and its various generalizations in the context of locally symmetric spaces. Context of locally symmetric spaces. So, all the proofs here, from where I stand, they were fairly algebraic in mind. They were fairly algebraic in flavor in the sense that they use these explicit formulas and use the locally symmetric structure and representation. All right, so the next slide is what can we do when we are outside of the class of locally symmetric spaces? So, what if we don't have access to such rich algebraic structure? What can we show? Well, Show well, um, so as I mentioned before with Swarski, we proved that if you if your manifold has dimension two, if you're a compact uh negatively curved surface, then this formula for order of vanishing that's free proved in a constant curvature is still valid. So you still have this order of vanishing is basically one minus two. In fact, it applies to general context on also flows in dimension three. Now, there were some extensions of that to surfaces without boundary, but Hepstel knows. To surfaces without boundary, but I have sell them to the non-orientable case by Born, Wheel, and Shen because I assumed, but maybe forgot to say that my manifold is oriented. And then Sekich and Paternan studied more general volume preserving Anosa flows. So geodetic flows are a subclass of Anosa flows, and there are various assumptions more and less restrictive than you can put on ANOSA flows. And so volume-preserving Anosa flows, that's a more general class than general. That's a more general class than geodesic flows or compact analysis flows. And so, Sekesh and Paternan discovered that if you change the flow so that you start with a geodesic flow and then it falls outside of the contacts class, so your flow is no longer contact, but it's still volume preserving, then the order of vanishing actually jumps. So it depends on something beyond just the topology. It depends on what kind of properties you're flowing. What kind of properties your flow had. Now, then, so that you could say it's a negative result in the sense that, well, they had a lot of positive results, but one of the big takeaways of their paper is that you don't always get a topological invariant here. You need to know something about the flow in addition to knowing the topology of the manifold. So, a very nice positive result is this work of Dungir, Morivier, and Shem was just published last year, but it's stay dating a few years ago. Last year, but it's a dating a few years ago. What they did is actually proved Friedz conjecture in the setting when you have a nearly hyperbolic free manifold. So if you perturb a free manifold, and they had other results than that, but that's one that's easiest to state. So they show that for acetic representations, if you take a nearly hyperbolic free manifold, you actually do have this relation between the value of the real data function in zero and analytic. Data function is zero and analytic torsion torsion. So that's great. And here are a few more related works by Dan Redier Shobedan and Christe Weisch. And I didn't, it's just a little bit harder to explain what they did without introducing extranitation. That's why I unfortunately just had to bundle them like that. All right. So that's the previous work in the non-local symmetric case. And that all uses micro-local approach to data functions that are break. Local approach to data functions that I'll briefly review in a moment. All right. So here is our result as advertised. So here is, we'll stick to hyper to three manifolds. So let's say, let's first fix the underlying differential structure. So it's a you have a compact, connected, oriented hyperbolic three manifold. I'll call it sigma. GH is the hyperbolic metric connect. Then we have two results. One is that if Then we have two results. One is that if the metric, if you look at the zeta function with respect to the hyperbolic metrics, you look at the length of closure that respects a hyperbolic metric, then the order of vanishing is the same as was computed by Free. So that result is not new. And the second result is the one, the part that's new, which is if you take a generic conformal perturbation of the metric, then the order of vanishing becomes equal to 4 minus d1. Now here is a definition of generic conformal perturbation. Definition of generic conformal perturbation, which is, I think, that's what you would probably think a generic conformal perturbation looks like. So there exists an open dense subset of possible conformal factors. So that's the generic part, right? Open dense set, such that for any choice of a conformal factor in the set, there is this epsilon bigger than zero. So that's the part where it's a perturbation, right? Small perturbations here, such that if you take the conformal perturbation, Take the conformal perturbation, so you just multiply your metric by e to the tau times a, where a is this factor in this open density, and tau is small enough depending on a. Then the order of vanishing is 4 minus 0. So that's the definition of generic conformal perturbation. All right, so a couple of remarks. So first of all, this is the first result of instability of this vanishing order under metric perturbations because the previous result of Because the previous result of Pekich Paternan deals with perturbing the flow, but it doesn't perturb it in a class that it stays a Jedi flow of symmetric. And I mean, I don't know, it's kind of curious where to go from here because when you look at the locally symmetric case, you would think, okay, this order of energy should be a topological invariant. Then when you think about the general case, when you try to prove that it's a topological invariant, you think there's just no way it should be a topological invariant. There's just no way it should be a topological invariant. There is no reason immediately to suspect that. And then, after we did this work with WarSQ in dimension two, we discovered that it actually still is a topological invariant in dimension two. And then we were quite hopeful that, okay, maybe there is a general theory. I remember one referee report on our paper said something like, and our work in any case would be superseded by any serious progress on the general free conjecture. And the staff kind of shows you why general. The stock kind of shows you why general progress and general freedom gesture is hard to come by, actually. And so, after now, we kind of feel that this order of energy should not be a topological invariant, but it's but generically, maybe it should be. So that's the situation. As I said, it's complicated. And another remark is that the first part of our theorem is not new. That was already due to freeze. That was already due to free, but the way we prove it uses geometric rather than algebraic C. So we have a different proof of that, and that proof actually feeds into the proof part. All right, any questions at this point? Yeah, thanks. So in this tau and A, that condition is specifically made so that the curvature remains negative in the perturbation and therefore the Anosa flow is still sorry, the geodesic flow is still anosov. Is still an oss? Right, so any small perturbation in C infinity, let's say, of an anosa flow is still an OSOP. So, as long as we're talking about perturbations of anosa flow, you're going to stay in the Anosa category. Again, I'm talking about T-infinity perturbations here. Right, but it's just that's what the epsilon means, right? That it has to be a small. One of the things, one of the reasons why epsilon needs to be small is that the clause should still be an auto, but if Should still be an autof, but it has to be actually much smaller than that, and depending on a. So, our result is really a perturbation result. What we do is we use first variation. So, if you have a function which is zero at zero, and you know that its first derivative is non-zero, you know it's going to be non-zero in a function neighborhood of zero. But it could be a much smaller neighborhood than the set on which it was originally defined. So, we do not specify how small epsilon is, and it certainly depends on the state. On the stage. Okay, great. Thanks for your attention. No problem. All right. So, how do we show this? So, here I'll talk about how do we think about data functions from a spectral point of view. You know, the strategy for melomorphically continuing data functions is always the same, starting from Riemann data function up until here. It's always the same. You have to write your data function, which is a product that doesn't converge. Is a product that doesn't converge for all lambdas. You have to write it as something else. So, step one, you write it as something else, and step two, show that the something else makes sense for all lambdas. That's the general scheme. The only problem is that what the something else is, and that's where the nature of the data function, of course, matters. So, the way we think of data functions is we think of them as characteristic polynomials of some operators. Now, that doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense at all. A special operator will be a differential operator. But a way that you have a better chance of making sense of this formula is if you take the log derivative of both sides. And so you want the log derivative of the theta function to be the trace of the resolvent of an operator. Now, that also usually doesn't make sense. At least for us, it doesn't make sense. This resolvent is not trace class. You cannot take the trace. But if you use the so-called flat trace, If you use a so-called flat trace, which is micro-local in nature, you just restrict to the diagonal and integrate, and that's something that needs to check away from that condition to be able to do this, then you can make sense of this formula. And so that's how we'll be thinking about data functions. We'll be thinking of log derivative of the data function should be equal to an appropriate trace, so a flat trace, of the resolvent. Now, imagine that this is true, and imagine that my operator was a matrix. And imagine that my operator was a matrix for a little bit, and this trace was an honest trace. So, if you have a characteristic polynomial, then you know that the vanishing order of the characteristic polynomial at, let's say, at zero is the dimension of a space of generalized eigenstates. So, it's not just the dimension of the kernel of the matrix, it's the dimension of the kernel of any power of this matrix. So, the generalized eigenstates are defined. So, the generalized eigenstates are defined as u such that some power of the operator annihilates u. Now, in our case, it will also be like that. So, we can write the vanishing order of theta, of this theta function, using dimensions of certain spaces that I'll introduce soon. And I'll call them ref k infinity zero. So, they'll be with us for the rest of the talk. And these are spaces of polycode-rel generalized resonance forms. That's what we call them. But I'll introduce them. I'll introduce them. So, you have some finite-dimensional spaces, and you can write the order of anything in terms of their dimensions. And so, our strategy would be to describe all of these spaces in terms of the Duromkov homology. And for the most part, we'll just be working with k equals one. So there are spaces for different k's corresponding to the degree of a differential form. And so, if you understand one form, then understanding the rest is not hard. Not harder. All right. So, what's the specific operator that we'll use? Oh, I should say that this is, there is some formal similarity of what I'm about to talk about with Hodge-DeRam theory, and maybe even with determinants of the Laplacian, though I don't know enough about the subject to really talk about that. In that in Hodge-DeRam theory, your spaces would be. Your spaces would be the spaces of harmonic forms. Here we have a kind of analogous situation, formally, but not really. And the determinant of the Laplacian would be kind of analogous to the value of this function zero, if it made sense. But I digress. So here is our setting. So we have the sphere bundle, we have the generator, the flow x, the spectral field, and then our operators would just be the lead derivative with respect to x. The lead derivative with respect to that. So it's a first-order differential operator. And you can take lead derivatives of various kinds of objects. Well, we'll talk about lead derivatives of differential forms. And not just all differential forms, but differential forms, they are usually called perpendicular k-forms, which is a bundle of forms which are annihilated by Ix. So I is the interior product. So those are the ones that if you substitute x's with the differential form, it's generated what you just applied. The differential form is generated by J does the flow get zero. So that's the space. So that's going to be this bundle omega k0, the bundle of k forms which are annihilating by ix. The formal similarity with Hodge theory here is that there is Cartan's magic formula Lx is dix plus Ixd, which is similar to the Hodge Laplacian, which is d del plus del D, but the formal similarity ends at the point that delta is d star and Ix is not d star. And Ix is not G star in any sensible place. So, generally, if you have a harmonic form, it's in the kernel of D and in the kernel of Del, right? Harmonic forms are generally closed and full closed. In our case, it's not going to be like that. So now, what are the spaces on which we'll look, on which we'll study these? So here we have a compact manifold. So if you look at the Laplace on a compact manifold, the Hoch-Durang theory is particularly nice. Ram theory is particularly nice because we just look at any kind of Koblov space, right? Let's just take L2, right? L2 and H2. The Poich-Laplacian is a threadcom operator. It has a very, very nice spectral theory. You have, that comes with being an operator with discrete support. Here, if you try to do the L2 theory for the select, you will get a continuous spectrum. And if your k is equal to zero, if you just look at zero forms, then you get continuous spectrum on the real line, so the entire real line. So that's not something that, you know, there is no Fratcon theory that works just on L2. So you have to change your space. And so what you do is you introduce anisotropic fobola spaces, which I will not define just because this is the kind of the previous chapter of this work, if you want. And I want to talk about the topological part. But you can define But you can define an esotropic fobola spaces on which are tailored to the stable, unstable decomposition of the flow, on which the resolvent family of this operator is fraction of index zero. So you can get a spectral theory. It's no longer going to be self-adjoint. So the lambdas for which it is not invariable, the spectrum will be in the complex plane. And this has a long history of study here, listed here. Listed here. And we will use the micro-local and scattering theory approach to these spaces, which was pioneered in works of four Rashofran for Shostra, and then was used in this paper with Worski and the data function. Okay. So what is an isotropic sobola space? You know, one way to think about it is just earlier this morning or whatever time of day is where you are in Shuanzhou's talk, there was altocohomology, right? Was altocohomology, right? And there, the issue with the, not the issue, but the difficulty in studying altocohomology is that the space is not compact, right? On a compact manifold, there's only one deron cohomology. But once you have non-compact manifolds, you need to control, you need to impose some conditions on what your differential forms do as you go to infinity in space in your manifold, right? Now, in our setting, our manifold is compact, the sum is. Manifold is compact. The SAM is a compact five-dimensional manifold. But the operator is not elliptic. So if you think about it micro-locally, the characteristic surface of this operator, which is just a vector field, the generator injected as a pull, the characteristic surface of that extends to fiber infinity. It extends to frequency goes to infinity. So here, in order to get the fretform property, you need to put in weights, and these weights will be weights and frequency. These weights will be weights in frequency space. So instead of changing the rate of growth of your functions, you will change the soboleg order of regularity in different places on phase space depending on the stable and stable decomposition. Basically, what you need is you need to impose sufficiently high regularity on the dual stable space, sufficiently low regularity on dual unstable space, and interpolate nicely in between. And that gives you spaces. Between and that gives you spaces on which you can prove the threat home property, all right. So, the all right, so coming back to the uh main exposition here, uh, the poles of this family of operators are called polypetral resonance, I said that they would be complex numbers in general, and we can study generalized resonance states. So, if you look at this operator, which is just L x, then what are generalized resonant states? Well, these are elements in the This well, these are elements in the domain of the uprate, really, the main of the power of the upright, I suppose, if you want to be pedantic here. So, this would be current, so this would be distributional section of the bundle of k-forms annihilated by Ix. And these elements have to be generalized resonance states, so they have to be annihilated by some power of LF, right? LS likely can still be defined on distributions, just the differential operators. Distributions, just the differential operator. So, using, so in our work with Magic on the Zeta function, we showed that the order of vanishing of the Royal Zeta function at zero can be written as an alternating sum of the dimensions of this generalized resonance state. So it's a bit more complicated than having a single operator. Instead, you have five operators for a conjugation. Have five operators corresponding to k equals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, corresponding to these different differential forms. You take the alternating sum of the dimension of the space, the generalized resonance states, also known as algebraic multiplicity of the corresponding resonances, and you get this order of vanishing. And that used micro-local tools, which were Hormong's propagation of singularities, Melrose's radial estimates. So, those two feed into showing the platform property the way that we want. And a Tea-ball-Gilliman trace formula to relate the. To relate the flat trace of the resolvent of the subarator to closed Jet as it. Okay, well, that's as much as I'll say about the proof of that stuff. All right, let's see what's on the next slide. I'm curious. Okay, great. So now we are going to actually study the order of anything at zero. So now our lambda will be zero, and that's it. You know, the general theory works for any lambda, but here we'll focus on lambda. For any lambda, but here we'll focus on lambda equals zero. And what we do, we actually compute the dimensions of these spaces. And here is the table of dimensions for the hyperbolic case and for generic perturbation of the hyperbolic case. You see that they differ by this, you know, 2b1 of sigma becomes b1 of sigma on the right. So if you take the alternating sum, then you will see the orders of vanishing of the data function that were advertised. Of the data function that were advertised. But this is really the result that we brought. So, I'd say more detailed information than just the order of anything of the data function. You know, if you use algebraic methods, then the data function originally, you might be able to handle it easier. In the locally symmetric situation, it's actually easier to find the order of anything of the data function than to identify all of these individual orders. That's also possible, but it's hard. It's hard, all right. And you can see this thing has a kind of a ponforaduality here. It's actually trivial because wedging with the correct power of d alpha or alpha with the convex form just gives you isomorphisms between, you know, two minus j and two plus j spaces. And so that's why you only need to study degree zero, one, and two here. So that's as much of the spectrum as you need to study. All right, so how do we study that? Well, so here are generalized resonant states. Generalized resonance states. And yeah, so we have this situation, we have this domain of the operator, which I didn't describe. And then you have a simple differential equation, just some power of LS, but you have a complicated domain. Now, it turns out that you can characterize this. You can characterize these functions. You know, when you do Hodge theory, say on a compact manifold, you can use any HK. You can use any HK space, right? And then the domain will be HK plus 2, Sobolev space. But you know that harmonic forms are in all of these HK spaces, so they're smooth, right? So if you just study harmonic forms, you don't actually care which order of the Sobolev space you use to show that the spaces are finite dimensional by use of Fratcom theory. And so there is a similar situation here that our generalized resident states, they line the domain. Um, the line that I mean, you know, they have an easier characterization than the spaces that you need to show the threshold property. Namely, you can just instead of writing this domain that I didn't specify, you can just make a requirement that these are distributions whose wavefront set is contained in EU star. So that's the requirement. In context of scattering theory, it's like imposing the outgoing. Here, it's like imposing the outgoing condition. That's, I think, how you might want to think about that. So, this is this wavefront set condition. So, it turns out that if you impose this wavefront set condition on your distribution, the spaces magically become finite dimensional. And forgetting about the fact that the spaces of distributions with restricted wavefront sets are not Bano spaces, you get a threshold theory by using this condition. Okay, so this is really the spaces. The spaces that we need to study, except we have this wavefront side restriction, and it's imposed by the dynamics. So, you really, your wavefront side should lie in the dual and stable space. Now, instead of studying generalized resonance states, we can study resonant states, right? In general, studying eigenvectors is easier than generalized eigenvectors. So, you start by studying eigenvectors, right? That's how you usually do. And so, here is the space of generalized Space of generalization of resonance states, which is instead of some power of LX killing u, you just have lx u is equal to zero. And then you can similarly define co-resonance states, which correspond to taking the adjoints of this operator. Remember, the operators have self-adjoints, so taking the adjoint changes the space. And it turns out that those would be, they have a similar definition to resonance states, except the wavefront set now should be in ES star. It should be in the dual stable state. And those two can. Space and those two can be related by this flip lap. For geodesic flows, they are time reversible. So if you take x v minus v, the conjugate the flows, it's inverse in time. And so that's those spaces are really isomorphic by this map. And what you can do is you can actually pair resonant and co-resonant states because the wave fronts don't intersect, right? You can just multiply the corresponding differential forms. If you have the correct degree, you can watch them and integrate. Wedge them and integrate, and you should wedge it with alpha because remember they were all killed by x. So, wedging with alpha gives you the correct thing. So, k forms and four minus k forms in this space can be paired with each other. Again, the product is well defined because you can take products of distributions with a complementary wavefront here. All right. So, one, a couple more things that I want to mention here is that there is something called semi-profit. There is something called semi-simplicity. So I say you have semi-simplicity if the space of generalized resonance states and resonance states coincide, so there are no Jordan blocks. And that's actually equivalent to this pairing being non-degenerate on the product of generalized resonance states and coreson states. This stuff is just exactly the same as for matrices, as a matter of fact. There's no. Once you have this spectrum property, you can think of your operators really as matrices and a lot of this kind of algebraic. And a lot of this kind of algebraic properties of square matrices will just carry through with not too much effort. Now, all right, so now if we want to analyze the situation, so we want to understand the space of generalized resonance states, and we'll start by understanding resonance states, blah, when does the simplicity hold. The simplest case is when k equals to zero. So we have zero forms, which are just functions. And that one has been well understood already. And here you have simit simplicity, and the only thing that you get is. And the only thing that you get is the constant function. So that's one-dimensional. So that's the part where, well, you get some topological information. One is basically zero of sigma, but all right. So there are no interesting, there are no non-constant distributions in the space which are invariant under the geodesic flow if we're talking about scalars. Somehow it corresponds. Somehow it corresponds to the flow being mixing. Well, not somehow, it does correspond to the flow being mixing. All right, so now let's study one forms. And so that's where topology will come in. And I will start opening quicker. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just open, look at this. So here is the space of resonant state. And then remember, L is dix plus ix. So I'll write it out. And remember that Ix already killed my U because it's an. X already killed my u because it's in this omega k0 perpendicular, so you can write it as this, just having these two equalities. And again, it looks very simple, except you have this somewhat complicated domain with the wavefront set restriction. So when you look at these forms, you see that d plays a role. So you say, okay, how about we study closed forms? You see, if du equals zero and Ixq equals zero, then you are in this space of resonance states. So let's study those. And those can be identified with your cohomology. Be identified with your cohomology. So you can, you know, when you define the Romko homology, you usually do it using C infinity. But on a compact manifold, and here we are on a compact manifold from a Duramco homology point of view, it doesn't matter which classes you use, right? You could use distributions, you could use a lot of different classes. And so what you can do is you can just to each of these distributions, you can correspond this to a homology class. You know, it's a closed form, so you have. You know, it's a closed form, so you have a homology class, and it can be well defined because these classes are actually closed under pseudo-differential operators. In particular, they are closed under the elliptic parameters of the Hausdorff. So you can write any form with a smooth closure in this space as something that's exact in this space plus something closed but smooth. So you can contract everything to smooth from a point of view of the oncohomology. Smooth from the point of view of their own cohomology. So, this cohomology map turns out to be an isomorphism in degree one, and that's something that was already present in the previous work, 2017 paper Sworsky. And well, he I'm going to skip the proof here, but it basically uses basic fracon properties of your operator. Somehow, once you set it up correctly, it has this almost algebraic or Has this almost algebraic or formal flavor? So it turns out that closed resonant one forms can be identified with homology classes. So the question is then, so then their dimension is going to be the same as the first Bayian number. The question is, are there any non-closed one forms in this space, red one, zero? And it turns out that, yes, and again, I'll skip some of the details, but basically, there is a way to Details, but basically, there is a way to rotate. In case of constant curvature in the hyperbolic case, you can rotate this one form, the closed one form by pi over two in some sense, and you get other forms in the space which are not closed, and that's everything. So you get twice as many in a kind of in a very explicit way. You can describe everything in terms of the closed ones, but you get double the amount. So there is an explicit description of these. And this has to do with the specific symmetries. Has to do with the specific symmetries of hyperbolic space. It has to do with the fact that the expansion rate of the geodesic flow is constant in hyperbolic space. It's independent of the direction. So a 90-degree rotation of saying stable or unstable space can use with the geodesic flow. So that's this extra symmetry that creates this extra space. Then you can use the knowledge you gained here to actually describe the two forms. You get some description. You get some description. And in fact, when you look at generalized two forms, it turns out that you have Jordan blocks. So in degree two, you actually get Jordan blocks in the hyperbolic case, and that accounts for all the dimensions that we got in the hyperbolic setting. Now, how do you do it for perturbations? So you just the closed things will always be with you. Those are topological. With you. Those are topological. If π1 is an isomorphism, closed forms, they'll always be the same number. You want to move out the non-closed. So you want to do it by perturbation. And here we do it by first variation argument. And how do you do first variation argument? Well, so you just take a perturbation depending on how you want the first derivative of the variation to be non-zero. Basically, you want the resonance as zero for the example of to move away and you compute its first derivative. Compute its first derivative. And in order for that to be non-zero, you want a certain expression to be non-zero. And this expression is the pairing of the push, of the pullback of the conformal factor that you use to perturb to the sphere bundle times alpha, the contact form, times du times j star of du, j is a centipedal map, where u corresponds to non-closed one forms. So you need to compute something and you want it to be non-zero. And you want it to be non-zero, and that's basically what we show. So, I will do this. So, you need to show that a certain quantity is non-zero. The only problem is that this quantity is a distribution. So, u is a resonance one form, so it's somewhat well determined. And in fact, we have a good description of it, but it's a distribution. It's really not a function in any sense. And then you wedge it with J star du, you know this. Wedge it with J star du, you know this pairing can be defined because the wavefronts don't intersect, and then you need to push it forward to the base. So, this is an object on the clear bundle. You want to push it forward to the base, show it's non-zero. And that is slightly tricky because, well, most things are non-zero, right? In general, in different perturbation, share perturbation theory, you just hope to say, well, most things are non-zero. What are the chances it's identically zero? Not much, right? Identically zero, not much, right? But how do you show it's actually non-zero? Well, for a function, how do you show a function is non-zero? You evaluate it at a point and show it's non-zero or something like that, right? But for distributions, you cannot evaluate at points, right? So for a distribution, you have to pair it with some test function and show that it's non-zero, right? That's how you show a distribution as non-zero. Now, but if you choose some random test function, you won't be able to compute this pairing. So, okay, it's probably. To compute this pairing, so okay, it's probably non-zero, but but you can't show it because you can't compute it. So, the difficulty in this part is to show that you to find correct test functions that you can pair with and you can compute it, and this will still be non-zero, and they have to be smooth. And the way we do it is we define a certain operator, which is convolution with, well, cosh to the minus four, which is not such an unreasonable thing to do on hyperbolic spaces of the hyperbolic distance. You define it on the convolution. You define it on the covering space, which is H3. You pull it down to the quotient, you get a smoothing operator, which we call Q4 because of the force here. And if you apply it to this F, which is this push forward that you want to be non-zero, it turns out to be this expression, which is the hyperbolic Laplacian of the length square pointwise of a certain push forward, which is a non-zero harmonic one form. And so if this expression, if f is zero, if capital F is zero, and then this is identical. Zero, capital F is zero, and then this is identically zero. This is Laplacian complex manifold, so this means that this harmonic one form has constant length, and that doesn't happen on hyperbolic three manifolds. And so that's how we get a handle to show that something is non-zero. And once this derivative is non-zero, we can do perturbation theory to show that our order vanishing is 4 minus d1. So I'll for the two conjectures. One of them is that generically we should get this kind of behavior where all forms are Behavior where all forms are closed, which is, well, if somebody asked a question, I can elaborate more on it. What's needed for micro-local analysis to actually access that? Not hopeless, but kind of interesting and potentially difficult. And the other one, which is kind of ridiculous, we don't know that, but we don't, is that if you have a twist by what you have an acyclic complex, then there is no remnant spaces. It's an equivalent. It's an equivalent of this theorem and Hodge theories that if your underlying manifold has no cohomology, then there are no non-zero harmonic forms. But we don't actually know how to prove that, which would be very nice to prove because then you could try to prove Fried's conjecture about the value at zero by exhaustion, somewhat similar to how Dungier-Morivier enchanted. All right, now I'll really stop. I'm very sorry for running over. Well then, thank you very much for the talk. Are there any questions? Sure. How much works in higher dimensions? We don't know. I mean, well, we have this conjecture, right? We didn't try, so you can see already in the Try so you can see already in dimension three things get complicated, right? Already in dimension three, we don't know for people who like stratified spaces because it's first variation. If you think about the moduli spaces of metrics, so there is this point, which is the hyperbolic metric. And then what we show is that for a generic point around this, you're going to have a different vanishing order. Basically, all the closed forms will move away. But because we used first variation, we suspect but cannot prove. Suspect, but cannot prove in general that there is something like a sub-manifold. You know, you would have different strata passing through or near this point, on which you would have different orders of vanishing. It's almost literally, well, not quite, but it's similar to this question. If you look at symmetric matrices and you look at order of zero as a as let's say real symmetric matrices, you look at the dimension of the kernel of the matrix. At the dimension of the kernel of the matrix, so the multiplicity of zero is an eigenvalue. You stratify by this multiplicity, you get a complicated thing. I'm not, I think somebody figured that one out, and we have a somewhat more complicated version of that with some components that we don't really know how to handle. So, already in dimension three, it's kind of there is, if anybody, you know, in stratified spaces wants to have a go at it, there is certainly, you know, the picture is incomplete. So, what we can conjecture in general. Conjecture in general that maybe this holds for generic. So, what we conjecture is that for generic three manifolds, we get the same picture. So, we showed for generic three manifolds near hyperbolic, we conjecture it's true for generic three manifolds. And if you have higher dimensional manifolds, in our paper, we have a similar conjecture. Conjectures are cheap, right? But it makes sense in some, you know, it makes sense to conjecture that all of these forms will be closed. So, all of these. Of these forms will be closed. So, all of these resonant forms will be closed. And then, once you do that, and you assume that simplicity holds, using tools that we already have, one can figure out what all the multiplicities are and figure out what the order of vanishing is. So, that I think in higher dimensions, that would be the thing that one might be able to show. But there is a certain micro-local ingredient which we're missing. That, you know, if anybody else, I can explain what it is, but it's. Explain what it is, but uh, it's um, yeah, anyway. So, that's um, that's that's the state of affairs in higher dimensions. So, Semion, maybe I didn't understand. You always have the lower bound on, say, the res one, that it's bounded below by the first betty number. So, you always have the closed forms, do you? Yes, yes, that's right. And that might not be due to us, I wanna say, but I I wanna say, but in unique, it's known that that's right. If you just want the closed one form, the dimension of that is fixed in any dimension, in fact. So it's always equal to bedty one. But nothing similar for the two form? No. So for two forms, it gets complicated because no. The abstraction to constructing cohomology classes comes from Homology classes come from the closed one forms. I think if I go back to where is it? Yeah, you see here, for instance, in the hyperbolic case, if you look at two forms, they're almost all exact. So you have D alpha, which is exact. Then you have D of res 1, 0 for two forms. That's in the hyperbolic case. And then you have just one non-closed one, which is psi, which is a canonical form. It's a smooth form, which generates the homomorphism. Which generates cochomology of the fibers of the sphere bundle, which are two-dimensional. So, this doesn't saturate cohomology. What saturates cochomology kind of is the generalized one, but you know, so you can see it gets kind of messy. Yeah, okay. The semi-simplicity, can it be taught at some sort of biology, some sort of point-carry duality? Well, kind of. I mean, semi-simplicity, where is it? Semi-simplicity is equivalent to this form pairing being non-degenerate between resonant and co-resonant forms. So now for Hodge theory, you know, whoever does Hodge theory, this is a place where you have it nicer than we do, because D is del star and everything is self-adjoint. So there is a reason people don't talk about co-harmonic forms because they're just harmonic forms. Right? The operator is dual or the same. Kernel of the operator is dual or the same. And when you pair a harmonic form, so you just pair harmonic forms with harmonic forms using L2, which is a non-degenerate pairing. That's basically how you show the symmetric matrices do not have Jordan blocks. But in our setting, it's not. Setting, it's not like that, right? This pairing could be degenerate, and in fact, in the hyperbolic case, in two forms, it is degenerate. We show it's degenerate. So, uh, so yes, it's about computing the pairing, but it's um, no, it's a priori, it could be degenerate. Yeah, I'm curious about the four also. Is it related with the fact that M is of dimension four, or it's just a coincidence? Here this four in the statement about semi-simplicity. Oh, yes, yes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's it's in the pairing because we are M has dimension five and alpha is a one form because we are we are killing so you you have a five manifold which is contact and then you you have this revector field x and you look at k forms that are annihilated by x and so then a matrix And so then a natural pairing on these would be: you take a k form and a 4 minus k form, you wedge them, and then you wedge with alpha, which is the contact form, and then you integrate. So if you have higher dimensions, this part, I mean, this whole slide, it applies in higher dimensions. Well, just four has to be replaced by the correct number. Now, kind of the basic algebraic and analytic theory goes through, it's just the details of the. Don't of the topological analysis. Simeon? Yes. I have a question. So did you look at the complex dimension two hyperbolic space? Because there you may have like more structure, more rotation somehow? No, but that's a very good question to ask. So we studied. Because maybe there is a bigger jump then. It could be. So there is a bunch of locally symmetric spaces, right? There is this kind of hierarchy. You start with hyperbolic surfaces, which is the simplest, and then you kind of branch into hyperbolic manifolds. And then you have more complicated ones, like the complex spaces is the next one, the one that you mentioned. And so the question makes sense and possibly could be solvable with another. Solvable with enough work, but some new insights will be needed. It's not like our strategy would just literally apply, right? For the complex space, that could be a good project. Somebody to do, we, yeah, so we just stuck to the hyperbolic space, if nothing else, for our own laziness. Yeah, so it could be more symmetry. So basically, the general mantra of our result here is that these locally symmetric spaces, exactly, they have extra symmetry. Exactly, they have extra symmetry. The hyperbolic space has this rotation symmetry inside the sphere bundle. And so, if I may venture a congestion, then probably every locally symmetric space has its extra symmetries. And with enough insight, one might be able to identify what these symmetries are, maybe even classify them in some representation theoretic way. And maybe, again, with enough perseverance, because our perturbation thing. Because our perturbation thing here was kind of particular, the way we proved it, show that generically they all disappear and you just get this conjecture. That's a very good question. Well, if there is no more questions, we have still the picture. Sure, uh which is when
