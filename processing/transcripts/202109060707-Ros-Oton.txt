We will switch to Xavier Rossotton, which is from ICREA and Universidad de Barcelona. And he will speak about stable cones in the thing one-phase boundary problem. He will have accordingly more minutes, I mean, 25 minutes starting from now, okay? Okay. Okay, well, thank you very much for the invitation and for the introduction, Mateo. So I will talk, I will try to be brief. So 25 minutes. So we will talk, as you said, about the thin or fractional one-phase free boundary problem. And this is a joint work with Chavier Fernando Real, who's a postdoc at EPFL and was a PhD student of Alessio. So let me start with the classical one-phase problem. Okay, so this is the one-phase free boundary problem. It's one of the most classical free boundary problems. I would say together with the optical problem and the Stefan problem, this is the other very classical free boundary problem. And the regularity theory was initiated by Altan Caffarelli in the 80s, right after the one for the obstacle and the Stefan. And this is still a And this is still a very active field of research in which we have still many open questions, and we will see some of them. So, basically, the general idea is that we want to minimize a functional, an energy functional, that has a non-smooth behavior at u equals zero. Okay, so basically, the solution will have two parts, one in which u is zero, one in which u is positive. And then the interface is what we call the free boundary. Okay, so same in this generality, you could. Same in this generality, you could think that this is similar to the obstacle problem or even the Stefan problem, which is parabolic, but this functional will be different. Okay, so the one-phase problem, the energy functional that we have is the following. So basically, we minimize the Diracle energy plus a penalization for the measure of the setting which U is positive. So we want to have a function that is minimizing the gradient U squared, but at the same time, Uh, u squared, but at the same time, we want to minimize the set where u is positive. So, and this non-convex energy functional gives minimizers that are of this form. So, they will have a region in which u is zero, a region with u is positive. And then in the region where u is positive, as we will see, the function will be harmonic. Okay, so the main known results is that there exists a minimizer, u. So, given any boundary. So, given any boundary data here on the boundary of the fixed domain omega, there is always a minimizer, maybe not necessarily unique, but it's okay. And then the regularity, the optimal regularity of solutions is that U is flip sheets. Okay, so in general, the gradient of U will have a jump here across the free boundary. And then the most challenging and important question here is: what can we say about the regularity of the free boundary? Okay, so we have the same kind. Okay, so we have the same kind of questions as in the previous talk, and we want to try to see what is the best we can say. And then basically the results are quite different in the one-phase problem or in the Stefan problem. And in this context, what happens is that up to dimension four, so in dimensions n less or equal than four, three boundaries are always sinfinity. Okay, so there are no singular points then in this case. So in low dimensions, we have So, in low dimensions, we have full regularity, while in high dimensions, dimensions seven or higher, there are singular points and we have examples of them. Okay, and then one of the main and most difficult open questions here is to decide what happens in dimensions five and six. Okay, this is still open even for the classical one-phase problem. Okay, but basically, other than that, we have a very, very clear picture of what happens with three boundaries here. Okay, so. Here. Okay, so the overall strategy for the probability theorem that I just said about the free boundary is the following: so, because the problem is a scale invariant, we can study blow-ups. So, we pick any free boundary point, you do this blow-up procedure, and then what will happen is that blow-ups are homogeneous, thanks to a monotonicity formula. Okay, and then the main question is to classify blow-ups. Okay, so this is a very, very important step, which is the classification of blow-ups. Which is the classification of blow-ups, and says that after dimension four, blow-ups must be 1D. Okay, and then nothing else could happen. And then, if I have the blow-up that is something 1D, like in this picture, then what happens is that as we zoom in, because the blow-up is simply the limit, so a bit before taking the limit, so as we zoom in more and more, the free boundary looks flatter and flatter. And then we have the theorem due to Alden Caffarelli in this. Due to Alden Caffarelli in this context, that says that if the free boundary is flat enough, then it's actually C1 alpha. Okay, and then once it is C1 alpha, it turns out that it's infinity. And this is more a La Schauder estimate in a sense. Okay, so all this strategy is quite common. I mean, it has a strong analogy with minimal surfaces. So even though each of these steps, each of the proofs is different, and especially the classification of low-abs, you need a different monotony. Of low-abs, you need a different monotonicity formula, and you need a different proof of this part and also of this part. The overall strategy is somehow the same for minimal surfaces or for other free boundary problems as well. So in the Stefan problem, you could think that basically the strategy is the same, even though then in the Stefan problem, we have much more, so it's a very different problem to understand singular points. Okay, here I'm not talking about singular points. Singular points. Okay, so this is the classical one-phase problem. Okay, and I didn't say what is the PDE satisfied by you, right? So the problem comes from minimizing a functional. And then we have this interface, which is the free boundary, and then these two regions, in which we should have a PD for you here and here. So from the point of view of PDEs, what is the PD satisfied by U? Okay, and then this has a By u. Okay, and then this has a simple answer, and it's the following. So, first, notice that this functional can be seen as a semi-linear functional. Okay, so you can think of it as a functional of this type, like a semi-linear PD, in which this capital F is the characteristic function. Okay, so the F in the energy functional is discontinuous, okay, but it's somehow a semi-linear PD as well, okay? And then what happens, at least And then what happens, at least formally, it's easy to see, and then you can prove it more in a more rigorous way, that when you differentiate this, you take the minimum of the energy functional, what happens is that the function is harmonic whenever it's far away from the free boundary. So it's harmonic whenever it's positive. It's zero whenever it's zero, of course. And then on the interface, we have that the gradient is constant equal to one. Okay, so the normal derivative is constant equal to one. The normal derivative is constant equal to one. This is equivalent in this case. So, in a sense, we have both Diriglay and Neumann conditions for this problem. Okay, so basically, if you remember what Alessio presented in the previous talk, in the Stefan problem, we have U is zero on the free boundary and the gradient is zero on the free boundary. And then we have a right-hand side here. Okay, here, this problem is different. And then we have also both Birikla and Neumann conditions, but the Neumann is not zero. Neumann conditions, but the Neumann is non-zero, it's one. It's constant. And this makes the problem quite different, actually. Okay, and singular points, especially they behave in a completely different way. And then also you have non-uniqueness here, while in the other case, you have uniqueness of solution. So there is a kind of a similar structure, but then the results and the theorems are actually quite different. Okay? But keep in mind, this is the PDE that we want to understand in this context. Okay? And what Okay, and what can we say about the classification of blow-ups? So, this is a crucial step in the theory. This is one of the most important and difficult steps in this theory of the one-phase problem. And then, blow-ups will satisfy this PD. So they are harmonic whenever they are positive. They are one homogeneous, so homogeneous at least one. And the gradient is constant along all the free boundaries. Okay, so this is the equation we have, the PDE. And then what one can prove. What one can prove, and it's not difficult to prove in 2D, is that any function satisfying this must be a 1D function, a 1D profile that is basically the positive part of a plane, basically, of a linear function. Okay, so in 2D, that's it. There is nothing else to be proven here in terms of classification of low-ups. However, in higher dimensions, in dimensions three or higher, the question becomes more delicate. And then we have the following, that in all dimensions, Following that in all dimensions three or higher, there exists a solution to this equation, to this PD, that is actually symmetric. And it looks like this. So there is an actually symmetric cone in which u is zero here and here. Okay, and then u is positive here, harmonic here. And the function, if you choose appropriately this opening of the column, the function u will be one homogeneous and with constant gradient along the full free boundary. Okay, so there exists. Okay, so there exists a solution like this to this PD. And then, so you might wonder: well, this means that then in 3D, I already have singular points. And the answer is no, because we are looking at minimizers of the energy. So what turns out is that this actually symmetric solution in dimensions less or equal than six, this is not a minimizer of the energy functional. So it cannot appear as a blow-up because we are looking at minimizers of the function. Of the function. Okay, so this is somehow, if you know the theory of minimal surfaces, this plays the role of the Simon's cone. Okay, so the Simons cone is something that exists in all even dimensions, but it's only a counterexample to the regularity in dimensions eight or higher. Okay, so here in this case, this is a counterexample in dimension seven or higher. Okay, so we have a special class of solutions that are actually symmetric ones. That are actually symmetric ones in which we can already see some dichotomy between the different dimensions. Okay, so, and as I said, dimension seven, this is a counterexample. Dimension two is not even a solution. And from three to six, it is a solution, but not a minimum. Okay. And then, okay, this is a particular class of solutions. What can we say about general solutions? And this is what I said before, that this is a deep theorem due to Caffarelli-Jeruson Kenny in 3D and due to... Jerry Son Kennick in 3D and due to Jerusalem and Sabine in 4D, and says that in dimensions three and four, all blow-ups must be 1D. Okay, so this is a deep and difficult theorem, and it really needs to use the fact that the blow-up is a minimizer. Okay, so the PDE, if you only look at the PDE, this is not enough. You really need to use the energy functional and the fact that it's a minimizer. Okay, so how do we use that it is a minimizer? So how do we use that it is a minimizer? Well, you do this via the stability condition. Okay, so you really, you need to use only that, not that you don't need that it's a minimizer, but only a stable solution, basically. So the blow-up is a stable solution, and then you can find the stability condition. Okay, so this is due to Caffarelli, Jerry, and Kenny, and it's where they found the stability condition for this problem. And it's this, is that for every test function eta, For every test function eta, you have this: that the integral of any test function with gradient squared is bigger equal than an integral on the free boundary in which you have the mean curvature here as a weight. Okay, so h is the mean curvature of the free boundary. And if this happens for every test function, then this means that the function, your solution is stable solution. Okay, so any minimizer satisfies this condition. And then the proof of these two results of 3D and 4D. Of 3D and 4D are based on this instability condition, and then choosing very appropriately the test functions. So you have to choose the right test functions, and they are different in 3D or in 4D. And then you get this theory that basically the only possibility is that blow-ups are 1D. Okay? So this is crucial, as I said, in order to classify blow-ups, so to prove this theorem in up to dimension four, but also to understand. Four, but also to understand actually symmetric solutions up to dimension six. Okay, so notice that there's still this gap that for actually symmetric solutions we have a complete understanding, for general solutions, we do not. Okay, now this is basically the background that I wanted you to know a bit for the classical one-phase problem. And now the theorem that I want to present is about the thin or fractional one-phase pre-boundary problem. Okay, so this is basically. Okay, so this is basically the problem we are interested in is the minimization of this functional. So instead of the Dirigle energy, we minimize a non-local energy, the Hs, instead of the H1, basically, with the same penalization term for the measure of the set where U is positive. Okay, so this is a very natural energy functional that was first studied by Caffara Liro Joe Francir, and it was motivated by flame propagation models and the regularity theory. Models and the regularity theory has been developed in the last 10 years, starting with the works of Capale, Joffrey, and Cyre, but also later on by the Silva, Sabine, and many others. Okay, so this is of course a non-local energy functional that is called the thin one-phase pre-wander problem, because when S equals to one-half, this can be written as a problem in which you have the Dirichlet energy in one dimension more, but this is measured. In one dimension, more, but this is measured on a thin space on a hyperplane. Okay, and then the best known result in this context is the following. So, let me summarize what is the best known result. Okay, so basically, this is a combination of works due to the Silvan Savine in GEMS and Engelstein, Kauranen, Bratz, Sakularis, and Sire in CPAM last year. And it says the following. So, basically, free boundaries are smooth outside a set of singular points that they call six. set of singular points that I call sigma and the dimension of sigma okay so the dimension of this singular set is at most n minus k so k star s so this k is by definition so we define k star s is the lowest dimension in which non-trivial low-ups appear okay and then we don't know what is this value of k so in a sense all the theory is developed except for the determination of this value of k Value of k. Okay, so we don't know what is the lowest dimension in which non-trivial blow-ups appear, okay. So, and this is the question that motivates our work, right? So, basically, we want to answer this question. We have this energy functional, we have a full regularity theory, and then we have blow-ups, and then if the blow-ups are 1D, we have full regularity of the free boundary. But then the key question that remains open is this. What is the first dimension in which non-trivial blow-ups may occur? Dimension in which non-trivial blow-ups may appear. Okay, so this is the question that motivates our work. And the only known result in this direction is that in 2D, blow-ups are always 1D. So only the 2D is completely understood, but nothing else is known in higher dimensions, basically. So nothing else was known before our result. So the equation, something I didn't say, I have to say, is what is the equation satisfied? Is what is the equation satisfied by minimizers, right? So, and then this is analogous to the classical case somehow. And then, instead of functions being harmonic, they satisfy this equation for the fractional Laplacian here. So they are s harmonic. And instead of having constant gradient on the free boundary, they have constant quotient. So u divided by distance to the s is constant along the free boundary. Okay, so this is somehow the over-determined problem. Determined problem that minimizers satisfy. Okay. And the optimal regularity of solutions is that they are Cs. Okay, and this is optimal. And blow-ups are homogeneous of degree S. So blow-ups, the equation for blow-ups is this one. Okay, so it's that they satisfy this equation for the fractional Laplacian, that they are zero here, they are homogeneous of degree S, and the quotient with the distance to the Quotient with the distance to the edge is constant along the free band. And now we want to try to understand if we could classify somehow or minimizers or blow-ups. So the first thing to notice here is that there is an analogous, actually symmetric solution of this problem. And in this case, it actually exists in every dimension starting from two. So because the problem is non-local, even in dimension two, Local, even in dimension two, this exists, and it's the same as before, basically. Okay, so you have to choose the opening of the cone appropriately, and then this is a solution to this equation, to this PD, okay, to this non-local equation. And then the question that, so it raises naturally the question that in which dimensions are these actually symmetric solutions minimizers? Okay, and this turns out to be a difficult question. Is this turns out to be a difficult question? Uh, and then this is uh the question that uh we want to to answer. And then the second question: before doing this, you need to first answer a more basic question, which is what is the stability condition for this problem? Okay, and this turns out to be highly non-trivial as well, and this is also a question that we answer in our work. Okay, so we have the motivation somehow is to answer this question. So, in which Answer this question. So, in which dimensions are these actually symmetric solutions minimizers? And for this, we need to answer this important question of what is the stability condition for the thing one-phase problem. Okay. And our first main result that, as I said, is joint work with Chavi Fernando Dreal is the following. And it says that if you have any function that satisfies... That satisfies, I mean, it's a blow-up basically, it's a homogeneous stable solution, which is in addition actually seismic. Then, up to dimension five, u0 is 1D. So, these solutions are not stable. So, they must be unstable up to dimension five. Okay. And so, this answers our question up to dimension five. We don't know what happens in dimension six, but we know that in dimension. happens in dimension six, but we know that in dimension seven, there are counterexamples even for s equal one. So we expect that for n equals seven, there will be counterexamples also for other values of s. So up to dimension five, these solutions cannot be blow-ups. And at least when s is close to one, we expect them to be minimizers for n bigger equal than set. Okay, so that is only the gap of dimension six, in which we are not sure what happens, but we believe they should. What happens, but we believe they should be. I mean, the theorem should be valid up to n equals six as well, but we prove it up to dimension five. Okay, and then it's important to say that our approach is completely different from the one of Kaffir Elli-Geris and Kennick for S equal one, in which there are many explicit computations and they even require some computer, I mean some not numerics, but they require some help from a computer, from Mathematica to do the computations involving an LD, okay? The computations involving an OD. Okay, so our proof is simpler. So we are missing dimension six, but our proof is really does not require any deep computations. It really, you take, once you have the stability condition, it's pretty, I mean, not simple, but it's easier than their proof, I would say. Okay, so our second main contribution, as I said, is to find Second main contribution, as I said, is to find the stability condition. Okay, so basically, we find the stability condition that extends the previous one for the classical case, but here it turns out to be much more intricate. So it's more difficult to verify in a sense. And it's the following. So if you have any, so the stability condition basically for say homogeneous solutions to simplify. Is the following. So basically, it's a double internal on the free boundary. So this is kind of an energy functional on the free boundary with a kernel that is comparable to x minus one to the power n. Okay, so this is kind of an h1 half energy on the free boundary. And this must be bigger equal than a potential h that behaves like one over x times f squared. times f squared. Okay, so f is the test function that this should be valid for every test function. Okay, so if you think about this, so this is this is an n minus one dimensional, say a manifold, if this is smooth. So this is a kind of a Hardy inequality, because this is an H one half energy, and this is a potential that behaves like one over X. So this is a kind of a Hardy, fractional Hardy inequality on the free boundary. Okay, and then if this is valid or not, If this is valid or not, it will depend on what are the exact constants that appear here and here. Okay, so this is a delegate inequality. So we need to know exactly what is this kernel, what is this potential, what are they exactly, and how can we relate them. And it turns out that this kernel is given in terms of the green function of the domain. You have to take the green function, divide by distance to the x in both variables. And then this potential h is an integral of this kernel and with the normal. And with the normal vector, the oscillation of the normal vector, basically. So, this is a quite complicated stability condition, but this is what it is. You cannot avoid it. So, this is really if and only if, and this is the stability condition for the problem. And the nice thing is that we can use this stability condition to prove our theorem for actually symmetric solutions. So, it is useful, even if it looks difficult to be used. Okay, and just in the last two minutes, I want to. Last two minutes, I wanted to mention some open questions that remain. So basically, what we have proved is that actually symmetric solutions are unstable up to dimensions five. Okay, and this is independent of the value of the parameter s. So this is somehow surprising and it's something that do not happen, does not happen in other problems in which stable solutions are involved. Okay, so if you take general semi-linear equations, the stability condition and the The stability condition and the right, I mean, the sharp theorem depends on s. So the dimensions depend on the s. Here, the dimensions are independent of s, and the same for non-local minimal surfaces. Okay, so the same happens that the shadow dimension depends on s and in this context it does not. Okay, then second, we believe that the same should happen for n equals six. And this motivates the following conjecture. So we believe that for every s, the theorem should be the same and is that. The theorem should be the same, and is that all blow-ups should be 1D up to dimension six for actually symmetric and for general solutions. This is a bit bold conjecture, if you want, but we believe this should be true. Okay, and recall that this is open even in the local case, right? That for five and six, this is open in the local case. So the only known cases is when s equals one up to dimension four, and in for every s only dimension two. Only in dimension two. Okay, and what we have answered here is the case of actually symmetric solutions by finding the stability condition. Okay, and this is somehow related to the problem of classifying non-local minimal costs. So thank you very much. And I will stop here and let me know if you have any questions, of course. Yes, thank you very much, Shavi, for the talk. And if anybody has some questions, there are a couple of minutes and can write or open the mic and talk. Let's see.
