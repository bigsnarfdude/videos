Are we a go? Yep, we're on, we're recording. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so thanks everybody. I hope you can hear me well and you can see the slides that I'm sharing here in Zoom. If you cannot hear me well or you'd like me to go back to a slide or something, just speak up or talk through the chat. So the goal of today's talk will be to The goal of today's talk will be to discuss a geometric problem, and that is the study of Lagrangian links and their Lagrangian fillings. And I will be doing so through an algebraic lens, which involves cluster structures. So to begin with, the main goal will be to construct what's called a cluster A structure on certain space associated to a Legendre nod. The space is going to be this space in here, the model I space of sheaves in R2, which are constructed. Shees in R2, which are constructible and have singular support, you're given Legendian link. Now, you're not meant to understand anything of that sentence, and indeed the talk will go through the basics of what that goal is about. Namely, we want, to begin with, have a geometric intuition for what this modelized space is doing. Sure, you can name this modelized space of sheaves, but what is it really capturing from a geometric standpoint? Now, the second thing that I want to emphasize. The second thing that I want to emphasize as well is what is this cluster structure? What's the definition of that? What is a good geometric way to think about a monolith space having that cluster A structure? We'll go over that as well. And if at any point you want me to stop and give an example or repeat any details, just ask me to do so. And finally, from a more kind of pragmatic perspective, I want to also emphasize why is it useful to have a cluster array structure? To have a cluster A structure, it is certainly a beautiful thing, sort of an intellectual good progress exercise to know that that modelized space has its structure. But from a more basic perspective, can we recover or indeed prove new results that we didn't know in symplectic and contact topology through this cluster structure? The answer is yes, and I will give some examples of that. Okay, so what's drawn in here is just the Legendre in front, and indeed the talk is heavily motivated by Is heavily motivated by me wanting to understand what a Legendric knot is. Hans has shared the slides with you in the chat, so you can use the slides independently. But yeah, just tell me if you want me to emphasize any details of a given slice. Now, what is the geometric problem that motivates this work? Well, it's a problem in symplectic geometry, and that problem has as an input Alejandrian name. So that's the input you start with. You consider a name. Input: You start with. You consider a Legendre link lambda, and you can have this Legendre link Lambda be in standard contact R3, in standard contact 3-sphere, or you can also have it in the unit cotangent bundle of R2. For all intents and purposes, it's going to be essentially the same discussion. Now, what do you study about this Legendrean link? Well, what you study in this particular case is the notion of a Lagrangian filling. So let me do a little cartoonish picture. So, let me do a little cartoonish picture. Here, I have depicted for you a Lagrangian link at the boundary of the four-ball. And what we're caring about are these Lagrangian fillings in here. Those are embedded surface in the four-ball, which have fixed boundary, your Lagrangian link, that's stated in here. And you want them to be actually Lagrangian surfaces, namely, the standard symplectic derboux form must vanish when you restrict. form must vanish when you restrict it to its two-dimensional tangent space. In addition, we will ask for exactness, which for what we need to do is a necessary hypothesis. So the geometric problem here is you're given a Laganian link on the boundary and you care about studying these surfaces in the four wall that are Lagrangian and are embedded with your fixed boundary being your Lagandran knot. Okay, so that's a very geometric off-the-cuff problem. There's no algebra here. Problem. There's no algebra here whatsoever. How do you approach that problem? One way to approach that problem is to maybe start thinking about what the space of all Lagrangian phillics looks like. Well, what is the space of all Lagrangian fillings? Well, to begin with, that's an infinite dimensional space. The quotient relation, the equivalence relation we have is up to Hamiltonian isotopy, which is also an infinite-dimensional group. So you cannot really talk in any naive sort of finite-dimensional way about Finite-dimensional way about the space of Lagrangian fillings for a given Lagrangian node. In symplectic geometry, we found, or rather, people who've worked before me have found two ways to deal with this. One is a floor theoretical way through the study of augmentation varieties. And that goes back to the work of Lenny and many others. And Kalman and Chikanov come to mind. And another way is through the study of sheaves. So that goes back to the theory of Kashiwari. Theory of Kashiwara and Shapira, the micro-local theory of sheaves, and more recently, the work of Stéphane Guillermo, also in joint work with Kashiwar and Shapira, has been crucial. So here the upshot, and I will delve into the precise definitions later, is that there is a way to associate a category to a Legendre-ling lambda such that that category, well, it's non-trivial, it says something, and that category is a Legendre invariant. That category, Variable. That category, for those who like algebra, is actually a DG category. And what's interesting about that DG category is that it satisfies a certain fineness condition. And thus, by results of Tohen and Vacquier, you can actually make sense of the notion of a modelized space of objects. So, in general, if you have a category, you cannot just talk about a space of objects. Objects are a set class. But if you want to endow it with a topology, if you maybe want to do With a topology, if you maybe want to do algebraic geometry in it, you're thinking about some kind of algebraic structures, you need something about that category. Luckily, that category of sheaves, once it's DG enhanced, satisfies that. The upshot here is we can name a category in a Legendary varying way. Whatever the category is, it yields a space. That's the space I will be studying. That space, as I have defined it, is quite abstract and sort of hard to tackle, but I will give a very least theoretical down-to-definition. A very least theoretical down-to-earth description of it later in the talk. Now, is this modelized space, is this space that we obtain, the modelized space of Lagrangian fillings? Well, it's a good avatar for it. And the way, the precise way in which it's a good avatar for it is that it satisfies the following outstanding property. If you give a Lagrangian filling L of lambda, so an example will be this surface for this boundary condition lambda. This boundary condition lambda. The Lagrangian filling is going to give you inside that space a toric chart. That toric chart is actually open. So, here, whenever I say the word torus, it's going to mean an algebraic torus. That means C star instead of, you know, C star to some power instead of S1 to some power, just the complexification of our all good GNT torus. So, this toric chart is an open toric chart. And, okay, well, typically modelized spaces are such that the Lagrange. Typically, modelized spaces are such that the Lagrangian filling would give you a point. Okay, here it gives you a chart, but it's something we understand geometrically. That chart ought to be understood as the space of a billion local systems on your Lagrangian. So your Lagrangian is a puncture surface, and you can ask about its a billion local systems, namely homomorphisms from pi 1 onto G L 1 C. There's no conjugation because everything is abelian. G L1C is C star. G L1 C is C star. So those are maps from pi 1 to C star. That's the same as the first comology group of the Lagrangian with values in C star. That is exactly why we get this B1 of L. So you can think of this modelized space as having the property that given a Lagrangian feeling and a choice of a Belian local system, you get a point. But given that you know very well how to parametriz local systems, we're going to have this perspective where a given Lagrangian feeling is going to give us. Lagrangian filling is going to give us a Tauric chart. Are there any questions at this point? Okay. Pajé, can you do the same thing with augmentation varieties? Yes, everything I will say can be done with the augmentation varieties. There's a pragmatical difference. So the difference between chief and augmentation variety. So, the difference between sheave and augmentation varieties, roughly speaking, is the Riemann-Hilwer correspondence, is the difference between having an ODE and having the sheave of solutions of the ODE. So in floor theory, you have to solve a certain PDE, you have to find certain holomorphic disks, and once you've found them all, then you can compute everything that I'll say there. Nevertheless, sheaves have the advantage that in a way, the ODE or the PDE in this case has been solved. So having the sheaf is a way to kind of shortcut to the computations. Cut to the computations so they're faster. But I can explain also how to do it on the augmentation variety. Does that answer the question? Okay, I hope you. Thanks, Lenny. Sorry. Thanks. Okay, so a lot of us like to think about smooth problems as well. And certainly you know much better smooth topology than Much better smooth topology than I do, but I wanted to highlight some differences between the smooth world, that is, smooth surfaces bounding a smooth knot up to smooth isotopy, and Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangian fillings. Oh, well, you know, Roget is studying these Lagrangian surfaces that bound a Lagangan knot. How far is this from studying smooth surfaces bounding a smooth knot? It's distinct enough. It's different enough. Here's my two favorite differences. First of all, a smooth knot. First of all, a smooth knot bounds a smooth surface in the four wall. That's a given. Now, a Legendre nod lambda might or might not bound a Lagrangian filling. Since I'm studying this problem, we will always take lambdas that do bound Lagrangian fillings, but that's not in general the case. Furthermore, even if you do bound a Lagrangian filling, then you have a pretty hardcore topological constraint on the abstract type of that filling, namely the genus of the filling is completely determined by the Lagendian number. Completely determined by the Lagendian knot, and furthermore, it's a slice genus and minimizes it. So, for instance, a smoother knot bounds certainly a smooth disk, it bounds smooth-knotted disks, and it bounds also genus one smooth surfaces and genus two. You can smoothly add genus to any surface which has a given boundary. That's pretty straightforward, hopefully. Now, in general, just studying the smooth and nod would give, just for the case of this, because the study of For the case of disks, the study of knotted two spheres in four space. So that is a challenging problem. In the Lagrangian world, when we have a Lagrangian unknot and it's max TB, so it admits a Lagrangian filling, actually there's a unique Lagrangian filling. So not only it can only be a disk, but actually it's going to be unique up to homotopy isotopy. This leads to point number two, which is maybe one of the problems I'm really excited about these days, which is Lagrangian fillings can actually have a plausible conjectural position. A plausible conjectural classification. So, I'm not going to delve into the specifics of this conjecture. I can talk about it some other time if you want me to, or you can read the article. But if you've seen ADE phenomena in life, namely in the classification of simple singularities or Dinkin diagrams or semi-simple Lie algebras, these also potentially will happen in the classification of Lagrangian fillings. Namely, there's going to be three families: A, D, and E. A is the family of two ends. A is the family of 2N torus NOTs, E6 is the Taurus NOT 3.7, E8 is the Taurus NOT35, and the others don't have a name. It's just those families. Those are going to have finitely many Lagrangian fillings. Finitely many. For instance, it says the unknot is going to have one Lagrangian filling, the hopelink is going to have two, and the trefoil is going to have five. And in general, for two enters not, you're going to get a certain cattle number. Now, there's a very important point in this conjecture which says otherwise, as long as your Legendrean is As long as your Lagrangian is given by the closure, the rainbow closure of a positive grade, you expect infinitely many Lagrangian fillings. Well, that's interesting. Can you classify them? Because infinite, you know, what does infinite mean? It means nothing. So can you actually establish a bijection with some canonical set such that you can make sense of that infinite, to kind of work with that infinite? And this is the first time where cluster algebras sort of sneak into the picture, and the conjecture actually states that those infinitely many. Actually, it states that those infinitely many fillings are going to be parametrized using certain cluster structures. So, hopefully, this slice has emphasized for you some differences between smooth and Lagrangian phillings, which they do exist. There's some similarities, but I would say the distinctions are pretty much more powerful than the similarities. Okay, so let's now move on to what I asked me a question. Yes, another question. Yes, cool. Yes, cool. So they're all non-Hamiltonian isotopic, but Lagrangian isotopic? That's correct. That's accurate. So if you remove the hypothesis of exactness, then you are going to get a nice Lagrangian isotopy. Indeed, the conjecture is relying on this idea that any two such feelings can be sort of connected through a sequence of Polterovic surgeries, of Lagrangian dissurgeries. And as you know, a Lagrangian dissurgery, Polterovic surgery. Lagrangian desurgery, polterovic surgery does change the Hamiltonian isotopy type, but it does not change the Lagrangian isotopy type. Does that help, Ko? How much of this conjecture is known? So all the upper bounds are known. So it's known that for type A, D, and E, there's at least these many fillings. It's known that otherwise there's going to be infinitely many fillings. That was proven in the last couple of years by me and some co-authors. And then Gaussian Weng independently. And for the only lower bound that we have, namely the only one that we know that it's going to be exactly that many, is the n-naught. For the n-naught, we know there's one. But for the hoveling, we don't know it's two. For the treffel, we don't know it's five. The hoveling being two, I think it's doable. The treffel being five requires some new idea that I don't know yet. Yeah. So we know there's at least that many. We don't know if those are all. We've done any, we don't know those are all. Any other questions? Okay, so you know, through that motivation, that geometric motivation of studying Lagrangian fillings, we kind of ended up with these cluster algebras that help us conjecturally trying to classify these things, internally help us to distinguish them. We can do that. That's telling us the bound saying that there's at least that many. What is the cluster algebra? What is a cluster? What is a cluster algebra, or what is a cluster variety in our case? So, here I have, you know, in my best possible intention, drawn what an affine variety looks to me. This is what an affine variety looks to me. There's going to be some ends which are not it, and there's some genus and topology inside. What is a cluster variety? A cluster variety is, by definition, any space. So, that's going to be think of an algebraic variety or a scheme or something that you're comfortable with, but within the realm of algebraic geometry. Within the realm of algebraic geometry, such that up to codimension two, it is the union of tori. Again, tori means algebraic tori. So it's any variety such that up to dimension two, you can express it as the union of tori. But that's not just the definition. The definition requires something else. So let me modify it a bit. When you have a smooth manifold, you typically define it as saying it's a bunch of balls, you know, it's a union of balls, and then you It's a union of balls, and then you say something about the transition functions. You say transition functions should be diffeomorphisms. If you have a topological manifold, transition functions are going to be homeomorphisms, whatever category you're working with. Now, what is the deal here? This category, the category of cluster varieties, it's not something where you can just name the transition functions. You're not going to say transition functions belong to da. Rather, in this world, the transition functions are given to you by a formula. Given to you by a formula, and I'm not going to delve into the formula, but the formula goes by the name of a cluster A mutation. And the only input that you need in order to name the formula is a quiver. Also, if you think about it as a skew-symmetric matrix, that's also fine. So you have a variety which is expressed as a union of tori and such that if you have one torus here and one torus over here, the transition functions in here are going to be given by a formula. That has an obvious flaw as a definition. That has an obvious flaw as a definition, namely, the formula is coordinate-dependent. Namely, if you change coordinates in the domain toras or in the target toras, the formula is going to change. So that's a very lousy way to define a category or a set of varieties. So what you do instead is you ask that each such tori comes endowed with a given identification in its spectrum. Namely, what you do is you choose. Spectrum. Namely, what you do is you choose a basis of regular functions in each torus. So, this is a variety that Aptakora mentioned to it's covered by Taurus, and you ask that the data is a basis for each Taurus. And now in that given basis, and that's given and fixed, then the transition functions look like a given formula, these A mutations. Theory of cluster A varieties was initially developed by Faken Goncharov, building on the work of Min and Zelovinsky. Building on the work of Famin and Zelovinsky, and it's very rich and beautiful. I can talk more about it, but I just wanted to give a sort of just a quick intuition behind what that is. It's a space which can be covered by this tori. Transition functions are given by this formula, but what's really important is that you remember that each tori must be endowed with this canonical coordinate system. The tori are known as cluster tori, the coordinate system in each tori are known as cluster variables, and the union, the data of a And the union, the data of a cluster tori with its cluster variables, is often known as a cluster seed. So that's what a cluster variety is. And it's roughly speaking a vast generalization of the notion of a toric variety. So if you thought about toric varieties, they have one torus there. There's here you have many and they're kind of clued together. Okay, so that's the definition. And now we can go towards the main goal. Now, before stating the theory, Now, before stating the theorem, I want to highlight a couple of properties that are useful about having a cluster A structure, namely about being a cluster A variety. So in our case, it's going to be this avatar of the model A of Lagrangian fillings. Why is it useful at all? So here's a list of simple properties that can actually be immediately deduced from having a cluster A variety in many cases or many families of quivers. To begin with, you can compute the singular comma. Compute the singular cohomology of that. That's already not known. So I here emphasize the NOT 819, which is the 3-4 Taurus NOT. So if you had asked a contact topologist, or at least if you had asked me, like, what is the comology of the augmentation variety for the Max TB3, 4 torus knot? I don't know. Furthermore, what is the comology of the model I of sheaves, or again, the augmentation variety for a torus knot Kn? Taurus not Kn. Well, those are spaces whose comology we don't understand, whose singular comology we did not understand. Now that we know they're cluster A varieties, there's a formula for them. And actually, it's a beautiful formula due to Lame and Galashing relating into Qt Catalan numbers. So just straight off the cuff, singular chromology can be computed. And then further things can be done. So this is an affine variety in many cases. So it's going to have a mitch hot structure through the lean filtration. You can compute that. You can compute that. In many cases, it's going to be a Poisson manifold, an holomorphic Poisson manifold. In many cases, it's actually going to be an holomorphic symplectic manifold. You can do FQ counts if you like arithmetic geometry, so on and so forth. So it's a class of varieties which are very well understood. Again, maybe a good analogy is toric varieties can be really understood through the combinatorics of the polytopes. Here, cluster varieties can be understood through the combinatorics of the quiver. And a lot of the geometry, of the algebraic geometry, Of the geometry of the algebraic geometry can be deduced from that. So, to me, just those reasons are pretty good reasons to have a cluster structure, but I mean, cluster structure is actually much more deep in that it tells you about significant embedding problems of Lagrangian skeleton in R4, which I can discuss some other time. Okay, so let me go with a specific example so we keep things down to Earth. Let's take the max TB representative of the trefoil knot. That is a unique Legendre knot that has. Is a unique Legendre node that has max TB in its Legendre isotopy class. And in this case, the modelized space, I will explain later why, but it's just cut out by this hypersurface. So this is a complex two-dimensional affine surface in C3, complex two-dimensional. And so it's a four-manifold. It's an affine surface. It's smooth. And you could ask, where are the tori? And here, I drew them for you. Well, I depicted them. So this is the front for the trefoil. So, this is the front for the trifoil. A Lagrangian filling for the trifoil is going to be this genus one surface. And the first tori that I'm naming for you is: well, take the function z1. This is a variety, right? Z1 is a function in it. Great. Take another function, 1 plus Z1, Z2. Once you've taken Z1 and 1 plus Z1, Z2, ask for the set of points in this variety where these functions don't vanish. Then you're going to get something, I claim. You're going to get something, I claim, that is isomorphic to C star square. And in general, you can play this game and say, well, if you look at the non-vanishing locus of Z3 and 1 plus Z3, Z2, that's also another Taurus. If you do it for the Z1 and Z3, that's also another one. Great. I've named for you Tori. Here you start to see, even for the truffle, where did I get these functions from? You know, what hat are you looking at that you just pull your arm and just pull up functions like? Arm and just pull up functions like that. And how did you know it was five and not like seven? And how do you know you're done? So on and so forth. Well, that's part of the power of that theorem. It's going to tell you exactly how to compute those functions. And furthermore, it's going to do so in an entirely intrinsically symplectic way. So there's going to be a symplectic way in which we name those functions. And then the non-vanishing of those functions, which are going to be the cluster variables for a given Lagrangian filling, are going to give you the tori. But remember, a cluster of variety is not just tori, it's tori. Class of reliance is not just tori, it's sort of endowed with a coordinate system. Okay, so main theorem, and I'm going to skip through this very fast. The main theorem is what I have already been emphasizing, is there's a large class of knots, Legendre, links, Legendre knots, Legendrean links, those coming from a grid-plavid graph, which I'll define momentarily, such that we can prove that the model I variety is indeed a cluster A variety. And in fact, the theorem that's stated here in That's stated here in little font, small font, it's hard to read. That's just explaining to you what is the symplectic intrinsic definition of all these objects. How do you name the quiver? How do you name the filling? How do you name the lattice? How do you name everything purely in terms of symplectic geometry without ever having to mention anything algebraic? You could ask, okay, you've proven this for this class of knots, Legendre knots or Legendrean links, which I will introduce in a second. Can you do it for more generally? In a second, can you do it for more generally? The short answer is yes, once the technology of cluster algebras is available for things like stacks. So, right now, the technology is fine for cluster varieties, but for things like stacks, particular derived stacks, it's not yet there. And so, you know, we can do as much as the algebra allows us to do to this day. Okay, so let me now give you the intuition behind the theorem. This intuition is wrong in the sense that it doesn't work. That it doesn't work, and even if you try to push it very hard, which I've tried for the last two years, it just doesn't work. But it's enough of an intuition that it makes you want to feel that you know you can actually prove the theorem. So this intuition is kind of what I was mentioning to Ko, this idea of Lagrangian surgery. So if you have a Lagrangian knot here, lambda, and you have your Lagrangian filling in here, if you happen to have a cycle inside a Lagrangian filling, which I've denoted here gamma. Denoted here lambda gamma such that it bounds an embedded Lagrangian disk on the complement, you can, through a certain process that Polterovich defined, you can shrink that disk into a point and expand it out again in a way that the smooth isotopy class has not changed, but typically the Hamiltonian class has changed. Again, the Lagrangian isotopy class has not changed either. Now, this brings to the spotlight a problem which is finer than what typically it's been Finer than what typically it's been discussed in the field, namely, you should not, I mean, you should, if you're interested in these kinds of problems, it's not just the information of the Lagrangian feelings that ought to be interesting, but the information of Lagrangian feelings and what I call L-compressible cycles. By that, I mean one cycles on the Lagrangian feelings that bound embedded Lagrangian disk on the complement. And to me, this is fundamental. Like, that's one of my kind of favorite things to think about. My kind of favorite things to think about these days because it also relates to how do you build relative Lagrangian skeleton. So, you think of a skeleton maybe as being the Lagrangian filling. You union those disks. But you know, do the disks exist or not? If they do exist, how do you build them? If they don't exist, how do you prove? How do you provide obstructions for those disks? Again, those are disks in the four ball that are Lagrangian and have boundary, a closed embedded curve inside your Lagrangian film. Curve inside your Lagrangian filling. How many of them can you find? For instance, here's a simple geometric problem. I give you the trifoil and I give you a Lagrangian filling for it. Can you find a basis for its homology, for its first homology group, such that each represented, each generator of the basis has a representative, which is L-compressible? And beautifully, you can do that for the trefoil for the five fillings that we know, but for things like the Chikanov M52 knot, one of the two knots in the Two knots, one of the two knots in the pair, you cannot do it. And our theorem actually provides an obstruction for that. So, you know, it's an interesting game now to understand when you can and when can you not. So sorry, just to be clear, you're saying these are embedded disks, but somehow they're non-trivially framed or something. These are supposed to be minimal genius services, right? So I'm not sure I understand the frame powers. So this is a disk in the four wall, right? Whose boundary is a curve inside of the Lagrangian filling. Inside of the Lagrangian filling. Well, but you can't just pinch them, or you get a smaller genus surface, right? You can't pinch them ambiently. Or am I misunderstanding something? Is this pinching process a symplectic process or a smooth process? Even smoothly, right? You said the Lagrangian was minimal genus. Yeah, so for instance, yeah, here I think this nod is like A6 or something. So yeah, so this must have genus 3 and it must. So, these must have genus three, and it must really have genus three. So, uh, if by pinching you mean separating them like this, yeah, you cannot do that. The pinching process that you can do is bring them to be a point, but you cannot just separate them. But I'm confused about this too. I mean, if you have a disk there that's if the boundary is gamma, it's embedded in the complement. I mean, there has to be some framing issue that prevents you from doing that topological surgery. So then, yeah, I. So then, yeah, I wasn't fully thinking about this framing issue. I mean, there must exist. We can prove that those disks exist, and you can prove that that's the minimal genus. So there must be a framing issue on the Allagrange disk. Yeah, I'll try to think about it. And once I've thought about it clearly, I'll get back at you. But yeah, those, I mean, I assume, as it happens in many differences between simplituding and smooth topology, that the framing issue comes from. Apology: the framing issue comes from the fact that I'm asking that these disks are Lagrangian and that the boundary has a given conormal orientation and so on and so forth. So, I would assume that the framing obstruction does come from the simplest geometry. So, all right, any other questions? Oh, sorry. Are the disk supposed to be Lagrangian or holomorphic? Lagrangian, Lagrangian. Lagrangian, Lagrangian. This is very important. These are Lagrangian. So the L in L compressible stands for Lagrangian. So obviously, well, maybe not obviously, but the theorem of Gromov states that if you had an allomorphic disk, the Lagrangian couldn't be exact. So there's no holomorphic disks being bound by the Lagrangian filling. There's most Lagrangian disks. It's a theorem of Stokes, I think. Sorry, Stokes hyphen. Stokes hyphen somebody else. Meaning, the language needs to be adapted. Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah. Okay. If you apply Stokes, you get that. But yeah, anyway. Stokes. I agree with Paolo. All right. Well, I'm going to move on then. So you care now about finding Lagrangian fillings and finding these disks that you might want to use to complete the Lagrangian filling to skeleton. How do you find these? Discover how do you find this? So, we have somewhat a good set of technology to find Lagrangian fillings, but we do not currently have a good set of technology to find Lagrangian fillings and ill-compressible disks. So, what I've developed last year, a couple of years ago, it's the theory of Lagandrian weaves, which is just a theory of studying Lagrangian fillings through the fronts of their Lagandrian lifts and then developing some diagrammatic calculus from it. All you need to know about that technology is that not only it allows you to find Is that not only it allows you to find Lagrangian fillings and distinguish them in many cases, it also allows you to find these L-compressible cycles. So, cycles in the Lagrangian fillings in which you can perform polterovic surgery. The first time I applied these kind of ideas, so the foundations of this calculus is this article in geometry and topology called Lagrangian Weaves. And these ideas were first applied kind of this guy's way in the article Infinite Lagrangian Fillings, which the recent analys one. The recent annals one. So, um, good news is we have new technology to tackle that problem, and this cluster structure is kind of the first general application of the gender weaves in an abstract sense. So these guys do have cluster structures. Okay, so now I'm going to just review the basic key points. So, number one, we have a Legendre knot. In some way, you end up naming a certain space associated to that Legendre knot. That space, in many cases, not. That space in many cases is not an algebraic variety, it's going to be a stack. So the first thing that we need to do is find lambdas for which this space is actually tractable. For instance, an affine smooth variety, or even just an affine algebraic variety. That would be something where we can really talk about cluster structures without delving into the details of D minus stacks. Now, D minus stacks, which are derived stacks, by the way. Now, what's the key point number one? What's the key point number one? This modelized space that we've named, well, it kind of acts like the space of Lagrangian feelings, as I said. The punchline being given a Lagrangian feeling, you get this open toric chart inside that space. So in that sense, Lagrangian feelings give points inside that space. Number two, if you have one of these L-compressible cycles in the Lagrangian filling, you can perform Polterovitz surgery, get a new filling, and so you obtain a new toric chart. So that kind of hints already at So that kind of hints already at if you can do that, why are you getting a cluster variety in some sense? You have a filling that gives you a C star chart, C star to the something chart. You perform polterovic surgery, if you can, that gives you some other filling and thus some other chart. Obviously, what's still missing, and that's the key point that needs to be resolved, is that you need to be able to name these bases of regular functions on the Lagrangian filling, again, intrinsically in a symplectic way, such that In a symplectic way, such that they change according to Polterovic surgery through clustering mutations. So that's, I would say, at a sort of where are we in this problem? That's the new contribution of the article. It's able to name symplectically those functions and then prove it has all the properties that it does have. So, as I said before, something that we need to be careful about is this space needs to be reasonable. So, not any Legendre link is going to work. For instance, if you take the instance if you take the chekhanov pair so those are two legendary representative max db of the mirror of the five to naught one of them actually has a very nice modelized space m of lambda it actually an affine variety that you can work with the other is an absolute disaster in the sense that it has derived structure and things are tricky um so not not every legendary works it's not even to do with the smooth type that's a legendary issue and uh thus i'm gonna And thus, I'm gonna at least work with a class of links for which we can do cluster structures and thus define everything that I've said. Which one is which? Which one is which? The one? Yeah. With the checkout of notes. The one that admits a binary mass log index, that's the good guy. I can deal with that guy. I cannot deal with that guy. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. So not any Legendre link, but let's start with links that come from this grid lobby. With links that come from this grid-plavid graph. So, let me explain to you what a grid-plavid graph is, which is something we're defining and how it gives rise to very large classes of Lagadian links. So, a grid-plavid graph is a plavy graph, meaning it's a planar bicolor graph. If you see two vertices which are of the same color, for instance, you see this black guy and this black guy, just put a white guy in the middle. So, you know, you can make any such graph plavid by adding vertices. Greek just means the following. It means the vertex. Greek just means the following. It means the vertices are going to be always belonging to the lattice Z2 in R2. And then all the edges that you allow are really the ones that belong to axis and its parallel transports through the affine translation. Namely, you're allowed to do this, you're allowed to do this, these, and then the vertical lines the same. They must be vertical lines with one of the coordinates being an integer number. So this is what we call grid-plotty graphs. Find that some combinatorial Find that some combinatorial definition that we've made, heavily inspired obviously by the work of Posnikov in the study of plovy graphs, that these are more general than Posnikov-Plavy graphs. And how does this have anything to do with your concern of standing-lojunging fillings? So here's the definition. The alternating strand diagram associated to a Plavit graph G is the following immersed curve. It's a curve that you obtain by at every black vertex. By at every black vertex, you draw the three lines like this. At every white vertex, you also draw the three lines like that. You co-orient them according to these. At the black, it's co-iented outwards and the white, it's coordinated inwards. And if you're wondering what happens at a lollipop like this, you just take these little loops around here. So in the plotted graph that I just drew here, you can apply those rules and you get the following. Those rules, and you get the following alternating strand diagram. This alternating strand diagram gives rise to a knot through its Lendian lift because it's an immersed curve with a coordination. In this case, the smooth type of the knot is the mirror of the 7-2, the Lagantian knot. Note that it is not the rainbow closure of a positive prey. And that's a way of getting knots. What are some advantages of those knots? Well, number one, they always have a Lagrangian filling. So great, at least I don't have to be worried. So great. At least I don't have to be worried about is this Lagendra not going to have Lagrangian filling or not. They always have an embedded exact Lagrangian filling. Now, in general, we're going to denote by lambda G these knots associated to plague graphs G. Let me give you a bunch of examples. So if you want to think about this knot as being in R3, you just satellite the S1 fiber. Let me give you a bunch of examples. Any positive braid closure, namely if you have a positive braid and you just take the rainbow closure. You just take the rainbow closure. So, here you would have your positive break beta. Those actually can be obtained in that way. And this is the technology of plaudit fences. Kind of goes back to Rudolph in his series of quasi-positive papers. And what you do is you just take as many lines as strands you want, and then for every crossing, you put a fellow like that. So, that, for instance, would give rise to the 2antaurus link. This greed-plavid graph here would be sigma 1. Here would be sigma one, sigma two. So that's sigma one, sigma two, one, two, one, two, one, two. So that's sigma one, sigma two to the fourth. So that's the T34 torus naught. In general, you can obviously obtain any plavic fans in that way. Namely, the braid delta is going to be those crossings for which black is on top, and the braid beta is going to be those crossings for which white is on the bottom. So in particular, any positive braid closure can be obtained with a great body grant. Closure can be obtained with a grid-potty graph. And notice that those grid-public graphs don't have any lollipops inside. Every face really is a polygon. There's no funny business happening on any face. Now, this does not. Do you allow four valent vertices or not? Well, it depends what you mean by allowing. Like, if you gave me something like that, what I would tell you immediately is do this. You know, like I would say, resolve it to this. So I don't allow it, but if you gave me a forillant vertex, I would just resolve it. Gave me a for Valent vertex, I would just resolve it to a triangle. Yeah. Yeah, and Valentin kind of same way. Now, a second class of knots that I really like are Legendrean twist knots, and Lenny, Lenny Inc., and John Nair and Vera Verteschi did study them quite beautifully. And you can actually get all of the Legendrean twist knots max-TB. You could at least get one representative of the Max TB families, which are not unique. So this is M52, this is M72, this is M. M52, this is M72, this is M92. Notice here that you're finding these lollipops inside, and those allow for sort of more intricate knot theory happening. All of these knots have a binary mass love index, and I think that's already telling you a lot. So in the case of M52, that uniquely determines the max TB representative that we're talking about. Great. So I did for you a combinatorial geometric construction out of the grid plug-in link. You built a knot. That's in our article we're going to. That's in our article. We're going to explain how this is an algorithmic procedure, and you can actually get a front for the knot quite nicely. What are some upshots of that? Well, the upshot number one is that when you have such a knot lambda g, then you have a canonical Lagrangian filling. That's the first thing that I already mentioned. You can algorithmically build a Lagrangian filling. But beyond that, that Lagrangian filling comes from a weave. So you don't know what a weave is. All this is saying. Weavies, all this is saying is that the Lagandrian lift of that Lagrangian filling can be built just out of d4 minus front singularities and A1 cube and A1 square singularities, which it just translates into the fact that we can really easily manipulate those using front diagrams in R3. Now, furthermore, not just does there exist a Lagrangian filling, but there exists a basis of cycles which can be named directly in the front in a canonical way, such Canonical way such that you can name through the combinatorics of the graph which of them are L-compressible and which of them are just bounding in MERS Lagrangian disks. So again, having that not lambda that comes from a Lagrangian filling allows us to name a basis for the first homology of the Lagrangian filling in a way that you can also say if the Plavy graph satisfies this property, which is a combinatorial property that we've invented, then you prove this property can be checked. You prove this property can be checked even only if that cycle actually bounds Dallagrandendiski in which you can perform polterovic surgery. Now, okay, what does this look like in real life? Because these are just words if you have not seen that. This is what a weave looks like. So this is, you know, in this technology of weaves, what this is representing, this is a torus nod, I think 2.7 in a kind of complicated way. And this is a Lagrangian filling for that torus. And this is a Lagrangian filling for that torus node. So that's a genus 3 Lagrangian surface, exact bounding it. And then you want to find cycles in it. How do you find cycles in it? Well, the way you find cycles with this WIF technology, it's something like that, is you start at a trivalent vertex, and then you have some rules that you allow yourself. For instance, you can go through exavalent vertices, come back here, and that's going to give you an absolute embedded cycle in the filling. And in this case, if you obtained with the rules that I just described, namely starter drivella inverted. Described, namely start at the trivellin vertex, travel across any hexagonal finish at the trivellin vertex, then those are going to be such that you can perform polterovic surgery in them. Okay, so that's how these pictures look like. And the whole paper is sort of based on this technology that once you can draw things like that, you can actually compute. Okay, so now I'm gonna are you gonna explain a little bit more what these pictures mean or not? So So, what this means is this is describing for you a front in R3. So, this is how the front would look like if you look at it from above. And at a trivalent vertex, the singularity that you see in the front is D4 minus. So, above each point, there's going to be as many sheets as colors plus one. So, in this case, there's going to be four sheets above these in the front, four disks. And then, whenever you crowd. And then, whenever you cross a blue line, it means sheets one and two cross. Whenever you cross the green line, it means sheets two and three cross. Whenever you cross the red line, it means sheets three and four cross. And now there's a statement about what the front looks like at exavalent vertices and at trivalent vertices. And I think there's some four valent vertices somewhere, like in here. So that's describing a Legendrean front in R3. Enthroned in R3. The claim is this singularity is lift to an embedded Legendre in R5. And furthermore, that's a theorem we prove in the article, this does not have any red chords. So for instance, the Legendre link that you see here is just a braid, which you can read by going around here. So this would be like, say, sigma one, and then you do sigma two, and then sigma two, and sigma one again. You can read the braid word just by going around. Going around, and that's going to be the Logandran link. And then this filling has this Logandran lift, which has no red cords. And thus, when you Lagrangian project, you get an embedded feeling in R4. So again, the key idea was, I don't know how to draw surfaces in R4. I just don't have the brain for Lagrangian surfaces in R4. But because they're exact, I can lift them to Laganian surfaces in R5. And those I can draw because they have a three-dimensional front. So that's what I'm operating with. Does that make sense? With does that make sense? Does it help at all? Did you say yes, Cole? I cannot. Okay, so yeah, so let's move on. You don't just have a way of naming Lagrangian fillings with these diagrams, but you can name absolute homology classes, and you can also name relative homology classes. And those are these kind of diagrams. And those are these kinds of diagrams. Everything will be explained in detail in the manuscript, like in which way you do that. Okay, so in the last six minutes that I have, I just want to convey a couple of ideas about this modelized space that I've been talking about, because it's this D minus stack associated to some Digi category. But can you actually name that space in some down-to-earth way? And the answer is yes. It's not incredibly hard. It requires some technicalities, but a lot of that work was done by STZ. A lot of that work was done by STZ. And between the work of STZ and Guillermuka Shiwara Shapira, you just do a bit more work and you get the following proposition. Namely, you look at a front of a diagram. You look at a front diagram for your Legendre knot. Now, you can try to compute that model I space from the front. That's in general hard, if not impossible, like in a commentarial way. Nevertheless, these links that come from Lambda G, not just Lini Lambda, but Lambda G, they Linea lambda, but lambda g, they have a special kind of front, which is, by the way, not the alternating strand diagram, it's some other front, such that the modelized space can be described as follows. You assign to every point in the complement of the front a vector space such that it has the following property. Once you have given a binary Maslov index, which that front does admit, then the vector space on the bottom is one dimension less than... Is one dimension less than the vector space on top. Both vector spaces are framed. That's a new thing that had not appeared before, but it's really important that they're framed. They have a basis chosen in it, or if you want a volume form. And then every time that you pass an arc which is mass log index zero, then you have an injection from Vk to Vk plus one. If you pass an arc which has mass log index one, then you go down. And then at the crossings, there's some condition about this, which mostly it's saying. This, which mostly it's saying this guy directs some, this guy should span that guy, and their intersection should be this guy at the bottom. And then at the cusp, it's just asking that this composition with this is the identity map. So there's some conditions about the linear maps F and G. They must be injective, surjective, and respective frames. And then at the crossing, you have some acyclicity condition, which translates into some transversality. And finally, I have not written this here, but mark points are necessary if you're dealing with Legendre. Are necessary if you're dealing with Legendre links, and we will explain how that framing changes. Namely, the framing needs to be rescaled if you go through Markpoint. So, what's the punchline of this slide? The punchline of this slide is if you know enough algebraic geometry that you're able to construct modelized spaces which are incidence problems, namely points in lines and then maps between an incidence problem and another, then you can name that modelized space through vector spaces and maps between them. Vector spaces and maps between them. It's kind of like a linear algebra description of it. It's kind of, yeah, it's more of an affine description of it. So let me give you an example and then we'll just move on to the end. So the example here is that of the trefoil. So that's an example where we just have the vector space, which is empty outside. And then here is the vector space C. The Maslow of index here is 0, 0 everywhere. So it's just going to jump by 1. That's why we get C2. The Maslow of index here is 1 and 1. The mass log index here is one and one, that's why you go down by one. And so the moduli space here is merely the incidence problem given by four lines in C2, these four lines in here, and then these map out of C2, which you can take the kernel off. That's what I did here. And then this is just the problem of five lines in C2. Because of the crossings, there are some conditions. So this crossing is telling you that this line and this line must be transverse. And this line must be transverse, must be different. This line and this line must be transverse. So you end up with five lines which are cyclically distinct from each other. And because of the framing, you actually have chosen a vector generating that line. Everything has been done once we fixed a C2 in the middle. So you need to quotient by the gauge group for ambiguities to disappear. So how do you make this down to Earth? You can use the GL2 symmetry or the PGL2 symmetry. 2 symmetry or the PGL2 symmetry to make the first vector be one zero, the second vector be zero one, the third vector will have a one because it's transverse to this fellow in here. And then the second coordinate of the third vector is some variable z1. And the fourth vector is just some variable z4, z3. And then the fifth vector, you can put a one in here. Once you impose the condition that the determinant between two consecutive vectors is one, you're going to obtain this equation that I mentioned. These equations that I mentioned back at the beginning of the talk. So that's a very down-to-earth example. And I can name for you more complicated examples. Oh, before you go to more complicated examples, how did you choose the vector spaces C? Could you do like C to the N instead to start with? You can do that. So what's happening here is I'm not talking about the entire model I of sheaves. I've taken the component in which the micro local rank jumps by one. rank jumps by one. That's because I want to get a billion local systems. So I could have instead do jumps where I jump by n, right? So c n and then c to the 2n, right? But then the natural thing to do would be to take degree rank n local systems into Lagrangian, which is a non-abelian theory, which I don't know how to deal with as of right now. What if the outside vector space that you have as zero right now started with some dimension, but you still jump by one? dimension but you still jump by one is that just like is that just like sort of a stabilization of this and it doesn't really do anything interesting yeah you can just kill that off so that the outside one is zero i mean it will give you like some some fixed data that is not gonna you're not gonna move and then the rest is gonna be the same space so yeah putting zero outside that's that's that's something you can do directly by what you're saying you can just quotient the whole picture by this stock in the outside um so just to name some tora geometrically for you Just to name some tora geometrically for you, the first tora that I had named at the beginning of the talk is just the set of points in this model I where the first vector is not parallel to the third vector and where the first vector is not parallel to the fourth vector. So you see, a great thing about having described this modelized space in terms of vectors and flags is that now you can name functions in it in a very natural way. You can name subsets. You can say, well, I'll take this vector and take the determinant with that vector, or I'll take a ratio of vectors. They're starting. Ratio of vectors, there's starting to be a way to name functions. Of course, not any functions work. And in fact, if you had chosen the set where v1 is not parallel to v3 and v2 is not parallel to v4, you would not get a tori, and that does not work. So there needs to be some geometry, some sympathetic geometry behind telling you what are the conditions that you want for that. So I'm finishing on the time now, so I'm going to wrap it up. I'll just say that in general, for any positive braid, we can name what that space is. We can name what that space is. In fact, for a Taurus naught kn, that's just going to be the complement of the anti-canonical divisor and the Grismanian. You take the representative of the anti-canonical divisor, which is made out of normal crossing divisors with the blukers. And so that's a variety we understand, can put coordinates on. And for M52, you get some incidence problem where it's like some lines and points, and then some points in a line, and then some maps between them. And you can work. Between them, and you can work on that. And some degenerations are allowed. You can allow, for instance, this point to become this point, but some others are not. Again, which degenerations are allowed or not are the same, is the same information as which functions you're allowing or not, which is something again given by symplectic geometry. So I'll just give a summary of what we had up to this point. If you have a grid-plotti graph, you can build a weave. Out of that weave, you build a Lagrangian filling, but you further have this information of But you further have this information of basis in homology, which is given by cycles in which you can perform polterovic surgery if the Y cycle is a tree. Now, you can read everything out of the graph combinatorially. Number two, this moduli space is isomorphic to some incidence problem of some flags. The difference, if you've read the literature on this, is that you must allow CKs to vary as you go along. So it's different incidence problems and maps between them. And that weave. And that weave describes for you this open torrek chart by imposing some incidence conditions, further incidence conditions. That's these further flag transversality conditions here. Finally, what I am not able to cover in this talk, but you can read the slides or you can just ask me. The next theorem that needs to be proven is given the weave, we've covered the fact that we got a Tori chart. Good. That's what we wanted. We wanted Tori charts. Lagrangian feelings gave us a Tori chart. But of course, what needs to happen is that we need... What needs to happen is that we need a basis for each of these storage charts. So, the theorem that I'm left to prove is exactly how do you build the basis out of the Lagrangian filling in a symplectic way. And furthermore, the basis must be such that it satisfies the quiver condition and such that when you perform Lagrangian surgery, it gives you exactly the cluster rate mutation. So, I'm just going to wrap it up here. If you download the slides, which are available on the workshop website, you can see here that The workshop website, you can see here the definition of the cluster A coordinates. The upshot ends up being there exists a cluster A structure, as I have been emphasizing. And it's key that you don't only understand Lagrangian fillings, but also you understand this L-compressible absolute cycles and its relative basis. So thanks a lot. Thanks for listening. And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks. Is there a relation between this stuff and mirror symmetry? The first thing I would ask you is, what is mirror symmetry? But let me say something maybe. Whatever you mean by mirror symmetry, I don't think there is a unique definition. Yeah, well, that's my point. But maybe the question is, does there exist a definition of mirror symmetry such that there is a relation between this and mirror symmetry? Relation between these and mirror symmetry. Yeah, so the short answer would be as follows: Is what I would say ought to be declared is the mirror of a Legendre knot is precisely this modelized space, or if you wish, the augmentation variety. In the sense that the way that you do mirror symmetry from STZ, sorry, from the SYZ picture is that the mirror modelite, the thing that it's algebraic, is parametrizing Lagrangians, right, in your space. In your space, Lagrangians and local systems. So, this is what the augmentation variety is doing. This is what the model IF sheaves is doing. So, I think one ought to think about the A side of mirror symmetry, namely the symplectic side, as the input data is a Legendre knot. That's a relative version, is a Legendre knot. Instead of a one-state manifold, you have a Legendre knot in the boundary S3 of the four-ball. And then there's a natural Lagrangian skeleton, but it's not unique. So, if you take It's not unique. So, if you take any filling and you add a bunch of Lagrangian disks on the complement, you can get what I would call a relative Lagrangian skeleton. That I would say is the geometrization of what in mirror symmetry is usually called an LG model. An L G model is an example of that. So if you have the Weinstein, the relative Weinstein hypersurface on the boundary, and then this Lagrangian filling. What is the mirror of this pair, of this relative Lagrangian skeleton with this Lagrangian on the boundary? The mirror is precisely this modelized. The boundary. The mirror is precisely this modelized space. Now, can this be precise? So, for instance, for Taurus knots, Lauren Williams and Constant Reach have work on explaining how the Grossmannian case works, how you take mirrors. And it looks close enough that what they're doing could be put into that setting. Now, I don't know how to go the other way around. Namely, you give me the Molly space of fillings in the floor-theoretical avatar of the augmentation or the shift-theory. Theoretical avatar of the augmentation or the shift theoretical avatar, how do you take the mirror of that? That's the part that I don't know how to do. So I would say, how do you go from the A side to the B side? And how do you do mirror symmetry? Mainly, you know, Lagrangians here or line bundles there, and there's this symplectomorphism here, gives you these equivalents there. That you can do going from the symplectic geometry to the algebraic geometry. And the part that I don't know is how, if you have the model A of shifts, how if you have the origination variety. How, if you have the organs variety, do you do algebraic geometry there? Namely, try to classify coherent sheaves such that the answer that you get is a symplectic problem. Because the answer that I want is, you know, a Lagrangian knot or a relative Lagrangian skeleton. So I think if we had this other direction back, that could be fruitful because it would kind of tell you things from algebraic geometry rather than the other way around. Does that help at all as an answer? What's the word again? I couldn't hear it. Oh, sorry, I should have been precise. Whenever I said positive braid, it meant you take the braid group, you take the positive monoid, you choose a word in it. So that's some positive. Some positive words, so the word in the generators, the art in generators, sigma one, sigma two, sigma three. And when I talk about it as if it was a not, it just means you take that word, you write it as a braid, and then you close it up without any framing. So you just close it up like that. That would be the smooth definition. And if you wanted to do the Legendran definition, you would take what's called a rainbow closure, which is you take cusps this way and then that way. But again, no framing. There's no minus one framing in that. So when I say a positive. Framing in that. So when I say a positive braid, I mean any Legendre knot, which can be obtained by taking a positive braid word of whatever number of strings and taking the rainbow closure of it, which gives you a front, and that defines for you a Legendre link. Does that answer your question? Yeah, thank you. Your questions, maybe Dave? Yeah, I look at for examples to understand things. I understand how AN is a toric variety, but E8, for instance, is not. Is E8 a symbol? Is E8 a simple example of a cluster variety? So E8 is in the tor is not 3.5? No. I mean, if I take the algebraic singularity E8 in resolve. Are you resolving or smoothing it? I mean, it's kind of the same, but one is an amorphic. Like, are you getting a plumbing of T star S2s or T star S ones? Like, I was thinking of a plumbing, you know, the plumbing diagram on E8.
