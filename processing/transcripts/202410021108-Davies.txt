I'll be talking about some recent joint work with Rudker Campbell, who was a young postdoc at IBS in career. So the topic in Euclidean Ramsey theory, so it's all started off with the Hadron-Nelson problem, which is this famous problem of asking how many colours you need to colour the plane, avoiding any monochromatic unit distances. So for upper bounds, this is very nice, seven colouring. It's hexagonal timing of the plane. And then for lower bounds, for a long time there's only these very simple lower bounds of four, quite these small chromatic units in scars. And maybe the first big breakthrough on this problem was a more measurable chromatic number. So I don't want to say exactly what measurable means, but intuitively it's just you have some set in the plane and you can actually measure how big it is. So if measurable chromatic number is when So measurable chromatic number is when we're looking at measurable colourings. So a colour class is simply measurable sets. So it was proved that actually the measurable chromatic number for plane is at least five. One kind of advantage of going to measurable rather than this regular chromatic number is with measurable sets this kind of lets you throw out a lot of the algebra that you might have to look at and you can really just focus on doing geometry and analysis to previous results. Results. So for a long time, this result kind of provided some evidence that perhaps the regular chromatic number of a measurable chromatic number of unit distance graph or even of all the multiple distance graphs on the plane could be different. But then a few years ago now there's this big breakthrough of actually a construction of a five chromatic unit distance graph, so a regular chromatic number for 0.85. And that's witnessed by this monster unit distance graph where you Monster in a distance graph where you need a computer to check that you can't forecolour it. This one's bigger than the small list. That's now known. The small list is now around 500. Originally, I think it was like 10,000. Okay. So I don't want to look at unit distance graphs. I want to look at multiple distance graphs. So instead of just bidding monoclastic unit graphs, So instead of just forbidding monochromatic unit distances, I want to forbid monochromatic distances from a set of forbidden distances d. So we can just denote this kind of graph by a set R squared D. We're looking at units distance graph, this is where distance would be one. So now we're forbidding multiple distances. And we want to look at the chromatic number of these guys. So here's a very easy upper bound you can do if d is phi, right? Upper bound you can do if D is finite. If you've got D different distances, you can look at the subgraph for each given distance, up to scaling it's a just unit distance, so it's seven colour of all. You can colour for each of these subgraphs, and then with a product colouring you get seven to the D colouring. So if you have a finite collection of forbidden distances, you're bound from a number. This idea you can take a little bit. This idea you can take a little bit further. The seven-colouring for claim doesn't just forbid unit distances. You can actually forbid small interval distances between 1 and 1.1, say. So you can go a bit further and say if your forbidden distances lie in some interval between A, A and B, but these three and zero, Es finite, then you can again get a um parachrometric number. Bound chromatic number. But then, in terms of asking bounded or infinite chromatic number, the interesting case is when the forbidden distances are bounded. And for the sake of the simplicity of considering one of these two cases, let's just look at what happens when observed for billion distances d tends to infinity. You could also ask when you've got stuff going to zero, and you'll get similar answers. But let's just look at when it goes to affinity. So for measurable colourings, this was actually answered a long time ago. For any set for bit of distances, tending to infinity, for measurable chromatic numbers infinite, there's never a finite measurable colouring. And this is actually a theorem with a lot of different proofs, lots of different analytic techniques. Being meshable really gives you a big advantage. It's this first proof you gotta figure. It's the first proof using ergodic theory, other proofs using mesophory, harmonic analysis, aura analysis. There are a lot of different ways to prove this. Okay, but I want to talk about regular kinetic numbers. So we can go down the dimension and see what we already know here. So let's just go down and look at the integers. And already there's a nice room that says that follows. Nice theorem that says that for a lot of these Fibonacci distances, you are going to have infinite chromatic number. So, in particular, there's this classical theorem that if you have a polynomial, integer coefficients, constant coefficient zero, then any finite column of the integers contains a monochromatic pair whose difference or distance is some value of this point label. So this has this weird f of zero equals zero condition. Zero condition. But this is necessary to have something like this. So even for very simple polynomials like 2x plus 1, this becomes false. It's now this is odd distances. Colour all the even integers blue, all the odd integers red, and you get two colouring, avoiding these 2x plus 1 distances. So going back to the plain dismotivated Rosenfeld distance problem, it's asking if this situation becomes different. This situation becomes different when you go up, for instance. So he asked for a chromatic number of the odd distance graph where we're now forbidding odd distances in the plane. And then a couple of years ago, I was able to prove that this has a bad committee on the plane. Okay, so this is kind of just the f of x equals 2x plus 1 case. So the next natural question asking what you could do is Question asking what you could do is, well, can you just completely get rid of the central zero equals zero condition and do any border background? And then the answer is basically yes, you can. This is joint work with Rose McCarty and Mihal Philichuk. So for any polynomial, if you forbid the polynomial values of this McLean instances, you have infinite commenting on that. And we just have some silly condition of taking the positive values. This and of taking the positive values. If your polynomial has only finitely many positive values, then you'll get a colouring. So you could also say that the first coefficient is positive. And one other result we proved that I really like a lot is to have a prime distance going from the plane that's on that chromatic number. So if you're forbidding prime distances, you have infinite chromatic number. And this uses some analytic number theory. It's really more than some. It's really more than some kind of density with all the distances. It's using nice properties of the distributions of price. Okay. So I think those are nice results, but there's still a big gap between what we know and what we know from Easterable. And the natural conjecture you can make when you see this metaphor result is actually, you know, perhaps you can just completely get rid of the metrical conjecture. But now, around 15 years and ago now, there was actually a really good candidate suggested for a counterexample to this. And this is if you have your set of forbidden distances are algebraically independent. So a set of numbers is algebraically independent, just if they're not the solution to any non-trivial polynomial. There's some example of an algebraically independent series, this. So. Is this. So you can have some algebraically independent set of tending to everything. But this is a really good conjecture for a candidate of a counterexample. If you think about medical colourings in terms of letting you throw out the algebra, then really this is involving a lot of algebra. So I don't mean this algebraic independence. Okay. So all that one to talk about is that this conjecture is true. Talk about is that this conjecture is true. If we have an algebraically set of forbidden distances, then we can get a finite colouring of the plane. And of course, by this result, our colouring is necessarily non-measurable. So it's not something I can easily do avoiding. And we can also go further and do this in any dimension. So you clearly in D space, you can find it to be colour, avoiding able to break anything that just exists. But I really want to focus. Yeah. I really want to focus on the two dimensional case because things work out a lot nicer. Okay. So what do we actually prove? So recolouring actually turns out to be very simple. What we really prove is this very unintuitive looking theorem that if we have a set of algebraically independent distances d, we're looking at this d distance from a plane. Deep distance graph from a plane, then we can partition this graph into two subgraphs, both of which are actually unit distance graphs. But this is kind of unintuitive because the way we were doing our colouring before is that we're just splitting this up into unit distance graphs because it contributes to distance. But somehow when we're algebraically independent, we could have many forbidden distances, but we could still split into two unit distance graphs. And once we have this, the colouring is very easy. We're just the union of two unit distance graphs, both as. Of two unit distance graphs, both are seven-colorable. So we get a seven-squared 49 colour. So I want to try and make this look more intuitive than it currently does. So it's convenient to look at our distance graphs in another way as KD graphs. So before we were kind of just looking at different distances you get, but we can also express it. But we can also express this as a kd graph. Our group is going to be r squared, and our generator is going to be unit circle, and then times our distance is d. So somehow our tactic is going to be to particip these generators in a way that's going to give us two unit distance graphs. We can't just do this by splitting d up. We also need to somehow split up a circle. Okay. So something that's more convenient than looking at R squared is that we can just look at the complex numbers. And looking at the unit distance graph and complex numbers are going to be exactly the same in R squared, but complex numbers have a nice algebraic structure. Something that will also be convenient to look at is a nice subset for complex numbers, the algebraic numbers. So again, complex numbers have direct. So again, complex numbers algebraic if it's not a root or a number of polynomial. And we want to look at the algebraic numbers. And actually, for the structure of our multiple distance graphs, our basic building clocks are going to be not as unit distance graphs in the plane, but unit distance graphs on the algebraic point set. So we're going to somehow get some structural description of these guys in terms of unit distance graphs. Of these guys in terms of unit distance graphs, and we add a rate point. So, to be a bit more precise, what we actually prove is this. We're not just the union of two unit distance graphs in the plane, we're the union of two graphs, each of which is some countable Cartesian product of unit distance graph algebraic point z. An uncountable Cartesian box product. Inbox or that contest. Whenever you do complete over two unit distance graphs, you get unit distance graph. Some kind of product structure. Okay. So we finally want to split up the generators of this KD graph. And one Graph. And one kind of generators we want to group together are ones where you can get to the other by multiplying by some unit algebraic number. So we want to look at the algebraic numbers on the unit circle. And then we don't really, for colouring, we don't have to worry about this infinite graph. We can just reduce some finite graph because this is the same for chromatic numbers. And then an observation is every finite subgraph, obviously. Subgraph, multiple distance graph. It's going to be a subgraph of some Kaylee graph of this form. We're dealing with complex numbers. We've got some finite subset for complex numbers. The differences are going to be in our set D. And then our generators are going to be these unit adorate numbers times our generator times our basic generator set. So the difference is all in D. So the difference is all in D and um we never have that one, it's an adder if I'll talk about. Okay, so to get a feel of what subgraphs of this looks like, if we just take one element of x, then we're going to get one of our basic building blocks. One element is going to give us this A graph, a subgraph, and connected components of this are going to be exactly the same as Going to be exactly the same as unit distance raised on the algebraic point. So we could hope that this structure continues. We look at now just two points in the set x. And this looks nice now because this ends up being isomorphic to the box product of two of these units and scales when you are like point set. And this is basically just because there's no counter. There's no antibodies relation between two of these, they're independent, so you're going to get these bots products and you're going to get it. But things are not so nice that this is going to continue forever. If we have three distinct elements in our set X, then we're not necessarily the box product of three of these units as well as an outlet point. And this is essentially going to be because now we can get some kind of dependency. So we can get things. So we can get things like this, which is no longer going to be a voltage by diagnosing this because we've got some dependency between these three different types of algebraic edges. Okay. So here's a nice trick. We want to look at the complex numbers in a different way. What we want to do is look at it as a vector space over. As a vector space over the algebraic numbers. But this is going to be some infinite-dimensional vector space. But somehow this is going to be nice for us. And intuitively, you can kind of see that now one-dimensional subspaces of this vector space, this is going to be like the algebraic numbers. This is somehow going to correspond to our unit distance across the algebraic points. And we can look at our set X as this. And we can look at our set x as just points in this vector space. And a really key observation is if we have some subset y, or set x, that's independent of this vector space, then the Kaylee graph with these y generators is going to be the same as this box product of these y different box product y times, but you can use this as well. Okay. So at this point, a strategy is beginning to present itself. What we need to do is partition our set X into two independent sets. We're going to partition all our generators. Each of these sets X1, X2, is going to give us a spotify using distance cross-imit point set. And then just we're doing a partition, so this is going to be union. Will be reunion of these two calendar both. Okay. So at this point we can kind of get rid of these graphs and we're really just proving that you can get this independent partition of the set of vectors with these set of properties. With these set of properties. So we're getting this from these algebraically independent distances. So actually, our set of vectors in our vector space B are going to be so that their lengths are algebraically independent, possibly with some repetition, but so that none is an algebraic multiple or not. So we want to prove that for such a subset of this vapor space, we can partition it into two independent sets. And what this we want to partition to two independent sets, what this is really begging for is matroid partitioning. So this says that if we have a matroid, say that for any subset of our elements, this is just for partitioning into two sets. If for any subset of our element f, the size of this is at most two times the rank of f, then we can always partition into two independent sets. Partition into two independent spaces. So, if you don't know what a matroid is, you don't have to worry too much in this case because we're representable. Our elements are just going to be vectors in this vector space B. One dependent sets are exactly just independent vectors. And this rank is just going to be the rank of a set of vectors, slightly the largest independent set. So, our aim is going to be to apply matrix like this. And then this is exactly what we're going to prove. That in this matroid, we always get this bound. It actually ends up being a strip. And this will let us apply matroid by dispute and get our two independences. Okay, so I don't want to get into the gritty details of how you proved this, but I do want to share some interest on how you can go about this and why something like this is true. And this is going to start off with a little bit of a tangent, but you can actually get some interest into why this is true from rigidity theory. So in rigidity theory, we look at frameworks that's the same but plane, which are going to be the The plane, which are going to be a graph in the plane, and we care about motions of this graph that fits n length. Our edges are kind of like fixed length rods. So a very simple framework is just some edge this graph. We've got n vertices, say, and this kind of has two n degrees of freedom. Each vertex, we kind of have two degrees of freedom. And as we start introducing edges, we start losing degrees of freedom. When we introduce edges, When we introduce edges, we've now got some kind of algebraic relation between points or verses from here. Which is good because we were talking about algebraic independence before. So we're getting some algebraic relations here. So diffico is not rigid, because somehow you turn here. But now, if we add in some extra eggs, we're again removing a degree of freedom, and now this is rigid. There's still kind of three degrees of freedom because you can translate and rotate it, but that's it. Okay. So rigid frameworks in the plane are well understood. Minimal rigid frameworks are exactly Larman graphs. So a Larman graph is exactly the graph where they have two n minus three eternes and every k vertex subgraph or some way. You don't have to worry too much about this, but the point is, these are well listed. And just to make what I'm going to say next look a bit less weird, you can again relate this to matroids. So there's something called a rigidity matroid, and the surface of this are going to the minimal sub-gruffs, what's up, alarming rub, with some rigid plus in it. Plus an ants. So we're gonna have to look at these Lotmogs plus an ants and okay. So proving this kind of goes in two steps. We're gonna go for contradiction. So first we suppose that the set the size of the set X is at least twice a rank. Then we're going to construct a special kind of framework. And this framework And this framework is going to be a Larman Graph plus an edge. So, again, some rigid guide plus some extra thing. And we want the property of the edge links to be such that somehow all the edges aren't in one algebraic class. So the edge types are going to be within our generators, algebraic multiples of our set X, but we don't want. But we don't want them to all be within one singular element otherwise. It's like looking at unit frameworks. So we want there to be at least two, if not, these algebraic types for these edges of a framework. So the claim is if we have this double rank, we can construct such a framework. But then actually these things don't exist, which will give us our contradiction. Would give us our contradiction. If we have some framework which is minimal, respectively a longer growth plus an edge, then actually somehow these edge-growth dependencies are going to force all the edge types to be of the same adjacent type. So all your edges should be some ad direct one from another. It's contradicting that you can construct such a framework with two adjirect types. So I'll talk very, very briefly about both of these steps. Briefly about both of these steps. This first one of constructing such a framework, well, we've got this set X and this rank command kind of giving us some dependencies. So we'll start off some bases, some rank. We can get our edge types looking like this, say. And somehow, now we have a lot of degrees of freedom in how this embeds. There's not so many out, there's not really any. Beds, there's not really any algebraic relations. But these dependencies we get from these extra elements outside the bases, each one's going to introduce some kind of algebraic relation once we add it into a framework. So we kind of keep building our framework. We don't increase degrees of freedom, and each time we're able to introduce a new algebraic hedge type from eastern dependencies, we'll decrease a degree of freedom. So we're able to add in these edge types. Each one's going to decrease a degree of freedom. And we end up with this widget guy plus the edge. But it's exactly just a decreasing degree of freedom with the sameness shouldn't really exist, but these dependencies allow us to construct this. And now And now, I just want to give one motivating example for why you have these outdirect dependencies. So we can look at the simplest graph, which is the Lama graph plus net. This is just K4. And we can look at some embedding of it in the plane. For convenience, we can put one vertex on zero. And then we look at the other vertex points in the plane. And we have these edge things here. These colours correspond to different algebraic types. Algebraically independent. So, how it's rank independent. And now, our nice trick is we can look at this matrix. This is going to be the product of two rank two matrices. So, just matrix whose entries are lengths of these edges. It's got rank two, and most two, so it's determined zero. And this allows us from a dot determinant to get some polynomial in terms of these edge lengths. And then this is giving us some non-trivial solution to these polynomials. To use product because that's these hit things, which we shouldn't have if they're algebraically independent. But this goes for one example that K4, you can't have that with ad directly independent editings. Okay, but now we know that not every set D increasing to infinity is. Every set D increasing to infinity is going to give infinite chromatic numbers. But of course, we sort of just question of, well, which sets D do guarantee infinite chromatic number. And I'll just mention one case that has been open for a bit, which I like a lot, which is looking at powers of two. So is it true that if you've a bit powers of two as your distances, that you have boundary chromatic wonder? My suspicion would be. My suspicion would be that for any infinite set of intuitions, you have one boundary chromatic number, but this would be a really good case to do by developing techniques. Do we have any questions?  It's just going down.
