Hi, my name is Lenora Kepler. I am also at NCSU, and my advisor is also Dr. Rasmussen. Today, I'm going to talk about how we can use phylodynamics and decision trees to estimate the effects of mutations on viral fitness. So, the idea is that we want to learn this complex fitness function, and specifically we want to be able to input features. we want to be able to input features of a genotype, specifically what mutations are there, and be able to output the fitness of that genotype. So the idea of additive decision trees is that you add together many core estimates from a single decision tree. And then the next trees that you add to that are trying to explain the residual fitness that hasn't been explained. Fitness that hasn't been explained by the trees that come before it. So, we partition the decision trees based on the presence or absence of mutations at certain sites. And then we choose a coefficient to minimize the log likelihood of the phylogeny. Since unlike most machine learning methods, we do not have sort of an observed value. We have to estimate it, and we estimate it by adding the coefficient. Adding the coefficient that minimizes the negative log likelihood of those genotypes evolving under a multi-type birth-death model. So you can see here we have a simple model with four sites. All of the estimates start at zero and we partition it at site zero and site two. So this is a partition of all genotypes with no mutation at site zero and that have a mutation at site two and we estimate some amounts. And we estimate some amount to add to their fitness. And then at this next site, at this next tree, we have the estimate from the prior tree. We figure out an amount to add to that current estimate, penalizing with some shrinkage and some regularization. And then as we move forward with the decision trees, we have estimates for the genotypes that are more and more. Genotypes that are more and more diverging. But the idea is that the estimates become more differentiated over time, but by grouping together and penalizing, we seem to minimize any truly bad estimates. These are simulations of nine sites with two epistatic interactions, and you can see that we are pretty accurately able to estimate fitness even of unseen genotypes, which are those shown in gray. So these are working pretty. So, these are working pretty well. They're able to recover complex fitness functions. They work better than regression alone, even when giving the regression the actual interaction sites. But they don't work as well when the mutations skew really beneficial. And also, we think we're having some issues with not adequately correcting for overfitting with our cross-validation. And the idea is to next incorporate non-genomic traits such as region. Thanks very much. Any quick questions for
