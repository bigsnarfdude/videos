Oh just a poster session. Poster session. Okay. Well thank you. Thank you for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here in Venice, my first time in the mountains are beautiful. Glad to see you all. So today I will talk about IKKT thermodynamics and early inverse cosmology. This is going to be a talk that is going to complement a little bit what Robert said earlier and maybe expand on it. Earlier, and maybe expand on it to another model. See, Robert discussed a lot about the DFSS model and how you can obtain a cosmological, a scalar variant spectrum of cosmological perturbation from it. Here I'm going to try to build something similar, but purely from IKKT, without anything to mix and match between the two. And we'll see how it goes. I should say, though, that this talk was prepared for an afternoon. I had in mind that maybe a few talks were going to be in. Maybe a few talks were gonna be in between. So, there's a lot, there's gonna be a lot of review stuff that Robert has mentioned, but I'll try to skip over it. Maybe it's gonna give you a different perspective what these ideas are, and then we'll dig into newer stuff, which is gonna be the IKQT model more specifically, and how we can get a scale and variance spectrum of cosmological variation from it. So, without further ado, let's begin. I will begin with this beautiful picture of what's going on. Began with this beautiful picture of what's called the semi-background. The idea is that in the early universe, the universe was in a phase of plasma. In this plasma universe, light was not really able to move around. This only like once the temperature decreased enough that recombination happened, the hydrogen atom formed, and then light was able to travel, and we could see stuff in the universe. And at this moment where light became free, you can all Became free, you can look all the way back to it, and you get this very nice picture, which is called CMD, this cosmic microwave background. And what it tells us is that the universe is mostly homogeneous at a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin. And what you can see here are fluctuations, minor fluctuations of the universe at the point where light became free. And of course, we cannot see past this picture here. This picture here in the universe. So, this picture here, if we decompose it and study it, we can learn a great deal about what was happening before the universe before we could actually see stuff. And a way to do this is to decompose this picture, the fluctuation in this picture, by doing an army expansion. Basically, I'm just taking in spherical harmonics, I'm just finding what coefficients are in this picture for the spherical harmonics. For harmonics, and if I define this quantity called the angular power spectrum, I can plot it. And what I obtain is this picture, which you might have seen in Robert's talk. What this picture is telling us is that there are oscillations in the universe which peak at these angular frequencies. Those are very unacoustic oscillations, as Robert has explained, and which are at a certain scale, and then they are suppressed since at Irish. Since at higher scale, like this is shorter than me path of photons, so there are these functions suppressed. And then this tail around here at large scales, which is really interesting, because it comes from super-ubal modes, and those are modes that are frozen in, so they don't oscillate. So in principle, and I should say that this is mostly flat. It doesn't really show in this picture because also this is a fit, first of all, with many parameters as rubber as explained. Many parameters, as Robert has explained, but theoretically, this should be flat here, which means that this power spectrum of cosmological perturbation is scale invariant. And this cannot be explained by usual matter pervision because they're not there. So in principle, this should come from whatever theory was explaining the universe at a moment's creation. So whatever theory explains, well, Well, cosmology beyond what we can see should be able to reproduce this black spectral cosmic variation. And this theory, where we try to compute this, what we compute is not exactly the angular colour spectrum, but what's called the power spectrum here. And here. So in principle, you can compute the angular power spectrum of the class of construction by Spectrum of classical integration by integrating over the power spectrum and some transfer function that involves the penis entropies. On large scales, this can be approximated as a Bessel function. And then if you carry out this integral, you find that the angular power spectrum is proportional to this quantity here, which is called the dimensionless power spectrum, times a quantity one, which involves the. Which involves the bolt of the scanner harmonics. This is why we usually plot this dimensionless angular spectrum, which is what is shown in the previous picture. And an interesting thing about this power spectrum is that it is, on large scale, should be scan variant, as you can see from here. So whatever theory, as I said, that explains here in the universe should add this property. As Robert mentioned, the current As Robert mentioned, the current paradigm, the current theory that is most exciting to explain these fluctuations is called inflation. And the idea being inflation is that, or in this case, for slower inflation, which is based on a one-field model that makes this a phenomenon happen, is that if you have this scalar field coupled to gravity with With a potential that has approximately this form, the most important here is this part here. If this potential satisfied what's called Slohrow conditions, then the equation of state of this field is almost that of a cosmological constant. And what you obtain is an epoch of the universe, while the universe is exponentially inflated. Exponentially inflating. And this epoch occurs while this field is slowly rolling this potential until the slow-roll conditions are violated. And then inflation ends, and there's the thing. And then there's a transition to a radiation-dominated universe that we can see today. So I told you you can compute the parametric spectrum of cosmological perturbation from this, and this is how you do it. You first expand this action that I showed you in the first. This action that I showed you in the last slide to second order. Here I'm going to be working the Kamovin gauge, where the functions in the field are zero, but all fluctuations are encompassed in the metric. And here it would be like the perturbation parameter for scalar perturbations in the metric. And if I quantize this around this inflationary background, I can compute the two-point functions of this quantity and relate it to what's called the power spectrum, which I defined earlier. What's called the power spectrum, which I defined earlier. And it turns out that if I compute the dimensions, power spectrum for inflation, I obtain this quantity. And here it is scale and variant, of course. So inflation can, because here it's scan variant because it isn't 10k. I should mention this. So here that means that inflation can source a scan variant spectrum of cost-most corporation, which is nice. So it provides a seed for. It provides a seed for structure formation in the early universe. And here I should mention that we are interested in here computing the spectrum at the time where modes exit the elbow horizon because inside the elbow horizon these modes oscillate and they're quantum and once they exit the elbow horizon their squeezing becomes classical so they are inflating, can see structure formation. And all the other modes, since this universe is exponentially inflating, all the other modes are like Feeling all the other remotes are like washed away. So, this is a very clean structure mechanism for structure confirmation. Alright, so as Robert told you, information has problem from the point of view of effective field theory, but it has also problem from the point of view of embedding in string theory. If you believe strong enough that string theory should be the theory that explains your universe, then in principle it should also like have inflation as solutions of string theory, describing your universe. Theory described in the early universe. And of course, string theory has many, many, many possible vacuas. So it is a very good question to ask whether or not inflation or theories that emit inflation can be part of these vacuas. And since tens of years, there's this program called the SOPLAN program, which aims to distinguish low-energy effective field theory, which can be Can be part of string theory. Those are called theories part of the landscape from those that are outside of the reach of string theory, which is called the swampland. And there are multiple conjectures that effective field theory must obey to be part of the landscape. One of them is called the distance conjecture. Well, the sitter conjecture. And what this conjecture says is that the potential, the variance of the potential, should be. The variance of the potential should be greater than some other warm constant times the potential. And this comes from looking at various vacuos of string theory in which in the regime where the theory is well controlled, so they're supersymmetric. So when you have a vacuum, you can, for example, look at all of them and you can see that they have this common feature. They have this common feature, which is this one. So, a few years ago, Rafa elevated this principle to the conjecture. And so, any effective field theory that has to be consistent with the string theory must obey this conjecture. The problem, though, is that this potential that I show you here, this flat region here, is in great tension with this Swanton conjecture. The reason is that this parameter here, C, is very small. C is very small, so it's hard to satisfy this condition here. So it is, in principle, very hard to build inflation out of string theory. There's another more recent conjecture which Robert discussed to greatest length, which is the trans-Planck censorship conjecture. The idea is that if inflation lasts more than this quantity here, which we call the TCC time scale, then most which are shorter. Most which are shorter than the planck leg can be inflated and become classical, and this poses a problem from the point of view of effective field theory. And a few years ago, in 2019, Plafa elevated this own conjecture. So this should actually be a condition that effective field theories have to satisfy to be part of string theory. And there's and actually uh there's actually a nice connection to the distance conjecture as well, which is another motivation from this uh for this extension of the function layer chairs. Of some natural shares. I just registered the protest that I think there's lots of reasons to look at things that are not stringent inflation, not inflation, and I think there's lots of reasons to look at this stuff too. But the thing I do object to is the statement that there's a problem with effective deal degree and inflation. I think that's eleven to that. So you shouldn't rely on that as part of your motivation. I think there's lots of other great motivations in school. Yeah, no, I agree with you. I think I would view this more as a tension, like a more This is more as a tension, like more like a proposal of, and of course, like there's a, here it says it's an order one parameter, so of course, like you can, there's some leeway here, and of course, there's been some, at least attempts at constructions of the sitter space in string theory, which are still a subject of a debate. There's many proposed scenarios, it's just that it's a hot topic, and people are trying to redistinguish this by bringing principles, which are sometimes. By bringing principles which are sometimes well or not too well motivated. And this is one of those. I'm just rising to debate because I've had a long history of discussing this with Robert. And it used to be that the point was that there needs to be a problem with type of delivery, but there could be one. Whereas the same position harms that there must be a problem. Because if you mentioned the folks says that there's a problem with type of delivery equation, I don't think it's, there's no evidence that there is a problem. There may be a problem. Eventually they're both fine, but we have. Eventually, they will find that we have a problem. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I do not want to start discussing this because I actually want to get into the matrix theory portion. And I would be very happy to hear what you think about the matrix theory portion. But I think we're at the 15-minute mark. So if you want, we can definitely discuss this. But I feel like this is a hot topic in string theory. And I'm not the only one. I'm not an expert on this. So there's definitely more people that we could discuss this with. But I agree with you that this is more like a statement, which is trying to bring you. A statement which is trying to bring in a discussion, but I mean, there's no like dead on concrete evidence for this. Right. So as Robert mentioned, okay, maybe there's a problem with inflation and string theory. That means that maybe we should look at alternative scenarios. Some of these scenarios, well, Robert touched on bouncing cosmology, which is something that I will not touch on today. There's also these emergent scenarios, which are also possible. Those are scenarios. Also possible. Those are scenarios where the scale factor of the universe starts approximately constant and then it transition to the period in the universe, which is described by a redition done cosmology. And in these scenarios, you can, for example, plot, I get this nice plot for the elbow expansion rate. And you see that in these immersion scenarios, mode can also cross the elbow horizon. And that means that when it will cross the elbow horizon, they can also be. It will cross the album horizon, they can also become squeezed in classical. So, these immeasurance scenarios can also see structure formation. Whether or not it is a scan variant is something that we have to show. It has been shown in string theory, more precisely with string gas cosmology. For example, if you take, if you start in the early universe and you couple a theory of gravity to a string of gas, and you study the thermal fluctuation of the string of gas, you find that thermal fluctuation You find that thermal fluctuations of the strength of gas can source a scanner-variant spectrum of denser and scatter perturbations. Recently, well, last year, or the year before, I don't remember, we took this statement and tried to analyze it in the VFSS matrix model. So we took the FSS matrix model of finite temperature, we coupled it to a theory of gravity, studied the thermal fluctuations, and we found that this kind of scan-ray inspection also occur. And the only one I want to talk about. And the one I want to talk about today is a new approach from the IKKT model, where we also couple the IKKT model at temperature, which is something I'm going to define because this is entirely new. And in this case, we can also find that if the universe emerges coupled to this IP hemo at high temperature, then we can also source a scan rate tensor spectrum of chemical emotions. All right, so let's dive. Alright, so let's dive into the models. The IKKT model is proposed as a non-perturbative description of type IIB string theory. And this model is described by this action you can see here. There is no three parameter, only matrices. Matrices here, by the matrices here, the ones that we're interested in are these AU matrices, which describe some kind of target space in which objects live. Those could be strings D brains, which I'm going to talk about. Strings D-brains, which I'm going to touch on later. And those are and involves also target-space fermions. The idea is that the A0 part, this is constructed with respect to the Minkowski, the flat Minkowski matrix, so I should mention. So the A0 portion of this target space should be related to time, and then the AI should be related to space. That's how you should see it. And then all the objects are described in terms of these matrices. Thirds of these matrices show some embedding, which would be strings or whatever else. You can see that this is a target-space theory because it can be derived exactly from the shield action of the type 2B string. This is in disguise exactly the non-Bogoto action of a type 2B string. Actually, if you were to vary with respect to square root G, and here I actually mentioned that these Poisson brackets also mentioned. They are also dependent on one inverse square root g. If you vary this with respect to square root g, and then you plug this back, the equation of motion back into this action, you obtain back the number koto action, just like when you would take, for example, the polyakov action of the string and then vary it and then plug it back into the action table. Yes. What since it is non-perturbative? You say it's unperturbative in what sense? I will get to it. Get to it. So, yes, I'm going to explain this in the next slides. It has to do with what you can study in this target space, which is more than strings. Okay, if I take this shield action and I replace these Poisson brackets with commutators, so sort of in a quantization matter, I will replace also this integral by a trace. Then I find this exactly this action that I showed you before, plus a constant parameter. Plus, a constant parameter which is non-dynamical, so it is not important in the model. As I mentioned to you, this is a theory of strings, so there should be in principle string solutions, and those can be obtained by varying the shield action, first and foremost. If you, for example, shut down the fermions, then you obtain this equation of motion. And then if this commutator here is proportional to a constant, Proportional to a constant, then you can find D-string solutions. So, for example, here the D-string solution would be described by, for example, this A0 parameter would be described by time, and A1 would be described by some space parameter. So that would describe a long string evolving in time, which is extended in this A1 direction. And there's this analog solution, the Akin-Pikiki model as well, which is this. Model as well, which is described by saying that this A0 matrix is described by a matrix Q and that this A1 matrix is described by matrix B. And those satisfy the computation relation, Eisenberg computation relationship. And this is supposed to be equivalent to the type 2B string because of this relationship that we have here. Of course, those are not the only solutions that you can have. Not the only solutions that you can have. You could extend these solutions, this class of solution, to any type of commutator which is equal to constant. And here this C matrix should be anti-symmetric to respect the anti-symmetricity of this commutator. And whenever I have an anti-symmetric matrix, a fully anti-symmetric matrix, I can always write into a Jordan canonical form, such as this one. So it has this one. And if you write down the string solution from this, you find that it is described by groups of two commuting and two non-commuting variables that satisfy the Eisenberg commutation relationship. And those can be thought of as brain solutions, actually. Those are exactly the brain content of type 2D string theory. So for example, if I am only these two terms, this is the type 3. If I have only these two terms, this is the D1 brain, which is a D string. And then, since D comes in group of two, you can only have odd-numbered brains. So, D1 brain, D3 brains, D5 brains, and D7 brains are in there. You can also compute the interactions between these brains, which I'm not going to cover, but it is also gravitational in nature. So, since this contains more than strings, you could say that this is non-pertivative. And also, you can find other solutions. Can find other solutions which are dynamical. However, those solutions require two advanced affirmations and they cannot be obtained by just varying the action and trying to solve it exactly. Instead, you have to use numerical simulations. And this is something that was done by Nishimo Ra and all, which Robert mentioned earlier. The idea is that if you impose that this A0 metric is A0 metric is diagonal, and you use Monte Carlo to find the other matrices, the spatial matrices, you will find that the spatial matrices are this spin-diagonal structure where values of the matrix are large around the diagonal and they goes to zero away from the diagonal. And the idea is that you can extract time evolution from this. Extract time evolution from this by defining a smaller n by n matrix and dragging it along the diagonal to study the time evolution. And in this case, time can be described as the average of the eigenvalues of this matrix. And then whatever is the content of this small matrix would be like describing the ocean of your system. Describing the evolution of your system. And this is the fish of this. Of course, it is hard to see how the system evolves just from these matrices, so you have to show in some parameters. You should view this as some kind of object expanding or contracting in space. Let's say a box, a distribution of points in the box. I can define what's called this color, the extended space pattern. And this should give you Gives you the size of your box as a function, basically. It's more or less a scale factor, if you will. If you have your box and you want to see it expand, you can define this isotropic parameter and then how it inflates or decreases in size will tell you how your box expands. But that is not all? Yes? So in your previous slide, time equal to 0 would be 1. And time positive? And time positive? Time equal to zero. Well, it depends on the eigenvalues here, yes. So I think in the normal cost of summation, it goes from negative infinity to like zero. So as long as here you have to order your time variables in a chronological order. So you have to choose a matrix in which all these time values are increasing monotonically. So you go from that corner to that corner. Exactly. Exactly, exactly. So, this is a nitroisotropic parameter, but you can also define what's called the momentum inertia tensor, and this gives you the size of the box in different directions as a function of time. And if you plot these parameters after minimizing the Monte Carlo system, you will find that the extent of the space parameter at early times expand, and that only three spatial directions among the nine spatial dimensions in string theory expand. Theory expand. And you should view this as an emergent three-dimensional universe from an initial SO9 state. So this implies that this means that there could be emergent cosmology scenarios in the IPKT model, which is described by this. And actually, you can find what is the time evolution after a merger. And this is done by throwing in a mastermind because in Two in the master because in the numerical submission, the matrices evolve in such a way that after some amount of time, the IKKT model develops some kind of effective master. And if you find the solutions just using the equation of motion and you compute these parameters, you will see that actually the scale factor evolves exactly like almost a radiation dominate cosmology. So in principle, this can transition to a radiation. Transition to a radiation dominant cosmology. Now we should also try to explain if this universe that emerges is consistent with ours. And of course, a test as we've seen before is that we should compute the spectrum of cosmological perpetration by expanding around this and find whether or not it is a scan variant. This is in principle hard to do because this is a numerical approach, right? And we don't have And we don't have full control over this. So, what I'm going to do is take a more stream gas cosmology approach and say, okay, whatever is my background here, expanding background, I will take it as my background cosmology. I will expand around it. I don't have the specific details of the signal pollution, but I will expand around it. And the only thing I would impose is that the equation of motion for the perturbations are the same. Are the same as for a theory of general speed. And this, I mean, this is consistent in the sense that, well, I could use any theory of gravity to get a background, but the condition I will impose is that for this theory of gravity, these equations of motion are satisfied, which means that, for example, if this was at high energy, I'm imposing that at low energy. I recover general relativity when space temperature energy. This is basically what I'm saying when I say that. Please push under satisfying. And as Robert showed in the slides, I can compute the power spectrum of cosmological perturbation from this by computing this quantity, these two-point function of the scatter perturbations. And I could do the same for the tensor perturbations. And if mass And if matter is a terminal state, when I couple it to this theory of gravity, then there's this nice equation that relates the two-point functions to some parameters that only depend on thermal properties of the system. For example, for scalar perturbations, I can relate those two-point functions to the ink capacity of the system. So if I can compute the ink capacity, I can find perturbations. And for tensor perturbations, what I'm interested in is interested in is transverse pressure perturbation. So if I manage to compute the pressure of the system as a function of temperature, I can compute the transfer perturbation. I just take a derivative with respect to the size of my box I am studying my system in, and then I obtain the power spectrum of 10 supervisions. Right, minutes? Okay. So of course, for a DFSS model, this is easy to compute this because I This is because I have an explicit time parameter, so I can just like go to Ethan space and then identify this with my inverse temperature, and then I have a theory of thermal and then I have BFSS find temperature. For IKKT, it is a bit more complicated because I have no explicit time parameter, right? But that's no issue because I have a target space and we know how to build a terminal state in string theory just from a target space. From a target space. And the way you do this is that you take a string propagating in a Euclidean target space. And then what I impose is that I will compactify one in the direction of this target space, and I identify it with time, and say that this compact direction is periodic ought to be inverse temperature of my system. And since this is a supersymmetric theory, it bears fermions, and we know that it's almost a And you know that in a thermal system with fermions, like these fermions have to have anti-variant boundary conditions. So while I impose that, my fermions have antiviral boundary conditions. So once I have that, I can compute the free energy of the system by just doing this thermal expansion for a string propagating around that background. I want this background, and then I can just find the thermal properties from usual thermodynamic equation. The idea in the IKKT model, since this is also a theory of hard time. Since this is also a theory for a target space, is that I will. How much time can I get? I think we can still have two or three minutes here on some results. Okay, okay. I will take two or three minutes. I will go through this very quickly. Okay, so this is a theory of a target space. And I told you that I have to compactify this along a direction to obtain a thermal theory, and I defy it with the inverse temperature. In matrix model, there's a way to In matrix model, there's a way to do this, and this was discovered by Washington Taylor and also studied by Tom Bax later for Susie Breaking patterns. The idea is that I have to define some kind of unitary matrix that generates this translation along the direction I'm interested to compactify. And I will say that, for example, here, my matrix that is in the direction of time will be periodic up to a shift, which is the one over the inverse temperature. And then the other And then the other spatial matrices will remain invariant. This is just saying that those will remain invariant. And then the thing that I'm going to add here, which is not usually done for these compactifications, I'm going to say that the fermions are anti-periodic, which is required for having a model of time temperature. To solve these constraint equations, it's quite easy. I just have to find this translation operator times the phase. Operator times the phase. And then the solutions to this equation will look a little bit like this. And then I'm not going to explain this because I'm running out of time. If I plug this back into the Akhiti equation motion, what I obtain is this rather tricky action, but actually it looks like a mode expansion, which is great. Actually, it is exactly the mode expansion of this action, which if you know a bit about matrix theory, you should recognize. Know a bit about matrix theory, you should recognize this is almost the BFSS model, except that if I do this mode expansion here, the maximum bar frequency instead of being transcribed modes, they're winding modes. And actually, if I use T-duality, I can relate this action to the PFFL action. So, and this is something I should expect because. This is something I should expect because this is a theory of type 2b compactified on a circle. And if I use T duality, I should obtain something that looks like type 2a. So this relationship should be obtained. And the FSS model is a theory of type 2a. It's M-theory compactified on the circle, which is type 2A. So this is consistent. And then to compute the Spitchon-Clause-model cooperation, I do the same thing as in strings. I plug this into, I compute my product string function, which I expand around the Which I expand around the Gaussian terms, and then the first order term like this, the second term order like that, and then I can compute the power spectrum, and I obtain that these are scalar variants. So that is it. Summary of my talk. Inflation is now the only mechanism for large-scale structure formation in the universe. IKKT model is a non-perturbative string theory. If I couple a thermal KKT to ice green gravity, I can recover scamming spectrum cosmological. Thank you. I don't think we might uh go over to next talk for a second and ask I'll see you on this point at all. So let's thank the speaker again.
