And my talk will be about singularity models in geometric variational problems. And let me introduce what this meaning. So in particular, I will introduce three typical examples of geometrical variational problems. The first is mean curvature flow, and basically the it's a surface and whose motion is given by the mean curvature vector. The second one is basically it's The second one is basically its minimal surfaces and here uh is uh uh anisotropic minimal surfaces which is uh has some weight and uh uh this is uh uh critical point of the anisotropic area. And the third one is so-called Alan-Kahan equation and uh the Alan-Kahan equation uh is epsilon square Laplace U epsilon equals this uh W prime uh of U epsilon and uh this W uh is And this W uh is a double well potential as below in the picture. And uh the reason to study the third equation is because it's closely connected to the minimal surface equation. And the minimal surface because it's level set will converge to the minimal surface. And this uh is also a variational problem because its energy is this uh given by this e ipsloon and is uh in some sense it's converged to the area functional. And uh let us see some uh pictures. Let us see some pictures of these three examples. And the first picture is the mean culture flow of the surfaces. The initial shape is a downbell-shaped surface. And under the mean culture flow, it will meet the singularity. And in this picture, it flows through the singularity. And so the second picture is this minimal surface. And you have some wireline and you put it into the soft Put it into the soft uh soap water, and then you will get this soap film. And if the boundary is not smooth, in this case, and the interior will also have some singularity. And the uh picture below is maybe the material is not uh uh uh isotropic, so um the singularity and uh will will be I mean uh not that much s symmetric. So uh the l last picture uh The last picture here is about this level set of Allen-Kahn equation. And when the epsilon is large, and in the first picture, and if it is dark, and it's close to the value 1, and if it is white, and it's close to the value minus 1, and you send epsilon to 0, and you will see that this phase transition will converge to this, this level set converge to To this, its level set converged to the in this picture is converged to the geodisk. And also below the picture is another possibility, which means the level set may be very complicated. And expect this crossing large circles, and it may have other types of singularities, for example. And you may see this triple junction and three segment meeting at one place. Place and so a priority this could be this could happen. And so, what is the meaning of singularity model? And let us go to a very classical PD result, which is Liouville's theorem. And for elliptic, this harmonic functions, if this bounded entire, then it is constant. And the second is if this Asian solution, bounded Asian solution of the Kleet equation, it is also constant. It is also constant. And Asian here means it is defined from negative infinity to some time. Okay? And the reason why one see this entire solution and Asian solution is because when we zoom in and enlarge, one will see this entire solution and Asian solutions. So what is geometric Louis's problems? And the first is for mixture flow is to classify the Asian solution. To classify the ancient solutions of minkature flow. And the second is to classify the entire graphical solutions or the stable solutions of mineral surfaces. And the third one is to classify the entire solutions, maybe early entire stable solutions of the Allen-Cahan equations. So, why do we study these three objects? The first is Object. The first is minimal surface. Maybe we start from minimal surfaces. And it has physical meaning because it's modeling the sub films and also it has many geometrical applications. And it can give the ambient manifold information. For example, the positive mass theorem of Shuan Yao and used the minimal surfaces. And it's also related to the scalar curvature and also the anisotropic version. Also the anisotropic version can be used to study the I mean some more realistic physical modeling problem. And the mingler flow and is a gradient flow of the area functional and it has many similarities with the Ricci flow so it is expected to have geometric and topological applications. And for example let me just single out some examples here. And this shoe flies problem this true flies problem uh which asks if uh you have a topolog you have a smooth uh ball uh smooth uh sphere if it is uh it will bound a smooth uh smooth bow. And also one can ask if you have a three sphere and uh uh if you can find at least uh for example four minimal uh two spheres in three sphere. Uh there's uh min-max uh uh proof but Proof, but one expect to have some mixture flow proof as well. And also, this is a parabolic evolution equation. And one wants to know that well postness of this mixture flow and if one can flow through the singularity. And also the last one is because it's as I said, it's converged to the minimal surfaces and one can use to study the regularity of minimal surfaces and the geodiscs. So what is the surface? So, what is the meaning of singularity? Okay, singularity in geometrical setting means that your curvature, basically the second fundamental form, blow up, and so you will see the geometry is not smooth, roughly speaking. And so how do we study the singularity models? You need to zoom in the singularity. So, how do you zoom in the singularity? It is based on the symmetry of the equation that you will have some rescaling invariance of the symmetry. For example, Of the symmetry. For example, if you see a minimal surface and you multiply by some lambda, you will still see it still satisfies the minimal surface equation. And also this Alan-Kakan equation, and you can also do this scaling. And the mingle flow is a parabolic equation, so you do this parabolic rescaling. And both of these three equations, and they have this monotonicity formula. So one can use the monotonistic formula together with this rescaling symmetry and to obtain to zoom in. Symmetry and to obtain the to zoom in and obtain the singularity model at one point. So the singularity models basically in the elliptic setting it corresponds to the entire or stable solution. And in the parabolic setting and it corresponds to these Asian solutions. However, for the isotropic minimal surfaces and it does not have good symmetry. So it is not known that the min m monodonicity formula. So the blow-up is a bit difficult. A bit difficult. Uh so let me give some classical examples of the singularity models. For mingler flow, if you see that it's uh uh if this uh in the plan okay if you see this curve and the final result will be it will converge to a round point. If you zoom in, you will see a large, you just see a circle. Okay? And uh so for the Allen Kahn equation. And uh so for the Allen Cahan equation and uh uh uh here I'm in the epsilon equals one uh so the in stable entire solutions of Allen Cahan and uh if it is uh defined in R2 and uh it must be 1D and uh if it is in 3D and uh satisfies some energy growth condition it is also uh one-dimensional solution which means one-dimensional means that it only depends on variable x1 and uh this And this behavior is just like this tangent edge function. And so for minimal surfaces, and recently, I mean there's a big progress, okay? And they showed that the stable, complete, connected, oriented, immersed minimal hypersurfaces in up to six dimensional Euclidean space is flat. It's flat. And but in dimension 8 is wrong. And so the in dimension 7 is still open. And so but for an isotropic case and one can only at the moment one know that it's sharp up to dimension I mean dimension 4. This is a minimal graph. So it's an isotropic minimal graph. It's a three-dimensional minimal graph. Okay. So. Uh so let me uh sorry here. So uh uh let me uh give more uh detailed analysis of these uh singularity models and let us first consider the mixture flow. So one will consider the generic singularity which means one can initially perturb the surface and uh to say okay after some time if you one can still meet this type of singularities. And uh so the expectation is that uh uh Expectation is that generical singularities models are the cylinders. And coding mini cozy showed that they are actually the entropy stable solutions, shrinker actually. And also in the dim uh in for the two-dimensional mixture flow and recently and Chodos Choi and Mentality Schultz and Baumer Kleiner with the resolution of multiplic one conjecture and they verified this is true. And so And uh so it's very important uh uh to study the neighborhood uh this gen um I mean what uh one can study the neighborhood behavior of the singularity as well. Yeah, but what is the non-gen uh generic singularity? And non-generic singularity is uh see the picture below, this is the conical singularity and uh it's still similarly shrinking and uh this uh asymptotic conical shrinker has some generals inside. And uh under the flow we have a question that uh if you meet a conical That if you meet a conical singularity and you have two possibilities to flow through the singularities, actually. One is you will expand, one is that you will separate, and which one is better. But in the natural experiment, actually, one can see two possibility depends on the contact angle, the angle of this cone. And so, adapted to this conference, I think, my supervisor proposed that there may My supervisor, he proposed that there may may be some, if you add some white noise or somehow one can probably study which one has the uh larger uh probability. Okay. Uh so what I discussed about this cylinder is uh for fixed points to study the singularity, but uh it's very in order to flow through the singularity or do surgery and it's important to study the neighborhood behavior. So one may not Behavior. So one may not zoom in at a fixed space-time point. One may also zoom in along a sequence of points. So it's natural to study the following concept. It's called Asian asymptotically cylindrical flow. The reason for this object is because these cylinders are entropy stable. And the asymptotic asymptotically cylindrical flow means that if you see back go backward and under Go backward and under the rescaling it close to a shrinking cylinder. And one of the questions is that how to classify such asymptotically cylindrical flows? And as an application, if one can classify this as ancient asymptotically cylindrical flow, one can solve the following open problem, the mean-convex neighborhood conjecture. It means that if I meet a cylindrical singularity at a space-time point, and then Space-time point, and then in a neighborhood of this cylindrical singularity, the mean curvature flow is space-time parabolic neighborhood, and the mean turb flow is mean convex. Okay. So more generally, that uh because I said that uh uh if you do this blow up and uh I mean blow up not at a fixed uh space-time point but along a sequence um Sequence space-time points, one will see the so-called Asian solution. And the Asian solution, as I said, is defined from some negative infinite time to some time, which could be positive infinity. And in particular, in higher dimension, including this mixture flow, if this convex in Euclidean space, it will converge to a round point as well. But if I assume the mean convexity, actually, one will see. Convexity actually, when we'll see the blow-up singularity models, are so-called mean this Asian non-collapsed flows. Asian non-collapsed flows, let me give you an impression of what does that mean. Here are Asian solutions of mingled flow, but it is not non-collapsed. It's collapsed because this first is translating downward and it's a wing and it's restricted into two slabs, into a slab. And the second is a pancake. And the second is a pancake, and when it evolves backward, and you will see it's restricted into two planes. And it's collapsed, although it's convex. But these five examples are different. And they are actually non-collapsed. The first is static, it doesn't move. The second is a sphere, and third is a cylinder. It is self-similar shrinking. So backward, you will swap out the whole space. whole space. And the fourth one is translating both a little upward and it will also sweep out the whole space. Last one is an so-called Asian oval. It looks like an ellipsoid and it will also sweep out the whole space when it evolves backward. And these are examples of Asian non-class solutions. So as I said that so one hope to classify the ancient asymptotic The ancient asymptotically cylindrical flow, actually, by the pioneering works of England Dasklablus, Cesim, Brando, Choi, and Troi Hossoforovich and White, they basically they have known that the asymptotically cylindrical flow into the if the cylinder type is R times this Sn minus one, for example in R3 if it is S1. And in this case, and In this case, the only possibilities are these three models: cylinder, the round translating ball, and this ancient oval. And you see that if you evolve backward and in the middle, you will more and more close to the cylinder. And they used this, and they proved the mean-convex neighborhood conjecture in R3. And in higher dimension, and they studied the asymptotically styling to this type of. to um this type of cylinder and uh one can uh use it to flow through the flow uniquely flow through the um neck uh this next singularity. So but how about in uh in general if you have not only one R factor but more than one R factor, okay uh if you consider this type of asymptotically cylindrical flow close to this type of cylinder then Then there are more examples in, for example, in higher dimension. This is the example by Hoffman Emmanuel Martin White. And this is translating both origin, but it's not rotated symmetric. So each slide looks like two-dimensional ancient oval. And Troy Hasman Verhaskovich, they classified in R4 that it is either this R times to two Either this R times the 2D round ball or the 3D round ball or this one parameter family of oval balls which is controlled by the tip curvature ratio. And so for Asian oval, Asian oval in this picture, but it's actually does not only include this only this picture, but more general examples, have more general examples. Ancient Oval is ancient, non-collapsed, non-self similar. It's not Collapse non-self-similar, it's not a self-shrinking, also not a self-translating compact mixture flow. And in this case, if we assume this rotational product symmetry and we prove that it's actually unique. And so as a coloury, we use it to prove that the classify the rotational product symmetric Asian non-collapsed solutions, they are actually the Sephiroth. They are actually the sphere, the cylinder, one can flip in the coordinates or the unique oval rotational product symmetry with product symmetry. And if we don't assume this uh rotational product symmetry, we can construct more examples. For example, in R four, these examples they have the O two symmetry about the last two coordinates. About the last two coordinates. And so one can reduce the picture in R3. In R3, it looks like an ellipsoid. And in the first two coordinates, one can, its shape is determined by the viscous ratio of the first two coordinates. But these examples, they still enjoy the reflection symmetry in the R2 plane. And so, in general, how to classify the ancient asymptotic gray signal integral flow. The Asian asymptotic cylindrical flow or the Asian non-collapse flows. And so basically, it is divided into four steps. The first step is to prove the uniqueness of the backward limit. And the second step is to analyze asymptotic dynamical behavior when you close to this backward limit, which is the critical point. And the third step is to fix some uh gauge symmetry and uh obtain the the the general parameters The the general parameters and the last step is to upgrade the asymptotics, this dynamic asymptotics to the rigidity or classification. So because let us consider step one, because it's Asian asymptotically styling to flow, so backward and if we do this renormalization, this m bar, this renormalization, one we see that it's actually converged to the one write it as a graph because it's One write it as a graph, because it's uh converged to this cylinder, one can write it as a graph over the cylinder. So, after write it as a graph of some function profile function on the cylinder, this mingler flow after the error term becomes some non-linear height equation, and the linear term is given by this Onstein-Ullenbeek operator. So one first needs to study the asymptotics of this U, profile function U. And we found that actually for the We found that actually for the Asian asymptotic signature flow, the its profile function behaves like a quadratic function after you multiply this tau and you will see that it's actually a quadratic close to some quadratic function. And this quadratic function is governed by this constant matrix Q and its eigenvalue is a symmetric matrix and its eigenvalue either to be zero or is some negative number. If this is some negative number, If this is some necked number, so if this is some necked number, it means it has in this oval, it has this inward quadratic bending. And if eigenvalue is zero, and typical behavior is that it will split off a line, like a cylinder, or it is like the Bosoliton exponential, has this exponential behavior. So when the uh rank of this matrix Q is zero, okay, the if we assume it's H and non-collapsed mixture flow, one can uh show the rigidity that it's either a cylinder or some R factors times the round ball solitone. And uh if this we assume that it's uh four rank, for example in R4. rank for example in R4 and this we assume the rank because it's Q is a 2 by 2 matrix and we assume that the K equals 2 and this we call it as 2 oval and up to this rescaling and this rigid motion that we show it it belongs to either this O two times O two symmetric unique ancient oval or it becomes to the one parameter family of solutions we have constructed in the previous picture. Constructed in the previous picture. And moreover, and after quotient the symmetry, because x1, x2, you can flip it in coordinates. And its moduli space is homeomorphic to a half interval. And in higher dimension, we can show that it's so-called spectral rigid. I will explain it later. And also, the moduli space is parabolic. It's a host of dimensions. Upper bound is k minus. host of dimension upper bound is k minus one. And uh so how do we prove it? Uh and the toy model is this non-linear height equation. And uh so for studying on non-linear height equation one do this Fourier analysis and uh one do this spectral decomposition of this operator L and one see that this uh uh uh quotient weighted space is decomposed into these uh three spaces, the positive mode space and neutral mode space. Space and neutral mode space. And by the Merlar Degg OD lemma, actually the dynamics one can show that actually only the positive mode and neutral mode are dominant. And this eigenfunctions one corresponds to to the space corresponds to the time shift and the y1 y2 corresponds to the space shift. And this y1 times 12 corresponds to the row. The rotation. And the last sum of this y norm square minus four corresponds to the parabolic rescaling symmetry. So how do if we want to do classification, we need to establish some coordinate system and to show its injective and surjective. This coordinates map. So we need to show the injectivity and we need to show the form. Injectivity, and we need to show the following spectral uniqueness. And if, roughly speaking, if M1 and M2 are two, so two ovals in R4, if they are profile functions, I mean at some very negative time, they have the matching the same positive mode and neutral mode, then we can actually show that they are the same. This is what we call a spectral rigid. And the proof is basically based on the energy estimate. basically based on the energy estimates and in different regions and we decompose it into three regions and do different energy estimates in different regions and there is a technical place we need to use some maximum principle to glue the regions together. And so I said that there are five eigenfunctions correspond to the symmetry. There is a last one and which There is a last one, and which corresponds to the I mean geometrically it corresponds to the width ratio of the oval in the first two coordinates plane. And it corresponds to the following coordinates map, spectral coordinates map. And it's the ratio of the projection to the eigenfunctions, to eigen functions, quadratic eigenfunctions. And actually, and this, we show that by the previous theorem, we know that this. By the previous theorem, we know that this map is injective. The spectral uniqueness we know that is injective. And in the next theorem, we actually show that it's surjective. It's based on some intermediate value theorem argument. So together and this map gave the coordinates and to the to the interval and we show that it gives the diffeomorphism. So this is our classification of So this is uh our classification of the ancient solutions uh uh for the two o's. So next uh let me discuss the singularity models in minimal surfaces and uh uh and uh Alan Carter equation. So uh how do we obtain the minimal surfaces? Of course we can first do this Baladu problem and uh to find the area minimizer. But however that if for example if you are in a sphere you you minimize you you will see a Sphere, you minimize, you will see a point, and uh it's it's not any uh realistic surface. So one can do this uh mountain pass argument to find the critical point of area functional. Here uh um let me define this p-value of volume spectrum. And one can do this min-max procedure. Uh for example uh this uh uh if you have some uh quadratic uh uh quadratic form the and you can do this uh uh minimum can do this uh uh min-max method to find eigenfunction of this uh eigen function uh eigen f uh eigenvalues of the matrix symmetric matrix. And similarly this is a non-linear version. And if you have this uh uh if you consider so-called p-swape out and uh here below uh is a picture of one swape out uh uh you have one parameter family of surfaces and so for each uh one swape uh One swap for each piece wave out, and P swap out means that your swap out depends on P parameters. And you consider the maximum volume, the surface with the maximum volume. And then you find the minimum among these surfaces. And then in this way, you will get you will actually get minimal surfaces, some minimal surfaces with multiplicity. With multiplicity. And the value of this value is called the P waves. So one of the questions is that you obtain some minimal surfaces by this way, but what is the regularity actually? So this, as I said, that this p-vase is a sum of integer multiplicity of some stationary verified, which is a weak version of the minimal surfaces. And uh how about the regularity? The uh regularity is actually one of the uh thing is actually one of the uh thing is based on the uh one-stime problem for the uh stable minimal surfaces okay uh and uh also uh another thing is uh uh if you do this blow up uh and you will say uh minimal cone and uh one of the question is that uh okay and for the minimal cone uh stable minimal cone uh away from one the tip point and in the dimension two to six and one can see is actually by the And one can see it's actually by the Simulus result, one can see it's actually uh the hyperplane. But in dimension one, and which means it's a uh in dimension one is different because the triple junction, in dimension one, the triple junction, this singularity model can happen, the triple junction segment can happen. And uh and uh recently about this uh uh when it's co-dimensional one, which is the hypersurface and Which is the hypersurface, and actually, it's answered that this the minimal surface is actually if you are in dimension up to dimension seven and you can get it's actually smooth. But in dimension two, okay, if ambient dimension is two and k equals one, and one can actually study the singularity models. As I, in the first picture, that I In the first picture, that I asked if this triple junction can happen or not. So another thing is that about the asymptotics of this volume spectrum, and actually for the hypersurface case, and it's proved that this volume spectrum has this asymptotic growth. And also for this dimension one, This dimension one in arbitrary dimension and is also verified. But one of the question is that what is the sharp constant? And this is only known for the curves in two-dimensional ambient manifold. And so this constant is square root of pi. And it's answered by studying the Alan-Cahan through the to study regularity via Alan-Cahan equation. Regularity via Alankana equation. So usually how to study the singular regularity. And one of the ways is that passing to the min-max weak limit and when or this Allen-Kahn epsilon limit, when directly studied, the limit is regularity. And this heavily depends on the geometric mirror theory. And another way is that before we take the limit, Another way is that before we take the limit, and this is based on the Alan-Kahn approach, and before we take the limit, we study the curvature estimates of this level set of u epsilon. And so before if we get the a priori information before we take the limit, and then we may have some hope to avoid this Nishen, for example, Nishen's geometric mirror theory, and to obtain the regularity. And to obtain the regularity of the finite Morse index limit verifold. For example, this is done by Otis and Otis Mentalides for their IGES work. So let me go back to this Alan-Kahnhan equation. It's a stable Bonstein problem. And so this is Alan-Kahan equation. And when epsilon equals one, and it's conjectured that And it's conjectured that the stable, smooth, entire solution of Alan-Kahn equation, okay, with double well potential, one can assume the energy growth condition. And the in-dimension n is 1 to 8, okay? And under some suitable coordinates and normalization, and one can one conjecture that it's just the one-dimensional, one-dimensional One-dimensional tangent edge solution. And the progress is that in dimension, when n equals one, two is completely solved without any energy growth condition. When n equals three, and uh Ambroso, Cabre and Dancer they show that it's actually uh under the energy growth condition is uh is proved. And uh more generally and uh one can consider uh the assume not the stability condition but monotone condition. Condition, but monotone condition. And under this condition, it's called the DeGeorge conjecture. And there's a big progress by Savin. And above dimension 8, and it's wrong, given by De Pino and the Jing Chen Wei. And let me introduce my results. So Chodosh Mandalidis in their annals paper actually Paper actually, uh, they proved that uh they obtained the interior regularity of the uh limiting variable while the Allen-Kahn equation. And uh uh in our setting we consider the uh manifold with its boundary case and the limit is actually called the free boundary minimal surfaces. What is free boundary minimal surfaces? Free boundary minimal surfaces uh here means that uh uh you see that this uh in inside of this ball for example and this minimal surfaces And this mineral surface is, it has multiple ends, and each end is also, its boundary is orthogonal to this barrier surface. Or actually, it's allowed to touch, tangentially touch the boundary as well. And in this case, it has multiple ends. Also, it's more index its growth growing along these ends, growth. So, this is called a free boundary minimal surface. So, in my So in my work with Day, Paris, and Taro, and we proved that in three manifolds with boundary and for this Alan Kahn equation with vanishing Neumann condition and double well potential and after passing through subsequence under the bounded energy and uniform bounded energy and the bounded uh uniform bounded Morse index count. Uniform bounded worse index condition. And we can show that it converges to this destroyed union of integer multiplicity of smooth embedded free boundary minimal surfaces, which may tangentially touch the boundary as well. For example, if your boundary is exactly the minimal surface, right? And but we uh generically it's uh it's orthogonal, always orthogonal to the boundary. Always orthogonal to the boundary. So this is the dimension three case. And uh so the proof is basically uh the regularity and uh the uh the the Bonstein problem is closely related actually. So uh we first extended this uh uh Jing Chenwei and uh clay one their curvature estimates to the boundary case and we showed the so-called uh And we showed the so-called curvature estimates if your enhanced, at least for stable solutions, if your enhanced second fundamental form is bounded in a half bowl, then in a smaller half bowl, your mean curvature of the level set has some decay, and this allows us to do the blow-up procedure in the next step. And this depends on this resolution of the two-dimensional stable Bonstein problem. One stand problem. Oh, I think this is sorry, this is three-dimensional. And so then we use the blow-up argument to establish the curvature bound. And then for stable solutions, then we extend to the finite Morse index setting. And uh the next uh is uh we studied the behavior in uh dimension two, okay, for the Allen Kagan equations. Okay, for the Allen-Kahner equations on the two-dimensional surfaces with boundary, here the double-wheel potential is choosing carefully to be this cosine potential. And it's initially given, proved in the interior case by Trudo Schmentalidis' LGS paper. And we actually showed that after passing And uh we actually show that after passing through the uh subsequential limit and uh still under the n bounded energy and Morse index condition, and uh its limit is actually the uh union of billiard trajectories which may tangentially touch to the boundary but not the generically ten uh touch the boundary. But uh so so the proof is actually based on the blow-up argument. And uh when the Morse index is zero, this is still When the Morse index is zero, this is a stable case, and we apply the curvature estimates and the two-dimensional stable Boynstein theorem. And when the Morse index is larger than zero, it's stable in the analysis region. So we can do the this blow-up analysis together to reduce to the either the Morse index is I minus one or one can apply the so the following uh classification by Classification by Yung Liu and Jun Chen Wei for the finite worth index entire solutions of elliptic sign-gordon equation. And the reason uh we choose uh this constant potential is good is exactly because it's elliptic sign-Gordon and one can do this uh complex one of the coordinates and to change it to a wave type of uh this sign-Gordon equation and one can use the integral system method uh and to find these multiple solitone solutions. These multiple solitone solutions and to know the exact behavior of these solutions and then and converting back to the elliptical solutions and to study the level set behavior. And the level set behavior, the blowdown is actually exactly crossing lines. So this triple junction and also this type of for This two is not allowed, okay. So, this is why we will see this billiard trajectory. If you in the half-space case, and there are some light show, for example, in many cities in China, I think, and one can see that it's a union of these billiard trajectories. And also, in the interior case, I think Todo and Mendoletis, and they use And Mendolytis. And they use this regularity because they show that, okay, the P-width is on the surface, on the sphere, is realized by the multiplicity of different larger circles. So estimates of P-width, this sharp constant becomes a combinatoric problem. So this is why the regularity is very important. Yeah. So there are some questions. So based on the Um so based on the okay based on the uh the previous uh topics the first is uh how to do the classification of Asian non-collapsed solutions or Asian asymptotically cylindrical flows in higher dimension without assuming the full rank or vanishing rank in particular. The second is that if we want to extend the regularity and into up to uh above dimension three to seven and we need to study the Allen Kahn stable Allen Kahnhan The Allen Kahn, stable Allen Kahan Bonstein problem. The third thing is I think one can, I mean, there is a non-generic conical type of singularity and I discussed a bit about the maybe there's a stochastic method to give the selection principle flow through the conical singularity. Another is for the Allen-Kanka equation, that we get the limit made tangential to the tangential. tangential to the boundary, but generically not, but maybe if you add some noise and one will converge to the I mean converge to the non-tangential in the non-tangential sense, maybe in probability one. And the other thing is that we have some one can consider the inverse problems of mixture flow minimum surfaces and Allen-Gala equations. For example, we have not the Laplacian spectrum but this volume spectrum. One can ask Volume spectrum, one can ask, and if we know the volume spectrum, maybe we still need some more info geometric data, and how do we recover the metric of the manifolds? Or for minimal surfaces, one can also consider the generalization of this lens rigidity in the higher dimension while the minimal surfaces. Yeah. Thank you very much. I think this is all of my talk. I think this is all of my talk.
