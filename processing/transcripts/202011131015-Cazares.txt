Go ahead. Well, thank you very much. So, I am a research fellow in the SAMI Impact Group at EMBODBI in Cambridge. And I want to start this talk just highlighting that, as you all know, accessory genome is a key component of many bacterial pathogens. However, the mobile elements such as plasmids, which Such as plasmids, which are major contributors to this accessory component, are very complex genetic units and therefore why difficult to assemble. So, that leads to the question of what sequencing technology should we use to identify and characterize these mobile components? Should we go for the long read sequencing that is very expensive or then the cheaper one that is usually Illumina sequencing, so short read sequencing? So, earlier this year, we published a study where we use Published a study where we use both technologies. And so, I just want to highlight the main findings regarding which approach we should use. So, we started studying this collection of clinical isolates from Thailand. And what we first did was selecting the top-resistant isolates, and we sequenced those using Pac-Bio. And this allowed us to reconstruct these massive plasmids of more than 400 kVs, which carry multiple. KBs which carry multiple resistant genes. And we wanted to know what was the presence of those megaplasmids in the hospital population. So for that, then we used Illumina because it was cheaper and we already knew how the megaplasmid looked like. So we could use those as reference. And in that way, we found other megaplasmics in the hospital. And we also compared those megaplasmids to all the plasmids that were complete and they were reported in Ginbank by then. Reported in Yinbank by then. The problem is that we got a very narrow picture about the geographical distribution, which told us that they were mainly constrained to Asia, but we wanted to know whether that picture was real. And so what we did, because we didn't have more information in terms of plasmid, was investigating all the pseudomonal genomes available by then, which are mostly drug assemblies. And by doing that, we were able to recover thousands of megaphones. Able to recover thousands of megaplasmids that were overlooked in different studies and they were just sitting there in Ginbank. So nowadays you can use other algorithms like COPS, also part of the or developed in the EPIC group that allows you to analyze hundreds of thousands of the sequences that are already sitting in databases. And by integrating all this information, we were able to draw a more comprehensive picture of this megaplasmic family, which now wasn't restricted to Asia, but we discovered they were widespread. Discovered they were widespread around the world. They were associated to different bacterial species and also both environmental and clinical isolates. So you really can find them everywhere, but we just didn't know. In terms of the timeframe, we discovered that you could identify the strains carrying these massive plasmids dating back the 1970s. So once you put all that information together, we were able to draw a more comprehensive phylogenetic view. Phylogenetic view to represent the diversity of the plasmids and also allowed us to identify that as few as four phylogenetic markers can be used to study the epidemiology of these plasmids. So in our case, our framework tells us that if you use long-range sequencing, you can reconstruct very complex plasmids, but at the moment that you have that reference that is a high quality, you can use that to combine with short-bit sequence. To combine with short-width sequencing and explore other environments like hospitals or the environment as such. But more importantly, if you are able to link that to all the wealth of information that is already sitting there, you should be able to get very comprehensive views of whatever the mobile element you are studying. Thank you. Thanks very much, Adrian. And any questions for Adrian? For Adrian. So, I would want to ask a very quick question. What was the cost comparison between the two technologies? How would you say if you think of the budget that you ended up spending on the longer, the short reads? Yeah, we can sequence some bacterial genome using Illumina. Bacterial genome using Illumina with around as few as I think six feet pounds. But for using PacBio, you need a couple of hundreds to sequence the same genome. Yeah. So it's quite a bit more expensive still. Okay, perfect. And comparable coverage then? No, you get way more coverage with Illumina. Okay. Three times or four times. So it's the per sample, not the per read. Perfect. Okay. Okay, not the per read. Perfect. Okay, thanks very much.
