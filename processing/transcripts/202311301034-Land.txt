Allowing me to speak about this rather, say, pedestrian uh topic. Um it's not as not as fancy as other things that I also like to do. Um so let me just say what is the general setup of the question I care about for today's talk. Um so imagine you have something like a bundle where the base has dimension 2d and the fiber is something, it might have dimension 2n if the total dimension makes sense. Before specifying what I mean by this, Before specifying what I mean by this, it's an oriented bundle of some sort. And the question I want to raise is: and I mean, this is not my question, this is what people have done for a long time. What is something that I will call S D, maybe this perhaps called pi, S D pi for signature difference, which is the signature of E minus the signature of E times the signature of N. I thought I am recalling. I thought I am recording. Okay. So whenever it makes sense to take a signature of B and of N and of E, you can ask what is the difference. So that's what we want to discuss. Okay, so this has various flavors because you're allowed to sort of freely change parameters on M and B and On M and B, and E is determined by the rest. So there are certain flavors of this kind. And I'll focus first on the flavor of M. So M could be a smooth manifold, or maybe a topological manifold. And pi could be classified by a map from B to B dot plus of m or B homeo plus n. The thing we all auto We all ought to care about because this is called conference on spaces of manifolds. So that's something you can do. Well, but you can also sort of relax the condition. I mean, taking signatures is sort of a flexible thing. You don't need manifolds for that. So M could also be just the V D complex oriented. And then pi would be classified by NAT to B of the automorphisms. The automorphisms. Maybe I'll give this different names so that n is a manifold, x is a V D complex, and this would be classified by a map to V odd plus X. Then the total space of such a vibration is still a V D complex, has a signature, so you can take it. And then you can observe that there is something more you can do. Not only manifolds have signatures, but unimodular forms have signatures. That's the point. This is how we get signatures of manifolds. So in fact, M could be. Manifolds. So in fact, M could be, say, here P, Lambda, a unimodular form, and Pi could be classified by a map to N of the isometry of this form. And of course, I will not write down, but tell you that there's not a way to go from here to here by forgetting that a manopole is V D complex, forgetting that the diffeomorphism or homomorphism, in particular the homology equivalence. And you can pass from here to here by just taking a homology equivalence and looking at its effect on the. Or monopoly equivalence and looking at its effect on the middle-dimensional commodity. And so, I mean, to be precise, I probably have to say something like minus one to the d symmetric or so. So that the total space has a signature. If I look at syntaxic forms over a four-manifold, the thing that is called E doesn't have a signature. It does, it's just zero. Same. Or you can define it to be zero. It's also fine. Okay, so those are flavors you can do. Another flavor you can do that's going to be less relevant for the purpose of this talk, but is maybe more relevant and or fun for thinking about small problems, is that B can be many things, but at the very least it should be a P D complex because I want to extract a signature of B. But it could also be a manifold, and there's going to be a crucial difference between sort of B letting A crucial difference between sort of B letting B only be a P D complex as opposed to B being a manifold, and that has to do with the fact that many of the constructions I'll present today are going to be Borders and invariants in B. And the Bordersmith theory of manifold satisfies transversality, and the Bordism theory of Van Gray complexes does not. This allows you to do some arguments in the transversal case that you're not allowed to do in the Vancouver case. And in fact, you can prove things that are just wrong in the Pongrade case. You can prove things in the manifold world. You can prove things in the manifold world that are wrong in the PDF. So there is a certain flexibility of, you know, what exactly do we care about? And the outcome of the discussion will sort of depend on the exact papers that you put in. Good. Let me address first something that's known or what has been this, I don't know, this is not a new question. So let me tell you something, what is known and then I'll focus on a special case and write down a theorem and prove that theorem. That's the purpose of this talk. That's the purpose of this talk. So, remarks on this. So, the first question is: well, the signature difference, what can it be? The easiest answer you can imagine is just always zero. That's not the case. Not true that S d pi is zero always. And just because this is a conference where I think most of the people are familiar with the Mumford conjecture, it's a fun exercise to take the statement of the Mumford conjecture, say the stable homology. Say the stable homology of mapping class group is polynomial on Kappa classes of whatever you like, and prove from it that there exists a surface bundled over a surface with signature of E non-zero. And now please no one tell me what the signatures are. That's what I'm going to say to the moment. That's for me. It's just an exercise to show that there exists a surface button over a surface with non-trivial signature. But I mean for a surface, I can only set this to be zero, as Oscar pointed. I can only set this to be zero, as Oscar pointed out. And for a surface, I can still only set this to be zero, as Oscar pointed out. So the signature would have to be zero, it's not. Okay, so it's not always zero. And then you can start asking other questions. The first question is, when is it zero? Maybe there are conditions that tell you sometimes it is, that are checkable in practice. And the first result along these lines is a paper of Chelsea Penser, I think. And they prove the thing that's already suggested here. The thing that's already suggested here, namely that if you whatever if you start up, say with a manifold button or a P D vibration, then really you can extract this local system of forms, and the signature of E only depends on this local system of forms. So what they prove is that the signature of E is, let me write it as the signature of E with twist in the middle-dimensional commodity of M. And you're supposed to think of, I mean, you're allowed to think of this expression, and it's also a twist. To think of this expression as also a twisted signature, but whether actual is trivial. But here, the monodromy, I mean, the fact that you have a bundle tells you that there is a representation of pi 1 of b on the isometry group of this middle-dimensional homology, and you have to take this into account. But we can typically ask, do I not have to take it into account? And the stupid way that I don't have to take it into account is this monodrome reaction just is trivial. There's nothing to do. So, in particular, if the map from time 1B, that's each. Pi 1b that's induced by pi to the isometries of this middle-dimensional homology, where it's trivial, then the signature difference is zero. That's something that's nice to know. Here's a slight extension of this result that I find fun. Due to Werner Mayer, San Diego, student of Hilton Boos. So he realized that in case, okay, so let me. Okay, so I'll say this in words. So, this statement is true if you have a base being a PB complex. Statement is correct. The base is a manifold. Meyer proved this in the case of smooth manifolds, but you can prove it also for topological manifolds. So, if B is a manifold, then you can relax this condition and you can say, well, maybe my monodrummy that I have. Oops, MR. And I mean, I'm writing this just in terms of, I mean, if you imagine you start out with a bundle of some sort, but I mean, you could do any form here, right? Then the twisted signature makes sense, and the statement would be the twisted signature, the non-twisted one. So you don't really need this to be trivial. It suffices that it factors through a group such that the rational homology of G is t if you have. If you happen to be allowed to factor this state through a finite class, you're good. So, this is a video result only from end. This is a result, yes. Let me give you an example, perhaps later. Okay, maybe I'll do it in words now. So, one example of such a local system you can get by taking a covering. Yes, then the local system would be, well, the fibers are points. So you get a positive definite form that has this property. That has this property, right? It's a finite group. And then it's essentially the statement that the signature is multiplicative under covering spaces. That's true for manifolds, and it's wrong for PB complexes. That's the sort of first thing that Wall proved about four-dimensional PB complexes. Signatures need not be multiplicative under covering spaces. And you can get a transversality type argument for this result. And you can use these two combinations to prove that transversality case for. Combinations to prove that transversality case for PD complexes. Alrighty. Okay, so that's something you can do, which is sort of an extension of this result. I find this slightly mysterious, but yeah, I mean, okay, you can prove it. So, fine. So, also in this case, the signature difference is fine. Okay, so then next in history is, well, you know, it's not always true, it's sometimes true. Maybe some weakening of the statement is true. Some weakening of the statement is true. So you can ask: is it true modulo some number? Your favorite number, 17. 17 is maybe not a good number, but you can ask it. So first thing you can observe is the signature difference is always zero on problem two, and maybe again, let me say what is it I want to say for PD vibrations. That's one of the embarrassing things. So I prepared this talk last night, and then I realized I actually don't know if this is true for local systems. It's true. Okay. Because the signature is kind of. Okay. Because the signature is congruent not to the Euler characteristics. The Euler characteristic don't don doesn't really make sense. I'm going to write down two statements. Probably the... Let's discuss it. I'm leaving, so you can't discuss it. Discuss it with someone else and I'll let you know. And and feel free to point me to a reference. But okay, surely for T V vibrations it's true because the signatures combined to the other references. So last night I didn't have the emotional strength to go through the argument for the loading system case. Okay, so this is something you know. Then in fact you know more. It's also true for PDF vibrations that the signature is congruent zero modular four. And again, I mean if I don't know the mod two thing I better don't know the mod four thing for a local system, so it's a question you could raise for local systems that I don't think I know. For local systems that I don't know what I know. So let me say historically how this possibly went about. What is it I wanted to say? So in the way it's written, it's proven in this family signature theorem of Oscar's in 22. There is a paper by Hambledon, Kolczyvsky, and Romitsky from 2006, I believe. So in the paper, they do it for PL bundles, PL manifold bundles, but I've Bundles, PL manifold bundles, but I believe that Kolzeniewski writing his thesis gives an argument for PD vibrations. PL bundles. There's maybe PD vibrations. And the base has to be simple. There seems to be some technical condition that's going to also write away. But okay. Matter of fact, is if you have a vibration of PD complexes, then the signature is congruent. And the signature difference is divisible by 4. And then if you see something like, well, it's always true, but 2. Well, it's always true mod 2, it's always true mod 4. You can ask, is it true mod 8? The answer is no. Turns out there is a surface bundle over a surface with signature 4. So you cannot do better than that. But you can ask, well, let's play the game of B under that condition. When is it true about 8? So it's a conjecture of Knauss and Teischner. And I'll just, I don't know, for good summer I'll just add one, I don't know. They make one conjecture, I'll make infinitely many, that sounds fun. Many that sound fun. So, how did I want to rate it? I want to say that for PD vibrations, and possibly more generally, who knows, the signature difference of pi is congruent to zero mod, what is it I want to say? Mod 4 times 2 to the k. If the monodromy, the isometries of whatever you're looking at, you know what I mean. You know what I mean? If maybe I'll try to make this up if I do isometries of H M Z coefficient model, and then I tensor to Z mod 2 to the K. Something, if this is trivial. So the same is of the kind that if you look at this unimodular form, you have the fibers, and you just reduce. You have them the fibers, and you just reduce mod 2, and then the monotrom is 0, then you get an extra 2 factor. Then you get multiplicated mod 8. So if you think of letting k going to infinity, then the statement would be something like you get a trivial action on the two addict fibers, well, but then you also have a trivial action on the integral fibers, so we would. So this is sort of an interpolation between the fact that you have visibility for trivial, yeah, trivial vibration, I mean trivial. Yeah, trivial vibration, I mean, trivial local systems, and the ones where you only have triviality modulos or homes. Okay, so let me just mention briefly. Yeah, please, what do you think at this stage? Yes, so you take your local system of forms, and then you reduce the form or two to the k. You ask the representation to be trivial, and then you get multiplicativity modulo four times two. Could be true, could be not true, who knows? So, something is known. So, let me remark what is wrong. So, Carmen Rowley proved sort of deviation one part of this. So, if the action, let me write it like this, and you all wrong action. So, if you p lambda and then I tensor this over z with z dot 4, then this conjecture would say you get. Then this conjecture would say you get multiplicative T mod 16, and cheap rules you get multiplicative T mod 8. But let me say that this conjecture is correct if the base is a surface and k is equal to 1. Let me write Benson because Let me write Benson because Carmen pointed me to a paper where he does this. And so you'll see an argument later if you want. So this conjecture is true if B is a surface and A is 1. So surely this is not optimal. You can improve upon it. Okay, so there's something small in this direction that you can think about. And so for the rest, You can think about it. And so, for the rest of the talk, I want to consider a special case, because I can, where B is a framed manifold. Okay, so that has many advantages. A, I'm in the setting where the base is a manifold, and B, I'm in the setting where it's framed, and so this term doesn't appear, and really I'm asking about the visibility for signatures of total stasis of whatever sort of vibrations over framed manifolds. Sort of a toy case of the situation you can consider. But this toy case I'll explain to you, it just happens to be on the particular. Explain to you, it just happens to be on a particularly simple form as to do just explicit computations. That's all. I'll do that. But I think it's more of a proof of concept thing. In principle, you can apply this idea and try to calculate more general results. This is just the easy one that I did after a nice weekend over Wolfach on the train back. So I realized, can we just calculate everything? And in this case, you just can't. Okay, so how could you try to approach this? So let's say these, from now on these frameworks. Let's say V is from now on V is framed to D dimensional. So, how can you approach this? Let me do something that people have done earlier. You can realize that, well, you know, the signature of E is also a Boredism invariant. And so really, if I have a map from B to B diff plus of n that classifies some bundle of which I want to calculate the signature, I can view this element as an element of 2D dimensional frame borders of. Dimensional frame, ballism of p this plus. And the signature of E is going to be an invariant on this group. So I'm going to write down a Z somewhere and I'm going to tell you how to extract the signature of E by means of some composites of this. Okay, so what is it that you can do? Well, you can realize that the B diff plus, I mean, this the collection of the B diff pluses of M, they group complete to empty SO2. So To MTSO2. So some of our three, you get a map to loops infinity, I don't know, maybe zero of MTSO2. Okay, so now this is Lup's infinity of some spectrum. You do frank borders of it, that always has a thermometer surjection of pi to B of M T S O 2 to N. Yes? And that has some sort of iterated botgenauer type sequences to pi D. type sequences to pi d 2 d plus 2n of MSO. Oh, and then we all know to take the signature. So this upper composite takes this vibration and it classifies the borders and classifies. That's what it does. And now we sort of I told you that this construction depends I mean the signature only depends on the sort of the unimodinal form you have on the middle dimensional homology, which I always call Pedanda because chromology is to one. Is called P lambda because quantities to one. So I can do a similar thing below and take these two isometries of P lambda. And then I just do the same thing throughout. Instead of letting manifolds group complete to MTS or 2n, I let forms group complete to row and the grid theory. So I get a map to three-dimensional framed rho and the grid. And now I can let me do epsilon symmetric, and epsilon is always going to be minus one to the b of z. Of Z. Yes? And then by the same argument as here, I get a map to pi to D of epsilon symmetrical equal theory of Z. And then these geometric in our sequences algebraically have an analog that sort of as you build MSO from MTSO to N, you build L theory from global liquid theory. So the analog of this is having a nut to pi 2d of L epsilon symmetric of Z, and that also has a signature homomorphism. And that also has a signature homomorphism. They do the same thing. And somehow, well, you have all these maps, they group complete to something, and you argue a bit that the map on group completion has to be a spectral map. So you also get this. You get commutative diagrams of the sort. I mean, this hasn't been worked out, but it's only sort of for telling to you what an approach to this problem is. And so really what you want to be studying is this lower composite. Because the form only depends on, I mean the signature depends only on the strength borders and class of your Depends on the strength borders and class of your local system, and then you might as well do it. Okay, so one comment I should make is that these maps are always objective. This is some formal blah blah in homotopy theory. And these are group confusion things. So any class here, and this is a homology theory, so any class is realized by something. So in some sense, if you want to understand what are the signatures, like globally valid formulas for divisibility results for signatures, what you have to do is calculate this homomorphism. What you have to do is calculate this homomorphism. Just have to calculate what is this lab. And the image of this lab consists exactly of the signatures that you arise, that you obtain from taking local systems of unimodular forms over frames to DMAP. Okay, let me historically... Well, let me write down this. What is it I want to do? Yes, I want to write down a theorem and then put it into perspective and then prove it. The term is going to say what is the image of this homomorphism, and putting it into perspective is going to say, how does it relate to the image of this homomorphism? Which may be, I mean, at least in hindsight now that we have this calculation, the one that you don't have is the more interesting one. And I'm sure that our homotopy theory transcript probably also of the other thing I don't know. But in any case, so far, I don't know the image of this map, but I know the image of this map. Okay, so let me tell you what the image of this map is and then say something about this sort of more geometric case where you start out with manifolds. I mean, the same argument is true here, is what I wanted to say, right? This map is subjective, and this is also an open region. So any element here is somehow realized by some one global framed manifold. The nice thing you can do. The nice thing you can do here, I maybe say this elements in here are represented somehow by Bordersen classes of manifolds, whose tangent bundle comes with a 2D dimensional trivialization. You have a 2D dimensional trivial sub-bundle, which is obvious in the case of a frame manifold bundle, right? The tangent bundle of here sort of is contributed by the pullback of the tangent bundle of B, but that's trivial, so you get some trivialization of a certain rank of your bundle. So then you can imagine this is about studying. So, then you can imagine this is about studying sort of signature-type formulas under the restriction that certain Pantriang classes are zero. And you have to evaluate congruences of that kind. Okay, wonderful. So what is the theorem? Let me phrase it in the way where we don't care about zero-dimensional manifolds. Just makes the form if I write down the formula for d eaten and odd, then it's incorrect for d equals to zero. Then it's incorrect for d equals c0. So let me say in words on pi zero the slap is so changing. Let's do the d greater than zero case. And then so the image of a growing d grid 2d epsilon symmetric z to L2D epsilon symmetric of Z, which we identify with Z via the signature, is. Is what is it? It's 2 to the d plus 1z or 2 to the d plus 2z, depending on the parity of t. So this is true of t is 0 or 3 mod 4. This is true of t is 1 of 2. Okay, this is what it is. So maybe at first glance it seems, I don't know, possibly surprising to you that only powers of 2 appear. And so that's the first comment I want to make. So, comments. So, comments. So, A, as I said before, these numbers are realized as signatures of vocal systems and forms, systems or forms by this homological group completion arbitrage. Okay, so I mean, these are not only globally valid. Only globally valid lower bounds for the divisibility for signatures, but in the case of local systems, these are just exactly the things that you get. Do you have any means of making that explicit? Well, that's difficult. What I can tell you is that these groups, isometries of D lambda are arithmetic groups. So that means they have bounded above virtual rational cosmological dimension, which will tell you that from d large enough and any fixed something here, the map is zero. So this will just tell you that. zero. So this will just tell you that if you want to realize a very high number on a given fact D, maybe you, I don't know, you have to take the appropriate P, and it might by homological stability tell you that you have to take a big hyperbolic summon. And then you can do it by homological stability. I mean, provided use the works of the orthogonal case. But I think you can give sort of bounds on how large these isometry groups must be so that you can realize the number. So that you can realize the number. But lower numbers. Yes. I don't exactly know, yes. I know, sorry. I don't think I. But I mean, yes, what I can tell you is that somehow if you stick in a very small group and a very large D, you will not get something. This is the only thing I'm saying. By virtue of these finite rational homological dimensions of the individual groups. Okay. So then, maybe the most interesting part of my talk today, I thought when I prepared it yesterday. I thought when I prepared it yesterday, is the question about what's up with the signature homomorphism for MTSO2N? What about pi to D MTSO to N, which is by the signature? So, I mean, is anything structurally similar true? I mean, does the image have such a simple form? Maybe only vectors of two appearing, and the answer is no. The co-kernel of this map has all primary torsion. All primary torsion in principle. So let me tell you one thing that is correct. So this map is: oh, let me change this to 4k minus 2 and this to 2. Possibly an easy case. Then this map is p-iadically surjective if and only if the 2kth canoey number, and no, I mean, you know, I don't know, 2k8, who knows? At some point, I convince myself it's 2k for some. At some point, I convince myself it's 2k for some construct of what 2k is. Take it with a grain of salt. But you can take the numerator of theta 2k, and this has to be a p-adic dimension. So use some CP torsion in the co-kernel once the numerator of the new number 2k is divisible by p. This pairs of p's and k's are. Pairs of P's and K's such that this is not the case, have a name. So P2K, such that the numerator of B2K is not a periodic unit, have a name. These are called irregular friends, irregular pairs. Okay, this is something that people in number theory studied, so you can just look it up and you'll find a lot of irregular pairs. In particular, this is. So, in particular, this is sort of theoretically non-soetherective. Or you find p-torsion in the coke kernel whenever you fix the k such that power 2k is something. And in my notes, in my actual notes, I wrote down an example, but I don't have it with me now. So we can all Wikipedia and see what the first regular find is. It's something with 691, I think. 37. 37. Ah. Okay. And then, yes, you can. Okay, in any case, you can check these things out. So, in that sense, this becomes much more interesting from a number theoretic point of view. What we do here is sort of very confusing, apparently. Okay. Any questions about these things so far? Is it the same as not being divisible by T? Yes. Or being divisible by B. You figure that out. It has to do with the question whether or not the numerators. It has to do with the question whether or not the numerator is divisible by P in the correct yes or no thing. Okay, so it's not a p-adic unit if it's divisible by p. Yes, very good. Okay. Yes. Then I should also say, but I'll only do this in words, somehow from the perspective of bundles, it's sort of special to do things that are even-dimensional. To do things that are even-dimensional. And that has to do with the fact that somehow even-dimensional manifolds group compete to MTSO2. So in the odd-dimensional case, famously, people are trying to understand this better. But this part of the picture makes perfect sense. You can ask about homotopy of MTSO2n minus 1 also, and then you just do 2d plus 1, and you get a signature homomorphism. And there is an analog of these situations in growth-labeled theory. Of these situations in growth-labeled theory, and you can also write out the theorem that does the job here. And okay, so that's something you can do. There's sort of odd-dimensional analogs of these results. What more can I say? Yes. Another fun fact is that for smooth manifold bundles, okay, let me say a couple of names. So Atia, So, Atia, a different Meyer, Karl Heinz Meyer, different from the one that we had before, and now it's written up in Lawson Michelson's book on spin geometry. You can find the exact numbers that I wrote down appearing as divisibility. So they show the signature of E is congruent to zero or not what I say. And the argument is index theoretic in nature. And the argument is index theoretic in nature. So the idea is to say, well, if I have an element here, I told you it's represented by a smooth manifold with a tribalization of the 2D-dimensional sub-bundle. Then you take the signature operator on your manifold. Its index calculates the signature. You observe that you can make it Clifford linear for the Clifford 2D algebra. And then you calculate the representations here of the Clifford algebras and look at what are the dimensions of the decomposable Clifford modules. And these numbers come out. And these numbers come out. But somehow, I mean, that's a nice way of doing it. But you don't have to statement. Somehow, you can forget about index theory and just do it on the level of Gromondequid and you'll find exactly sort of these numbers appearing. And it's slightly mysterious to me. I mean, I don't really understand why the numbers that I get, I mean, how they relate to the sort of dimensions of the irreducible Clifford modules. Apparently, they're the same. Apparently, they're the same, but I don't have a. They're the same, but I don't have a reason for it. You calculate both and see they're the same, and I don't have a better reason for it. It would be sort of fun to understand this better, but I don't. I've managed to confuse myself. Shouldn't epsilon be minus one to be n? That's the same. Is it the same? Say uh uh uh thing just says. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Oscar. Okay, good. Finally, what I want to say also, maybe only in words, is that there's games you can play by saying, well, what if I put extra conditions on these forms? Partly, I'm just saying symmetric forms. Forms. Partly, I'm just saying symmetric forms, whatever you're anti-symmetric forms, then you have a signature. But it's sort of well known that if you have a quadratic form, for instance, over the integers, then you automatically know the signature is divisible by eight. So you can ask questions of the kind, what if I replace, or I have some strengthening of this result, I look at local systems of forms, but the form is a quadratic form, they're not a symmetric form. How much divisibility does this gain on top? And the answer is if d Is 1, no, if D is 0, that's what I just said, then taking quadratic form as opposed to a symmetric form, you get a factor of 8. If D is 1, the statement is you'll get, okay, let's check, if D is 1, I tell you that what, the signature is divisible by 8. And the statement is that if you upgrade yourself to a quadratic form, you get an extra factor of 2. And if d is greater than 1, then you don't. Is greater than one, then you don't get extra factors at all. You can improve on your quadratic forms or on the structure of your local system as far as you want, you will never get anything better. Just it's very exclusive to dimension zero and dimension two that you can improve signatures by and I mean roughly speaking I think the statement is just that the signatures just grow in the dimension of D so quickly that I mean you don't gain anything from that. That, I mean, you don't gain anything from having it put out for on the fibers. But that's sort of a curious fact. It has to do with this thing that, I don't know, from the experts of view, there's this variant of Roton de Gwid epsilon genuine symmetric. The statement is they're the same in these ranges of degrees. So you can replace it by epsilon-genuine quadratic. And the statement is the difference between these two spectrals on homotopy sort of in a range less than or equal to three. That's sort of a miracle that. Sort of a miracle that this is true, but it is. And so, this an interpretation of this result of the hashtag lines of us is that you don't get further divisibilities for signatures of local systems of quadratic forms once the dimension exceeds two. But that goes away when you allow yourself to look at derived local systems. I have a graphic form, say again? You allow yourself allow that to have an actual quadratic form, not a genuine one? Well, I mean, as long as everything over Z, then I'm just saying something about some maps being isomorphisms. Yeah, but in quadratic cognitive versus symmetric cognitive is not what you're doing. Ah, now I know what you mean with the right cognitive. Yes. I should think about that. I haven't. So you can put stuff on the manifold to make this better. Possibly. Okay, what I'm saying is that you can also. Okay, what I'm saying is that you can always calculate it, and I haven't done the calculation. I wouldn't be surprised if the statement is you don't get anything. Or maybe you do. I mean, you probably always get a factor of eight or something. In any case, yes. The statement is this is all sort of purely internal to this formalism of Bloom-Liquid theory, and you just do all the calculations you want. I think, like, for Z and on homotopy, you just do all the calculations you want. You just know everything. Okay, so these are variants of questions you can raise, and I want to spend just the remaining twenty minutes of To spend just the remaining 20 minutes of, I actually plan to give a 50-minute talk. So I want to spend the remaining time to explain to you how to prove this. Any questions? Sorry. How is this? So the composite of this map gives you the signature of the total space of T. Yes. Yes. And the product of the two signatures is zero because D is framed. V is framed. And hence V has signature zero. And that's one of the things that. Yeah, and in principle, if V is not framed, you just don't take framed Borders in here. You take whatever Borders theory you want. But then you have to calculate something to the effect of not this map on homotopy, but on Bordersen. And then sort of multiplying to L theory and then evaluate on homotopy, and that's just more complicated. And so actually in person, so I do the easy thing. Leave the more complicated thing to someone else. It's the more complicated thing to someone else. Or to the future. I don't know. But in principle, you can do the same type of argument. But this is particularly simple because you have to evaluate things on homotopy, and we understand homotopy very well. Okay. Any further questions at this point? Yes, no. Okay, fair enough. Okay, so how do you prove something like this? Well maybe so step one is to observe that it was no surprise that only factors of two appear, and that's due to the following results. So there exists a fiber sequence, you do k of z, h z to orbits. K of C, H C two orbits, this. And you should grow in the grid. Epsilon symmetry. So the epsilon C gritly plays in the C2 action, and so these are different terms depending on epsilon, but there was a and then there is L epsilon. Okay. And I'd like to understand this map on homotopy and evaluate what's going on. This formula tells me that if, you know, localize that. Localized at odd primes, I don't see any factors coming up, so localized at an odd prime, it must be surjective, and this is for the reason that it's in fact, this is a fiber sequence. And if I invert two, it splits surjective. I mean, it splits, and so in particular, it splits surjective, and the split is very easy. You have a form, somehow you can take the underlying module, recall that it has a C2 action, so you get a map to C2 fixed points, and then I'm allowed to invert two on the inside. Invert 2 on the inside, like a map. And this composite is an isomorphism. So that splits the sequence, and away from 2, the map is rejected on homotopy. So really, I don't ever have to think about odd finds appearing in this business. So we work too locally from now on. Too locally, or two complete. Not such a big of a difference, sort of these are also finite type. Too local, too complete, is sort of the same thing. Close enough to each other. So the point is that you exploit the following basic observation that the signature is really an invariant of a form over the reals. Because what is the signature of a form? It's well, tensor it over the reals and then take the signature in the sense of the Sylvester decomposition. So really what I want to evaluate is something like Something like the map to L epsilon s of Z on homotopy in a range of degrees where this map to the reals happens to be a homotopy isomorphism. So I want to do this in degrees. I don't know. Whatever you just have to make this unsymmetric R. And this map is an iso on homotopy on pi star in the cases we care about. About okay, so this guy has homotopy exactly form periodic with Z's detected by the signature, and this has Z mod 2s in every degree 1 mod 4 or 3 mod 4 depending on the epsilon that come in addition and are the so-called the RAN invariants. And in principle, you can run similar games and try to calculate the RAN invariants of such things, and I haven't done it, but should. But for signatures, I can sort of pass to the reals. And then just by sort of naturality, I can pass through what the good of all. I can pass through what we good of R. And then by some miracle, it's a clever thing to observe that if we work too complete, then I'm allowed to replace Gropen Dequid by a topological version of Gropen Dequid over R. I can just say, I mean, this is something like a group completion of unimodular forms of the reals, and I can just recall that these isolatory groups canonically have a topology, and I take that into account. And I group complete in that work. Then I get something that's easier. And the magic is that in L theory I don't have to The magic is that in L-theory I don't have to topologize somehow. L-theory is already topological. Heck? Yes, please. Is it clear that on the C's corresponding signature, the map is not multiplication by some number, which is not all. This one. Yes, because the signature is defined as take the reals, take the signature, and it's a calculation that the. Isn't the signature divisible in L of set by 8? No, because we're working symmetric, it's not. Oh, okay. Sorry. Yes. This map is an isomorphism. This map is an isomorphism on Hamburg period by the way you calculate the symmetric L groups of Z. But else, if it is a multiplication by 8, that's exactly this case, maybe in dimension 2 for symplectic forms, you exploit the set. And then you get your factor of it diminishes. Okay, wonderful. Okay, so you do this, and now that more or less separates variables and tells you you have to understand this map on the bottom ones that are all and you have to understand this. Once and for all, and you have to understand this map on the once and for all. And I do that in slightly different perspectives, but the first one is sort of the more complicated one. But let me tell you that the observation that this map factors through here could have been used millions of years ago to prove divisibility results. Just, I mean, you get lower bounds for what these things are, maybe not the exact lower bounds because you don't know what this map does. Don't know what this map was. But in principle, you could have gotten the visibility results, and I don't quite know why this hasn't been done. But to the best of my knowledge, this hasn't been observed. But I mean, there's nothing new interest here. This calculation is sort of, I mean, you can almost look it up in a book. I mean, you can look it up in a book, but then I was too stupid to extract the, they tell you what a nebulian group comes out. You have to calculate the number of elements in it. That was just too stupid to do it. So instead, I rather calculated it myself. But in principle, the calculation. But in principle, the case of the reals, I mean, really nothing new enters. And for understanding exactly what values you get, which I find sort of nice that we can do it, you have to analyze this map. And that's sort of a consequence of this work of the nine of issues, which will also be exploited in further work with Thomas Nikolaus and Sabin Niebuhrschlein to calculate something about the homology of these isometry groups. About the comology of these isometry groups of phones that appear is the fact that, what is the fact I want to say? Up to small pi zero errors, you can look at growing the grid, epsilon's a metric of C, too complete, and you can map to epsilon symmetric to a logical thing of R, and I'll also tell you in a moment what this is, but I just want to write it in a form that That is, I don't know, useful for me. It's not symmetric, topological C. You do complete everything. And the statement is this is a pullback up to pi zero issues. The more precise statement is the map from here to the pullback is an ISO on all positive homotopy groups and an injection of pi zero. And the fact that it's only an injection of pi zero is sort of in different areas has led to some confusion of life. So it's important to remember if you actually want to do something. If you actually want to do something. But we only want to calculate homotopy and positive degrees. We don't care about this. Okay, and then there is more that you know. Namely, okay, what is Brodenikwid of the reals? Well, the Sylvester theorem says any unimodular form of the reals is sort of canonically decomposed into a positive definite and a negative definite part. So, really, forms of the reals are just two modules. You declare a positive part and a negative definite part, and so what you get is just two. And so, what you get is just two copies of KO. What's the entry in the bottom right? Ah, it's the three addict numbers. The three addict number? That's the bottom left. Ah, that's C. Okay. Fabian, don't say anything. Um this is a bit annoying. Choose once and for all an embedding of Z3 into the complex numbers. You can do that, surely, because I don't know. That, surely, because I don't know, embed it in C3 and identify C3 with C. And then surely this diagram on rings commutes because you map from Z. And the statement is that diagram induces a two-addic pullback on road liquid. And yes, choices were made, and you can ask, does something depend on choices? But for the question I'm about to discuss, these choices do not play a role, so I don't want to go into it. Okay, likewise, you do something about. Okay, likewise you do something about symmetric forms over the complex numbers, not Hermitian forms of the complex numbers. And what comes out is that this is just one copy of table. And this is the map that adds two copies of table. And up to two copies. So you have an epsilon in there now, I think. Ah yeah, sorry. This is the epsilon equal to one case. Sorry. Let me focus let me fo this is true. And let me focus on epsilon equal to one and if time remains I'll explain to you how to extract the epsilon minus one case from the epsilon one case. One case from the epsilon one case. I do the epsilon one calculation and then the statement is you extract the epsilon minus one calculation from the epsilon one calculation by means of botkino sequences. So this is something you have. And the main idea for this is to see two things. So on the one hand side you want to show that if you do if you map from Z If you map from Z to Z adjoint one half, this is a two-addic equivalence. And then for a Z adjoint two half, this is actually equivalent. And this is really what the hashtag 9 stuff does. It says that sort of going from Z to Z adjoint 1 over 2, you two actually don't lose anything. And then the second statement is sort of a combination of the Bugsbed square, which says Which says that K of Z adjoins one half to K of, I mean maybe KO to Ku to K of Z3. And this is a two-adding pullback. So this is on the one hand side. And now if you want to prove something like this, and you know something like this, then you are allowed to apply orbit. So really you reduce the case of doing something else here in addition. And so you also prove that L of 0. L of R, L of C, L of C three. It's also a bullet, and that's sort of an elementary technique just to be extra easy. So yeah, nothing really happens. All the work has been done essentially by Workshad and understanding K of C L prime 2. And then you get this Grove-Liquid stuff for free. So you know this is a pullback analytic to calculate. But really, what this tells you is that part of the way I understand Grote-Liquid of C is. Growthly grid of C is through the map to Grove Negro of the grids, which is very unfortunate for us because that's the map we care about. And so maybe I add here that, again, up to pi zero issues, this term is the fiber of a map from self-m1 KO, which is given by psi 3 minus 1. So some atoms operation, psi 3 addict on KO, take its equalizer with the identity, and then the error term is going to be born in good of these three addicts. And so all the times that you have fiber sequences that are from the normality books. And so, what you get as an upshot, a claim, if you just work through these calculations, is that you can do the vertical inclusion of the K all. So this is, I guess, let me call it the anti-diagonal. So that's the fiber of this map. And then, at least for positive homology, you have a map from KO to Broughton equation. You have a map from KO to Broughton D grid or C, which shoots in this KO. And the claim is that the map from KO to Broughton grid epsilon symmetric C to Broton degrid epsilon symmetric of the reals. And then at the L of the reals, where this is the canonical map, it factors through KO, and this is the minus map. So this is through KO plus KO. It's the minus map, and then there is some map. It's the minus map, and then there is some map that I'd like to call tau. Let me explain to you why this map comes about. So, this two allic fiber sequence, we have a grotene width of the reals, and L theory of the reals reads as follows. If you say you had something like this, Groton League with top, and L theory sits in a fiber sequence with some C2 term of K theory, but I did everything topological sort of. So I'm about to say KO. And this is KO plus. This is KO plus KO. So I can do something stupid. I can observe that KO maps to its two orbits, which project down. And then, if you do this, so maybe I put KO plus KO here, just say these are equivalent, what is the map that you get? Well, this was induced by the hyperbolic map. And this is sort of given by decomposing into positive and negative definite parts. And over the reals, what you get is that this is the diagonal. Yes? And so I get a map from the co-fibre. And so I get a map from the co-fiber, which is KO, with a minus fiber 2L of R, and that map I call tau. And then by construction, the map from Groton Degrid. I mean, if I do this, you can convince yourself that you can split this by sort of projecting onto the positive definite particle. Anyways, So the statement is: you can do this, and the image of the map that you care about is unchanged if you hit it with KO, because on the non-tor... Yeah, okay. So the KO maps in here. This has torsion, and I claim that this is split search active. So on the non-torsion-free part, you just tip it by KO, and then you know what to get with it. You have to go through this, but it's not too bad. So what happens is that this component. Too bad. So, what happens is that this composite is times 2. Is that right? True? Because this composite is the anti-diagonal, and then I take the minus value. That adds up to a 2. So this composite is a 2, so really I reduce everything to calculating this value. And then I'm done in the epsilon equals 1 case. So then you use a trick and you show that tau is a ring. That tau is a ring map. Okay, O is a ring, L of R is a ring, tau is a ring map, so if I know what it does on pipe 4, I've done it. Tau on pi 4, from KO to pi 4, L of R to C, that takes a generator to, well, if I don't specify the generator, then I say possible. And one way you can do this is either you sort of um you're sort of careful in these constructions, or something that I just like is I observe that this construction, this whole thing is something that makes perfect sense for any C-style algebra. Then I use that this is natural in C-style algebras. And I check what it does on time model, that you just calculate by hand. And then there is only one such map, so one natural map. There's only one such map, so one natural map, and that happens to be a ring map. Just a, yeah, we can do these kinds of tricks. So you know this, so you get some factor of four appearing, and then you use, you know, what is the homotopy ring of KO? It's not really polynomial, but it's polynomial up to a factors of two that come every second time, first of all. Because it has a ring map to Ku, which we exactly know how to evaluate. So this really tells you that the numbers that you get with growing With growing homotopy, get more and more divisible by powers of two, and the exact ones you have to, I don't know, they have to do with the fact that this is not polynomial on this generator. So you get some extra factors of two, and then you add this extra factor of two. This is the way you calculate. I'll stop here, and if anyone is interested of how to get the epsilon minus one case from the epsilon case, I can expect it to be the first substance. Okay, it's like expected to be some other things similar to the questions Lost track of the conclusion for manifolds with framed base? That's the two power deficiency. So what's the conclusion? The conclusion is that So, what was the conclusion? The conclusion is that if you have a manifold bundle over a frame base of dimension 2d, then the signature of the total space is divisible by roughly 2 to the d plus 1, possibly 2 to the d plus 2, depending on the exact parity of d modulo 4. So it's not multiplicative. For manifolds, you can do some calculations that also show that really it's not multiplicative. And for local systems, as I said, all of these numbers are actually realized. Of these numbers are actually realized. We know that there is a local system over a framed 2D manifold with signature given exactly the number that is about to happen. That approach is impossible? No, as I try to explain what you can arrive at the divisibility results by using Results by using the fact that you can make the signature operator linear for the Clifford algebra of a certain rank, and then using the representation theory of the Clifford algebras. And that's what is in this book of laws and Michaelson and has been done by Atiya. So for manifold bundles, the fact that the signatures are divisible by these numbers, you can prove by index theoretic means. So for manifolds, you can recover it from the calculation into This calculation to local systems. So I don't need to have a manifold bundle. It just has nothing to do with the fact that it's a manifold bundle. But for manifolds, you will have higher divisibilities in principle. More stuff will happen that you don't easily see from index theory. But in principle are doable. I mean, this argument I made with Bernoulli numbers, it's just doing that. You write out the signature formula in terms of Pontriang classes, you check what is the coefficients of your Pontiang class, and then do it. Of your functioning class and then do it. That's why you're right at these numbers. There were too many factors to what was the conclusion for the vertical map and the horizontal map? Which of these? Ah, yes, so this map, for epsilon equals to one, it's times two on the red event homology group we care about. And for epsilon equals minus one, it's times one on the red ventilator group. Somehow, the base is doubly even dimensional. Even dimensional, then you get an extra factor of two from the fact that you know that comes from the integers. Any further questions? Bank marks again.
