With anyone who happens to be interested. So, my goal for the next hour is to just start with motivation, so things you've all seen before, but just remember what we're trying to do in constructing a new breed. I'm going to talk about the equivariant degree for spheres. This is work that's already been done by a number of people, Green Siegel, and Tia. I'll talk about our work, defining the degree and local degree in general, and then I'll do an enumerated example, because it's an enumerated workshop. It's an integrated workshop. So let me just remind you kind of how the topological degree works classically in your first year topology class. So given some map of n-spheres, you get an induced map on reduced homology. which is given by multiplication by d for some integer d. And we say that the degree of f is exactly this d. Not all manifolds are spheres, as we know, so given, so map f from x to y, now I think we need Now I think we need X and Y connected, oriented, same dimension, let's say dimension N, you still get this induced map on homology. And we can take the degree of f. And we can take the degree of F to be the push forward of the fundamental class. Yeah, I think I probably need that too. Thanks. So this is a really nice definition in the sense that it's short to state, it's really clear, it holds in a lot of generality, but it's maybe not the most computationally intuitive if you want to do computations. Intuitive if you want to do computations. But the triumph of degree theory classically is that you can compute this locally. So given some regular value for any point in the pre-image For any point in the pre-image, you can find an open set around the point in the pre-image. You can find an open set around the point in the image, the regular value, and you can use a tubular neighborhood theorem to define some map that I'll call f sub x, and this is going to be another map of n spheres. We can define the local degree of f at this point x to be the degree of this map of n-spheres. And the conclusion, the happy conclusion of this is that the degree can be computed as a sum. Can be computed as the sum of local degrees. And this is independent of choice of regular value. And even better, this vocal. And even better, the slocal degree is either plus or minus 1. Plus, either plus 1 or minus 1, depending on whether or not the derivative is orientation preserving or reversing it at this point. Preserving at X. Or reversing. So, this is the degree classically. It's possible you've taught this in one of your classes before. And we've heard about degrees a lot this week in the motivic setting. We heard about them yesterday. We also just heard about them in Ronstalk. And the really cool thing about degrees and motivic homotopy theory is that there's an extra piece of information that you have. There's an extra piece of information that you have to keep track of. So, you don't just want to keep track of the orientation at a point in your pre-image, but your local degree needs to incorporate a field trace that kind of keeps track of the residue field at any point in your pre-image. So, equivariantly, we're not going to necessarily, that's not going to really be a question for us because we'll be dealing with real complex manifolds, but we will want to keep track of orbit information for points in the pre-image of a regular value. When x and y are g-manifold. When X and Y are G manifolds, and F is the down theory map. So before we do that, let's just take a step back and think about what ingredients we even need for a degree. Let's make sure that we know the list of ingredients that we're trying to cook with. So, first of all, we need to know what the ring of definition is. Classically, this is the integers. It's the goes into the fit rate, but typically we need to know what orientations are. We need to know what orientations are. And last, I just said this, let me write it down as well. We need to understand the orbit of the set of points in the pre-image at the circular value. So, in general, this will have a g-action. So, in general, this will have a g-action. We need to remember orbits. You can think about this like roots of unity come in complex conjugate pairs. How nice if we could remember that under conjugation. So, this is kind of equivariant replacement of remembering the residue field. Why would have to be a fixed point? Great question. You don't always have a fixed point, but I will deal with that. Okay, so before we get to the manifold case, I want to talk about equivariant degrees of maps between representation spheres. This is classical. This work is due to a number of people. Siegel, Atia, just to name a few, a good reference for this is Tom Deek's book. Okay, so we're gonna let Jeanne and talk about Slee Group. Let's let G be a compact Lie group. Let's let B be a G representation. Let's take a complex G representation. S V is going to be the one-point compactification of this with G A. With G acting trivially at infinity. And I'll denote in square brackets, as one often does, moments of classes based and infinity based equivalent maps. From S V to itself. So these are representation, this is what representation spheres are. They are spheres in equivariant homotopy theory. G representations form a postset under linear isometric ensettings. So you can take the co-limit over G representations. There are some details there that I'm obfuscating, but it's true in one. It's true, and one can read the details. So you can take the colon over G drops under occlusion, maybe this is linear isometric. And it's a theorem that this collimit is attained at a finite stage. And not only is it attained at a finite stage, but the really amazing thing is that it's isomorphic to the burnside ring. So we heard about this in Thomas's great talk yesterday. In some sense, the burnside ring is the thing that you want, it's the ring that keeps track of orbits of G sets. I'll write that down. Orbits of G sets, I'll write that down. But this is kind of like the formalism behind why the Bernstein ring really is the grain that we should think about: degrees, and therefore equivariant enumerative results that could be computed using degrees. It really should be the ring that's being conditioned. Yeah. So if you have some, you know, one of your usual compact lead groups, like UN or something, that has infinitely many irreducible representations, well, it's kind of surprising that. Well, it's kind of surprising that this is a pain. It is very surprising. That's a great point. So, case, g is a finite group. Yeah, finite group is also surprising. And this is just the Rosenby rot of isoclasses. In G subs, addition is given by disjoint union, and there's a ring structure, it's multiplication, its Cartesian product. This only works for finite groups. If G is not finite, you can actually just take this co-limit to be the definition of your Bren-Seid ring. So now you don't really have, like, maybe a great way of thinking about G sets that aren't finite, but many G sets are finite, many groups are finite. This is a Groups are finite. This is a good definition. And let me just tell you one more thing about this isomorphism. The way this works is you take some F, the whole process in F. The whole processing up. And you map it to the set of points in the pre-image of zero as a G set. This is assuming that zero is a regular value. If it's not, you can make it a regular value. You can like return regular variantly. So I'll just say mark with me zero regular value, but as long as it is. But as long as it is, this is a finite set of points, let's say G is a finite group, by the orbit stabilizer theorem. You can write it as a disjoint union of its orbits. And because disjoint union is addition in the Bernstein ring, this is just equal to some sum of transitive G sets. Now this is going to be a number. Now this is going to be a number of orbits stabilized. So there are a lot of really nice computations you can do in specific examples if you give me a group and give me a G set. But anyway, this is the classical degree, just for spheres. But this is for finite group. But this is for finite group. I mean this doesn't work for a completely the isomorphism still works. I think you do need the root. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is the classical setup. We started with defining the degree for mass between spheres, then we defined it for mass between manifolds. Now we're going to define it for mass between G manifolds. For mass rechain G manifolds. In the co-limit, is that inclusion going the other way? V is the guy we start with, and then we're taking a limit. Oh no, I see. Sorry. So what's B prime here? Oh, I'm just saying, like, I'm just saying the co-limit. Is B fixed and so on? I'm saying the co-limit over the post set under inclusion. But the notation was confusing. I was trying to not have to write down anything concrete. Write down anything concrete. So, this degree kind of makes sense for a fixed V, but this is thinking of this as actually a map on that whole limit. Yeah, it's independent. As long as V is really large, it's independent. So it's a stable thing. You can add on more representation spheres, and the degree is an invariant. So here's our degree. Here's the classical degree for maps between representation spheres. We're going to define it for maps between G manifolds in general. It's going to be a push forward in equivariant cohomology theory. And if we take the sphere spectrum, we want to be able to get into map between representation scars. We want to be able to get that to this degree. Okay, so I might try to move a little bit quickly through some of the homotopy constructions. Let me just say, for those in the audience who might be experts, everything I'm going to do is stable. All of my spaces are going to be pointed. And everything is equivariant from now on. So if I write, I've already done it. If I write something without a G, I mean G. Everything's equivariant. So again, let's let G be a compact sleeve group. And we're going to get E, the genuine G spectrum with brain structure up to homotopy. This is in the category of G spectra. Don't worry about that if you don't know what it is. E defines an equivariant cohomology theory is what I'm trying to say. Equal variant cohomology theory is what I'm trying to say here. Given some f from x to y, a geo equivariant map of smooth G manifolds a tangent complex. The tangent complex is this. We denote it by LF and it's this two-term complex B theory. So this looks like a map. It is a map. So, this looks like a map. It is a map. I'm saying consider it as a two-term complex in K-theory. We say F is relatively oriented. If the time space of minus the tangent complex is trivial after smashing with E, for me this is the Tom space of this complex. So the annotation, but it's something we know. Enter smash. So we've seen some things like this so far this week. I mean in classical theory there are some nice conditions on E which says that every half satisfy you know, if you give it E, then every F satisf satisfies a linear algebraic condition. Linear algebra condition. Oriented theories, everything's oriented. Yeah, like you could say complex oriented theory. Is it like that here? It is like that here. You can take E to be a complex oriented theory, and often that is what you want to do. We didn't define it for that. We defined it much more generally. But you certainly can put restrictions on E so that things are oriented in a way you would expect. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I'll just say maybe I'll just say one more thing if this is kind of confusing. If you pick like a specific x, like a point, if you pick some point here, then you can pull the tangent complex back to the k-theory of just the points. Just the point. And your tangent complex looks like this. And these are just going to be representation spheres. Their time spaces are just compactifications. What we're saying here is not that V and W have to be the same representation, but that they are after smashing V. So like maybe this is a sign representation. Maybe this is a sign representation. This is some, this is like a regular representation. They're not the same, they are after smashing with the theory. So now let's assume that it's proper. At its proper and relatively E-oriented. Then we can use basically equivarian teoduality. Um, I'm I'm calling it this, but I'm calling it this, but we define this. We define a push forward in epochology. And as is customary, it's twisted. I'm going to call this isomorphism rho. So it's twisted, but because f is relatively e-oriented, we can untwist it. And we define the degree to be the push forward of one. So now this. So now this looks a lot like our classical story of push forward the fundamental class, but we've done that equivariantly. And what we're going to do now is we're going to define a local degree. Sorry? The thing in the top left of your tag. Yeah, you tried to tag it. So we're going to define a local degree, and the local degree will be evaluated in the cohomology will point. So if you pick a nice enough spectrum, for example the sphere spectrum or equivalent K-theory, you wind up getting a degree valued in something like the Bernstein ring or the reference species ring. Let me stop there. Any questions? Okay, so let's let y be a regular value. That means that the set of points in the pre-image, well, this is a screen ramp on. By Sard's theorem, we know that we have regular values. The set of regular values has full measure. But like you said, Jim, we don't know if we can find a regular value that's a fixed point. It's possible that the confection doesn't have any fixed points. So instead of asking for a local degree that is T equivariant, we're going to ask for a local degree that is the stabilizer of Y equivariant. And hopefully you have a fixed point, which, or sorry, you have a regular value. Point, which or sorry, you have a regular value which is a fixed point, but you might not. So here you always have the fixed point, and you say you can just have exactly. That's the real problem. Not problem, interesting thing. I'm still a little confused because you deformed that zero, it's no. To form that zero, it's no longer a fixed point, right? So the group wouldn't act on the fiber. Once the zero still has to go to zero, uniform the map. Uniform the map. Yeah, you perturb the map, you perturb the map to make it transverse to zero, but then zero still goes to zero. Okay, so we want to understand the stabilizer of y orbits of this set of orbits. Of y orbits of this set of points in the pre-image of a regular value. And it could just be totally non-trivial. I mean, it's the stabilizer of y. It doesn't have to stabilize any of these points in the pre-image of the regular value. So this could be like, for example, this could be something like maybe an x1 and an x2 are in the same orbit together. And an x3 is in an orbit by itself. And we really want to remember that x1 and x2. And we really want to remember that x1 and x2 are in the same orbit. So we're going to be able to find equivariant tubular neighborhoods around all of these to get maps between representation spheres, but we want to remember. But we want to remember that, for example, these could be in the same GY orbit. And the way that we do that is using equivariant transfers, which are kind of intimidating if you just are trying to learn about them, but in practice it's often something really reasonable, like the induction of a representation from a subgroup to the whole group, like it's a pretty reasonable change of group. Pretty reasonable change for the majority of the majority. So let me write down in math what this diagram means. Okay, so here's my F without the inclusion of a point. These two maps were transverse at this proper. Let's see if we can. Let's take a pullback. What I mean is this whole square is gy equivariant, but for any one x, this map is only gx equivariant. So And this whole square is GY equivariant. So, what we do then is we use the T of duality again to define another push forward. But the key here is that this is not G equivariant. It's not even G Y equivariant. It's only GX equivariant. This is like, this is what I talked about. Take the tangent complex over at. Why is it just restricted? Exactly. Exactly. But because these are proper, this is like a proper transverse pullback, we can pull back the orientation of f to an orientation of fx to untwist or push forward. Work and we define the local degree of f to be this push forward of one. Here's the here's the theorem. Here's the theorem giving you the local-to-global principle. Let F X to Y be proper GMAP smooth and hot GMAP folds. Assume it's relatively E-oriented. And the global degree is equal to a sum of local degrees. But now, we don't want to add up the local degree of every single map in the pre-image. Of every single map in the pre-image, we just want one for every orbit, and then we want some mechanism for remembering that, for example, x1 and x2 are in the same orbit. So let's take the sum over orbits. And the way that we remember the orbits is we transfer from gx to gy, and this is an equality. And this is an equality in the only thing is, remember, the global degree is in the cohomology of the big space, not the cohomology of a point. So we have to pull the left-hand side back to the pole. And that's it. That's the local-to-global principle. So this is a GY. This is a GY equivariant equality. In the case when you have a fixed point, you can get a G equivariant equality. Something to note here is that, like, immediately, this is not independent of choice of regular value because you might have regular values that have different stabilizers. So there's something to be said there. You're certainly trying to encode more information than you are constantly. Even if they do have the same state of life. Even if they do have the same state of functions, they might have the same or even if they both, even if you have like two fixed points, I still think you need a little bit more work. I think you need a connectedness assumption. Can you say, say I'm working in the Burnside ring of finite group, can you say sort of explicitly with that transitor? Yeah. Yeah. So this local degree, it looks like it, so it winds up being a map between representation spheres. Representation spheres. Let me just write this off to the slide. This local degree winds up looking like a map between representation spheres. Maybe it's like, well, it's because these X and Y are, they're really suspension spectra. So I take their value on a representation. And that is a representation sphere. So really, this is like some SV to SV. The transfer here. Different spheres of the same sphere to be. Now same. Now, same. Same way. Because of the relative orientation. I'm kind of obfuscating something. It's a question of like, are you here or here? I'm saying eventually things can be oriented. And the transfer looks like: take this match product with this. And what this kind of does is. And what this kind of does is it gives you basically like a map from a bouquet of spheres to one sphere, which is what you want, right? Like, I would love to have a map from a bouquet of spheres, and they're in the same bouquet if they're in the same gy orbit. One sphere, the x1 gives you a sphere, and the x3 gives you a sphere. Exactly. I'm supposed to think of the v as like the tangent space around each of these tiles. Exactly. It's not acted on by the whole G, it's only acted on by the state. E is a GX representation. Actually, you can make it a GY representation. Yeah. This is also like, it's different for different for different brain spectra. This is like, what I've written is pretty specific to the bird segment, but I was going to say that. But I was going to say that this, like this in p-theory, equivariant K-theory is induction. So if you've taken a representation theory. If you've taken a representation theory class, you will have probably seen this. What you have really seen is an equivariant, is a change of group in an equivariant cohomology theory. There's just more or less favor, depending on the rate spectrum. Okay. And if it's a finite H set, can I make it like a product with G mod H or something and use that to act? How do I do the transference of finite each set? How do I do the transference of finite instead? If you have some H representation, this is like take V and censor the permutation representation. So the same thing if it was just a finite page setting, just all the web of the gene modern. Yeah, you've got something of the dimension that's bigger. You're kind of spreading it out according to. Starting it out according to this coset. Okay, so in the remaining time, I want to talk about applications to enumerative geometry. I'm going to maybe move a little bit quickly here. What I want to say is that you can use the degrees. What I want to say is that you can use the degrees. You can compute the equivalent Euler number and the equivariant Euler characteristic. So let X be smooth. G naught. Beta X, A, rank, N, which is going to also be the dimension of X, the ranked N, complex vector bundle. Oh, spectro bundle. Let's take a section with only simple zeros. Then the equivariant Euler number, which is independent of choice of section. Which is independent of trace subsection is equal to a sum of local degrees. And you can also use the degree to compute the equivariant Euler characteristic, which arises as a categorical trace for dualizable objects in the category of G-spectra. I'm not going to write that down because we've seen that definition a few times in the past week, so I'll just say Say, um, so is this in the lead with the charge of the fiction? Yes. Yeah. Did I miss any hypotheses? There are hypotheses. Yeah. Let me write that down. I'll just say this can be computed using freeze. It's a trace of the identity map on X and For dualizable objects in the category of G spectra, dualizable is a really reasonable condition here, and it's like finite GCW complex, like many things are dualizable. Okay, now I want to talk about counting rational curves equivariantly. I wish you got a cosmonaut. That's what you're doing. Any questions? I feel like I'm moving kind of fast. I don't want to be the obstruction to lunch. Okay. Well, you can ask me questions after if you want. So we're going to count rational curves equivariantly. Here's what I mean by rational curve. There's a map from P1 to P2, which takes a point, it evaluates it on homogeneous degree due polynomials. And there are infinitely many of these, but as we've heard from several people, if we start imposing conditions, specifically requiring that the image passes through some finite number of Image passes through some finite number of quark points, eventually this count becomes finite. So a number of u passing through 3d minus 1 is the magic number. We're at 3d minus 1 points in general position. For example, there are twelve rational qubits. We're eight points in P2. And we want to answer the same question equivariantly. Now, let's let G be a finite number. Acting on P2, let sigma be a gene area set of eight points, eight general voice. And Q2, that doesn't mean you have eight fixed points. That means you have a set of eight points that is fixed under the group action, so it's very possible that all eight of them get muted within the All eight of them get muted within the set. Here's the question: What are orbits of rational qubits through this G-invariant set points? So you have a group. Set points. So you have a group action on P2. That means we have a group action on the rational curves that pass through these eight points. I'm asking not how many are there. We know how many there are. There are 12. I'm asking, can you tell me what orbits they're in under this group action? And it's a theorem, persistent myself that can't answer this question. So G's finite group acting on P2 set sigma is as above There exists a number. I'll tell you which ring spectra we're considering in a second. The count orbits. Orbits of rational cubics of the sigma, we've got a count in the Bernsweigh ring in ethoviring K theory. Better yet, we've got a formula for this. Better yet, we've got a formula for this equal to a sum over orbits of rational curves of a mass where where this mass is equal to the equivariant Euler characteristic of your rational curve. So I'm going to talk about the proof of this. I want to make an immediate remark you take the sphere spectrum you get a count If you take the sphere spectrum, you get a count in the verticide ring, and the cardinality of this G set equals 12, which is what we want. There are 12, so we better get 12. Actually, can I ask about that? Because I would have thought that if you took a big enough or complicated enough finite group of CP2, you wouldn't be able to find an invariant. Be able to find an invariant set of eight points which are general enough to keep this 1212. Well, you might not have an invariant set of eight points. So, what happens if I've got, yeah, so I don't know, I mean, just even, yeah, you might not have any variants. Well, if your curve is rational, it's nodal, and nodal curves have to get mapped to nodal curves because the nodal point has to get mapped to just like one point. So, basically, One point. So basically, qubits are rational nodal or they're smooth. Smooth things stay in an orbit together, and nodal things stay in an orbit together. Sure. When GG is going to act on the factory. Customer's. Oh, I made an assumption that being nodal is an open condition. But I mean, yeah, but what we're saying is that fixed points might be its. The fixed points might be in special position, and then the fixed curves might be really funny. You might not have a G invariant instead of gain points. No, even if you have a G and variants. But you might not have general points. But you might not have one. That's right. You might not have a G invariant instead of general points. That's right. There might be special points. Yeah, there might be special points. In which case you wouldn't have 12. That's right. How can you 12 for it? Probably how that's. Well, probably you have to count each the ones probably. Like, you could have a cuss, but you'd have to count twice. Two. But discussion time listings on the board. This is a great discussion. And I cuts in on the board. This is non-trivial. You have to throw out the cusps. This module I follow on. Okay, general problems. I didn't see anything. Didn't respond earlier, just because I didn't. Yes, and that's coming. I gave this talk a month ago at PCMI where I introduced a normalization, and it's about to come back because it's very important. I just wanted to finish this remark. If E is K-theory, this is a rank 12 representation. Um so this is a theorem, it's proved everything up to this point is done. Here's something that's in progress, we thought it was done, there's it's proven to be interesting. It's proven to be interesting, not wrong, just interesting. This mass is equal to the Euler characteristic of the normalization. Of the normalization minus the Euler characteristic of the curve. Here's my noble curve. Here's the normalization. You unglue at P. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. You unglue, and the normalization and the curve are isomorphic outside of these special points, the special points being the x1 and the x2, and the nodal point P. So this difference in Euler characteristics is really equal to the Euler characteristic of these two points. Of these two points down here. So, uh, we're we're confident this is true. We're confident this is true. It's proving to be part of a longer and interesting story about an equivariant conductor formula. So it might not wind up in this paper, but we feel really, really confident about this result. The reason why this is important, the reason why you might want this, as opposed to just stopping at the end of the theorem, is the following. Let's take a case, G is. Is E12 acting on K2 by conjugation? What do I want to say here? The mass, in this case, of a nodal curve with branches defined over the real numbers, well, the Well, these two points as a G set is going to be the same as the branches as a G set, they're either fixed or they're not. If this is a real node, a real rational curve, these branches are fixed. And so this mass just winds up being two fixed points minus one. If your branches are not real, if they're complex, then this winds up being as a G set. I'm writing this down as G sets. It's fine in K-theory as well. And in either case, The number of things. I'm saying the stabilizer is trivial. The branches are swapped. Okay. Yeah. So anyway, fixed points. It's going to be plus or minus one. It's plus one if the branches are defined over the real numbers. Real numbers. It's minus one of the branches aren't real. Cubics only have one node by Bezou's theorem. And these are not exactly the signs we want. They're the opposite of the signs we want. By what we want, I mean we wanted to compute relational J invariance. We want split nodes to have sine minus one. Have sine minus one. Non-split nodes have sine plus one, but that's okay. No, that's I've thought a lot about this. The minus one is not coming from an orientation. It's coming from the failure of the branches to be fixed under conjugation. I'm sure. No, no, that's what the minus one. Yeah, it sounds trivial, but it's not, because these are like K-theory is a complex-oriented theory, or if it's something in the bird's eye rings. Theory, or do it something in the bird's eye rings to pull back from a complex-oriented theory? It's something I've been thinking about a lot because I think we need different theories long-term to remember orientations, but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, number of fixed points should be equal to the gene myriad is the number of gene fixed points of the last. The set of eight points. So, anyway, this would be great. We're confident it's true. It might not wind up in this paper. But what this is really telling you is that you have one formula, this number, which computes both a complex and a real curve count, which is really cool. You might take that as proof of concept that equivariant enumerative geometry could be used to study real Gromov-Wooden theory and just as well. Real grow-up wooden theory, this is one case, but if you can do one, maybe you can do more. So I was going to talk about the proof. Maybe I won't so that we can go to lunch, but the way that we prove this theorem is we translate the moduli question into one of counting nodal curves in a gevarium pencil of curves, pencil of cubics, which has been done non-equivariantly. And we can do it equivariantly, and we can show that. Equivariantly, and we can show that the number of nodal qubits in a pencil depends purely on equivariant topological invariants. So, Euler characteristics, equivariant, the representation theory of the representation type of the Euler characteristic of a novo fiber, what have you, is purely equivariant, topological. So I think I'll stop there so that we can leave that.
