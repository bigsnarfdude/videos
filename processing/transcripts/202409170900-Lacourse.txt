I will present with Felix Leg, who is a student of mine. He is doing his PhD at the University of Montreal in Sociology. And before presenting, Alexander will describe our research network. So hi everyone. I'm very happy to be there. Thanks for organizing this and inviting us. Inviting us. I'm a professor at the University of Montreal in psychology, and I've been interested all my career in dramatic social change and how it impacts who collectives, all food. And I did, for instance, my PhD in Siberia, collecting data a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union. And I've worked one year in Mongolia and one year in Kyrgyzstan, because I really wanted to understand how people adapt to big change like that. Change like that at the group level and at the personal level. And then, with the COVID, suddenly my topic became very, very popular. And I joined with Eric some efforts to try to understand complex dynamic associated with change, but linking society to the individual. And during the pandemic, we joined a network that was the name was Résau que des Covéd pandémique, Quebec COVID. COVID pandemic, Quebec COVID pandemic network. And we just got some funding for the new network that's called the Résuit Prevention des Crisis Ensampis, Network of Health of Crisis Prevention. And health is measured or defined globally, like mental health, economic health, physical health, etc. and both at the individual and the community level. Community level. And as part, so I'm directing this act. And we are responsible for one of the research acts. And our objective is to mobilize people to action. And when I say people, it's researchers, students, politics, community members, citizen, everyone. So we keep in our mind crisis and how important they are and how much we need to be prepared for the next crisis as well. For the next crisis as well. There's a few people here, like Jacques and others, Jean-Marc, and that are parts of this network as well. But if you are interested, you are welcome to join us and join our efforts. And we have two sub-networks within our act of research. And the first one is complex data and modeling. And this is really what we are doing today and this week with you guys. So hopefully we can. Hopefully, we can share some ideas, especially during the working sessions we will have. And the other sub-networks is more in terms of community interventions, how to understand and test the intervention and be sure they are efficient in times of crisis. And I know there's some people who have spoken about such ideas today. So I'll let Eric, you want to add something? Eric, you want to add something? No, you did fine. I did fine. Not perfect. Just fine. I let those perfect guys do something. So, this is a summary of our presentation. First, I will talk about introduction and little introduction to finite mixture models. Mixture models. We're going to talk about latent class analysis. These are two papers in progress that Felix has led. So one is a latent transition analysis and the other is a growth extra model. I'm going to describe a little bit more in details what are these different modeling techniques for longitudinal data. So, what are finite mixture models? So, what are the motivations behind the development of these models? First, the idea is that our operation is heterogeneous. So it's not. And the general idea behind that is that each individual are different, but some individuals are more similar to each other, so they tend to cluster together. So there are sub-populations that are referred to as. Populations that are referred to as latent, so they are not directly observed, but we will use observed variables and the association that we can find among these variables to define these homogeneous sub-populations. So, and generally there is no single theoretical or statistical model that applies to all situations or to all individuals. So, this approach in psychology is so the unit is the person, so it's called person-oriented. And it makes more sense, since we are interested in individuals, than to focus on the individuals and its complexity, instead of focusing only on some variables. So, these models focus on groups of people with some other characteristics. So, we'll find clusters. So, we will find clusters rather than focusing on additive linear effects. So, clusters generally can capture nonlinear effects and also interaction effects. So, one characteristic of this model is that these are probabilistic models, so they are part of the, let's say, generalized linear model, but it's even more. Model, but it's even more general. So it's generalized in the near model with latent variables. And you can also deal with non-normal or more extreme data, so you can find really rare subgroups in your population that behave very differently than the other people. So there are two steps when you want to build a model. When you want to build a model, first you create a measurement model. So the idea is to, as I said before, you have observed variables and you think that the relationship among these variables are related to groups that are not directly observed in your population. Then you identify the number of latent classes that best describe your data and use fit. You can use fit indices or indexes such as information criteria, so AIC, EIC, so vision information criteria, and ACIT information criteria, or lighthood ratio tests. So there are different techniques or indices to help you find the model that best fits the data. So, theoretical interpretation of the model should also. The theoretical interpretation of the model should always be considered during the model selection. So it's the job of the researcher to label the latent classes. And we rely on theory to, because sometimes you can find classes that are just random points, and you don't want to extract classes that do not make sense theoretically. The second part is the structural model. So you link the measurement model to other variables in the system. So you can have external independent variables that are prior to the clustering. And you can also have external dependent variables that are associated to these data and classes. So you can predict. Classes, so you can predict outcomes of belonging to a specific latent class. This is just a little table presenting from a latent variable model perspective, which is very influential in social science. So if you have categorical observed variables and categorical latent variables, so that's our case. So you have a latent class model. Class model. If you have a continuous observed variables that is normally distributed, you have latent profile or Gaussian mixture models. If the latent variables are continuous, you can have item response theory. Then here it's factor analysis or structural equation model if both are continuous. But again, there has been many extensions, so you can have other distributions as well. Distributions as well. So, one of the most popular finite mixture models is called latent class analysis, or LC for short. It is used to classify respondents into latent classes based on a response in a categorical observer variable. So, we have a prototypical response pattern on these variables that help to identify between classes. In the literature, we also In the literature, LCL often proposed to the blob a person architect framework since writing classes can be interpreted as archetypes of individuals found in population. LCL also has an inductive approach since we don't have prior assumption about the model parameters. In other words, we don't know how many archetypes there are, what characterize them, or their prevalence in the population. LC parameters are estimated. LC parameters are estimated using the expectation maximization algorithms, and two types of parameters are estimated. First, class prevalence, which are the portion of the population that belongs to each class, and second, conditional probabilities, which are the probabilities of obtaining a specific response on observed variables given neighborship network through as in class. Elsie also postulates that once individuals are classified into Once individuals are classified into latent classes, the relationships between the observed variables are clearly explained by the latent variable. So this is the conditional dependence assumption. An extension of latent transiting class analysis is latent transition analysis because we also have longitudinal finite nature model. So the model is composed of two parts. First, the measurement model, which like LC analysis. Which, like LC, allows to classify respondents into relating classes. But, however, this is done at multiple time points, and the transition model. So, it allows to identify the probability of belonging to a particular class at 5T based on class membership at IDT minus 1. So, in short, LT is a Lagoon model. So, here is an example of how LT. So here's an example of how LTE can be used in a study. So the results that I'm going to show are a primary result. So from a theoretical background, one might think that there were fewer demonstrations during the pandemic due to the fear of conceiving a statement of offense or contracting virus. However, the overall number of demonstrations targeted during spring and summer of 2020 and remains high until summer of 2022. So the pandemic generated a two-year Do. So the pandemic generated a two-year-old contentious episode. And yes, citizens protest in the street, but they also use other modes of action, such as posting and sharing content on social media. And the literature tells us that when we look at social movements, for instance, they combine different actions to protest against governments, such as online and offline actions, and also that protest behavior varies across countries. Across countries. So the main objective of the study was first to identify typical how disciplined protests or profile of protesters. Were there different profiles during the pandemic? And second, is this technology constant throughout the pandemic or can we find different profile of protesters at different moments of the pandemic? And third, I protesters change with the protest during different moments of the pandemic. The protests during the moment of the pandemic. We use the data from a longitudinal survey from a project called COVID-19 Canada, the end of the world, as we know it. We use five binary indicators, that is signing a petition, contacting a politician, posting or sharing a message or link on social media, and also attending a street protest. These five binary items were measured at three time points, that is during spring of twenty twenty, summer of twenty twenty, also spring of twenty twenty two. Also, spring of 2022. So, the LTE model is characterized by having non-codistant transitions. So, we have long-term, long-term, and short-term transitions. Several models were compared, and the four-class model with measurement, longitudinal measurement invariance was selected as the more pertinent model. That means that the conditional probabilities defining each class is the same at all time points, although class revenues have changed across time points. Have changed across backwards. So, here are the results of the GWIN model. So, what the model identifies three latent classes of activists or profile of activists, and also an activist class. Starting all the way to the right side of the table, we have the class that we later labeled all-around activists, which were characterized by having a high probability of using either one of these actions. You can see also that for Athena Industries, protest probability is lower than for the other action. However, this probability was 10 times higher than for the general population. Than for the general population, and also higher than compared to other relating classes. The second relating class of activists is the online activist, which has a high probability of protesting by posting and sharing content on social media, but low probability of attending a street protest or contacting a politician. The third leading class of activists is called conventional activists, which had a low probability of posting on social media or sharing content at an industry protest, but higher probability of signing and contacting. Of sucking and contacting politicians. All these classes, as well as these other classes, is also well distinct from the third class. And finally, we have the analytics class, which has the probability of using either one of these actions, and is the large majority of the population. It also, this class prevalence increased the pandemic, and meanwhile, the online activist class decreased by around 50%. Meanwhile. 50%, meanwhile. We are next to the transition model. Here, both values denote the probability of remaining in the same class. So there are multiple ways, yes. We use fit statistics and also the theoretical interpretation of the model. But at the end, I can show the result of these fit statistics. Yeah, I compare four and five, and the notable indicator indicated before class. Indicated before class model was the model to adapt. But it was done manual. Comparing with fit statistics, they indicate that this model was more parsimonious than other, although that's an tradition model. I can show at the end how the model selection process works in LTE. So, first and foremost, so there are multiple ways of reading this table, but first and foremost, we can see that the transition from online activist classes. From the online activist classes, where it means that few protesters typically change how they protest. For instance, online activists at low probability at both transition to the conventional activist class and vice versa, meaning that few protesters completely change how they protest. And also, both conventional and online activists had low probability of transitioning to the all-round activist tasks, meaning that few protesters use other modes of action later on. Modes of action later on, in addition to protest behavior that they already have. The other main result of this table is that activists in general have high probability of transitioning to the non-activist class, meaning that a large portion of activists stopped protesting revolt in short-term and long-term transition. Meanwhile, some of non-activists, which were the large majority, Non-activists, which were the large majority of the population, start protesting and transition to an activist class. What is interesting here is that, although it's not the same individuals that protested remains at all time points, we found these three profile of activists at all three time points. We don't have different profile of activists at time one, at time two, and at time three. So, overall, this study shows that these These three protester profiles seem stable during the pandemic and perhaps can be found in other pandemics or contentious episodes. This was an example of how LTA can be used to identify different profile of behaviors, analyze their stability across time, and examine the discrete changes in prototypical behaviors. Next I think we'll show how finite mixture model can also be used to analyze continuous trends in the data. New strands in the data. So, what Felix presented is for discrete time, and it's also related, you can see intra-individual change over time based on different profiles. Here, the growth mixture model is a slightly different procedure. So, first, like LC, we assume Assumes it assumes a categorical latent variables, but what we have is latent trajectories instead of probabilities or problems. And these growth patterns can be modeled using polynomials of various forms, so they can be linear, quadratic, and cubic. So here the focus is on inter-individual differences in intra-individual change. So it's a different research question. So each individual. So each individual is then assigned to a latent class based on their observed growth trajectory. GMM can model complex growth patterns that vary across subgroups, but GMM is a nice extension which can also enable you to follow within group variation. So this can be constrained to zero, so you presume that there is no variation. No variation within trajectory groups, but you can also allow these variations. So again, it's based on a survey, so Felix didn't say it, but it's around the sample size is around 3,500 people. And now you see we have more time points. It's continuous time. It's continuous time, and also it's not equal spaced time. So, we ask the question: how much do you trust each of the following actors to address COVID-19? So we're going to talk more about scientists, but we ask for these questions about these two different groups of people. The structural model part. So, we're going to predict based on the classification of the model, vaccine intention, and also vaccination. These are the different items that were used for binary variables. So, this is the the output. The output of a growth mixture model. So on the x-axis, you have time. As you see, it's not equally spaced. And here you have the scale of trust, which varies between 0 and 10. If we would have looked at the data on average, so we only have one curve, or probably have a curve in the middle here. In the middle here. So you see that there's a lot of heterogeneity in our population and there are different curves. So it's also called, for people who are familiar with random effects model, it's called a non-parametric random effects model. So here are the prevalence in each class. So most of the population will follow these two. Population will fall into these two classes, so people are relatively stable over time and they are confident in the scientists. But you have these more extreme groups. So one is very low at the beginning and then get closer to the second group. The group is high, then getting low and then getting slightly higher at the end. Slightly higher at the end, and another group, the red one, which we think is the most at-risk group. It's a small group, 7.3% of the population, but those really down at the end of the pandemic. And these are trusts in health institution trajectories, just to be precise. Trust in health institutions trajectories. So, what we can do, since we have categorical weight and variable, can use these categories to predict an outcome. So, that's what we have here. So, we use the IS trajectory as. The IS trajectory as a group comparison. What you see here for vaccine intention is all the trajectories are less likely, since the odds ratios are smaller than one, they are less likely to have the intention to get vaccinated in the future. So the lowest trajectories compared to the The lowest trajectories compared to the highest trajectory. Here it's the same, it's the same ID, but it's only significant for the low and decreasing trajectory, so that was the red trajectory. But we could use other group for contrast if somebody wants to ask more specific questions. So finite mixture model are great models to detect patterns in the data. In machine learning, it's called unsupervised learning. It's also a person-oriented approach, which is great when you have asked questions about person and not about necessarily variables, but it can be other units. So if your units are If your units are a neighborhood, it can be neighborhood-oriented. But it's not because it's person-oriented, because our unit is a person. We also created, in the past two years, we worked on a Python and R package to do stepwise up that uses stepwise optimization method to predict distill outcomes. Because the problem with trajectories, when you Problem with trajectories when you classify people, you don't take necessarily into account uncertainty and classification. And sometimes there's a lot of uncertainty and classification, so you need more specific optimization methods to good prediction. So it's called StepMix, and it's free. You can download it on GitHub, and it was downloaded. Downloaded it it is right now downloaded three thousand times uh a month, so we're really happy about uh this project. Thank you. So we already had a question that I think I respond first during the model text process. So we did
