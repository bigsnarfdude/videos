Thank you very much, Pedro. Thank you to the organizer for the kind invitation. I'm very happy to be in this conference. So I would like to talk about recent joint work with Tarik at Guindi and Klaus Widmeyer. And it's about stationary solution to the Euler equations in 2D. And so and what these solutions tell us about the dynamics of the equation in the long term. So let me start by just writing down the equations. The two Deider equations in a two-dimensional domain are given by a system partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the velocity of an incompressible fluid. Incompressible fluid, U is the velocity, there's two components, and P is the scalar pressure. And since I'm not assuming that any viscosity, I don't have any sort of new Laplacian term here. And in two dimensions, if I forget for a minute what the boundary conditions are, it's more convenient to work with the vorticity formulation. So the vorticity, capital Omega. Capital Omega is the only non-zero component of the curl of the velocity and it satisfies a transport equation. So omega is transported by U and U can be recovered by the Biuse of our law from omega. So the Biosevar law can be written in this way. So U is the gradient per, so the 90 degrees rotation of a gradient. Degrees rotation of a gradient of a stream function psi, and psi solves a Poisson equation, La Passion Psi equals omega. So what are the main features of these equations? So there is no problem with global reposness as long as we are, say, on the Taurus, which is the case I'm interested in, or simple bounded domains, I mean, smooth. Smooth and so smooth solutions remain smooth for all times and they're global. And all the ALP norms are conserved, and in fact, every function of the vorticity is conserved. So it's a system of equation or an equation that has many conserved quantities. And therefore, the question of what is the long-term behavior for a given initial data, what does it do as time goes to infinity, is very interesting because it's Very interesting because it's in general very challenging. And in fact, because we have no dissipation, there is no global dissipation mechanism towards an equilibrium, for example. And so the dynamics can be very complicated. So, but there is some effect that is in no okay, sorry. There is some effect that is important to Is important to detect that is usually called mixing or vorticity mixing or fluid mixing, and it's a cascading process in which information travels to smaller and smaller spatial scales in a way that it's conservative for all finite times, but it's sort of there is a loss of information at infinite time. So, here on the left is just a picture of a simpler equation, just a transport equation in which the velocity is assigned, and I have Is assigned, and I have the concentration, say coffee, milk, mean-zero concentration, and I start steering. I see that smaller, smaller scales are formed. And these constitute sort of an averaging mechanism. So the L2 norm is conserved for the solution, but the solution converges to zero in a weak sense. And so this mechanism can be thought of in a more complicated way. Of in a more complicated way, also for the other equations, and it can produce a relaxation towards the stationary state or coherent structures. And of course, when it interacts with viscosity, many other things can happen, for example, the appearance of quasi-stationary or metastable states. And this cascading mechanism is also relevant for the derivation of turbulence laws like Komogarov laws in 3D. Komograph laws in 3D and bachelor laws in 2D. We won't talk about that now. However, there is some sort of averaging mechanism in the other equations that can tell us something about the long-term behavior. So there is actually conjecture about what is the long-time behavior to the other, which is formulated by Sverak, and also there is some hints of this in some work of Hillermann. Some work of Hinermann that says that the generic solution to 2DALR, say, on periodic domain, is such that the orbit is not pre-compact enough. So if you think about the mixing as sort of an averaging mechanism, you can think of this if you could prove that all solutions experience some vorticity mixing as time goes to infinity, then this. Goes to infinity, then this rules out pre-compactness. And of course, this is like completely out of the question how to prove this conjecture. We have no idea. But the idea underlying this conjecture is fairly simple, and that's that the solution should converge weakly as time goes to infinity, but not strongly. So you conserve any. It you conserve energy, so sorry, answer in this case, the L2 norm of the vorticity for all times, but in the limit as time goes to infinity, you may decrease the L2 norm and by because of weak convergence. So you may weakly converge, for example, to a steady state or some traveling or like quasi-periodic or periodic solution or something like that. And so one of And so, one of the things that one could try and do is to understand, instead of the global problem, give me an initial data, I tell you where it goes as time goes to infinity, at least understand the dynamics near steady states. So you take a steady state, such as a shear flow or a vortex, vortex, of course, in R2, maybe not in T2, and you try to understand what happens as time goes to infinity. What happens is time goes to infinity when you have a sort of a well-understood structure in the background, such as shear flow. And in a different direction, you can also understand given a steady state, what is the local structure of steady states near it? So what essentially, what do the possible endpoint configurations look like, at least if I start from a At least, if I start from near a well-known steady state, and it turns out that, I mean, these questions are all pretty hard, but what I would like to tell you today is a bit of the last bullet point that essentially does not solve at all this conjecture, but tells you that this conjecture is really, really hard, okay? And this is a a strong evidence of this. Of this. So, regarding Laplace structure of steady states, there is a really nice work by Zhu Wooling and Gong Chen Zhang from Georgia Tech, 2010. So they look at the quad flow. So the quad flow is the simplest sort of steady state that you can think of. It's vorticity equal to minus one or velocity equals to y zero. Okay, this is the simplest shear flow that you can think. The simplest shear flow that you can think of, and you can look near it in some topology. And they looked at it near in the set of solar spaces. And they found that if you look at low regularities, so Hs with S less than three halves, then there are steady states that have this crazy cut-size structure. So essentially, they have non-trivial X dependence. Trivial X depends. So, in particular, near a shear flow like Coette, there are stationary states that are non-shears. Okay, they have a non-trivial X dependence. While if you look in high enough regularity, in this case, H three halves plus, then all solutions near Coette, all steady states near coat are shears. And this is in a periodic channel. Okay, I should say it's not exactly in the setting of the 2D TORS. And so I see this second part of the result as sort of a rigidity result in a sense. So the steady state determines all the structure of the settled steady states near it as well. Near a shear flow, there are only ships. And these sort of ideas came also from other directions, such as in this paper by Schaefluenz Verac. In this paper by Chaufluenz Verac, in which they proved that in an annulus, in an avus of some non-degenerate steady states, there can only be non-degenerate steady states. And explaining non-degenerate is a bit hard at this slide, but I will tell you later exactly what they meant when you talk about the common flow. And also another result by Konstantin Trivers and Gilsberg also says that near Arnold. Also says that near are not stable steady states that are non-degenerate, it success, they are only non-degenerate, are not stable states. So these are sort of rigidity results in a sense. And so let me write down now the other equations near a shear flow and just explore a bit these concepts of the generals. So the shear flow is The shear flow is a velocity field of this form. They only depend on one variable in the first component. And if you write down u double grad omega by perturbing the velocity by both ratio and the vorticity by corresponding to this shear flow by a little omega, you get this equation. So you get the linearization, you know, shear flow plus the non-linear quantity. Okay, so this is much just my. So, this is just my terminology. It's not really anything that was widely accepted. But for the purpose of this talk, I will think that U is locally degenerate if it has a simple critical point. So it has some point at which the first derivative vanishes, but the second derivative is, say, positive. And then there is also another degeneracy that one could think of, which we think of as a more global type of degeneracy. Global type of degeneracy, that is a degeneracy of the linear operator here. So the linear operator, the kernel of this linear operator, is definitely made of x-independent function. There is just a dx here that hits everything. So if you have a function that only depends on y, that's definitely the kernel. But there could be more. And if there are more elements of the kernel, then we'll just inform and say that the kernel is big and there is a global degeneracy. Okay, so there is not only shear flows. So, there is not only shear flows in the kernel of the linear exploratory. And what I want to explore today is a bit what is the role of degeneracy in the local structure of steady states. So, just to give you three examples to keep in mind, the quack flow is non-degenerate in either sense. It's just, I guess, I just switch into from u to v, but to yeah, to v, but I meant the little u before. So, v or y equal to y is. Before. So v of y equal to y is monotone, and the linearized operator will contain x independent functions. The Poisson flow y square is, of course, locally degenerate. It has a critical point. But it turns out that thanks to the convexity of y square, the linearized operator only contains x-independent functions. And then there is the common guarantee. And then there is the Komagara flow, which is the main topic of this talk. And it's just the simplest possible steady state that you can have on T2, right? On a doubly periodic domain. And it is both locally and globally degenerate. Well, it has a critical point. But also, if you write down the linearized operator, you can see that sine x and cosine x are also in the kerman, not just. Also, in the kernel, not just the functions of y. And notice that this happens only on a rectangular torus. Sorry, only on a square torus. It does not happen on a rectangular torus. Sine x and cosine x are not in the kernel of one plus Laplacian inverse in a rectangular torus as long as you don't take a trivial one, meaning a copy of your square torus. Okay, so that's that's what this. That's what this says. So, this is the case I want to focus today the most. And so, why is the Komogura flow a steady state? For two reasons. One is that it is a shear flow. So, simply u dot grad omega is zero. However, it's also a steady state because it satisfies this form of the steady Euler equation. So I'm just writing u as the gradient perk of psi and omega as the Laplacian of Psi. And so it is one of those steady states for which the Laplacian of the string function satisfies, sorry, the string function satisfies this semilinar elliptic problem. In the simplest possible case, when f is just a linear function, F is just a linear function, and in fact, it is just the first eigenfunction, the Laplace. So, one could try, well, that's what we were thinking for a long time is, well, there is a steady state that is a steady state because it's a shear. So there is a shear manifold, if you like, and there is an eigenfunctions manifold. And the Skomungar flow sits exactly at the intersection of the two. Sits exactly at the intersection of the two, can we make some non-trivial stationary states appear out of this sort of vague, very vague idea? But anyways, so that's sort of where the motivation of this work came from. And so for the Kongara flow, as I said, this is the simplest possible case of this type of steady solution. So the result. So, the result that I will talk about today is the following. So, there exists a family of stream functions indexed by some epsilon small that are analytic and some right-hand sides that are analytic as well, such that these three conditions happen. So, let me just tell you what this is. Well, one just says that they are all solutions to the other equations because they satisfy. Equations because they satisfy some semi-linear elliptic problem. The second condition is really important. It tells you that they are close to the Kolmogorov flow. So cosine y is just the Kolmogorov flow stream function in analytic regularity. So if you remember, there was this theorem of Lin and Zhang that tells you that near coet, you can have some differences. Differences whether you work in low and high regularity, but here we just take infinite regularity and it doesn't matter because we can find solutions that are near the Komogur flow that are non-trivial. So they have some sort of strange structure that is not just X dependence because we have the cosine X that would just give us a trivial X dependent shear flow, but it will But it will be something that contains a non-trivial mode. So, in this case, we computed the one-four mode. And this entity is important because it tells you that this contribution cannot be cancelled out by other higher-order terms. So, it turns out that f epsilon is just a polynomial of degree five. And so, if you are in H2, you know by lipid irregularity that you will. You know by linked irregularity that you will be analytic. However, you have to quantify in terms of epsilon the analyticity. So that's where the non-trivial part comes from. But the point of this theorem, again, summarized in the last bullet, is that these families of solutions are non-trivial in the sense they are not in the kernel of the linearized operator near Komung or flow. Okay, and this can be done exactly because we have Exactly because we have this global degeneracy. So I will try to tell you next how. So we can compute explicitly this solution and you see that well you have the Kombara part and epsilon part that is what it is but the cosine X plus some shears so this doesn't count for our purposes but at epsilon square we get this Epsilon square, we get this non-trivial mode. And also, well, we just found the family solutions, but many such families do exist. So, one trivial way to find more is by modifying f epsilon at order epsilon square. This will not change the epsilon square order. It will only change at the epsilon cube order. And so, those are all the different steady states. So, if I write down the problem for the quintic polynomial. problem for the quintic polynomial that I chose is this one in the end that I oops I sorry so when I'm at this in this in this problem so what I'm doing I am simply perturbing the Komogar flow by an epsilon psi and the right hand side of the Komogar right hand side by an epsilon f and I write down By an epsilon f, and I write down the problem for epsi, and I would like to find solutions to this equation. So, in the end, really the problem that I want to study is this elliptic problem here. So, why am I allowed to add cosine x? Well, because I have a kernel in the left-hand side. So, cosine x is part of the kernel of Laplacian plus one. And so, adding it to Plus one and so adding it to psi doesn't change things. So this is sort of an advantage that we have by working with global degeneracy because you see I'm also already creating some X dependency on the right side. But of course this comes at the price that I'm going to have to invert an operator with kernels. And so I'll have to have some compatibility conditions. I cannot just invert it here. And if you remember all the non-degeneracy conditions that I mentioned, Degeneracy conditions that they mentioned from the papers of Sverak and Konstantin, they write down some analytic problem and then the left-hand side, the operator in the left-hand side is assumed to be invertible for their purposes. But here we're sort of pushing this in this against this and try to find something which has a non-trivial kernel. So this operator obviously is. So, this operator obviously is not operating. So, if I write down my quintic polynomial, I don't know why it is like skipped, I can write down the problem that I have to solve explicitly, which is here. So, and you see already what the problem is. You see cosine y is in the kernel of Laplacian plus one. So, I have to make sure that I choose A and B correctly so that the coefficient coming of cosine y here. Coming of cosine y here is zero. And the same here for cosine x. I have to make sure that the constant term coming from here is also zero. And so on. And this at every level of epsilon is like this. And of course, the Soviet conditions are just testing the right-hand side by the kernel of Laplacian plus one. So they can be written like this. Um let's uh okay so uh the the idea is then to set up a contraction uh argument. So the argument will be in H2 and as I mentioned I will only take even functions in x and y so I only deal with cosines instead of with cosines and sines and the solvability conditions. And the solvability conditions can be satisfied with certain coefficients that appear in the two by two system that they have are small. So this condition that looks strange comes out naturally when you write down the solvability conditions. And the point is that you can inductively find all these coefficients in terms of power series in epsilon and in terms of coefficients that depend on psi that are Lipschitz in L2. That are leap sheets in L2, and the A0 ones are leaf sheets with a small constant in H2, in fact. It's important that this H2, but I don't have time to explain why, but it relates to computing the H minus 2 norm of certain functions that is much smaller than their L to norm. So in the end, to close the contraction, I would like to use this information. While I don't care about what the Well, I don't care about what the Lipschitz constant is of A1 and B1 and so on because they are multiplied by epsilon anyway, so there is no problem. Okay, so now the contraction, the mapping for which I want to find the fixed point is precisely the right-hand side that I had there, where I hit it with the inverse of one plus Laplacian, which is fine now because I have ensured the compatibility. I have ensured the compatibility conditions. And so, in the end, I want to skip this because I think I'm running a bit out of time. And I want to just tell you what are the consequences of the results, but it's a matter of closing a contraction argument for this map, K epsilon. So, what are the consequences of these results on the dynamics? I will only mention the ones for Euler. For either, there are some consequences also for the Navier-Stokes problem, but I decided just to keep it on the other equations. So if you look at the dynamical problem, the dynamical problem of perturbation near a Komoga flow looks like this. You have a linearized operator, the non-linearity here. And the idea is that if you start with an initial Start with an initial data omegas, it's true that you converge somewhere in this weak sense, hence confirming this conjecture, for example, that I mentioned at the beginning. And if you neglect the non-linearity, this is true. So there is what is called linear MVC damping, which is a more precise version of vorticity mixing, essentially, that I mentioned before. So it just says that if you look away from the kernel of the linearized operator, then the vorticity weakly converges to zero in this case. And weakly, it's quantified in fact by an H minus one moment of distance. And the idea is that can I extend this result per term? That can extend this result perturbatively, at least trying to prove this conjecture for solutions near the Komogaro flow. And what we're saying is that this result cannot be extended protractively. So you cannot say that if you start away from the kernel, non-linearly, all the projection of the kernel. The projection of the modes away from the kernel will vanish because if you just perturb, even if you perturb in analytic regularity, you may just hit one of the stationary states that we have, and so you won't move from there. So, this is nowhere near solving the conjecture, but it says that the dynamics of 2DL on the square torus, even near a simple stationary state, is very hard because you could hit stationary. Because you could hit stationary states, you could be trapped for a long time near stationary states, and who knows where you will go in terms of asymptotic dynamics. There is some interesting features also of, in fact, just the set and the local structure of the set of the steady states near Komogorov, because you see, we had some projection on. Some projection onto the kernel that looked like cosine x plus cosine of three y and so on. And you may think that this just gives a direction on which you can find stationary state. And is it true that you can just look at any directions? And the answer is no, in the sense that if you look in a direction, for example, given by sine of Ly plus cosine x, just such a simple shear, it turns out that if you're close enough to Are you close enough to the Komoga flow? You won't be able to find any stationary solution for the two equations. So, in a sense, if you think of the manifold of steady states near Komogarov, it's somewhat irregular, right? There are some directions in which you do have stationary steady state, and some other directions in which this manifold would not be differentiable, for example, because of this result. This only applies for the square tars, and this is just saying that the global degeneracy is really important because, in fact, if you only look at this rectangular Taurus case, you can prove that if you are a steady state that is close enough to the Kolmogorov velocity, then the solution. Then the solution has to be necessarily shearful. So, in this case, you have some rigidity result that is exactly of the type Lin and Zhang for the white particles. And so, with this, I think I'm done, and I want to
