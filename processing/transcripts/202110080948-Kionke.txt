The next and last talk is given by Stefan Kionka, and the title is Profinite Rigidity of Lattices in Higher Rank Lead Groups. Yes, thank you for the chance to speak here. Being the last speaker, I also want to use the opportunity to thank the organizers for this very interesting workshop, which I enjoyed. interesting workshop, which I enjoyed very much. And thank you for putting the efforts. Good. So I want to talk about lattices and higher rank Lie groups and a version of pro-finite rigidity. And in fact, my title is a bit misleading. So there will be a lot less rigidity. Most of the things I want to speak about are the opposite of rigidity. But then at the end, some rigid things. The end, some rigid things will come up. And everything I say is based on joint work with Holger Kamaya. Okay, so let me start with a bit of background from group theory. So if you have a group, say an infinite group, and you want to study this group, then of course the groups we know best are the finite groups. And so it's tempting to study infinite groups using finite groups. And so the natural question which So, the natural question which occurs is: So, given the group, what can you say about it if you know all of its finite quotient groups? And of course, I mean, the universe of groups is really huge, so you shouldn't take all groups into consideration because, for instance, there are groups which don't have any non-trivial finite quotients. So, think of the additive group of the rational numbers or something like this. So, in this talk, I want to consider finitely generated. Want to consider finitely generated residually finite groups. So, what does this mean? It means that it's a group where you can see every non-trivial element being mapped non-trivially to some finite quotient. And okay, so it's not so important for us, though. The important thing to note is that finitely generated linear groups are residually finite. Finite. And I essentially only want to talk about linear groups today. Okay, so let's take another look at this thing. So there's a well-known construction. If you have a finitely generated residually finite group, you can look at all finite quotients of the group. They form an inverse system and you take the inverse limit. That's the pro-finite completion of the group. And you can equip. And you can equip these finite groups with the discrete topology, and then you get a compact and totally disconnected topological group. It's a compact and totally disconnected group. And the assumption of residually finiteness will allow you to think in a natural way that this group gamma you have is a dense subgroup of gamma. Subgroup of gamma hat. Okay, so here's a very simple example. Probably everyone knows. So the pro-finite completion of the infinite cyclic group is the inverse limit over all finite cyclic groups. And using the Chinese remainder theorem, you can see that this will be isomorphic to the product overall p of the rings of p-iadic integers. Okay, so that's an object we know very well. Very well. And so we could formulate the question differently. So, what do we know about a group if we know its pro-finite completion? And this question was studied a lot, and it was inspired or fueled in the 70s by a question of Grotendieek. And so let me start with a very simple example to make this clear. So groups can be non-isomorphic, but their profile completions become isomorphic. Completions become isomorphic. So, here's a very simple example. So, we have two groups which look very much the same. They are semi-direct products of a group with 11 element and an infinite cyclic group. In the first example, the one of this infinite cyclic group acts as multiplication with two on this 11 element group. And in the other example, it acts like multiplication with eight. Like multiplication with eight on this set mod 11. And then it's not so difficult to see that these groups are not isomorphic. And the reason is that this group Z doesn't have a lot of automorphisms. It has the identity and minus the identity, and that's it. But when you pass to the profiner completion, what you get is exactly what you would expect here. It's a semi-direct product of a Here, it's a semi-direct product of an 11-element group with Z hat, and this will be isomorphic to the profiner completion of gamma 2, exactly for the reason that this profiner completion here, Z hat, has a lot of automorphisms. So you can work this out as a nice exercise. So it's the point I want to make is they are very simple groups which cannot be distinguished using profiler completion. Pro-finite completion. Okay, but then there's the opposite phenomenon. So I want to say that a finitely generated residually finite group is pro-finitely rigid. If whenever you have a finite degenerated residually finite group delta with isomorphic pro-finite completion, then it's already isomorphic to gamma. And okay, a priori, it's not clear that rigid groups exist. Clear that rigid groups exist, but of course, all I mean, all finite groups are rigid. And in addition, all finitely generated abelian groups are pro-finitely rigid. This is not difficult to check because you can see from the pro-finite completion if the group was abelian, and you assume it's finitely generated, and then you can figure out the torsion part and the free part. But now comes something that is more surprising. That is more surprising and that is a recent development from the work of Brightson, McReynolds, Reed, and Spittler. They were able to prove that some other groups are profinitely rigid in this sense. For instance, they proved that the group PSL2 over the ring of Eisenstein integers is profinitely rigid. This means you can recognize this group uniquely if you know the If you know the finite quotients, which is surprising. And in addition, they were able to prove that some arithmetic triangle groups, I didn't list all of them, it's about 20 or something, are profinitely rigid in this sense. And this is not easy. And it's not, the result doesn't in some form extend to, I don't know, all Bianchi groups or something like this. It's really something. Something like this. It's really something where you have to have a very specific situation of the numbering involved. Okay. And so why is that interesting? Maybe also from the perspective of group theory, because there's a very big open problem in group theory, which says, is the free group on two generators profinitely rigid? So, I mean, the free group is a very natural thing. So you would hope to be able to recognize it by the Able to recognize it by the finite quotients, but it's unknown so far. But the free group is a lattice in SL2R, and so are these groups. And this is a lattice or in PSL2 over the complexes. So there's kind of a similarity between these groups and free groups. Okay, so now what do we see here is something that looks like, oh, maybe it's something about lattices in rank one Lie group. Lattices in rank one Lie groups. So, and you could be courageous and ask: Is it true that lattices in simple Lie groups of rank one are profinitely rigid? But this is not true. It's not a general rank one phenomenon. And there's a counterexample given by Stover in 2019. He was able to construct two lattices in PUN1, projective unitary group, which have isomorphic profiler completions. Isomorphic profiler completions, but they are non-commensurable. So they are not isomorphic, but being non-commensurable is something stronger. So let me recall that two groups are commensurable if gamma and delta have isomorphic subgroups of finite index. So, in a sense, they are very much. So, if they are not commensurable, then they are very much not isomorphic, but still their profile completions are isomorphic. Okay, so this is the rank one story. And there are some conjectures about the rigidity of fundamental groups of arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifolds. So, this is a very different direction. So, the question I want to discuss. So, the question I want to discuss: okay, this is like this rank one situation where things are difficult. So, what can you say about the higher rank situation? So, you're looking at lattices in simple or semi-simple groups of higher rank. And this has already been studied by Manny Aka in 2012. And he essentially has a technique to construct examples of such groups which are profinitely isomorphic. Groups, which are pro-finitely isomorphic, but not commensurable. And, like, the starting point for what I want to talk about is: we wanted to understand this idea better and see how flexible it really is. Okay, so, but what is the advantage you have in this higher rank situation? In the higher rank situation, you have the congruent subgroup property. And so an error. And so, an arithmetic group has the congruent subgroup property, and I'm cheating a little bit here, but if every finite index subgroup contains a principal congruence subgroup. So, okay, first of all, what is an arithmetic group? I will do it in the same way as Jean. I will not give you the precise definition, but it's a subgroup of some GLD over the integers. And of course, for GLD, you can... And of course, for GLD, you can reduce the matrices modulo M for all M. And the kernel is called the principal congruent subgroup gamma m. And we say that this group gamma has the congruent subgroup property if every finite index subgroup contains such a principal congruent subgroup. It's a bit cheating. You have to be a bit more careful with the definition, but let's think in this definition. So the non-examples are precise. The non-examples are precisely the rank one things. It's like SL2Z, SL2ZI, SL2Z omega. They don't have this property, but for instance, SLNZ for N at least 3 has this property. And it's a conjecture of SAR that in higher rank, you always have this property. It's known in many cases, but not in all. So, but let's see why this congruence subgroup property is helpful. It tells us that. It tells us that if we look at, say, SL3 over the integers and we want to compute the pro finite completion, then here it tells us that we can see every finite quotient by reducing modulo sum m. And so you can reformulate it and say that this profiner completion will be isomorphic to SL3 over the profiner completion of Z hat. And this is something we know very well. It's a product. Something we know very well. It's a product over SL3 over all rings of piadic integers. And so this congruent subgroup property gives us a very elegant way to explicitly compute the profile completion. Okay. So with this in mind, I can now give you a concrete example of lattices in higher rank, which are In higher rank, which are not commensurable but have isomorphic profiliner completions. So, for instance, you can take the field K, which is Q adjoint eighth root of seven. And you take the field L, which is Q adjoint square root of two times eighth root of seven. And then you take the rings of integers, OK and OL, and you take, say, SL3 over these. These are lettuces in SL3 over the complexes four times, okay? Complexes four times. Okay. And so, why do these groups have isomorphic profiler completions? It's a result of Komatsu from 1978 that these two fields are adelically equivalent. So it means their rings of adeles are isomorphic. Or put differently, there's a bijection between the prime ideals in OK and the prime ideals in OL, such that the completion Such that the completion of OK at P is isomorphic to the completion of OL at F of P. That's a strange phenomenon, but now with what we just said, you see that, for instance, if you take SL3OK and you compute the profinite completion, we can do the same trick mentioned above. We can take the profinite completion of this ring OK, and this will be, as before, a product overall prime idea. Before a product overall prime ideals SL3OKP, and then doing the same thing backwards, reordering the places, we come to the profiner completion of SL3OL. Okay, so you see it's a number theoretic phenomenon that you have these atylically equivalent fields and you can use them to get interesting groups. Okay, now I have to tell you why these. Okay, now I have to tell you why these groups are not commensurable. I mean, it might be that they are isomorphic, but they are not. And the way to prove this is Margulis' super rigidity. So let me give you a formulation of Magulis result, which is very convenient for what I want to do next. So you take a field K, which is the real or the complex numbers, and you have a linear algebraic group over K, which is connected. Over k, which is connected and absolutely almost simple and of rank at least two. And then Magulis, so you can think of SL3 if you want. And Magulis has the following result. If you look at lattices in G of R up to commensurability, then these are in bijection with triples up to isomorphism. And what do I mean with a triple? And what do I mean with a triple? So here k is a number field, and this v naught is a k place of k. So it's a real or complex place, depending on how you have chosen this fat k. But what is h? H is an algebraic group over k. So h is an algebraic An algebraic and say simply connected, whatever this means, k group with two properties. The first is that if you have H and you plug in the completion of K at this chosen place V naught, then this is almost G. So this is, say, eisen genius to G of K. So we have this. Okay, so we have this Lie group, and we get a group which, up to maybe a map with a finite kernel, looks like this group. And for all other real places or for all other Archimedean places, this is compact for all V Archimedean place of K with V different from V naught. And if it's compact, then it has to be a And if it's compact, then it has to be a real place, so there cannot be a complex place anymore. So, what does this mean? So, or what is this map? What is this bijection? So, if you have a situation like this, a number field, a place where this number field is not compact and it's compact at all other real places, then you can take the arithmetic subgroups of H. I mean, the arithmetic subgroups are all commensurable, so they define a All commensurable, so they define a commensurability class of lattices in G of R. So the map here is take arithmetic subgroups, and Margulis' arithmeticity says this map is surjective, and Magula's super-rigidity says this map is injective. Okay, so we can now think of lattices just in terms of these triples. And when do we say that two triples are isomorphic? It's the obvious notion of isomorphism. So the number fields are isomorphic. So, the number fields are isomorphic, and the isomorphism between the number fields maps the designated place to the designated place, and these algebraic groups are isomorphic. Okay, so now what we want to do is we want to replace here on the left-hand side commensurability with pro-finite commensurability, and then ask what do we have to do on this side. So, to give you the definition, to make it formal, I want to say that two lattices are profinitely commensurable if their profinite completions are commensurable. So they have opens subgroups which are isomorphic. And then you can use the result of Margulis to prove the following. So, and here's one assumption that I want to state. You have to assume that arithmetically You have to assume that arithmetic lattices in G of K have the congruent subgroup property. By Sears' conjecture, this should be true, but it's not known in all cases. But okay, so modulo this assumption. You can take on this left-hand side pro-finite commensurability, and then you get on the other side triples modulo another notion of isomorphism, which we call local isomorphism. And what does it mean? And what does it mean? It means that two triples are locally isomorphic if there's an isomorphism between their adele rings, which takes the designated places to the designated places, okay? And an isomorphism of group schemes. So if you take these algebraic groups, you extend scalars to the Adele rings, then there's an isomorphism between these lying over this isomorphism. So it's a funny thing. So in a sense, So, it's a funny thing. So, in a sense, you can just replace everything, you can replace the number fields with the Adele rings, and you get the right thing. And okay, let me just indicate how you proved this. So, the surjectivity of the map you have here is still Magula's arithmeticity. So, lettuces are still arithmetic. You get everything in this form. But to get the injectivity, we had to prove some sort of a Delic. Adalic super-rigidity statement, which is not surprising, but is a bit technical. So that's why I don't want to say a lot about it now. Okay, so this is just, okay, we now have this theoretical framework. Yes, we know that if you want to study lattices in a simple Lie group of higher rank, we can think in terms of these triples, which is a very algebraic thing. Okay, but it doesn't. Okay, but it doesn't answer, of course, existence questions. And so the existence question we are interested in is: okay, give me any simple Lie group of higher rank. Can I always find two lattices which are not commensurable but profinitely commensurable? So, can we always produce such examples? And with the theoretical background described, it amounts to: can we always find To can we always find triples which are locally isomorphic but not isomorphic? Okay, and there comes a point which is kind of annoying. So this adylic equivalence of fields, so number fields with isomorphic adyl rings, which are not isomorphic, so where the fields are not isomorphic. This is something I have the impression is poorly understood. So there are some families of examples. There are some families of examples, but apart from that, it's not really clear if there's some sort of a theory of when you would expect fields to be idyllically equivalent or anything. So if you want to produce such examples, the strategy is not to produce idyllically equivalent fields just because there's very little known about this. So we just restrict it to saying, okay, let's take the same field. Okay, let's take the same field. Okay, let's take the same field. Then essentially what you have to do, you have to look at the classification of algebraic groups over number fields or over fields. So how do you classify? Say we have the first thing in the triple. Then we can classify all algebraic groups. These are the forms of this group over the number field using Galois cohomology of the absolute Galois group of values in the automorphism group of H. Group of H. And what, how do we classify like these local things? So the idelic things, you take the product over all places and use Galwako homology for the local field with values in out age. But now comes the, so this map has been studied a lot. But we have an additional thing we can do here. We have this isomorphism of adele rings. Of adele rings, which is not supposed to preserve places. So we are allowed to permute places whenever at these places we have the same completion of the number field. So let me write it like this. So this group omega, which acts here, is the group of all, say, permutations pi in, so these are permutations of all places of the number field, which number field which have the property that if pi of v is v prime then the completion at v is the completion at v prime or isomorphic to okay and for some fields say if you think of about the field of rational numbers then there are no permutations allowed but for other fields you will always find like you have a large field extension of q Large field extension of q, you take a prime which is completely split, and then you can permute these places in any way you like. Okay, so as I said, this first map has been studied a lot, and the point is that it's injective in, I would say, many cases, let's say. So it's injective if If the group we're looking at, so this say G, this is the Lie group we're looking at, we want to construct the lattices in, is not of type AN, DN or E6. And the reason is that these are the Dinkin diagrams which have automorphisms. And if you have no automorphisms of the Dinkin diagram, then the automorphism group is just the adjoint group and there's the The adjoint group, and there's the Hasse principle for adjoint groups tells you that this map is injective. So, we want, recall what we want: we want to have two classes here, which are distinct, but become the same class, have the same image down here. And so, this map will, in general, not be helpful. So, the only thing we can do is some form of permuting places. And so, like summing up a very small Like summing up a very special case of what I just said, if the field is Q and you are not in these types, then this is always injective. So as a corollary of what I just said, you have a nice geometric statement, namely you have a real Lie group which is not of type A and D and or E6. Then every non-compact, non-co-compact lattice is profinitely solitary. Profinitely solitary, but what I mean, if you have a lattice which is profinitely commensurable, then it's already commensurable. So what is the point here? The point is that a non-co-convect lattice is always defined over the underlying number field is always Q. And then what I just said suffices. So the interesting thing for me is that I would like to know if this I would like to know if this really fails in these cases. Okay, for E6, okay, there's some problem with the congruent subgroup property here, anyway. But apart from that, so we can show that the statement is not true for the groups SLNR, SLNC, or SLN over the quaternions, if n is composite and at least six. So this is a bit it's Is a bit it's good to know that it's not a very general thing, but the answer is a bit unsatisfying because you have this condition of n being composite. So, and I don't really know if this is necessary. So I would be interested to know what happens for SLP where p is a prime number. But let me maybe say one word about why this composite occurs here. So you can construct these lattices in these groups. This is in these groups using central norm one groups in central simple algebras. And the construction we have is a trick where you take the tensor product of a central simple algebra with another central simple algebra, and then doing the same thing where you take the tensor product of the first with the opposite of the second algebra. And because you take this tensor product, this forces this n here to be composite. And we don't know a way. And we don't know a way to produce such examples without taking the tensor product of two central simple algebras. So I think there's here's something to think about how one could produce such examples. Okay, but let's, this was just an excursion. Let's return to the question. So the question was: given a simple Lie group of higher rank, can I also? Rank, can I always find two lattices which are not commensurable but profinitely commensurable? And I want to, so in most cases, it's possible. This will be the result. And I want to sketch the proof of one case so that you see what kind of methods come into play. So in the case I want to sketch, so say G is a real Lie group, say simply connected. loop, say simply connected and not of these types A and D and R E6. This is always the good case. What we do is we take a totally real number field of degree D, which is large, say at least five, and has a trivial automorphism group. And we fix one finite place of this field. This will be where we move all the problems to this field. So and then a theorem of So, and then a theorem of Prasat and Rapinchuk tells us that we can find simply connected k-groups for each real place V, which have the property that at the place V, we get the group G R we started with. And at all the other places, we get compact groups. So, there's only one compact group. Let's call it Gu. So, this is not the interesting part. This is clear. But then the result tells us that we can even achieve. us that we can even achieve that these groups are isomorphic at all finite places except possibly this w naught so we can move all the problems into one place okay and we don't know what happens at this place w naught but the point is it's a finite place and kneza classified algebraic groups over periodic fields and in fact in these In these, if you're not of type a n, then there are always at most four isomorphism classes. And so, if we take a field of degree at least five, then we have at least five groups here. And for by Dirichlet's box principle, two of them will have, will also be isomorphic at this finite place W0. And of course, I mean, increasing the degree of this field, you can now get arbitrarily many such examples. examples so you see it's it's in principle you could work this out but it's kind of it's kind of unpleasant that there's this final non-constructive step which would in in practice force you to try several options until you find a concrete example okay so here's the result we ended up with so if you have a simple lead group So if you have a simple Lie group of higher rank, which is not locally isomorphic to SL2n plus 1R, SL2n plus 1C, or SLN over the quaternions, is not of type E6, and not a complex simple group of these exceptional types E8, F4, G2, then you can find non-commensurable co-compact lattices which have isomorphic profiner completions. Completions. And the proof is really a bit unpleasant because, okay, here's a general argument for some cases, but in all the other cases, you have to vary the ideas a bit to make it work. And then in addition, you have the problem that the congruent subgroup problem is not solved in all cases. So you have to be careful to stay with the groups where you know it's true. And so the point is. And so the point is that these first two are not our fault. The groups we would have to take are not known to have the congruent subgroup property. Okay, so if the congruent subgroup property holds in higher rank as Ser conjecture, then you can remove these two. So this is not our fault. Somebody else has to do it. So what with these three complex Lie groups? Why are they? Complex Lie groups? Why are they there? Is it our fault? And the answer is no. And for these three, and this is like the rigidity statement I want to point out, it's really false. So we have the following result. If you have a complex Lie group of these three exceptional types, E8, F4, or G2, and whenever you have two lattices in these groups, when they are profinitely commensurable, then they are commensurable. So, what I want to do in the last, I don't know, eight minutes of my talk, I want to explain to you why, how to prove this. So, in the first step is a theorem which we proved and then realized that it already existed. So, it's a theorem of Schinberg, Hamilton, Long, and Reed, which was published in 2008. And the statement is that whenever you have two number fields, Whenever you have two number fields with exactly one complex placed, then if these are adaptally equivalent, they are already isomorphic. And in fact, so you need less than adaptic equivalence. It's sufficient if they are arithmetically equivalent. And this means that they are dead. And this means that their Dedekind CETA functions are equal. Okay, so this is so let's pass on to the sketch of the proof. So we have this complex group of type E8, F4, or G2. And we want to show that two triples, as stated in very early, which are locally isomorphic, are already isomorphic. Already isomorphic. And so, by this result of Chinberg, Hamilton, Long, and Reed, just mentioned, we can directly deduce that the number fields involved are equal. They are not just idelically equivalent. And then there's a special thing which, if you have a complex Lie group, then the number field you're working with has exactly one complex place, because at all the other Archimedean places, you need to have compact groups, and they don't exist over the complex numbers. complex numbers so and this means v naught is v0 prime it's the unique complex place so there's no chance to worry something here okay so we have to go back to this diagram in the very beginning so what is the important or what is the nice thing about these exceptional types the point is that the automorphism group of these groups are the groups themselves so these groups are adjoined and simply connected at the same time and so And so, what you have here is the non-abelian Galois homology with values in H, which is a simply connected group. And you look at this Hussein map into the product overall local Galwa cohomology groups. And like this main Hussein, the Husse principle for simply connected groups tells you that you can even forget the finite places. So already this map. Already, this map into the product of all Archimedean places will be an isomorphism. Or, in other words, these groups have no forms over the periodic places. And now, okay, we're left with the Archimedean places, and we cannot permute anything because, so this complex place is fixed. And at all the other places, which are real, we have to have this unique compact group. So, there's no way to permute something, and in turn, you can. Mute something, and in turn, you can conclude that actually these triples are already isomorphic. So, the point I want to make is that in this, so we had this small rigidity theorem for non-compact lattices, and we have this rigidity theorem here for these exceptional complex groups. So, there are always two ingredients, and like the second ingredient is always you have to do something with Galwak homology, but this has been studied. Homology, but this has been studied a lot, and there are a lot of techniques. So, this is not the thing I'm which I think is the surprising part. The surprising part is these rigidity statements about number fields, I think. So let's say that a number field is idelically rigid. If whenever you have an idyllically equivalent field, you can conclude that it's already isomorphic. And I only know three very small. only know three very small criteria to decide whether a number field is idyllically rigid. So it's known that a field which is galois over Q is idyllically rigid. It's known that field extensions of small degree are idyllically rigid. And then there's this result of, I just mentioned, that number fields with one complex place are idyllically rigid. And so I think that improved And so I think that in principle, I think it's possible that there are more rigidity theorems like for these exceptional groups and so on out there. But in order to prove something like this, we would need new criteria for a Delic rigidity of number fields. So if somebody has a good idea here, I would be interested. And also because there are people doing computation. And also, because there are people doing computations here, I know this database of number fields, and there are some, I mean, they check for arithmetic equivalence, but I didn't find a way to check for idelic equivalence, which seems to be more complicated. So if somebody has, for whatever reasons, nice examples of idyllically equivalent fields, I would also be interested in learning about that. Good. I think so that's all I prepared. So thank you. That's all I prepared, so thank you for the attention. Okay, let's thank Stefan for his talk. Do we have any questions for the speaker? Okay. In that case, let's thank the speaker again. And that concludes our meeting. So thanks. Everybody should thank themselves for participating and giving so many great talks. It's been a great conference. Really sorry we couldn't be together. Conference. Really sorry we couldn't be together in person. Would have been a lot of fun. It's always fun to, especially because you can build a fire at Banff year-round. There's like unlimited wood and unlimited matches. So that's always a lot of fun. Maybe I'm the only one that enjoys that. I don't know. Okay. Well, thanks to all. Thank you. To all, thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the nice conference. Yeah, thanks. It was nice to meet you again, Ling. Yes, it is nice. But it would be see you in person in the future. Yes, I think so. Hopefully, very soon. Bye. Bye. I enjoy your talk. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I need to for you too bad. Too bad.
