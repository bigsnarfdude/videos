Take it away, Priya. Thank you, Darian. Okay, so it's nice to see everyone after FMCS 2019. So good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to thank the organizers for this opportunity to present my work at this meeting. And this is joint work with my supervisor, Robin Cockett. And in this talk, I would be presenting exponential modalities and complementarity. Exponential modalities and complementarity and the connections between them. Okay, so let's first talk a little bit about exponential modalities. Linear logic treats logical statements as resources which cannot be duplicated or destroyed. So linear logic is a resource-sensitive logic. However, linear logic accommodates non-linear types using exponential modalities. So there are two exponential modalities in There are two exponential modalities in linear logic, which is the bang written as the exclamation mark, and it's also called as the of course operator, and then the question mark, which is read as the why not or the whimper operator. And what does these operators mean is that for any resource A, bank A refers to an infinite supply of resource A. So we can extract a resource A from this infinite. Resource A from this infinite supply zero or more number of times. And WIMPER A represents the notion of infinite demand of that resource. So Bang is used as a de facto structure to model arbitrary dimensional spaces in physics, such as bosonic Fox spaces. And also, Bang, the supply could be duplicated or destroyed. So, this is about the exponential. So, this is about the exponential modalities. And the other part of this work is complementarity in quantum mechanics. So, in quantum mechanics, a quantum observable refers to a measurable property of the quantum system. So, it's a measurable quantity. And a pair of quantum observables are complementary if measuring one observable increases the uncertainty regarding the value of the other. So, this complementary. So, this complementarity principle is by Bohr. And a classic example of complementary observable is the position and momentum of an electron. So, knowing the position increases uncertainty regarding the momentum and vice versa. In this work, the question we asked is: if there is a connection between exponential modalities of linear logic and complementary And complementary observables of quantum mechanics. They seem unrelated, but what we found is: yes, there is a connection between these two ideas. And in this talk, I'll be presenting at how we arrived at this answer, an overview of how we arrived at this answer. So, let me introduce the mathematical framework in which we studied this problem. Okay, so first we consider So, first, we considered linearly distributive categories. Linearly distributive categories provide a categorical semantics for linear logic. So, in these categories, there are two tensor products, which is called like, so the blue one is called the tensor and the red one is called the power. And these two tensor products are linked by a linear distributor. So, this is a left distributor, and there is a right distributor as well. Right distributor as well. So these two tensor products represent the multiplicative, conjunction, and disjunction of the linear logic. And these categories are by Cocket and Seeley in 1997. And monoidal categories are a compact version of linearly distributive categories. So monoidal categories are linearly distributive categories in which the tensor and the sorry there's a spelling error tensor and the par product coincide. Power product coincide. So, monoidal categories come with one tensor product. So, in between linearly distributive categories and monoidal categories, there is a series of steps that lead to structural collapse. So, here I have summarized these steps here. So, we start with a linearly distributive category where there are two tensor products. And then a mixed category is a linearly distributive category where Distributive category where there is a map from the bot, like the unit of the power product to the unit of the tensor product. So, this is called as the mix map. And the mix map gives rise to a natural transformation from the tensor to the power. This is called the mixer. So, this the category an LDC with the mix map is called as the mix category. And an isomix category is a mix category where the units are isomorphic. The units are isomorphic. So the units being isomorphic doesn't mean the mixer is isomorphic. So this is an isomix category. And then a compact LDC is where for every pair of objects, the natural transformation mixer is an isomorphism. So basically, this is like a weak, a compact LDC is a weak monoidal category where the tensor and the power are isomorphic to one another. And finally, the monoidal category where these two, the mixer becomes the identity map. So these are the Identity map. So these are the series of structural collapse from a linearly distributive category to a monoidal category. So yeah, so this work is about the exponential modality. So let's see how we model exponential modalities in a linearly distributed category. Again, a Bang-Wimper linearly distributed category consists of a monoidal co-monad. So Bang is modeled as monad so bank is modeled as a monoidal co-monad and for each object a there is a co-commutative co-monoid on bank a oh i missed something yeah bank a and similarly whimper is a monoidal algebra modality and so whimper is a co-monoidal monad and for each a whimper a is a commutative monoid and also bang whimper will be a linear functor will be a linear functor and all these pairs of maps form linear transformations. So this is this forms a bank wimper LTC and this was like this structure was given by Bloatcockett Seeley in 1996. And so an example of Bank Wimper LTC is the category of finiteness relation and also the category of finiteness matrices. So, if we want to study quantum mechanics using category theory, then we do not use linear logic directly, but we move on to dagger linear logic. So, let's see a category which gives a semantics for dagger linear logic. The simpler category is a dagger monoidal category. So, these are monoidal categories which come with a dagger functor, which is a contravariant functor, which is identity on objects. Identity on objects and an involution. And also the dagger behaves well with the tensor product. So this forms a dagomonoidal category. And conventionally, like in the category of Hilbert spaces and linear maps, which is a dagomonoidal category, this is where we study quantum processes. In 2018, like in a joint work with my supervisor Ancole, we Uncole. We presented, we proposed mixed unitary categories as a semantics for non-compact diagonal linear logic. So let me explain what this diagram represents here. So here we have a unitary category which is equivalent to a, for all practical purposes, this can be considered as a dagomonoidal category. And this functor, here is a functor which maps a dagomonoidal category into a larger Category into a larger space called a dagger isomix category. And within this larger space, the dagger is not identity on objects. So the objects are not self-adjoint anymore. So B is different from B dagger. However, in a unitary category, A is isomorphic to A dagger. An example of mixed unitary categories include complex finite matrices embedded into finite matrices. Embedded into finite matrices, finiteness matrices, and finite relations embedded into finiteness relations. And also, given any dagger isomics category, we can extract a canonical unitary category from the dagger isomics category by choosing the pre-unitary objects. So, this is a canonical mug. So, there are multiple examples of mugs already out there. And finally, like Like to study bang and whimper to exponential modalities within dagger linear logic. It's surprisingly simple. So I just copy-pasted the slide two slides ago. So like now we study Bang and Wimper in a dagger LTC. Everything remains the same except that now Bang and Wimper is a dagger linear functor. So it respects the dagger structure. And these pairs which were linear transformations will now become Linear transformations will now behave as dagger linear transformations. And again, the category of finiteness relations and the category of complex finiteness matrices over a commutative rig is an example of a dagger LDC with exponential modalities. Now that I have introduced the framework, so here is a very rough plan of how we arrived at the solution. So what we did is So, what we did is first we formulated measurements in mixed unitary categories, and then we formulated complementary systems in mixed unitary categories. And finally, we provided the connection, we arrived on the theorem proving the connection between exponential modalities and complementary observables. Right, so I will briefly elaborate on each of these. Briefly elaborate on each of these steps. So, step one: measurement in mixed unitary categories. Okay, so let's look. So, here is a mixed unitary category and let's look at the measurement inside the compact part where the dagger coins like where object coincides with its dagger. So, in a dagger monoidal category, a demolition measurement on an object A is a retract from A to a special community. From A to a special commutative dager Frobenius algebra E. So, like, so this structure here, the special commutative dager Frobenius algebra represents a quantum observable. And this map R represents a demolition measurement. And this formulation of measurement was given by Bob Guka and Bisko Pavlovic in 2006 in their paper Quantum Measurements Without Sums. And so this is already the And so, this is already there. But the question we ask is: what about the space outside? Like, what about the non-compact part? How do we measure objects inside this like shaded area where the dagger doesn't coincide with the object? So, for this, so to measure an object outside the unitary core, we have to first compact the object. Have to first compact the object into the core. So, this process we call compaction. So, a compaction in a mixed unitary category is a retraction from the object to an object inside the unitary core. So, this is what we called as a compaction. Hence, a measurement in a mixed unitary category is given by compaction followed by demolition measurement. So, that's how we measure an object in. How we measure an object inside a mixed unitary category. And now, if you notice, like, so giving a retract from B to an okay, so yeah, so here there is, so we can characterize compaction using DAC using something called binary idempotence. So, a binary idempotent is a, so here is the definition of binary idempotent. A binary idempotent consists A binary item potent consists of a pair of maps, so a map U and a map V between any two objects, such that going from A to B through U and going back to A and again going to B through U is same as going from A to B once. So we can keep circling from A to B and arrive at B. It's same as arriving at B using one transformation. So u v u equals u and V u equals u and similarly from B I can keep circling to A and B and so on and again finally arrive at A. It's same as arriving at A through one transformation from B. So V U V equals V. So these kind of transformations gives two idempotents, one on A and one on B, which is U V and V U. And the cool feature of these idempotents is that of these idempotents is that if we split the idempotent on A, sorry, if we split the idempotent on A and split the idempotent on B, the objects that are given by splitting these idempotents are isomorphic to one another. So that's the idea. And we can now add the notion of dagger to these idempotents. So in a dagger LDC, a dagger idempotent is given, is a binary item potentient Given is a binary idem potent that satisfies these extra two conditions. And what these conditions imply is that the idempotent on A, sorry, the idempotent on A dagger is equal to the idempotent given by daggering the idempotent on A. So E A dagger is equal to the idempotent on A dagger. And this is not a two-way implication. So these two conditions imply this condition here. This condition here. So, this is a dagger binary hydropotent. And the theorem that we have is that in a dagger isomics category, if for an object A, U is the canonical compaction of A. So if I have a retract from A into the unitary core to an object U, then if and only if U is given by splitting a coring dagger binary idempotent on A. Binary idempotent on A. So U is given by splitting a coring dagger idempotent on A. And by coring, we mean that this idempotent splits through the core. So that's the idea. And this is how we formulated measurements in MAX. So after formulating measurements, the next step is to formulate complementary systems in the mixed unitary categories. And so in a dapp, so like let's So, let's first see how complementary systems are formulated in dager monoidal categories. So, previously, I mentioned that class like special quantum, sorry, special commutative dager-frobenius algebra represents quantum observables. So, here is how here is how this algebra looks. So, we have a monoid, and the co-monoid is given by daggering the monoid. And here is the Frobenius law. Frobenius law. And finally, this is the special property. And two dagos. So now that we know quantum observables are given by these special commutative dagophrobenius algebras, we can formulate complementarity. So two dagophrobenius algebras are complementary if they interact to produce two Hof algebras. So this idea, like so, this formulation is by Bob Cooker and Ross Duncan. Bob Cooker and Ross Duncan in 2008 in interacting quantum observables. And this kind of formulation led to the famous ZX calculus. So we wanted to use this idea in mixed unitary categories. However, we had to use a general form of Frobenius algebras called linear monoid. So it's in a sense, linear monoid is simpler than Frobenius algebra. It's just a monoid and the object has And the object has a dual, right? And by this duality, like we get a co-monoid structure on B, like with the co-multiplication and the co-unit as follows. And a self-linear monoid is a linear monoid where A is isomorphic to B. And I said like linear monoids generalize Frobenius algebras. This is because a Frobenius algebra always occur on a self-dual. Algebra always occurs on a self-dual object, whereas a linear monoid has a monoid and a co-monoid on distinct dual objects. And also, a Frobenius, a morphism of Frobenius algebra is always an isomorphism. However, a morphism of linear monoid is more general. And here is the condition under which a Frobenius, a linear monoid, a self-linear monoid, precisely gives a Frobenius. Monoid precisely gives the Frobenius algebra. Right. And yeah, so here and linear monoids can be characterized like there is an alternate characterization of linear monoid, which is closer to the formulation of Robinius algebras. So in this alternate characterization, equivalentization, a linear monoid consists of a monoid and a co-monoid with actions and coactions that satisfy. Coactions that satisfy certain properties. And here is a Frobenius equation that is satisfied by the actions, coactions, the monoid multiplication, and the comonoid comultiplication. And you can see the similarity between the Frobenius algebra, Frobenius law, and like the axiom satisfied by the linear monoids. And so this brings us closer to the formulation of complementary systems. Systems. So, I said that a linear monoid is a tensor monoid with a dual. So, in an LDC, we have two tensor products. So, this gives rise to the notion of linear co-monoid. So, linear co-monoid is a tensor co-monoid with a dual. And a linear bialgebra is a linear monoid and a linear comonoid interacting to produce two bialgebras called like one bialgebra on A. One bi-algebra on A and another bi-algebra on B. So these bialgebras are dual to one another, but A and B are not self-dual. So they are distinct objects. Okay, so in this sense, like now we are very close, like now we have, we can define the complementary systems. A complementary system in an isomics category is simply a self-linear bi-algebra that satisfies these three rules here. These three rules here. So, this rule simply says that the unit of the linear co-monoid is dual to its co-unit by the duality of the linear monoid. And this rule here says the unit of the linear monoid is dual to the co-unit by the duality of the linear co-monoid. So, like the dualities determine, like the dualities exchange here. Like the dualities exchange here, and this is similar. Like the third rule is similar to the bi-algebra rule, which says that the unit of the linear co-monoid gets duplicated by the coaction of the linear monoid. And with this formulation of complementary system, we can prove that if A is a complementary system, then A is both tensor hop and power hop. So we can have these. So, we can have this notion of complementary systems outside the like in a non-compact dagger linear logic setting outside the core. And finally, we arrive at the result we want. So, the theorem we proved using these structures is that in a Bank-Wimper isomix category with free exponential modalities, every complementary system arises by splitting. Arises by splitting binary idempotent on the linear bi-algebra induced on the exponential modalities. So every complementary system induces linear bi-algebra on the exponential modalities. And because these exponential modalities are free, then that induces a binary idempotent on the linear bi-algebra. And splitting that idempotent gives back the original complementary system. So that is a So that is our result. And as you can see, like I proved everything, like I presented everything in linearly distributive setting. However, these structures and results can be extended to dagger linear by algebras and dagger LTCs due to the dagger linearity of all these pairs of maps we have. So that brings me to the end of my talk. So one common question I always get like when someone reads this article is that what are Someone reads this article is that what about the examples? Well, yeah, we have to work out examples in physics for these structures that we have here. And yeah, that's a work in progress or yeah, we are thinking about it. And I would like to thank JS for all the useful discussions, for many useful discussions on exponential modalities. And here is our paper on the archive. So thank you. Thank you for the paper. Thank you, Priya. Thank you, Priya. I'm glad your slide counter was off. I was getting a little worried for you. But thank you very much. Are there any questions for Priya? Oh, Jonathan? I'm assuming that's Jonathan? I may have to continue assuming that's Jonathan. Okay. Any oh, anyone else? Okay, well, I don't want to. I know, I managed to. Oh, he thinks his microphone died. Okay. Okay. Oh, sorry. Oops, oops, oops. Oops, oops, oops. Okay. Well, okay. Is that recoverable or or are you are you are you done? Type your question in chat. Oh yeah, oh yeah. What happens when you compactify bang and whimper? I think that's what you call it again. Compactify them again. Oh, compactify bang. Oh, compactify, bang, and whimper. Um that's when we get a complete okay, so when we start with a complementary system and induce, like so, okay, when we start with a complementary system that induces a linear bioalgebra on Bang and Wimper, but that's not a complementary system. But compactifying Bang and Wimper again produces the same complementary system, which induced that. So that's what the theorem about. That's what the theorem is about. Am I understanding the question right? Jonathan. So he says, nice, do you always get a commutative Frobenius algebra? Yes, you do. Okay. Yeah, I know that question was definitely understood correctly. Is definitely understood correctly. All right. Jonathan, any follow-up? Okay. Nope. All right. Thank you. All right. Well, does anyone else want to say something before we close for the day? I don't know. Christine, I mean, we'll thank Priya. Oh, Ben. Thank you. Yeah, I was just wondering because there was a talk. I was just wondering because there was a talk earlier, like, do you think that there's a relationship here with sort of linear bicategories, especially with some of these monoids you were talking about earlier as kind of monads in the sense of like bicategories, like a so linear monoids are originally defined, so they are linear. Are originally defined, so they are linear adjunctions in y categories. So the structure itself and like linear co-monoids is something new that we realized we need in this while working with this. So I guess like linear monoids can also be like generalized to linear pi categories and then op lax or something. Sorry? Like op lax or something like that? Yes, yes. Yeah. There is a yeah, there is a reference. There is a relation between linear monoid and linear comonoid. There is a functor between like the category of linear monoids and the category of linear comonoids, a reflective functor. So in that sense, linear comonoids would also be generalized to like linear bi-categories. And then like once we have these two, then there comes the notion of linear bi-algebras and complementary systems. So I think this entire setup could be generalized to linear bi-category. Be generalized to linear by categories, and that would be an interesting thing to do. Yeah, a little more general. Yeah, Gordon. Okay, so hi, hi, Priya. So a naive question. Is there any thought of uncertainty relations at this level? Yeah, this is something that we are yet to look at, like to understand how this translates to in physics terms. So, Bang is used to. So, BANG is used to model the state space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. And so, in that sense, there should be something going on there, but I really don't know what's happening on the physics side. Like, we are trying to understand that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Bang looks like kind of a super classical structure, like the one that contains all the other classical structures, and we can extract complement. And we can extract complementary systems out of this bank. That's how it looks. But then, in actual physics terms, we are yet to see what this means. Okay, so it's just asking a version of the first question that people ask. Okay, thanks. Do you have any ideas there? No, it's just a question. Okay, okay. Thank you so much. Good, good. Well, anyone else? Else all right, beautiful. Um, well, then we'll thank Priya. Oh, Priya, I have a request to the audience. If anyone has any ideas on how to translate this to physics or like in categorical sense, please, please give us some idea. Okay. Well, since you asked that yourself, I'll say that's a good question. I haven't thought about it myself. I haven't thought about it myself yet, but I will look into that. All right. Well, thank you, Priya. Thank you, David. And I suppose this concludes.
