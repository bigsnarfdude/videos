Okay, thank you so much for the invitation and for the introduction. This is my talk for Andrei Repinchuk on the occasion of his birthday. You know, I wish to come in person in Bonf and to congratulate him personally, but because of my teaching, I was not able to come this week. It's a great pity, but this is a life, so this is how it is. So, this is a joint work with. So, this is a joint work with Verdier and Pianzolo. And this is like a report about our informal seminar in Alberta last winter on open problems for Albert algebras. Can we maybe make it full screen? Your slides. The audience is asking if we can make your screen full, your slides full screen. But it's full screen. But it's full screen. It's not full screen? No. It would be easier to read. Does anyone know the command for Mac? Just a sec. On my screen, it's full screen. I don't know. Okay. Oh, okay. Sorry, yeah, I'm late now. What are you using to project? I mean, what program are you using? I don't recognize this. Just laptop and PDF file, it's Beamer presentation, LaTeX. Yeah, but I mean, then what program is this looks like? Yeah, you're in Zoom, and this is weird. Yeah, I don't know. Yes, it's Zoom. It's Zoom. I mean, as opposed to using reader or something. A reader? Okay, no, I think we can just go. Let's keep going. Let's do it. This is better. Thank you. Okay. Just a second. Is it okay or not? I'm sorry. Okay, so last winter we had a seminar on open problems in Alberta algebras, and we try to answer some questions posed. Some questions posted by Peterson and his survey. Even though we didn't achieve main goals, we have some partial results, which I want to present today. I consider it as a good complement to work of Rost on G3 invariant, and I am going to explain to you that a G3 invariant determines Albert algebras arising from. Arising from the first is construction uniquely. So, first, I will introduce Albert algebras. So, in my talk, the main field is F and I will assume characteristic note 2 and 3. But in the main theorem, I want to emphasize we don't have any characteristic restrictions. Just for simplicity, to introduce the subject, I will use this. This object, I will use this assumption. So let me first give the definition of an Albert algebra. First, we need a definition of Jordan algebra. This is a unital commutative of algebra and with this multiplication property. So, yeah, sorry, Volacha, we're still seeing the title screen. Have you been advancing slides? Title screen, have you been advancing slides? I think maybe we're seeing the wrong window. That's probably the trouble. Right? We're still seeing your title slide. It still says new evidence, they call on clearance items. I'm not sure I understand what the problem is. Are you still on the have you advanced to a different slide? Are you still on that first slide that shows your title? I'm going along my file, BIM presentation. Beam presentation line by line. Yes, but what we see is still the title. Have you changed to a different slide yet? We thought you had. Yes, I changed already. Are we possibly looking at what he sent us? So let me get out of the full screen. Do you see full? So we've had rid of one window. Why don't you close? Yeah, okay, remove. We're seeing your cursor. So now we're, I think. So now we're also in advance. Yes, if you move it up. Yes. Yeah, when you move it up with your cursor. So there's a button. Yeah, there's a down arrow. Maybe if you use that. So if you go up, you see. Well, yeah, if you just pull it up, that would work. But also there's an arrow just below where it says survey Albert et al. Survey Albert al. Yeah, that works. That gets us. Are you that's working? It's working. Okay, let me. Is it better? Okay, let me. Is it better or not? Okay. Sorry, guys. I've never had this problem before when I made the presentation, but something happened this time. So first I wanted to remind the definition of a Jordan algebra. This is algebra unital with commutative and not associated multiplication, but you have this law for all elements x and y. Elements x and y in A. So let me give the main example of such Jordan algebra. If you take an arbitrary associative algebra, then we can introduce a new multiplication using this formula. This is a new multiplication is commutative and it satisfies the required Jordan identity. So this So this algebra B with this multiplication usually is denoted by B plus. So a Jordan algebra is called special if it's isomorphic to a Jordan sub-algebra of some B plus. And otherwise, it's called exceptional. And Albert algebra is defined as a simple exceptional Jordan algebra. So this is. So, this is a long definition, and people who are not involved probably cannot easily follow this. But let me state you some facts which are known already. So, the dimension of such Albert algebra is 27. This is first fact. Second fact, over separably closed fields, all of them are either more. All of them are isomorphic. So, all of them are twisted form of each other. And automorphism group of any Albert algebra is a simple algebraic group of type F4. So, there is a natural bijection between three sets. First set, this is the set of Albert algebras over F. Over F, isomorphism classes of Albert algebras over F. Second set, the set of isomorphism classes of groups of type F4. And last set, the set of torsors of isomorphism class, the set of all torsors, F4 torsors over F. So this allows us to easily pass from one set to another if it is needed. So these three objects are not. So, these three objects are in natural bijection, and I like this picture. And now, I want to remind you that all Albert algebras can be constructed with the use of two T constructions. So, in my talk, I need only first T's construction, and let me remind you this construction. So, let us start from central simple algebra D of the. Algebra D of degree 3. Then we can take the direct sum of three copies of D and we look at A as a vector space. And on this vector space, one can introduce the multiplication with the use of the following formula. To introduce multiplication, we need another scalar, μ, from our base field F. F so people define the cross product on G using this formula. It's maybe complicated formula. Then one can introduce U tilde operation. So this is modification of element in D with the use of the T, the reduced trace in D. And finally, here is this formula: how to multiply element in A. Element in A. So it's a very bulky formula, very sophisticated. But the nice feature in our work is that we don't need this formula. Of course, we will use some properties of Alberta algebras which we approved with this formula. But our point of view, so I didn't tell that. I didn't tell that this vector space A is three copies of D equipped with this multiplication is called the Festius construction. So our point of view on Albert algebra is a little bit different. We view A as a set equipped with a cell structure. So by cells, we mean George. Cells, we mean Jordan sub-algebras in A. Let me remind you how Jordan sub-algebras look like. So assume A is division. If it's not division, then all problems which I'm talking about are known and there is nothing to do. So if A is a division algebra, then there are three types of Jordan sub-algebras in A. In A. So, first Jordan sub-algebras are trivial sub-algebras. So, this is zero and A itself. Second kind, cubic field extensions. So, every Albert algebra contains cubic field extensions. And this is, in my terminology, a cells of dimensions. Cells of dimension 3 or level 3. And lastly, there are nine-dimensional sub-algebras which I introduced above. So here B is a central simple algebra. It can be either over base field F or it could be over quadratic extension of the base field equipped with an invaluation of the second kind. And you have the separation plus, which introduces. Separation plus, which introduces new multiplication in B. So these are cells. So certainly, intersection of cells is a cell. This point of view rather formal without fact that our algebra A is equipped with the action of the so-called structure group. So we may associate to A group. I will tell you shortly. And this group acts on A in a natural way. And this cell structure equipped with the action of the structure group helps a lot to answer some questions on groups of type F4. F4. So, what is a structure group? Every Albert algebra A comes with a cubic form N. So there is a natural homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, and it provides a map from A to the main field. A here is written K, but it should be F. So then we consider the structure group as follows. Up points of this group are defined as follows. These are linear transformations of A, which preserves this cubic form N up to multiplier. So people say it's norm similarity. So it preserves N up to multiplier, optoscaler. Optoscalar. So, FAT, the structure group is a reductive group scheme whose central torus is GM. And a semi-simple pod derived pod subgroup is a simple, simply connected group of type E6. So the intersection of the central torus and this derived subgroup is at center of E6. Group is at center of E6. So, this is a complete analog of the situation when you consider GLN. So, GLN is an almost direct product of central torus GM and the derived subgroup SLN. Intersection is at center of SLN. Here we have a completely analog picture, or if you want to analog this quadrature. analog with quadratic forms we can consider we can consider a special orthogonal group and we consider the similitude group and as an algebraic group it's almost almost direct product of central torus GM and special orthogonal group so this this structure group Group is a natural companion of this algebra A. So now next object, cognological invariance constructed by Sir and Rost for Albert algebras. So assume A is an Albert algebra of a field of characteristic not two, we can consider the trace form. Consider the trace form on A given by formula x goes to the trace of x square over 2. In 1995, Sur computed this trace form and it turns out the result is the following. This trace form satisfies the following property. QA, this is quadratic form. We are looking for if you multiply, if you add some three-phista form, it will be of the shape three-dimensional quadratic form with coefficients two to two and five dimensional and five fista form q5. So this two fista forms q3 and q5 gives rise to the Gives rise to the kidemological invariance from Albert algebra to H3 with coefficients in Z mod 2 and F5 them F to H5 with coefficients in Z mod 2. So behind this construction, there is a result of due to ROST. This is the descent of FISTA forms with respect to extensions. Respect extensions of odd degree. So ROST results sits inside this three F3 and F5 cogemological invariants. So later, Peterson-Tracin extended this invariance for a field of bad characteristic. So another invariant is due to ROST. It's called G. Due to rost, it's called G3 invariant, and this is a functorial map from Albert algebras into H3 with coefficients in the atmosphere. So Ross did it for fields of characteristic not two and three. And later, by the way, for us, it's important to know the formula how G3 looks like. If Albert algebra If Albert algebra comes from the fastest constructions, so the fastest construction includes central simple algebra of degree 3d and some scalar mu. And then G3 invariant is just a cup product of the central simple algebra with cognitive class determined by mu. So this is very natural formula, but the difficulty is to show that. The difficulty is to show that this formula doesn't depend on the choice of D and mu. It may happen that the same Albert algebra has different representation. So there is different D prime, mu prime, and one needs to show that the cop product is the same. So this is a non-trivial result and it Trivial result and it was constructed by Rost in 1941. So, and again, for the case of wet characteristic, this invariant was extended by Patterson and Tracy. So, in 19 raised the following question: So, you have So you have three cognitive invariants denoted by F3, F5, and G3. And it is known that there are no more cognitive invariants. I do not want to go into details, but basically, these are all cogemological invariants, or more precisely, they're generators of the model. Generators of the module of grimological invariance. So, and the question is: so, giving Alberta algebras or equivalently giving torsors of split group G0 of type F4, so you have this canonical map. It's not a homomorphism, it's a map. And the question is if it's injective or not, if the three cogemological invariants. The three cognitive invariants determine Albert algebras uniquely or not. And here I use identification: the set of Albert algebras identified with torsors. So not much is known about this question, and let me list three known results in this direction. First result is a First result is a theorem due to Springer. So he considers Albert algebras with the property that G3 invariant is zero. So all such algebras have a natural realization as a reduced algebras, and the construction involves actonian algebras and two parameters and Springer. Springer proves that if you consider only such a class of Alberta algebras, then this map is injective. In particular, the kernel is trivial. The kernel of the previous map, this map is trivial. Second result, let me mention, is a joint result with Andrei Repinchuk and Igor Pinchuk. And Igrapinshuk, and its conditional result. And let us assume that f is finitely generated. And let us assume that finiteness conjecture for groups with good reduction holds. Then what we proved, we proved that the map phi under consideration is proper, that is, its fibers are finite. So in other words, there are only finite. There are only finitely many Albert algebras up to isomorphism who have the prescribed cardiomological invariance. And the last result I want to mention is the Ross Syrian. He wanted to prove to answer in full generality the answer's question, but he managed to give only a partial answer. Only a partial answer, and this answer is the following: assume you are giving two Albert algebras with the same cognomological invariance or two torsors, C1, C2, then what Euros proved is the following result. There are two field extensions of the ground field F. The field extension K of F of degree dividing three and And the extension of degree prime to three, and such that your Albert algebras, when you take restrictions to K and L, they coincide. So, of course, the target would be to show that C one and C two are the same, are equal, but for the time being, we know only this result. We know only this result. At the end of my talk, I will show that we can improve this result of Ross by saying more precisely what L is. L is a quadratic field extension which kills F3 invariants. So this is a consequence of our result. So here is the main result. It's a joint work with Lordie and Pian Sola. And P and solo. And what we are doing, we consider Albert algebra arising from the Faustis construction. These are precisely torsors with the property F3 is equal zero. So all Albert algebras arising from Festis construction have this property F3 is equal zero. And then this map G3 is injective. This is our Objective. This is our result. So, this is the first part of my talk. I use Beamer presentation. What I want to do right now, I want to stop sharing my screen and to switch to my iPad and to explain on whiteboard how we proceed to prove this result. So, let's hope that everything works. I will stop sharing this now. Stop sharing this now, and I want to share with my iPad Oops Oops. Do you see my whiteboard? Yes. Okay. Uh now maybe it will be better for you to see. So I want to explain the strategy of the proving uh of Ethereum. uh our theorem let me emphasize that in our theorem the field f is an arbitrary it has arbitrary characteristic and uh first step is a reduction to the field of characteristic zero so this is basically the work of Philippe Zil so the first step Reduction to the case characteristic F is zero. So assume you are getting a field F of positive characteristic. Assume characteristic is positive. Let's do the following. We can construct a field K which is complete with respect to discrete valuation. Complete discrete valuation. Complete discrete evaluation field. Let O be the ring of integers, and we assume that the residue field is our field F. So we can do easily this with the use of bit vectors. Then let G0 be a split group of tag four. And we have the following diagram. So we want to say something about torsors over F. So you have H1, G0 over F. Torsors by Henslema, we can identify with torsors H1 over O. Over all our group G0 over Oops And next step we can embed this set into torsors over K. So we have this diagram, and this is again, let me emphasize injection. Then we want to consider G3 invariant over F. G3 invariant over F is part of the gamological invariant for an arbitrary, simple, simply connected algebraic group. So we may consider Rostinology. So we may consider Rust invariant of our group G0 over F and G three is a three component of this map coefficients qz mod z listed and you may consider the same rust map but over k But okay. And there is a map from H3 over F into H3 over K constructed by Cotto. And Philip J investigated. Commutativity of this diagram. So, what he proves is that this diagram is commutative up to automorphisms of Q mod Z. Up to isomorphism of Q mod Z. And what is important, by cutter construction, this arrow is injection. So, and simple diagram change. Diagram chase shows that if you start from two torsors here over air, and if you assume that both goes to the same point, then if you go to K, to the generic point, you have new torsors here, say one K, Psi two K. And if you know And if you know that in the case of characteristic zero, your map is injection, if you know that this is injection, so you easily find a contradiction. So everything boils down to play with this diagram. And this diagram is due to Philippe G. So this is a simple reduction to the field of characteristic zero. And so step two may see. Step two may assume that characteristic not two and three. So every time I try to avoid characteristic two and three when you deal with Albert algebras because the picture is more complicated in this bad characteristic case. But due to Philippe G, we can avoid this case. So assume you are given two torsors. Giving two torsors. Uh, with the property that the G3 invariant is the same and our group G0. So we assume that F3 is zero, so they arise from the first construction, and we assume that G3. And we assume that G3 invariant is the same. So it's technically very difficult step. And what we want, we prove the following. We prove the following. There exists a maximal torus T in G0 over the ground. In G0 over the ground filter, such that both cos cycles or both torsors come from C. So we may assume that they have coefficients in C. So if you have only one torsor, it's easy to construct such a torso T with the use of standard crystal. With the use of standard crystal, but here the different difficulty is that you have two torsors and you want two torsors move to the same maximal torus T. Taurus T is a nice torus. It has very simple speech and properties. So Taurus T is an almost direct product of two cookies of torus S and Taurus S is And torus S is a polymer. So this is elements with norm one with respect to cubic Galois extension of the ground field F. So Taurus S has dimension two. It consists of elements with norm one and it splits over a cubic Gaul extension. The intersection of two copies of S here is Lucy. So just to visualize how I look at this torus T through the following Denkin diagram. You have a full Dink diagram. Torcelles have coefficients in the Coefficients in the split group G0 of type F4. So this is Dinking diagram. We'll take a root of maximal lengths and negative. So this is extended Dinking diagram. You have a subgroup SL3. You have the second subgroup SL3. They commute and they embed S through. Embed S through regular representation. So you can embed S into SL3 and you take the product of these two copies of S. Intersection is mu3. This is what torus T is, but of course, difficulty is to show that we can move C1, C2 into this torus. So this is difficult. So, this is a difficult technical step. Let me continue with the next step. So, and again, our aim is to show that torsions are equal. So, we can restate this fact as follows. There is a natural torsion by junction. There is a natural torsion by junction. Injection. So we'll take C1 with twist speed group. With twist group, you have group G, which is of type F4. It's anisotropic. And here you have two torsors in the split group. Under this torsion bijection, C1 goes to one. And let me denote image of C2 by X. image of C2 by X C and this torso C gives has coefficients in G and it has the fundamental property that if you apply Rost invariant it goes throughout so this is easy property Property because G3 invariant for C1 or C2 is the same. This can be restated in the way that C goes to zero. And so our aim, new aim to show that ψ is 0. If psi is 0, then because of this map is bijection, psi 1 goes to 1, then xi1. To one, then say one and say two must coincide. Okay, with the use of this torus, we have the following chain of subgroups in twisted group G. So let me emphasize: G isotropic, F-anisotropic group of type F4. And what else? And the corresponding Albert algebra, the corresponding Albert algebra arises from the first disconstruction. So remember, I said that our point of view on Albert algebra is that it's a so space equipped with the action of the structure group, and all arithmetic information related to the corresponding group G is constant. Corresponding group G is concentrated in the stabilizers of these cells. So if you can describe in a good way stabilizers of cells, in particular cubic field extensions, and if you can describe their torsors, then basically you can prove all remaining open problems for F4. So, in this country situation, you have the following. Yes, any question? Okay, so in this concrete situation, we have the following chain of subgroups interested group G. Let me write down this diagram and then I will explain what it is. What it is. So, in this diagram, the following, you have torus T, it's just an outlisted group G. This is by construction. So, the subgroup H has type D4. And this is the following subgroup. Let's look back. What is G? Let's look back. Where is this? Ah, here it is. Our group G is a twisted with a say one. Say one has coefficients in a torus T. As coefficients in a torus T. When you twist an algebraic group by torus with the coefficients in maximal torus, then the action, the corresponding action of the Galois group acts on the roots of the corresponding roads in a natural way. And in this situation, you have two types of routes: short routes and long routes. And certainly, Crowds and certainly Gala group preserves long cross and long crosses generate a subgroup simple simply connected of type D4 inside F4. So this is our group H, simple, simply connected. Simple, simply connected, and this is trailitarian group. So SH. So, SH, what is SH? SH here is a four length. You may consider that centralizer inside G of your group H, and this will be two-dimensional torus, two-dimensional torus. And with the use of cell structure, we prove that it's isomorphic to our torus S and then. And then you can take the product. You can take the product, and this is our group SH, which appear in this diagram. There is a natural description of this group through the stabilizer of some cell in the corresponding Albert algebra. Algebra and structure group was introduced above. And one more object which I must explain, and P is the following subgroup here. So P is a reductive group, as a reductive group, it's an almost direct product of our torus S, two-dimensional torus S, and P two, P tilde, this type A two. This type A2 has type A2, and this is inner form of type A2. Of course, everything must be proved, so I have no time to give proofs of these facts, but P tilde is a group of this shape. So you can write down the similar. Write down the similar diagram for torso. You start from a torso C with coefficients and C, you can move to P, you have a torso psi P, you can move to H, whether you have torso C H, you can move to G, you have torso G and also you have a torso in the red. In the reductive group SH, and you have torsa in the structure group of A. Oh, I see three minutes left, not much. So, and now here is the trick. Our aim was, if you remember, our aim was to prove that psi G is trivial. Now I want to re-aim. I want to re-aim. Instead of proving that it's trivial in G, I want to prove that it's trivial in P. You may ask what's the advantage of this point of view, and the advantage is the following. If you want to show that it's trivial in P, this allows us to take any field extension of degree 10 to 3. And to see. So may take any field extension of degree prime to 3 of degree prime to 3. And this is because of the nature of this group P P and P zoda. If you write down exact sequence. Write down the exact sequence for computing Galar tremologies of P through Gala tagiomologies of S and P tilde, but you will see that it's stable with respect to finite extensions of degree prime to three. And so may assume that Gala group is a pro three finite pro finite group. Profinite group. Without loss of generality, we may assume that this group is a pro3 group. If you may assume this, then you may use a ROST result, which I mentioned before. May apply ROST result. Rust resolve and this rost resolve says that C over G is trivial. So in this diagram, so if you take field extension, you get that C goes to G t and then after that you may analyze goes through this diagram. Diagram. If you assume that it's trivial over G, then it's trivial in the structure group. Then you are reduced to describing the kernel of the map in the Gallo terminology for this arrow. And with the use of some results, we may prove that the kernel of this map is trivial. Then you can prove that the kernel of this arrow is also trivial. And then you prove that. And then you prove that your torso is the real NP. So I see my time is over. I wanted to give more details of this picture, but unfortunately I have to stop. Thank you so much for listening to me. Any question? Let's take the speaker first. Are there any questions? Oh, the fact that P tilde is of genotype, so it's easy to see or yes, it's easy to see. This comes from the nature of torus T. Taurus T is of the shape it's split by quadratic extension, and this quadratic not quadratic by qubit extension, it splits torus T and so. Taurus T and so the group P tilde becomes split over cubic extension. So it's uniform. You know, Andre, look, where is this diagram of subgroups? So group P contains torus T. Taurus T is split by cubic Golo extension. So T becomes split. Slid and so it's semi-simple part, P tilde is semi-simple, it's also Slove. Any other questions? This may be a naive question, but is there a chance that one can sort of doing these case-by-case both injectivity and sort of case-by-case show? sort of case by case show interactivity overall? What do you mean case by case? Well you did the you did it for the alphabet that came from the first construction, right? So maybe. Okay, you are talking about second test construction. For me, as the main difficulty is to move two torsors into good torus team. So if torsors come from secondary From second T construction, so I have some ideas how to construct Taurus T, but it's not so simple Taurus. It will have more difficult splitting properties. And to be honest, till the end, I don't know how to move to the same Taurus T using standard. We can move to C1 to Taurus T1, C2. To Taurus T1, C2 to Taurus T2, but what we want, we want to the same Taurus T. I don't know how to do this for the time being, but certainly it will be our homework for the summer to extend these considerations for algorithm algebras arising from the second test construction. So, if you do know that they come from the same source, let's say you assume that. Then, our chances I would say 90% to finish the proof. I know how to argue if you move to the center of T, I know in most cases how to describe kernel of this map, kernel of this map, kernel of this map. So, there are very good chances to finish. There are very good chances to finish the pro. Well, let's thank the speaker again and then we'll resume at 10:30 after the coffee break. Okay, thank you.
