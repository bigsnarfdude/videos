Specifically, time evolution problems and their appropriate boundary conditions. I will try to give perhaps an overview of the revival phenomenon, and through the talk we will identify two types of revivals, the pure and the weak revivals. So here's an overview of the talk, and first I will explain what is the revival phenomenon based on an example from the three linear stretcher equation, with periodic battery rhetoricians. It's very odd by the repetitions. And to do this, it is better to view the revival phenomenon as the one side of a dichotomy with the other one being the fertilization of the characterize analytically the revival phenomenon for this, for the case of the state degradation, and we will see some standard results that form perhaps the classical setting, what I call the classical setting. So after this, So after this we will examine we will see some examples of other type of type of Ultimate problems, with no period boundary conditions, with other types of situations. We will encounter the weak revivals and finally we will close with some observations and some more of the problems. So let's begin. So let us consider the initial balance-value problem for the field set degradation of 0 to pi. We have periodic buttons. We have periodic battery conditions and initial conditions U0. So we know how to solve this problem. The solution is given by a Fourier series. Here is J is the classical loconoma-foulement basis. It's also the eigenfunctions of the other line. The Ferengi operator, eigenvalue J squared, and the card denotes the coefficients of the initial condition. Now to explain the revival phenomenon, the fra revival of optimization phenomenon, We display basically a dichotomy of the behavior of the solution where we look at irrational or irrational times irrational where t over 2π is not irrational, otherwise irrational. And this phenomenon, this dichotomy fest when we have ministerial conditions with James continuities. So let us choose a minister condition with a James continuity at pi, step function, and plot the solution and some generic types of. Look the solution on some generic types of irrational types. Generic times are the irrational types. I will use both. Uh depending on. So the fractionalization effect is a smoothing effect. It says that if you have a trans continuity in the beginning, when I go to some generic time, I don't have any more dance continuities and the solution becomes continuous. The real imbalanced part of the solution profile becomes a continuous function. Function. So we have a spoofing effect, at least the net times. And not only this, but if we look at the profiles, they look like no intellectual functions, resembling some Paula Graph fractal-like behavior. And this is called this smoothing effect, it's called the fractalization effect. And it is the behavior here for the fractalization effect is quite different when we now go to the the rational class. Go to the rational times. So if we go about rational time, so rational movements of 2π, instead of smoothing, we see piecewise continuous profiles, in particular piecewise constant profiles, as the initial condition. So we kind of have a revival of the initial condition in the structure of the solution. We have jump discontinuities in the beginning, we revive jump discontinuities at rational times. We have piecewise constant in the beginning. Piecewise constant in the beginning at time zero, we have piecewise constant solutions at times at large of all times. So these two effects together therefore this dichotomy regularity, so we have rational irrational, revival or fertilization. We have mainly focused on the revival phenomenon and for this particular example we can completely characterize what we see in this picture. So, for any initial partition, one can prove that the following identity holds. This identity says that if I go at a rational time, my solution is a finite linear combination of translations of the initial condition. In particular, we see that for each k, we have the coefficient here. I can also do that. Well I can also get a coefficient a finite exponential sum. These are known as generalized quadratic Gaussons. And through the analysis of the revolved phenomenon you can obtain some exposure identities, what we're going to go over there. Anyway, the identity motivates us to define to consider a first concept of... A fresh concept of verifiable, which I will call purifiable, and says exactly what we think the identity. So the solution at transforms is a finite superposition of translations of the initial condition. And this implies what we saw in the picture element. So we have finitely many discontinuities at rational times whenever we start with some discontinuities, and we also see that the solution at rational times will depend always on the finitely many values of the initial condition. And okay, so to give some concept around the revival phenomenon now, but somehow I confuse, so the work by Oscar from 1992 explained this dichotomy in some extent. So for particular for initial conditions of bounded variation with finite discontinuities, we saw that Continuities, is so that if we do at irrational time, the solution becomes continuous, whereas at irrational times we have count of many, at most countably many discontinuities. And if it is continuous, we gain continuity in both values. Independently of Skolov, Baden claimed boundary vival and factorization effect by studying the Talmud effect, which is the a distraction effect a phenomenon uh in optics. phenomena uh in optics. It describes uh the repeated let's say the repeated uh occurrence of at some regular distance of the of the EGMATS of a periodic diffraction grading when we have light passing through. So in this picture we have here the diffraction, a periodic diffraction grading, we have light passing through, and we see that when we go to the right hand side here we we see the full immune of the diffraction grading. Whereas in the middle, we see self-dimensions of the grading, so there is a repair value, let's say, of the grading. And Bay and Grace had studied the Talmud effect using the representations, the fully series representations of the second calculation for the periodic problem, and found this dichotomy. Then Berry went a little further with this, he connected to the theory of quantum revival, which Theory of quantum revival, which again says somehow that your wave function reconstructs at certain times in terms of copies of the initial state. And he also made the conjecture for the fractal now, for the dimensions of the graphs at the irrational times that it should be 3 over 2. And then Rodiaski proved this that indeed is 3 over 2. Combined some results by Tasky Rodiaski, who a paper here in 1999 about this nice database. Nice data. In fact, one particle knows the time, it probably does. And then again, Taylor independently from all the other reasons. He found also a purifiable phenomenon for the stereotype radiation. In this paper, he also gives this response to the identities for the Gaussams. That's how we can reduce these things. And Gaussam says he extends to n diamonds to the surface of n-dimensional spheres. To the surface of n-dimensional sphere, to the n-dimensional torque, so have some results in higher dimensions. And finally, again, independently from all the other researchers, over in 2010, they discovered the revival catalogization effect. And he showed us how we can extend the pure revival to a more general class of linear dispressive disease of this type, where here is a polynomial of. is a polynomial of within the coefficient, so we have dispersive relation of polynomial within its coefficients. He also named the dispersive quantization, capturing both the dispersive aspect of the equation and the quantization of the solution and rational tactics. The full statement you follow the book of Devon the Rec is proof. The representation for the purified is quite similar to the one that that we have for the second observation. That we have for the setting of occupation. And this form the classical setting. So the classical setting is the pure revival for this problem, for this periodic problem. So now after 2010, we start thinking, not really specifically, but in general, okay, what happens now if we start changing about the conditions which are the changing our equation? So I would like to address some examples in these directions when we leave the classical setting. And with these two examples, I want to somehow say that although we had self-attain battery conditions in the beginning, in the periodic problem, there are self-attain battery recognition, it seems that the revival effect does not depend on the Depend on the self-attention of the boundary rotation. So, one main example that we have analytically is for the static regression, for the free linear straight degree regression, when we have this pseudo-periodic boundary cautions, where the parameters can be LSNPR. And these are non-self-adserved battery partitions. And we have purifiables for this problem, but not only of translations of the initial partition, but also we have translations of the But also, we have translation of the reflection. So, we have somehow a litter structure of the revival phenomenon. And on the other hand, for a third-order problem, for the AAPTE, a linear equation of the code or the free circulation that Dalis was talking yesterday, for self-attaining battery conditions, we can prove that the reply band actually breaks. So, whenever this parameter shit down in our battery conditions In our boundary conditions, uh is ira is irrational. If I go at rational times, I I would have fractalization effect instead of revivals. So it seems that the having self-absorbedness doesn't really matter for the revival effect, but maybe the revival is more in favor of the safe. And also that we realize from the proofs that the form of Okay, the form of the eigenvalues, the form of the eigenfunctions do matter on what's on examining the revival. But we are not yet in place to give you a list of assumptions that will guarantee that a time evolution problem will have revivals. So then we thought, okay, let's examine more examples. And instead of now coupled boundary cogitions, so here we have coupled boundary conditions. So here we have a couple boundary conditions. Let's see what's happening if we go with separated boundary conditions. So this is another time evolution problem for the three uncertainty education, but now we will consider pi and we have this type of Robamba decoditions here, which somehow is an interpolation between Neumann and Dirichlet. So for my parameter B, which runs My parameter B, which runs from 0 to 1. If it is 0, I have no emotion. If it is 1, I have the input. And for this problem, you can solve everything. You can do everything explicitly. Calculate everything. And when we go at rational times for the solution to the problem, we see that, okay, we don't have an exact revival. We have a pure revival of the Ephen extension. Here is the even extension of the U0. So U0 is in 0 in 0 pi. We extend it to describe the translations. So it's a pure revival of the even extension of the initial condition plus something else, but something is a continuous function of x. So it does not affect necessarily the pure revival, we decompose. This is what we call the weak revival. So a pure revival effect affected by a continuous. Revival effect protected by a continuous function. The main observation here is that although we don't have pure revivals, we have the same implications as the pure revival. So whenever I have jump discontinuities in the time zero, I will exhibit jump discontinuities at rational times. So again, I have a revival of the jump discontinuities. And also I have again finitely made dependence on finitely main values of my initial condition. Initial condition. And this is the weak revival. And how perhaps this weak revival might look like? So here we start with an initial condition with a jumps continuity at pi over 2 and for some values of our parameter b we see that okay we don't have copies of translated copies only of the initial condition but we have other types of transformations but again we see the revival of exams continuously Revival of exams for the news in our cases. Here. How much time do you have to wait for? It's supposed to be, I think it's supposed to be for small time perhaps. Small time? Theoretically, you can say for any rational time that I give you, you will have this kind of interpretation. That I give you, you will have this kind of this any rational time. That I give you, you would have this representation that for any rational time, you would have you would have a Q reviral representation plus a continuous function of X for any rational time. For any PQ, you would have such a representation. And here is the the weak revival effects. We don't have any more pure translation. So and the weak revival somehow if we if we go too far outside the classical setting the pure revival becomes weak revival and another example that we were looking is for evolution problems and as an example, here I think it's a nice example to use, is the biharmonic wave equation with periodic battery partitions. Given that we have periodic battery partitions, we see that we have weaker vibrance. And this comes ah because biharmonic wave equation incorporates the structure of the state variation. So the claim, so we have the initial conditions F F and for the time derivative at zero, we have G and we have periodicals. And the claim is that okay, we at rational time we have weak revivals. I will sketch the idea, of course. So we can factorize the bi-harmonic wave equation in terms of two problems for the for linear assembly equations. Here we set we set this as doubling. We set this as W. So we get an equation for. So, whenever Q is a solution to the biharmonic wave equation, it's also a solution to any homogeneous linear state equation with initial condition F, where the force term is given, satisfies a free linear state equation with initial condition here three minus the second derivative of f. So here we we work under the assumption that the F can be H s fifty, so F can be h squared. But we know how we can solve this by the Hamilton's principle. It would be the solution to the free equation plus the Hamilton theorem. So for NT, I have a solution to the periodic three-nines degree equation plus the Hamiltonian. If I go at rational times, I get a pure revival of f plus a function of x, and we can show that actually n is. Actually, n is a continuous function of like this term here represents a continuous virtual colours, but it characterized completely. And this uh so it seems the the the weak rev not uh it seems okay. So the weak revival it's it's the main revival effect for f for second order entire objects, at least for Order in time objects, at least for polyharmonic weight equations of even order. And as I said, if we leave our classical setting, instead of pure revivals, we have other type of revivals. And here we saw that we have a weak type of revival. And finally, I want to perhaps finish with a couple of problems that we still don't know what to do or questions about. So, in their paper, all the same, they also consider. They also considered like they had some numerical examples for more general inner value conditions for the static error, and we see other types of value phenomenons there, which we haven't explained analytically yet. Other examples are for third-party differential variables, pseudo-digital battery conditions yesterday. And of course there are questions, okay, what is happening for non-linear For nonlinear equations, for like non-linear perturbations. So, for the non-linear, there are results for the cubic nonlinear straight gear, for the order of the freeze equation, I haven't included here, but so in this paper Journal provided some uh numerical uh evidence that the taboo effect uh persists for the Persists for the cubic nonlinear circular equation with periodic battery conditions, and somehow in the same time, one selects gave the very good statement of the result. But okay, what happened now again under or under boundary conditions? And this consequence of the Ganyla invariance, actually so that we can extend the results of Edomanzigarkis to the case of self-axonic periodic battery conditions. Conditions. So whenever u satisfies the non-linear state equation, z, this transformation z satisfies the same equation. But if u is periodic, z becomes quasar. So you can have a correspondence between two problems for a non-linear equation and extend the result. And then also we have, okay, what is happening now if you have a state uh operation operates if you have if you have content in your valuation and at least the result at least I know is for is those two papers for linear state gear equation with potential and periodic battery condition and by Radiovsky 1999 worked with a fundamental solution and one recently by Tokyo King one who somehow worked the same they followed the same proof for the anti-like is to obtain even some bounds on the fractalization effect and so on there is a weak revival here the same is for the I didn't say this there is a weak revival for the QBKN for the QTNS and a weak revival for the when we have potassiums but again what now if you consider more Okay, well now if you consider more general string uh operators which kind of and tomorrow I think we will listen if we will see even more examples by the talk of uh so uh thank you and I think I have things a bit already okay questions comments. A few slides back where you actually showed for the weak revival, yeah, just here, n, the continuous function. I was guessing before that it also depended on the rational multiple. But do you... For a different rational multiple, is there just how does it change? Is it continuous as those? So for, if I fix the rational time, if I fix the rational time, I fixed that rational time, then I look at a function as a function of x. This is called x. But how is it changing in the rational time? I mean, is it just from one rational time to the next? Is it just completely different? Rational. Basically, this function would be a sum of pure revivals of a continuous function. Of a continuous function. So at each time the representation for x will change. But it will always be the continuous function in x for any choice of the rational time. But for example, for this, for the non-linear cases Cases you don't have a specific characterization of your continuity, they solve it by estimates that the so here, again you can use the Hammer's principle and so that the Hammond term is continuous, but you don't have a specific representation there. And here too, then you need to work with other techniques, person if you use them. Okay, any other question or comments? What about the audience online? Is there any questions for the audience? Does that seem to be the case? Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we have a pretty important attention of. It's a reminder of everyone at 1 p.m. 1 p.m. main reception. And you know, your problem. Well, you don't have to have my characters, right? I'd like to tell you what I want to show you now.
