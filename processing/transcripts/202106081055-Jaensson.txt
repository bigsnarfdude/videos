I was really looking forward to it when we heard that it was going to be there. I'm a very frequent visitor to Mexico, and whenever I visit a new place in Mexico, that becomes my new favorite place. But I've been to Oaca quite a few times, and I think I can really say it's my favorite place in Mexico. So it's really a shame. But I hope this workshop maybe in the future will take place again there. And if not, for sure, I'm really going to be back there. So hopefully, see you. Back there. So, hopefully, see you in person somewhere soon. So, yeah, so this work is on basically, it follows very nicely on the presentation of Patrick because it deals with complex interfaces and viscous interfaces. And we're going to talk about the drag on a spherical particle at an air-liquid interface, simulations of that. And we specifically look at the interplay between compressibility, man-goni flows, and surplus viscosities. This work is a collaboration between the Antoff University of Technology. Between the Aintof University of Technology, where I'm now, and ETH Zurich, where I was last year and the year before that, as a postdoc. And most of the work actually has been done by my son, Porali, who is a graduate student in the polymer physics group at ETH Zurich. So why is this an interesting problem? Why do we want to look at particles at complex interfaces? Well, so this problem can actually be found in a lot of different settings. So this is something that Patrick also showed, particles. Particles play a big role in the stability of emulsions and foams. So, beers have basically big complexes, maybe it can be proteins, can be other things inside the beer that stabilize the foam. Ice cream is a nice example. Somehow, we always end up with unhealthy foods. We should find maybe more healthy alternatives here, but or maybe not actually. So, emulsions and foams are a big topic, of course. That's an important problem to understand the stability of these. Understand the stability of these, but also biological membranes. So, when you think of a protein diffusing around in a membrane, it's basically a big particle in a complex interface. It's often modeled as viscous, as incompressible, and that's why this problem of a particle at an interface is also relevant for biological systems. And finally, of course, people also use particles at interfaces to probe the At interfaces to probe the interface, to probe interfacial properties. You can do passive micro-eology, so basically, track Brownian motion of particles at interfaces, and it will tell you something, hopefully, about the properties of the interface. You can also do active micro-eology, where you basically use a force, a magnetic force often to move a particle around. It can also be another shape. It doesn't have to be spherical. But basically, because you know the force that you apply and you can measure the deformation. Apply and you can measure the deformation or the motion of your particle, you can deduce something about the interface. So, this problem of particles at interface is actually quite important for several reasons. And it's complicated because there's this coupling between hydrodynamics, Marangoni flows, and interface rheology. So, there are these different physics going on. They're completely coupled, they will influence each other, and that's why it's actually And that's why it's actually not a trivial problem just to predict from the outset. So that's why numerical simulations, of course, are so powerful. And we're going to look at in more detail, especially at the compressibility of interfaces. So in the next few slides, I will just show the governing equations that we solve for these simulations. So we have a particle at an air-liquid interface, or basically it's just a viscous liquid and an inviscid liquid with zero pressure. Liquid with zero pressure, so we don't need to solve anything in the top domain. Our particle is embedded in the interface at a contact angle of 90 degrees, and the interface is assumed to be flat, and we assume that it remains flat. So, this is an assumption you can justify by introducing a no-slip condition here at the boundary. So, we say that the contact line does not slip. That combines with a very low capillary number. So, typical for these systems, capillary numbers are. For these systems, capillary numbers are really extremely small, maybe 10 to the minus 6, which means that the planar assumption of the interfaces is valid. And there are some other definitions, as you can see in this picture. So then in the liquid domain, we solve a momentum balance. We assume creeping flow because, again, these particles tend to be micrometer scale, so the length scale is quite small, so inertia doesn't play a role. We assume incompressibility of the lower fluid. Incompressibility of the lower fluid. The bulk stress in this case is assumed to be Newtonian. Of course, we have a rate of deformation. And for this specific case, we set the far-field velocity to zero, and we let the particle itself translate for the certain velocity in x-direction. At the interface itself, where we have this IS, which is the interfacial unit tensor, which is basically a projection tensor which will project any vector onto the interface. Vector onto the interface. We have as a first boundary condition the stress boundary condition. So this is something you can derive by looking at the forces acting on a piece of the interface and tracking that and applying some operations to that. And you end up with the following expression, which basically tells you something about the momentum jump when you go across the interface. We have an interfacial stress where in this case we use this Buzzinesk's driven model as Patrick showed before. Griven model, as Patrick showed before, where we have a dilutational part and an isotropic part. So basically, these stresses, you will get devatoric stresses as a consequence of eta s over shear viscosity, and you will get isotropic stresses as a consequence of habilitational viscosity captions. We have a rate of deformation tensor on the interface, which looks as follows, where this IS, of course, is. As follows, where this is of course is important to ensure this thing is conventional to the interface. Patrick talked about this in the previous presentation. We introduce an equation of state, so we assume that this interface is laden with surfactants and we need to say something about the interspatial tension as a function of surfactant concentration. And in this case, we use this simple linear equation of state, which generally only holds in the dilute limit, but you can also think of this as basically. As basically a linearized equation of state because we do everything dimensionless, so actually, a linearized equation of state would yield the exact same dimensionless set of equations. So as long as the surfactant concentration doesn't vary too much away from equilibrium concentration, this is also a nice linearized equation of state. Surfactant transport, we have a convection diffusion equation at the interface where we note that interfaces. Interfaces generally are compressible, so we do need to take into account that the surface divergence of U can be non-zero. And again, we have a far-field concentration, which is just gamma-naught, which is basically an input parameter and a problem. At the particle boundary, we then have no slips. So the velocity at the particle moves exactly with the particle velocity. And then to calculate the drag, we basically evaluate the following integral. So we have contributions. Following integrals: so we have contributions from the bulk stress, where this is our bulk stress tensor. We have contributions from the interface, where we have a part that comes from the surface tension or the interfacial tension, and we have a part that comes from the extra stresses. So this part is coming from basically this Bougie Nascurian model. So that completes our set of equations that define our problem. First, we start with some dimensional analysis. So we introduce these following characteristic values. So u. Characteristic values. So the particle velocity, R, the radius, eta is the viscosity of the bulk, and gamma naught, which is this surfactant concentration. And we obtain a number of dimensionless groups. So we have a Marangoni number, which tells us something about the strength of the interface of the surfactant versus box stresses. Then we have a Piclet number, which of course is a classical Piclet number, but now for an interface, so we have a ratio between A ratio between transports due to convection and due to diffusion. And we have two Business numbers. So one is due to shear, where we have this eta S, so the surface shear viscosity, and one is due to dilatation and compression, so we get this kappa S. And alternatively, we can also replace this BQ1 or BQ2 by theta. And sometimes it's actually a bit more, let's say, intuitive to think in terms of theta. have to think in terms of theta and here we define it as the ratio between bq bq2 and bq1 so we solve the governing equations using finite element method using this defen package that we have in our group that was developed by my team wilson we solve this using taylor root p2 p1 elements and we use gmesh to do mesh generation and the very nice thing about gmesh is that we can do very strong reflections We can do very strong refinement close to the particle. As you can imagine, a particle in Stokes flow has one over R decayed velocity field. So the wall, the boundaries of the box really need to be far enough away to not feel that velocity field anymore. And it becomes even worse for incompressible interfaces. So we actually did a long study, quite an extensive study, on the size of our domain to make sure they don't influence our results. I will show a slide on that later. On that, maybe. Of course, we started with mesh convergence. So, we did this for a clean and visited interface because then we can nicely compare to the Stokes solution. This is an example of a mesh. So, this is mesh M2. We have a whole range of meshes, as you can see here, that are gradually refined. And what you see, if you plot the divergence of the velocity at the interface, is that we get nice divergence to this analytical expression, which is due to the Stokes velocity. And also, the divergence. And also, the divergence field, the divergence of the velocity field at the interface looks very similar to the analytical solution. So, we're quite happy that our method basically predicts this stochastic solution very accurately. All the results that I will present are solved on this M4 mesh. So, as I told you before, this mounting box effects, we really want to make it large enough because Large enough because we don't want to have any influence of the walls. So, we did an extensive study on the domain size for an incompressible interface because we had this intuition that it might be more important for incompressible interfaces. And what you see if you go to basically a very large domain size of 6,400. So, this is 6,400 times the particle size. And this is really only possible due to this adaptive measuring of G-Mesh. To this adaptive measuring of G-mesh, because otherwise we will never be able to solve a large domain like this. And you see that this drag coefficient, as we define it here, nicely converges to a value of about 11.5 for an incompressible interface. All the results that I will show are on this domain of 3200. So we really ensure that there's only very minimal effects, basically so small that we can neglect them. And actually, what we solve, what I sold you in the government equations, are the steady state equations, and all the results I will show after the slide are steady-state results. But we actually solve transient equations, and we solve them until steady-state. And here you can see two sets of simulations. So, on the left-hand side, you see varying Pequen numbers, and we show the force, the dimensionless force on the particle for varying Pequen numbers as a function of time for Mangoni number of 10. And on the right-hand side, we do the same. And on the right-hand side, we do the same, but then varying Marangoni number for fixed Pictland number. And what you see is that the solution reaches a steady-state value of about in about 20 time units. And the time unit here is basically equal to a particle radius. So because we scale the velocity, the time with velocity and radius, basically a steady state was reached on the left-hand side in about 20 radii, and on the right-hand side, even faster. On the right-hand side, even faster, especially when you increase the marine bombing number. So, we really make sure by evaluating these plots that our solution is in steady state. The first set of results are then for surfactant-laden inviscid interfaces. So there's no surface viscosities here. And we basically vary for a fixed weak land number, the Marangoni number. And what you see is that when increasing the Marangoni number, basically the surfactant concentration, which you can see here on the y-axis. Which you can see here on the y-axis, and on the x-axis is the spatial coordinate. You see that this variation of surfactant becomes very small for increasing mangoni number. And the reason for this is, of course, that mangoni stresses want to restore interfacial gradients. They make the interface more incompressible, and that's nicely confirmed by this result. But it's not only Marloni number that plays a role, it's also the Piclet number. Number that plays a role, it's also the Piclet number because you can have a very high Marangoni number, but if Piclair will just diffuse all the surfactants around, it will still allow the end space to be compressible. So, also the Piclanum actually plays a large role. The Picland number also needs to be large enough, I think there's a mistake here, I think this should be upset, sorry for that. Large enough to make sure that the interface is incompressible and the surfactant concentration stays different. Okay, so we have a set of results for Piclaire and Marangoni. And what we try to do in the following figure is basically run a lot of these simulations. So this plot shows basically 800 simulations. So 800 points in these plots. And we then interpolate in between these points. On the y-axis is the PICLAN number. On the X-axis is the Marangoni number. And these contour lines then tell us something. And these contour lines then tell us something about the compressibility of the interface. So, the color is basically how compressible is the interface. And already in the literature, you can find that this product of Eclair-Marangoni is very important in determining compressibility, but it was never really quantified. So, how much compressibility do we actually get for a certain value of peak latt times Marangoni? And in this plot, we nicely basically quantify that. We indeed show that this ratio of We indeed show that this ratio of Piclair, sorry, this product between Picclin Marangoni is very important in determining the compression of the interface. And when you go to a value of about 40, which is this line here, so then we have compressibility of 0.1 with respect to the clean interface, then you basically get two incompressible interfaces. And this result actually was very nicely shown also in a very Very nicely shown also in a very recent experimental paper from M. Moulai et al., who's from Kathleen Steeves' group at UPenn, where they look at Brownian colloids, a lot of Brownian colloids at the interface. They basically take snapshots of them and they look at correlation by basically looking at displacements of these particles. And by doing that, a lot of times for every particle, you can pull out a velocity field. And the velocity field then looks. And the velocity field then looks like this. And on the bottom left here, and on the bottom right here, they show a purely compressible interface and a purely incompressible interface. And what you see is that indeed for these colloids here, the interface is basically incompressible. And maybe the interesting fact is that this was done for a so-called clean system. But actually, even if you do your best and you clean your system as much as you can, there will pretty much always be There will pretty much always be traces of surfactant in there, which makes the interface incompressible. And just to show you that this is consistent with our previous results, the Mangot times Picland number here was around 40, which was on the border of what we would call incompressible or not. So it nicely confirms these results on the previous slide. Another very important limiting case, of course, is incompressible interfaces. And we actually now have two routes to interface. Actually, now we have two routes to interface incompressibility. So, we can basically use these Marangoni and Biglin numbers to make our interface incompressible. And that's what we show you here. So, on the x-axis here is the Marangoni number. On the y-axis is the drag coefficient. And what you see, if you increase the Marangoni number, that you go to some converged value. And of course, as I told you before, your peak LAN number also needs to be high enough. So, basically, this value. Enough. So basically, this value is the value for an incompressible interface. And we get a value of about 11.5. And if we then do the same with our viscous stresses, so basically we have this gravitational viscosity, which can of course do exactly the same. It can also make the interface incompressible. We get the following plot. So we start a very low Business-S number. So the second Business-S number, which is the one that controls compressibility. We go through a transition. So this is basically the Stokes solution. So, this is basically the Stokes solution. We go to a transition around with an S2 of one, and we go to the same value of 11.5. So, the conclusion of this slide is that it doesn't really matter how you make your interface incompressible. This drag coefficient will always get the same value of around 11.5. Of course, with numerical simulations, it's nice that we can interrogate the velocity fields in a lot of detail. The first velocity plots, so, this is compressible. So, this is compressible interfaces, this is incompressible interfaces. You can see the similarity with these results from the Steves group as was published recently. And there's some other fields that we show here. We're not going to too much detail here. The shear field is actually quite interesting to see how this changes. And of course, you can see the divergence of the velocity field, the surface divergence. Here you have clearly stronger compression and. Stronger compression and dilutation of the interface. Whereas here, these islands are basically due to numerical accuracy, but the values are not that high. So, basically, our interface is incompressible. There's another interesting thing that we can do, of course, is because we solve our equations in a bounded domain, we can also take a look at what happens when we actually make our domain smaller. So, if we do that and we look at small Bougaines numbers, what you see is that. Small Bousiness numbers, what you see is that you basically get a vortex at the interface. But if you make your first Bousiness number very high, so you get a very large shear deformation, sorry, shear viscosity of the interface, it basically wants to avoid shear deformation of the interface and this vortex at the interface is completely gone. And keep in mind that the interface can be compressible. So these streamlines might never happen in bulk, of course, but at an interface this can happen. Bulk, of course, but then an interface can happen. And it does this just to avoid shear deformations, of course. So, what's the effect of interfacial shear viscosity? And so, we saw something in the bounding domain, but if you increase only the shear Business number, so the first Business Net number, you basically see that your drag coefficient will diverge at a certain value. And basically, this is just the Stokes paradox. So, there's no solution of a viscous interface at a very high business number, of course. At a very high business number, of course. And again, if we look at the surface compression for different values of the shear business number, you get this interesting pattern where there is not a big influence on the compression by only changing the shear business number, but you do see some influence at the lower busyness numbers, basically. Of practical interfaces are actually, of practical relevance are actually interfaces where this theta value, so the ratio. Where this theta value, so the ratio between the business numbers is on the order of one. Here are two plots of a business number, first bousiness number of one. We vary theta, so to go from 10 to the minus one to 10 to the 10 for different Piclet numbers. And what we show in this plot basically is that depending on your Piccolin number, the force that you get can be either very sensitive to this theta value, so it can basically be useful as a reunion. Basically, be useful as a rheometer because it is sensitive or not sensitive at all. So, it really depends on the effect of mangoni stresses, how useful it is to use a particle probe, for example, to measure the interfacial devotational viscosity. And again, we can look in more detail at fields. I think, in view of time, I will not go into much detail into these fields. So, that brings me to the conclusion. So, that brings me to the conclusion. So, I hope that I showed you that surface compressibility has a very large effect on the drag on the particle at an interface. Surface incompressibility or compressibility can be due to mango stresses, surface viscosities, or of course you can have a combination of both. You can have a bit of contributions from viscosities, a bit of contributions from mangoning stresses. And due to this coupling between these different effects, it's actually very difficult to extract interfacial parameters. To extract interfacial parameters by only using this setup, especially if you consider effects of compression. So, if you only look at shear, for example, there are setups of the square groups where they have a particle and they rotate the particle. So, you're not compressing the interface, you're only shearing it, then of course it's a different story. But for translating particles where you do get effects of compression, you have to be very careful. So, as a final note, I want to mention that this work has been recently published in. This work has been recently published in Physics of Fluids. Of course, I want to thank all the co-authors on this work: Maison Porali, who's the grad student, Martin Kruger, Jan Vermont, Patrick Anderson, and myself. And with that, I would like to thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you very much, Nick, for an interesting talk. Just waiting for some questions to appear in the chat. I might have a chat i might have uh uh some some some curiosity so you you well you you assume that the the the interface is completely flat so can you this under under under i mean i i would assume that there could be some effects close to the surface that uh produce some local curvature so can you can you yeah the the main assumption that we make there is um uh that the contact line doesn't slip That the contact line doesn't slip. So we have basically a pinned contact line. So if the contact line is fixed, then the fact that the capillary numbers in these problems are generally extremely low, these two effects combined will basically make sure that the interface only has to deform an extremely small amount to resist the torque that's acting on this particle. So this interfacial deformation. So, this interfacial deformation, we calculated it, is so small that the planar assumption is quite valid. There might be other, of course, irregularities of the particle in real life, which where you get maybe not a perfectly smooth contact line. In general, that will increase the drag force. That's I mean, it will will increase the amount of dissipation around the particle, but it becomes quite a complex problem quite quickly. So Complex problem quite quickly. So I think it will be nice, for example, to look at curved interfaces. I think that would be a nice extension of this work, just to see what happens there. That would be a nice extension. But interfacial deformations for colloid set interfaces are really very small. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, so when you say it's small, when you say small, you refer to the specific size of the particle at the interface. So you mentioned the words color. interface so you mentioned the word color so you are you are you are you are estimating this quantity for particle in the range the range of microns yeah so typically we are interested in in in micrometers scale part okay but in the in that in that regime could also have the diffusion of the colloid maybe play a role or or not yeah that actually that's a good point that's that's something we we didn't include here so you you basically can Basically, can think of this problem as a particle that's being forced by a magnetic that's strong enough to make sure that diffusion is not important enough. Still, I also think that even this problem without diffusion is interesting for the diffusion problem, let's say the microeology problem, because hydrodynamics also play a role there, as you saw in this paper from the Stevies lab. But you're completely right. The fusion interfaces for these small The fusion interfaces for these small particles will probably pay a role if the particle velocity is not fast enough. Okay, good. So there is a question also from Mike Gran. Maybe, Mike. Yeah, actually, I'll hold off on my question. I can ask that in the discussion or something because we're already cutting a little bit into our lunch or dinner break, which is already short to begin with. So I'll hold off. Okay, good. So if there are no other questions, I think that we can conclude officially this morning, so to say, session. If there are no
