Been a good friend and collaborator of mine for many years. So, we're definitely, yeah, we're all excited to hear him speak. He'll be talking about recent progress in the study of the Prandtl system and the zero viscosity limit. So, please take it away. Okay. So, first I want to thank the organizers for this invitation. I'm very honored to be talking here. So, this is a joint. So, this is a joint work with Samir here from Princeton. Also, related some other works that I will talk about are works with Enlord Dalibar, some work with David Gerard Vare and Yesuon Rori Mayakawa, and also works about singularity with the sharp colour. With the sharp colour, Tejidinkool, and the slim brownie. But I'll be mostly talking about the work with Semir. Yeah, so I like to start by mentioning few important issues, at least from my point of view in fluid mechanics, that I think we should be trying to understand more. Some of these questions are the stability of simple flows, the long-time dynamics, also questions related to transition between laminar and turbulent flows. So the talk of today is about inviscid limit, some of the talks also we heard about the blow-up and boundary length separation. So all these are So, all these are, I think, important questions in fluid mechanics. So, today I'll be mostly talking about the question about inviscid limit. Yeah, just to illustrate some of this question about stability, like this picture about stability of a vortex, like also A well-known thing is about the red spot of Jupiter, which is, I mean, the reason this exists is related to the stability of this structure. So, I mean, this is a whole description about it. Maybe I will skip it. But the reason we are able to see the structure. To see this structure, and this structure has been seen for centuries, is related, is a stability question at the end. Now, the transition between turbulent and laminar flow, I mean, sometimes you see a flow that starts laminar, then there is a transition, it becomes turbulent, and then it may go back to a laminar flow again. Flow again. It's not a very nice picture, but it shows that sort of transition between laminar and turbulent flows. So today's talk is more about boundary layer. So we are all familiar with this kind of picture about the flow past the wing of an airplane. You see here. You see here two kinds of flows. Like there is a flow on this side. Here we have what we call boundary layer separation. So the flow separates from the boundary and then here it becomes a turbulent flow. On the other side, from this side, below the wing, you see that the flow is nice and laminar and there is no Laminar, and there is no separation. So, my talk today is more about this region, about the region where things are nice and basically the fact that Navius talks can be approximated by Prentor. So, this the talk of today is this. I mean, this is a different talk, the boundary lens. Talk the boundary layer separation. Now, what's the starting point? So, the starting point is the Navier-Stokes system in half space. So, this is the transport term, the pressure, the viscosity, and then we have the divergence-free condition and the Dirichlet boundary condition, the fact that U. That U vanishes on the boundary. Now, the very natural question is: what happens when the viscosity goes to zero? What happens when mu goes to zero? Do solution of Navi stocks converge to a solution of Euler? Now, the real difficulty comes from the fact that for Navi stocks, you can import. For Navier-Stokes, you can impose that the whole vector u vanishes on the boundary, whereas for Euler, you can only impose that the normal part of the velocity vanish, because in Euler, you don't have the Laplacian, so it's not a parabolic equation anymore. So, this limit is not regular, and there is no hope to get conversion. To get convergence in strong topologies, because if you had convergence in strong topology, then you can pass to the limit in the boundary condition. Also, we expect the gradient, we expect the gradient of u nu to blow up when u go to zero. I mean, at least near the boundary, near the boundary, we expect. The boundary, near the boundary, we expect the gradient to become large. I mean, there is some sort of small scale present close to the boundary. So, Prentor in 1904 in the ICM actually proposed that away from the boundary, the Navier Stocks is well approximate. Navier-Stokes is well approximated by Euler. However, near the boundary, there is a scale, there is a square root of mu, there is a scale of square root of mu, where there is so-called a boundary layer. So meaning that the u nu will be approximated by some solution that. Solution that has the following scaling. So now, if one takes this Anzatz and plugs it in the Navier-Stokes equation, then one will see that capital U and capital V will satisfy some system, which is the Prandtl system. Just notice here that the square root of mu in front of the V here is to make sure that is to make sure that the uv is still divergence free right and also we expect the boundary um i mean we expect close to the boundary we expect um this capital u to be i mean we expect the velocity um we expect here something of size one whereas here we expect some something of size square root of mu Square root of mu. So now if one plugs this Anzatz in the Navier-Stokes equation, then we realize that capital UV will be solving the following system, which is the Prandtl system. I mean, at the end, you can think about it as a scalar equation because you can recover v from u through the divergence-free condition. free condition so i mean some sort of non-local uh non-local scalar equation i mean yeah i mean this term has some non-local effect um okay so so then we need to impose boundary conditions so u and v both vanish on the at the boundary and then um when when capital when capital y when capital y goes to infinity we expect our u and p to approach the euler solution the euler solution at at small y equals zero okay um now this is the final system i rewrote it here I rewrote it here. Now, there are many issues with this system. There are many issues with this system, even in terms of local existence. And if one looks at the literature about well-posedness of the system, we can realize that there are a lot of issues. And to understand it, I think one can just think about a very simple question, very simple, let's say, toy model, like if one tries to linearize this equation around the shear flow. So around a flow of this nature, just a function of capital Y. So if you linearize around this, you can So, if you linearize around this, you plug it in here, you get, I mean, this is a transport term, it's a nice transport term, but this term, when you linearize around it, what do you get? It will give you a term like this, u prime S V. So, this is the U prime S V. Now, this term, we said that we recover V. We recover V from U by integrating the divergence-free condition, meaning that you are thinking about V as some integral in Y of dxu. So V gains one derivative in Y, but loses one derivative in X compared to U. So clearly here, this term loses one derivative in X. So there is a loss of one derivative in X, but One derivative in x, but unlike this term, which is like a transport term, the term here that has this loss of derivative in x doesn't have a nice structure, doesn't have like an energy structure or anything like that. So this is all the difficulties about Prento are coming from this term. Now, in terms of if one looks at If one looks at well-posedness results, there are different kinds of well-posedness results. So there are results in the monotonic case, monotonic case, meaning that if U is monotone in Y. So it turns out that if U is monotone in Y, one can recover some sort of structure, some sort of energy structure to this term. First Olenik observed this by through a very complex This by through a very complicated transformation. More recently, like with, I mean, there are two kind of works that did this same thing, but in Sobolev space. So we were able in Sobolev space to find some nice energy in Sobolev space in the monotone case. Without monotone, it's Without monotonicity, the only kind of results are results that are in analytic regularity or in Jouvre regularity. So first in analytic regularity, there was works of San Martino Caflish, but then in Jouvre regularity with David, we had a result in Joe Frey regularity. Your result in John irregularity, then there are other results improving our result. One can also mix these two kinds of things, like the monotone case and the Jouvre case. And in general, there is ill-posedness in Sobolev regularity. So, this is like the state of the art, at least, in terms of local well-posedness for the For the parental system. There are many other results, I should say, like one can look at the 3D problem. There are results about long-time existence, smoothing effect. And slightly more recently, there are also results about singularity formation, trying to understand the formation. The formation of singularity in the parental system. The next question, after you get the well-posedness, after you get your well-posedness, the next question is, okay, why are we looking at rental? We are looking at rental because we hope that it approximates Navier Stokes. So the real question. So, the real question about Prandtl is to prove stability, meaning to prove that the solution of Navier stocks will converge to a solution of Prandtl when the viscosity goes to zero. Now, in terms of approximating, in terms of like proving that Navius solution of Navius talks converges to solution of Prenton, there are results. The work of San Martino Kaflis had also the fact that solution of Naviersov converged to solution of Prandtl in the analytic regularity. Here we need analytic in both X and Y. There are counterexamples in Sobolev regularity. There are results about About the justification of the so-called TS instability, also the optimality of the Jouvere irregularity. But I would say what one can learn about this is that if there is no separation and if one avoids the so-called TS instability, then the Parental expansion is valid. Expansion is valid. Okay. This is all what I'm talking about now is in the unsteady case. Now, let's move to the steady case. I mean, my talk will be mostly about the steady case. So let's move to the steady case. So the steady case, meaning that you are not, I mean, you assume that you have a solution which is independent of time. So, this makes a lot of sense. Like, if you look at the flow past the wing of an airplane, like for some time interval, you can think about it as being as a flow which is independent of time. So, it makes a lot of sense to study this by looking at the steady. The steady Euler. Now, this is steady Euler, this is the steady Navier stocks. Yeah, I'm slightly changing notations, changing just the Y notation, like meaning I'm using capital Y now for the variable for the Euler and Navi stocks. For the Euler and Navi stocks. When I move to Parental, it will be small Y. Okay, so this is exactly the same system that I wrote initially, but the only difference is that I'm getting rid of the time derivative. And now, what I am interested in, I am interested. I am interested in trying to pass to the limit from Navistocks to Euler, prove that solution of Navi stocks are approximated by solution of Euler. And I'm going to do this in this simplest case. So let's try to look at it in the very simple case. So the simplest case is you can take your Euler flow to be just one. Your Euler flow to be just one zero. So the most trivial Euler flow, one zero. This is your Euler flow. Now, your Navier stocks, you hope your Navier stocks will look like something like that. And you want to understand the limit when epsilon goes to zero. Okay, does u epsilon converge to this? U epsilon converge to this u bar, the solution of Euler. Okay, so I mean, this may seem like a very trivial question, but at the end it will not be. But let's start with the toy model, just to illustrate the presence, first the presence of the boundary layer. Now, if one looks at an ODE, if one looks If one looks at the following ODE, so this is a first-order linear ODE that has an explicit solution. So it's the following explicit solution. When epsilon goes to zero, u epsilon will go to one, like you can neglect this term. So you think that u epsilon will be one, which is the fact that this term, when epsilon goes to zero, this term goes. Goes to zero, this term goes to zero. So this is more or less for Navier stocks what we hope, like we hope that our solution of Navier stocks will be approximated by Euler plus a term of this nature. Of course, now instead of epsilon, it will be square root of epsilon, that appears. But besides that, we hope. But besides that, we hope that we have something that the one here is what plays the role of the Euler, but we hope to have something that plays the role of a boundary layer. Now, if you put the two together, that's what we usually call parental boundary layer together. So, when I write the parental system, it is really for the sun. For the sun. Okay, so this is where now I introduce the new variable small y equal capital Y over square root of epsilon. As I said, this is the opposite of what I wrote in the first part of the talk. And we hope that our solution of Navier stocks is approximated by Approximated by the Euler flow, the U-bar, the one zero, the trivial Euler flow, plus some solution of, sorry, yeah, yeah, I mean, like when I called here the trivial Euler flow plus something for which we'll try to close some energy. We'll try to close some energy estimates. I mean, at the end, what I'm going to do is slightly more like this thing: the U-bar, V-bar will be an approximate solution. So it will be not only the trivial Euler flow, it will be the Euler flow plus some parental correction to it. Okay. So now, what will be the be the what will be the equation satisfied by this u bar v bar okay so u bar v bar is i mean i mean the the way we'll do it is it will be some approximate solution that we'll construct but to leading order like if i want to look at this u bar the parental boundary layer this is the equation we have that i wrote already in the That I wrote already in the steady case. Now, in the unsteady case, in the steady case, it looks like this. As I said, it has to go to 1 when y goes to infinity, because that's how I recover that trivial Euler flow. Now, an observation, I mean, I think it goes back most likely to Olenik or maybe before her, but at least. Or maybe before her, but at least Olenik was the first one who took advantage of this, is the fact that one can think about x as a time-like variable if u bar has a sign. So if u bar is positive, so if you have a flow that moves in one direction, then you can think about x as a time-like variable, right? So And then we can even think about existence for short X and maybe blow up at some X, but that's what we call usually a boundary layer separation or global existence in X, meaning that you can solve till X going to infinity. So I'm here mentioning a little bit of literature about this equation. But again, as I mentioned earlier, this term comes also with a lot of difficulties because possible loss of derivative in X. I mean, if you think about X, I mean, if you think about x as a time, like this looks like a parabolic equation. This looks a parabolic equation. But this term has a derivative in x in it. So it's not even clear. I mean, but there is a transformation that if one applies that transformation, you can put these two together, these two x derivative, I mean the x derivative here and the x derivative here. Derivative here and the x-derivative here, you can put them together. That's what we call the von Miles transformation. But before going there, I'm mentioning few papers, physics paper. As I mentioned, Parental was the one deriving the system. Blesius was the one also constructing self-similar solution. Self-similar solution and the so-called BSCS profile, which will be important in this talk. Then, in terms of boundary layer separation, there are works going back to Kolstein Stewartson. I mean, we are not today interested in boundary layer separation, but I need to mention them. Now, in terms of mathematics, in terms of Mathematics, in terms of mathematics, this is like a degenerate quasi-linear parabolic equation. As I said, local well-posedness was due to Olenik, who used the von Meis transformation. There are global results. The boundary layer separation is the sorry, the yeah, the boundary. The yeah, the boundary, the separation. This was a result that they had with and lore. There are other results also studying the finite in X singularity. There's also question about recirculation. I mean, this is in going work with Samir also. But today, this is what we are interested in: the implicit limit. What happens when epsilon Limit what happens when epsilon goes to zero. Um, I mean, there are there were results by Yang Gu with Samir and results of David with Yeswunuri, also some results by Go and Zhang. But all these are local. What does it mean local? Meaning that they are only able to study the case where X is. Case where x is small. Our goal here is to get a global result. So global result, in a sense, it's two limits. There is the limit when x goes to infinity and the limit when epsilon goes to zero. So there is some sort of long time or long in X dynamics. X dynamic and the limit epsilon going to zero at the same time. Yeah, so before I talk about it, so what will be the other possibility? What will be the other possibility than getting a global index result? The other possibility is to have boundary layer separation. Which is this picture, like the fact that you can have a profile where u is positive, but then here the derivative, this derivative start vanishing, like the du over dy, du over dy start vanishing so that and And then you start changing sign. So, when you start changing sign, it's not even clear what it means to solve this equation. One has to re-understand, even like the well-posedness, how to pose the right question, and so on. So, as I mentioned, this. As I mentioned, this is like an ongoing work with Samir to try to understand some sort of behavior here. Okay, so, but today that's not our goal. Today, this is not our goal. And actually, I mentioned the work that I had with Anne Lord Dalibar, where we studied exactly what happened at this point, like trying to find. Point like trying to find the profile that describes the behavior here. Now, today we are in a situation where this doesn't happen, so the solution stays nice till x go to infinity, right? So, nothing of this type happening. Now, the blasiers in 1904, so like a few years. In 1904, so like a few years after Prenter wrote his equation, found self-similar profiles, so self-similar solutions to Prentor. So these are this is the self-similar solutions. I mean, one just solves this ODE. So So this is what they look like. So this is your Blessius profile. So again, if I try just to put the two things, the two possibilities together, one can expect either One can expect either some sort of separation, some sort of instability, or some sort of self-similarity or instability, meaning that your solution starts looking like the Beasius profile. So, I mean, of course, we can have more complicated kind of dynamics, but mainly this is this. Mainly, this is a nice dichotomy. And in general, the sign of the pressure, the sign of dxp can decide, like if dxp is positive, meaning minus dxp is negative. So if this term is negative, so you can see that if this term is negative, then it tries to push you to be. It tries to push you to become negative. So, and that's how separation can occur. Whereas, if this has the right sign, this has the right sign, you can expect that u bar will stay positive and things will stay nice. So, that's not completely wrong, but I mean, it's that's a good intuition about the equation. Equation. Okay, now I'm recalling our equation that we are interested in. I mean, this is the Prandtl system with U bar going to one at infinity. As I mentioned here, again, Olenik was the first to Was the first to write down existence results for the system. And then there is also work of Yangu with Samir. He am making the work with Dalibar about the separation, the dichotomy between the two cases. Like if DXP has the wrong sign, we can. If DXP has the wrong sign, we get separation. If DXP has the right sign, we have global existence, and the solutions start looking like self-similar solutions. Okay, so there is a work of SERIN proving that solution of parental approach displaces profile. Approach this plesius profile, and then there is also work of Samir studying. I mean, giving a more precise description. Maybe I go slightly fast on this. Now, the question we are interested in is what happens when the viscosity goes to zero. So now I'm going to the Navier Stocks system, not just the Prenton. And when, if one looks at the Navier's talks, I mentioned like there are results of Yango with Semiette's result, these other words that study the conversions of Navier stocks to Euler plus Prentol in the case where L is small. So, meaning that your interval in X. Your interval in X is small, in that case, they are able to prove the convergence from Navier Stokes to the parental system. Now, with our recent result is to say that we can do this, but We can do this, but globally in x, like x can go to infinity, meaning that, yeah, in these results also, normally one has to be imposing boundary condition both at zero and at L. Here we only need to impose some sufficiently nice data at x equals zero. Then we are able to prove the implicitly. The implicit limit, but we have a bonus also like we get the implicit limit, but we get also some sort of asymptotic stability uniform in epsilon when x goes to infinity. So this is two limits. One can fix epsilon and send x to infinity, or fix x and send epsilon to zero. Epsilon to zero. Okay. Okay. So this is more or less the result we have. Now, if I try to give a more precise version of the result, I mean, this is like a simplified version. Now, the more precise version of the result, the way also the result is proved, is that. Result is proved is that the U bar, V bar, I mean, will not be just a solution of the parental system, but we have to construct a slightly more precise approximate solution, meaning that my solution of Navi stocks, I have to, I mean, I have to, I mean, this is my solution of Navier Stokes, but written in the Prandtl variables, right? So I made the change of variable. So I made the change of variables. So then my solution of Navier-Stokes, I want to write it as some approximate solution. So the way one constructs this approximate solution is by solving Euler, Prandtl, Euler, Prandtl. Plant on. And then you get an error. Now, this error will solve some sort of linearized will solve a linearized parental system. And one has to close some energy estimates on this error term. Okay, so that's how at the end we will be able to prove this result. So again, the idea is. This result. So, again, the idea is first to construct a very accurate approximate solution, right? So, you construct a very accurate approximate solution, and then you need to close some energy estimate on the rest. Now, one can think that if one understands well constructing this approximate solution, then this will be enough. Then this will be enough. However, that's not the case because constructing the accurate approximate solution means that you are alternating between solving Euler, Prenton, Euler, Prenton. However, when you study the rest, you are solving the whole thing together. So you are solving the Navier stocks. And while solving Euler or solving Prandtl is more or less like a scalar kind of equation, when you are solving Navier Stokes, it's more like on the vector level. And this comes with actually a lot of difficulties. Okay, so this is the plan. This is the plan. And maybe I still have like, okay, so I'll try now to go through some of the Some of the ideas about the pro, I mean, about the energy, how we are, what kind of energy we are going to build. Okay, so of course, what I didn't precise also is what I mean by nice initial data at x equals zero. But okay, I'll try to explain it later. But here, here again, I'm saying I'm making estimates about the approximate solution. So what we are constructing here, the terms we are constructing, the approximate solution we are constructing, they They satisfy this kind of decay in X. So this is for the Prandtl part. Now, the Prandtl part solves some sort of heat equation, some sort of parabolic equation. So even the kind of decay we are getting here is a decay similar to the decay of the decay. Similar to the decay of the one-dimensional heat equation. Okay. So, I mean, if one replaces by the heat kernel, this is the kind of decay you get. So, you see, like one derivative in x gains you one over x, one derivative in y gains you one over square root. Gains you one over square root of x. Whereas the Euler part is more like of the hyperbolic nature. So derivative in x and y, they are of the same type. Like you gain the same decay. Of course, now the Prento is that you have the variable small y for the Euler. For the Euler, you have the variable capital Y. Also, one other thing we get, which was already known in a sense, the fact that the Parental will approach the Blacius, but here we need slightly more precise estimates here. And our And our last result, I mean, like if I put everything together, is the fact that the Navistock solution will approach the parental profile. Okay, so of course now, Navi Stocks approaches the parental profile, the parental solution approaches blaziers. So it means also that Navier stocks, in a sense, will approach. In a sense, it will approach Blesius when x goes to infinity. Which I think was not known, like the fact that solution of Navier stocks will approach the Blasius profile. So, I mean, in a sense, if one wants to understand the picture at the initial X, you are taking Initial X, you are taking a solution of Navier Stocks. I mean, this is like what I mean by nice initial condition. You take a solution of Navier Stocks, which is close to some U-bar, which is the initial data for Prandtl. And you want the initial data of Prandtl also to be close to the Blasius profile so that we know that U-bar will approach. That u bar will approach u bar b, the blazes profile. So initially, you have this, and what you are expecting when x goes to infinity that the three of them will be close to each other. I mean, ideally, I would have another axis that represents epsilon, but okay, I mean, it's already difficult like this, so. Already difficult like this, so let's not do it. Um, okay, now let's look at some elements of the proof. Um, okay, what I said earlier, like what I'm calling U bar, I mean, there is maybe a small confusion, what I am calling U bar and v bar. At some point, I'm you know, I'm thinking about u bar, v bar as. About u-bar, v-bar as the solution of the parental system. But now I'm more thinking about u-bar, v-bar as the whole approximate solution. And then I'm trying to close estimate on UV. Okay, so we have to think in both ways. Like either U bar, V bar is just the solution of Prandtl. Solution of Prentor, or U bar, V bar is the whole approximate solution. But what we are interested in in any case is that we want to linearize the Navier-Stokes system around this U-bar, V-bar profile. Okay, so if one does this, we will get some linearized. Some linearized equation. As I said here, either I'm thinking about u bar, v bar or the approximate solution. The main term is the leading, I mean, is the solution of the parental system. The one I wrote at the beginning here, just to recall it, is this solution, the first one. This solution, the first one. So, the whole thing is to understand the linearization around this solution. Okay, so this is the linearized equation, and then I have a non-linear term, the non-linear term, and I have a forcing F. The forcing F comes from the fact that U bar V bar is Bar V bar is not a solution of Navier stocks, but it is some sort of approximate solution of Navier stocks. And then you need to close some energy estimate on UV. Now your linearized operator looks like this. So it has the viscosity. The viscosity term and it has some sort of transport kind of term. Laplacian epsilon here, it's really scaled Laplacian because now I am in the rescaled variable. Okay, so now we seek spaces. Normally, one should try to find spaces X and Y where one Where one can find some nice energy estimate. Now, what are the difficulties here? Now, this is a system of equations. It's Navier-Stokes. This is Navier-Stokes. The main part of this linearized operator is what's coming from Prantol. Now, Prantol. Now, parental, at the parental level, the important terms are this one and this one, the U bar V, with the DYY, the DYY coming from here. This is what normally we have at the Prenton level. In the vorticity form, I mean, like we get, we is usually written in this way. Usually written in this way. I mean, when you take another DY, there is another cancellation. There's a cancellation when you apply a DY. And usually we think about it in this term. And we think about it as a Rayleigh, so-called Rayleigh operator and Erry operator. I mean, a lot of recent works on Prentol took advantage of splitting between so-called Rayleigh operator and every operator. Operator, every operator. So again, here I'm talking about trying to understand the linearized operator of the Navier-Stokes dynamic. So one has to try to relate this linearized operator to this scalar equation. I mean, of course, as I mentioned, I mean, of course, as I mentioned, even at the scalar level, understanding this linearized operator is highly non-trivial. So, pushing this to the system case will require some new ideas also. Now, the recent works about the small X case was based on Was based both on an idea of splitting. So an idea about solving really Ari and some sort of infinite iteration. So there is some idea of infinite iteration hidden somewhere. So now, if I go to the Naviestok's case, so I'm still having, maybe I'll just take two minutes to just explain one idea that we had to come with. So, one difficulty at the Navistox case is that we don't have a von Miles transformation. Von Miles transformation. Transformation. Von Miles transformation works well for Prentor, but we don't have a von Miles transformation at the Naviostox level. So somehow we had to understand the cancellations that are happening at the parental level and try to see what they can correspond at the Navier Stocks level. So maybe I'll go fast on. Maybe I'll go fast on this. I mean, this is really a little bit recalling what the one-miles transformation is at the parental level. And that what a little bit motivated the following change of variable at the Navier Stocks level. It turns out that these quantities at the Navier stocks level have slightly better. They have slightly better decay, they have slightly better coercivity. We can prove a better coercivity estimate on them. Basically, this is the kind of multiplier we use. So, if we use the following multiplier with the linearized operator, we get some coercivity estimate. Okay. So, how much time I have? Two minutes? Yeah. Just finish up. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So let me finish with two things. First is this kind of I mean, if one looks at the 1D heat equation and you want to understand the long in X behavior, this is the kind of energy you can write. Like you can write energy at the step zero and you put weights, right? Whenever you start taking derivatives in Y, you will be putting weights. If you take derivative in X, you put a slightly different weight. But this is how But this is how you can do weighted estimates because you expect and this is consistent with the heat kernel. I mean, if you take, I mean, if you write down the solution of the heat equation With the Gaussian and so on. These estimates are consistent with that behavior. So we had to come out with energy estimates that are motivated by this. So we get something really much more complicated, of course, because we have to incorporate also the von Maals difficulty. The von Maes difficulty, the fact that there is another normally we Fact that there is another normally we in the parental system, we have the other term that loses an x derivative. So, this is at the end our energies much more complicated. So, we had, as here, we had like energy at the at the zero level, at the one half, one one plus a half, same. So, we had to come up with energy of that same. Of that same like integer, half integer level. There is one last idea that I want to mention is that to close the estimate at the highest order, we had also to come up with a right change of Um coordinate okay, let's see yeah okay yeah so here we had to do the same kind of transformation that we did, the same kind of transformation that I explained earlier, but we had to do it at the non-linear level, not just at the linear level. Linear level, which is like remain, I mean, the same as what we see in also dispersive equation, like in posi-linear dispersive equation, sometimes you have to do this same kind of things. Okay, so maybe I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thanks, Anna. Thanks a lot.
