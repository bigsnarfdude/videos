Now, I have the pleasure of introducing one of my colleagues, David, who will speak to us about some work that he's been heavily involved in over the last three years. Hi, everyone, and thanks for the invitation. So, my name is David Chopodon. I work as an infectious disease modeler at the Public Health Agency of Kerala. So, the talk I'm going to give is not going to be very technical. It's going to focus on two things. Two things. First is going to be on the wastewater data, this new stream that we have as academic modelers. And the second thing is about how we collaborate, like we, like, at least our team, the modeling team like PHAC, with academics. And I thought it was a good venue here to talk about that because there are many academics in this room. And maybe, and for some of you, you are very familiar to how to work with us, but maybe some of you, some But maybe some of you, some others are not that familiar to work with us. And I think it would be a good opportunity for me also to showcase the disability that we have to work with academics and also the fact that it's been, I mean, in my experience, all the projects have been very focused. So, and I think on both sides, so both on our side, we had a lot of help from academics, but also I think from the academic side, side you you you know I think we asked for we ask some practical questions okay so so we are all familiar with the clinical data right and expect many people are going to talk about it and this is what I maybe I could try to have a pointer at the end so um like the that's what I call plain vanilla AP modelling which is obviously like you know Which is obviously like maybe a bit a simplificative way to describe it. But what I mean is that we are all very familiar with medipididic modeling using clinical data. Now with wastewater data, and I assume that most of you have heard about wastewater data, I mean the surveillance basis of wastewater data, but I'm just going to go to run through the processes. So something which is actually So something which is actually highlighted during the COVID pandemic is that you have a respiratory virus, like SARS-CoV-2, which actually is shed by infected individuals through the stool. So when you think about that, it's already like something that is a bit mind-blowing because it's a respiratory virus, it's not an artery virus. And we are also looking into influenza LRSV, DNA, and let's see, it's And it's the same, right? So we are shedding respiratory parallels through the fecal route. And we are shedding enough such that we can follow, at least we could follow, an emerging epidemic through the wastewater. That's also something which was really, I would say, surprising. Five years ago, who would have said that? So you have this variable. So, you have this virus which is shed, and it's going to have its journey through this huge network of sewer. You can imagine a big municipality like Winnipeg, Toronto, or even a smaller one. And so, many things are going to happen to this virus. And then you have also the sampling, the way you are going to sample the wastewater. So, for practical reasons, we can sample like the wastewater treatment plant. Sample at the wastewater treatment plant because it gathers a very large area. Or you can, as it mentioned earlier, sample at the building level, depending on your question. But even also the sampling methods, like you have so many sampling methods that are going to affect your concentration, your variant concentration. You have also the lab work, so how you are going to extract this RNA from the wastewater sample. I'm not a lab person, but the little I understood is an. Person, but the little I understood is that it's very complicated, and not everybody agrees on the methods. And then, so you do that, and then the lab sends you the magic number, if you want, the variant concentration in wastewater. And then they do that day after day. And you end up with a time series, right? Like the same time series that you can have with the clinical reports. You have a time series of viral concentration in wastewater for whatever virus you write or think about. Whatever bias you write or say think about. Again, like what I want to highlight here is as epidemic modeler, it's the first time we have this kind of time series, right? And this time series is actually depending on many things we have never encountered before with the clinical data. So we could have also like a very naive approach with the clinical data and say, okay, we count people who are sick, and then this is reported, and we know that it's a fraction that is. Reported, and we know that it's a fraction that is not reported, and so on. Even with the clinical data that I think most of us here know fairly well, when you start to dig into the details, it's complicated, right? The delays, the heterogeneity in reporting, and so on. Here with wastewater data, you have the same type of complexities. It's not just as simple as people, puts, and then you end up finding the barriers somewhere. Somewhere. You have processes, so physical processes, biophysical processes, that are coming in the way that are probably affecting this time series. So very time series you want to use to fit an IP model if your IP model is using wastewater data. So that's what we've been trying to do in our group, trying to really deep dive into wastewater data and trying. Data and trying to understand why it is so variable. So it is variable, so it's no secret, right? And here I've highlighted some, no, just for the city of Winnipeg, but it could be any city. So that's the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 recently, right? I mean, it's just a recent time series. And that's on the log scale. And you see that, I mean, the And you see that, I mean the arrow here is pointing to a peak. And what we really want to understand, and you have another peak over there, like one which is downward, we want to understand what, I mean, is it just like noise? Like, do you have to live with this noise, with the wastewater data? Or can we try to actually try to dissect, so this is what this picture he is doing, trying to dissect all these. To dissect all these processes and try to understand what kind of uncertainty or variation each process is going to bring to this final time series we are interested in, the concentration, the variant concentration. And to understand that, when you start to talk with people who are involved in wastewater for other purposes, like people have been looking, of course, at wastewater for a long time. At wastewater for a long time, for pollens, for narcotics, and so on. And you end up talking with people who are, well, we are in opium, but you end up talking with people who are in civil engineering, chemists, and also biophysics. And what we realize is that there are so many knowledge gaps that need to be filled to really understand that time series here. And this picture here is, I mean, This picture here is, I mean, I'm not sure if it's very clear, but it's a kid who's pointing, like trying to find its way in a maze. And I think that's how we feel right now, at the moment, is we are trying several directions, and maybe some of them are going to lead to dead end, but trying to, again, dissect all the processes of the wastewater level. But in this scientific exploration, we are reaching out and we reach out for help. Out and we reach out for help because we don't have all the skills and expertise in-house. And so we reach out to academics, people like you. Because why would we need, why would we seek help? So we don't have the expertise, we don't have the time, we don't have the resources, so sometimes the soft softwares needed, we don't really have them. And also access to that, right? And sometimes the academy can Sometimes the academy can help us to access some of the data that we need. And I think there are mutual benefits in this kind of collaboration. Well, for us, the benefit is that obviously that academics bring expertise. FAC brings, I think, a research question, like practical research question. So if your area of research is fairly practical and you want to, that can be interesting. We are also aligned with one of your main goals. With one of your main goals, which is publications, we're also encouraged to publish, and to do everything in open source. So, most of what we do end up being on GitHub. There is also the funding part. So, I mean, so far we've been fairly well funded, and we can also share that with academics. I'm not too sure how long it's going to last, but but that's still uh you know, uh uh how can I say, a diversification, so for academics to to work with us and get a little bit of funding with with us. Get a little bit of funding with us and from us. And to collaborate with us, you have like several vehicles, and it depends really on how, I mean, what are your constraints and what are our constraints to. You have contracts, so contracts which is going to be between ENML or PI and the university. And as an academic, as a PI, you are the main person representing the university. Then you can also have your student work. Have your student work on those projects, and some of the projects are really accessible to undergraduates or graduate students. So, you have the F-SWEPS and COAPOLA. FSWEPS stands for Federal Student Work Experience. And just as a note, there is no reason why your students wouldn't apply to these F-SWEPs. Just take three, four hours of the time. If they have a good CV, they can just take like, well, I mean a good CV. If they have already their C V They have already their CV well updated and well detailed. It's just a copy paste on this website. And it's a pool of students, and then we just are going to pick from the pool, depending on the project. And co-op depends on the program. You have also granted contribution, which is a little bit more less usual, but these are codes that PHAC or LML are passing. Or NML are sending, and then we can identify academic groups that can work on that. And of course, you have the NSERP and CIHR rails. So that's not, I mean, we could be collaborators, right, with that. And we can also bring some value to a project. Okay, so now I'm going to go through the examples. So that's going to give you an idea of what we work on to better understand. Work on to better understand the wastewater data stream, which again is, you know, I think it's just the beginning, and some of the projects may be, you know, maybe to dead end. Okay, so that was the first project that we worked on. And the question was fairly naive. It was, you know, it was at the beginning of the wastewater surveillance and. Of the wastewater surveillance, and we were seeing these time series, which were kind of fairly variable. And along with the viral concentration, we had also other data, other metadata, if you want. We had the temperature of wastewater, the pH of wastewater, TSS, which is a fairly well-known metric in this wastewater world, which is the total suspended solids. So, what's the mass of the solids in suspension in the wastewater? Of the solids in suspension in the wastewater. And that's very important for another project I'm going to talk about in a few slides. So the question was very narrow. Can we do some kind of a regression which is going to take into account those multiple covariates, such that you just try to have the main trend of wastewater. And the goal for this project would be really to support a trend analysis of wastewater simulation across countries. Trend analysis of wastewater signal across cameras. So we did that fairly early in the pandemic. We collaborated with the University of Calgary, so it was Professor Chik Wo and Professor Liu, and they had a postdoc working on it who did most of the heavy lifting, Zao Shantai. And so I'm just putting there the equation just to say that there was something there is a paper. Was something that there is a paper, so the paper was eventually published. But so I think, like, beyond all the details of the model, what I think was really great about this exercise was this posterior probability. So, what we ended up having the model calculate is the probability that the variable sotation this week is higher. The variable concentration this week is higher than the concentration that we observed last week. Just simple, right? It's just one number. And then we have here the time series of probability for different location, sampling locations in Canada. And really what we wanted to understand is is it and maybe it goes back to what what Etsy was was talking about, is to try to communicate a simple number. To try to communicate a simple number. So, like the variable concentration in the wastewater, there is a 70% chance that it's higher than what we were seeing last week. So, just to get down to that very simple communication. Just in terms of details, it was in the form of a contract. So, this project was a contract between the University of Cabiana and us. And the delivery. us and the deliverables were a draft manuscript which again was published in scientific report and we have also the arcode of all the of all the projects so we can run it on our site so now it's a second second project so this one is a little bit different so A little bit different. So, as infectious disease modeler, so I mean we are going to talk a lot about data. We want to have data to inform our model. And here, what we try to do is try to collaborate with a group which is going to generate the data that we need. It's really like imagine how would you do that in a clinical setting, with clinical data, is you would set up, as a DP modeler, you would set up your own analysis. Set up your own surveillance system on a campus, right? And you would have your incidents observed from that. So here it's a bit the same, not exactly the same, but for wastewater. So what I mentioned earlier is the viral particle in wastewater, s take for example SARS-CoV-2, they they they attach to uh little solid particles. Little solid particles, think of little grain of sand. And depending on the size of those particles, of the mass actually of those particles, that may change the dynamic. So what I mean by that, imagine that all the SARS COVID-2 particles would attach to very light solid particles. Then the stream of water, I mean, those light particles those light solid particles they are not going to settle down. Solid particles, they are not going to settle down in the pipe. They are just going to travel up to the sampling point. Now, the other extreme is if they attach to very fairly massive particles, like think about pellets or something like that, then those particles are going to settle down in the pipe. But you still have your SARS-CoV-2 to attach, right? You still have your RNA fingerprint on that. And now, so, well, they settle, and then imagine. And then imagine also that you have a wastewater system which is combined with rainstorm, and then you have a big storm, and then you have all this rainstorm rushing through the wastewater pipes, that's going to recirculate those large particles, and they're maybe going to be bringing to the sampling location. So, what you're going to have is not SARS-CoV-2 as it was shared recently, but which SARS-CoV-2, which has been transported. Which Cells could be 2, which has been transported several days ago to the sampling point. So these are just hypotheses, right? I mean, I don't say that's what's happening. But that's exactly what the group at University Laval, so Peter van Boragen and his collaborator Sovanatik, they are doing a big project over there to try to understand that. So it's when I say you try to re-understand the processes that are going on. The processes that are going on. It's so, that's what it's illustrated here. It's called a lutriation experiment. So it's really trying to understand the distribution of the mass of the solid particles to which the SARS-CoV-2 is binding to. If it's binding to light solid particles, then maybe this effect of turbulent water is not very going to affect our time series of. Affect our time series of our concentration. If it attaches to larger particles, then maybe that's going to be a problem. So yeah, so that's one of the... And our goal really is really to have a better parameterization of our wastewater epidemic model. Try to think about the delay function which can be, I mean, which is going to be parametrized with rain events. That could be what's going to be. But maybe it's a not. But maybe it's not useful at all because maybe the outcome of their research is going to say, okay, it doesn't really matter. Because this is a project which is still going on. So they started early this year and they are going to end in March next year. And that was made, the vehicle here was a grant contribution. So it's another format to collaborate with us. So this third project This third project stems from work that Professor Philip Schmidt at the University of Waterloo did before we did the project with him. So basically in a lecture the question is can we quantify the uncertainty of the PCR-based variant concentration in wastewater from our surveillance? So if I just go back here, Here, at least at the LML in Canada, most of the quantification of the variant concentration in wastewater is done with PCR, with a PCR volume. So what we wanted to understand, and still this quest to understand what each process, the variability growth by each process. So here we wanted to understand, just like when you look at just the PCR assay. I say, what kind of uncertainty it brings to this variant concentration. So, again, in a nutshell, the PCR essay, if you want, is can you read it on experimental data? Before you run it, you put in known concentration of genes, and then you look at the cycle values. This is what is on the y-axis here. And usually, what is done is that And usually what is done is that people in the labs, they do a linear regression for these points here. But the problem is when you have a low concentration of your package G, doing these linear regressions, so you extrapolate, it's a bit tricky, right? I mean, tricky in the center here will be wrong. So he came up with another statistical framework, and again, there is a paper in Peru. Again, that there is a paper we published, so everything is online, which gives us a more realistic calibration of the QPCR. And more importantly, also, we have also these uncertainty intervals. And so we had one of we had a student, a co-op student, so the format of this collaboration was with our co-op, Jan Uzelik. Co-op, Jan Uzanik, who implemented this model into an R package. And implementing that in an R package for us is great because it's a very well-formatted deliverable, it's well documented, and it's actually a package that we are now trying to push in production. So the work done is really as a concrete outcome, at least at that level. And what I want to draw your attention on is that, sorry, here the figure is a bit smaller. I'm sorry, here the figure is a bit small, but usually what is reported is the mean concentration that was found in a wastewater sample. So imagine you have just a point here. But this tool here allows us to have these credible intervals, computers intervals. And you can see here that the interval can span between, in this example, so that's influenza A, Large Canadian City, between Between 20 and nearly, let's say, 50, right? Like the number of gene copies per minute. So it's quite a big range. And when you are looking at this data nearly every day, and you mostly either have trend analysis or you want to use this data to fit your model, having an understanding or of the of the kind of uncertainty you are dealing with at the moment, and this is just for PCR, this is just Q PCR uncertainty. This is just QPCR uncertainty. I mean, it gives you a, I don't know, like, it's better to be aware of the uncertainty, because it's too bad. And whereas later on in this time series, the uncertainty is very small. Now, another project which we're also working on right now is one of our goals is really to have this what we call these in silico simulations of the pseudo-dynamics. Simulations of the pseudo dynamics. So we want to have some kind of a simulation in a computer of end-to-end, right? I mean, you have people, people, sick people, they shed, you have rain events, this goes through the wastewater system, and you have the lab processes, and then you have your observed concentration. And we want to play with that to understand, again, those variations that we are observing in the wastewater time series. And this project here, And this project here focuses on one component. And we do that with York University. So it's a civil engineering department at York University. So that's with Professor Rusman Kahn and one of his PhD students, Everett Snyder. So here we have access to the detailed sewer network of Large TV. In this case, it's Winnipeg. Of a large TV. In this case, it's Winnipeg. These are like tens of thousands of paths, right? So there is no way we are going to model that. But we understood, like reading the literature of civil engineering, that there are ways to simplify this network into a very, like, bring it down to the essential. And so it's some kind of simplification with constraints. And so for sure, we are completely, we don't have the skills, right, at least in our world, to do that. In our group to do that. So, we have also staffed to the team of Professor Ken, who are actually delivering this simplified model for a given city. And this is all written in Python, so we can use that, and it's going to be documented. So, you can reuse that for maybe other cities. But at least to play with the the city of Winnipeg I mean, to play with the wastewater system of the city of Winnipeg, that's one of the main components here. One of the main components here. And we did that with a contract. And the final project that we are working on is, so I mean, some of us here are doing multi-strain modeling, right? I mean, whether you are looking at Frenz AA, H1N1, or H3N2, or SARS-CoV-2, and the different ages. And I mean, we know. Um and I mean we know that the surveillance the clinical surveillance uh from from uh uh the genomic surveillance uh uh clinical surveillance is uh is super useful but wastewater attack can also add to this information. So, but the problem is like and this is why I try to illustrate here it's it's very very complicated much more complicated because you have this population okay so this is good which like and which like and several parts of the populations are going to be infected with several engages. This is what I try to to illustrate here with people different colors. And let's say that there are like four main ages. And what I've depicted here with the different colours are just the mutations. But my point is that, okay, so they're all going to shed in the wastewater system. And let's assume that you are going to sample at the wastewater treatment plant. So get this huge sample from a community. Sample from a community of maybe a million people. And when you are going to do your sequencing, well, you are going to break that all these, like those genomes, you are going to cut them into small RNA fragments. Now, when you have that, it's going to be very difficult to reconstruct what lineage, especially the proportion of did we have more lineage A, B, or C or B. So, what we want to So, what we want to have is we want to have a very user-friendly tool that provides robust estimates of barrel lineage's proportion in wastewater. And to do that, we've teamed up with Devon Becker, who's a prof at Lorenzo University. And he used to work with us, actually, for a short amount of time. And he did look into this question a lot, and he has already developed a model. What we want to do with this project is take it to the next step. Do with this project is take it to the next step and use the spatial and temporal information that we have from the GNOB surveillance, the wastewater gene-beak surveillance at the NABAC. So we have GMB surveillance at several locations in time and we would like to exploit that to have more robust estimates. And that's going to be also in our package, so that's the contract form, but he's going to Contract form, but he's going to deliver on our package. Again, like our package are great for us because it's like plug-in and we can use it. Okay, so in summary, so just try to give you an overview of how scientific exploration tried to do with the wastewater cycle and how each university has helped us in the way. And what I want to emphasize here is that. Emphasize here is that, yes, so viral concentration in wastewater is a new data stream that you may or may want to use in your IP model. In our group, we try to really leverage that and really embrace this new data source and try to use it in a meaningful way. There are many knowledge gaps that we haven't even started to answer. Maybe for some of the projects who are putting Maybe for some of the projects who are going too deep, maybe not just advanced, like just looking at what's going on in the wastewater, maybe it's useless. So I presented wastewater, but there are many other topics that are being studied in our group, like climate change and so on. So I really encourage you that if you want to reach out to the people at PTAC to do not hesitate, and again, because these are usually These are usually fruitful contributions, right? I mean, these are like a really two-way collaboration. And there are diverse formats to collaborate, so there is a good chance that we can find a way to make that happen. Thank you.
