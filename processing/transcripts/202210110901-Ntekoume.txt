Thank you so much for the introduction and of course for the invitation. It's really nice to be here. So as the title tells us, today I'm going to talk to you about the derivative non-linear Schrodinger equation. So the first thing I should do is show you the equation itself. So here it is. So here it is, looks like this. So you can immediately understand where the name is coming from, right? So if you look at the linear part, that's a Schrodinger linear equation. And then if we look at the nonlinearity, we have a cubic nonlinearity, which also has a derivative. Hence, derivative, non-linear Schrodinger equation, DNLS for short. And we will be looking at this problem in one dimension in space on the lines. X will be our spatial variable. And we will be looking at them. And we will be looking at the problem with initial q0 that will be in some sublock space Hs. For what S we will see later. So this equation arises as a model in magneto-hydrodynamics, so it has physical significance. And we will be interested in the bulk process of this equation. Oops, wrong button. Okay, significant. Button. Okay, so getting started, where should we be looking to solve this problem in what space? So, first, this equation has the following scaling symmetry that I have written down here. So, if I take my solution q and I scale it like that for any positive parameter lambda, I'm going to get another solution. And we can check that delta norm is preserved under this scaling. So all the q lambdas have exactly the same delta norm. Lambdas have exactly the same L to norm as Q, hence the problem is L to critical. And the L to norm has yet another significance for equation here. The L to norm is preserved under the flow. So the L2 norm of Q at time T is the same as the L2 norm of the initial electron. So these two things tell us that L2 is a very natural and ambitious space to try to solve the problem. To solve the problem. So that's our target for this stuff, the critical space. But on top of the L2 norm, this equation has many more conserved quantities. In fact, it has an infinite family of conserved quantities. I have written down here just the first three of them. The first one is exactly the conservation of the L to Mormon that I was talking about earlier. We call it M. The second one is the Hamiltonian. The second one is the Hamiltonian. I have also written a third one, and there are many more. They all look like integrals of polynomials of Q and its derivatives, and we keep getting more derivatives as we keep moving down. And this is one of the features of this equation that tells us that it is completely integral. So, now a little bit about what was known when we started looking at this problem. Local positions has been known for quite some time in has been on for quite some time in spaces HS for s greater or equal to one-half, but this result comes together with a nil-postness result. So we know that below one half, uniformly continuous dependence on the initial data will break down. So that sounds bad since I said that we want to study this problem in L2 or as close to L2 as we can. That sounds bad, but it's not devastating because okay, we don't have uniform continuous dependence on the initial data, but we might. Continuous dependence on the initial data, but we might have just continuous descendants. So that's not too bad. However, it throws away certain techniques. We cannot use any contraction we can argue it. So we know them. Next, okay, so I told you about the local glow possess result. How can we use that to boost it into a global glow possess result? Well, the usual thing that one would want to do is use some conservation laws. So if we look at this local globalness, So, if we look at this local volposness result, the time of existence for any S depends on the H1 of the initial data. So if we can find a way to somehow use our conservation laws appropriately to bound the H1H norm globally, we would be very happy. And you might think, well, you have infinitely menet conservation laws, you should be able to do that, right? Be able to do that, right? And yet, even one of them really looks like an H12 norm. The problem is that these conservation laws, all of them except the first one, the L2 norm, are not queries, so they cannot really help us get bound for our solutions. Okay, so now I want to tell you some things of some global bosen results, what the state of the affairs were when we started, was moving. The affairs were when we started, was when we started looking at this problem. So, as I said earlier, we cannot just think the conservation laws have some limitations, they're not coercive, right? So what researchers have done was try to assume some more, so usually in the form of a smallness of the L2 norm. If the initial data is With the initial data, so that they can use the, now they can use the conservation laws to get bound. The first group of results that I have written down here is the first one that was shown. So we assume that the L2 norm, the square of the L2 norm is less than 2 pi, and then we can get global robustness up to h one half. And then it actually took decades to break this bound from 25. Break this bound from 2π to 4π. But it was possible. It happened the last 10 years. So now we know that under the assumption that the square of the altruism is less than 4π, we can have global composedness. Now you might wonder, why 4pi? What is 4pi? Where does it come from? So it turns out that it has some significance. It is the square of the L-to norm of the special solution of the equation of the algebraic. Of the equation of the algebraic soliton. And what we found out actually when we started looking at this problem is that it is not arbitrary. It is a threshold where the conservation laws are going to lose their efficacy and we actually have some very concrete evidence for that. So if we take the algebraic soliton, this one, and we rescale it using the scaling that I showed you earlier, then we're going to get a family of solutions, a one-parameter family of solutions. Parameter family of solutions, they will all have exactly the same values for all their conserved quantities. As we said, the square of the L to 1 will be 4π, and the rest of them will all be 0. So all their conservation laws agree, however, they are unbounded in HS for any positive S. And that tells us that there is no way we can use only the conservation laws to break these 4π threshold. This is the best that we can do in that case. Sorry? Oh no, okay, correct button. Okay. On the other hand, there is another line of research which yields results without any alto-normal assumptions using inverse scattering methods. However, in that case, well, there are some really amazing results in that direction, but we have to assume more regularity and special decay. And finally, around the same time that we finished our first Same time that we finished our first go at the problem, there was really a breakthrough of Papua Empire, which was published in 2022 and announced in 2020, that showed that we can have global well-positions in H1 half without any L-to-norm assumptions on the emission data. And of course, that relies heavily on the complete integral of the equation and not just on the conservation models themselves. And now we can see why that was necessary. Now, I want to show you. Now, I want to show you our main results. Okay, so we started looking at this problem. As I said, our goal is L2. What could go wrong? Well, the L2 norm cannot blow up. We have conservation of the L2 norm. What we should be afraid of is the L2 norm concentrating. And the key to help us avoid this is equal continuity. So we want a subset of ultimate. A subset of L2 is equally continuous if I take translations of Q by H and they converge to Q uniformly in Q in L2 as H goes to 0. So the first result that we proved with Rowan and Monica was that if we start with a set, a subset of L2 Q of initial data, that is equal to continuous, and it also satisfies some smallness assumption for the L2 node. This assumption for the L2 norm. So we want the square of the L2 norm to be less than 4π, the same as we saw before. Then, if we look at the following set, so we take any Q0, any initial data in Q, and we flow it for time t under DNLS, and then we take the collection of all these things. We call this set Q stars. It's all the states that we can reach by DNLS orbits originating from our. Originating from our set Q, then this set will also be equicontinuous inductive. So the NLS has equocontinuous orbits. That was the first result that we proved. Then this allowed us to prove a priori H's bounds for our solutions. So for any S between 0 and 1 half, if we have a set Q satisfying the L2 norm assumptions before bounded in HS, then we can bound the H's norm of We can bound the H's norm of the solution in terms of the H's norm of the initial data. And finally, using these HS bounds and some more, we were able to finally get a global well-posedness result in HS for S between 1/6 and 1/12. So, lower the regularity for which we can have global well-posedness. And once again, we have this L-More as. Eltimore assumption. So I want to point out here that even local velocities was not known below H. Yes? One question. What is your notion of global equipment? Ah, that's a good question. So the data to solution map extends continuously from sorts data. That's a good question. Okay. Okay. Yes. You mean continuity in time? Yes, yes, jointly. Joint continuity. Yes. Exactly. So one thing I want to point out here is we keep seeing this 4π assumption. I want to point out here that the only reason that we need it in this, in the H and the a priori H's balance and in the global boot position series. And in the global blue-processance result, is to insert the equicontinuity. Okay, so that means that if we could get an improvement of the equicontinuity result removing the L2 norm assumption, we would immediately get all of these things without the L2 norm assumption for arbitrarily large initial data. And that is exactly what happened. So around the time that we were finishing that work that I was showing you, the result of Pagre and Perlmon came out and the ideas And the ideas of this paper inspired the work of Ben Harper's Roman Kilip and Monica Bichan, who were able to essentially remove the L2 norm assumption from the continuity result and that immediately gives us global velposeness in H16 without any L2 norm assumption. And then the next ambitious goal that we decided to tackle together, the four of us, was showing that the evolution is global. Showing that the evolution is globally well caused all the way down to the critical space L. Okay, so these are the results, and now hopefully I will get a chance to tell you just a little bit a sketch of what is going on in some of the articles. Okay, so as you have probably guessed, our methods rely very heavily on the complete integral of the equation, and there are many ways in which this demonstrates itself. We already saw that We already saw that the existence of infinitely many conservation laws is one of them, and we already saw its limitations. The other thing is the existence of a Lux pair. So we have a pair of operators L and P that satisfy this equation if and only if the Q that we plug in here is a solution to the NLS. And that tells us that the spectral properties of the Lux operator L are preserved under the flow. And another And another characteristic of completely integrable equations is the existence of an inverse scattering transform. But we already saw that this has yielded very good results, but it is not available in our setting because we don't have this specialty key. So we will be relying on the LAGS formulation. So I have written here the LAX operator for you. This is the important one for us, not the other one. Important one for us, not the other one, not P. So I have written it down for Q, and when our Q is zero, we get this operator L0 here. So we consider the perturbation determinant given by this, the determinant of inverse of L0, L, and after certain renormalizations, we end up with this object here, A of kappa, the determinant of 1 minus i kappa lambda gamma, where lambda Lambda gamma, where lambda and gamma are given right here. Okay, okay, so this is the object that we're very interested in, and moreover, it will be very convenient to take the logarithm of that. So we get this quantity alpha of kappa, which is minus the logarithm of A. And the convenient thing about that is that it has a series expansion of this form. Okay, now, why do we care about those? Care about those. So, as it was shown already in the work of class and shipper, these are preserved under DNLS for every kappa. So, for every kappa, we have new conserved quantities. And we claim that these are more convenient to work with than the already existing polynomial conservation laws. So, one thing I want to show you is how alpha really. So, essentially, what I want to do in the next slide is show you how alpha helps us settle all the problems. So, first, how does alpha? So, first, how does alpha help us understand equicontinuity? So, a more convenient way to think of equicontinuity is as tightness on the Fourier side. So, we want the L2 norm or the square of the L2 norm of the high frequency part of Q to go to zero uniformly in Q as n goes to infinity. So, as we said, alpha has this nice series expansion. We said it is conserved under DNLS. And if we look at the first term, when L is equal to 1, At the first term, when L is equal to 1, which is a quadratic term in Q, remember each one of lambda and gamma has 1 Q inside there, we can actually exactly compute what that gives us. This gives us this thing here. Well, now if you look at what happens as kappa goes to infinity here, we get one half the integral of q hat squared. So that's not exactly what we want. We need to do another internalization. So what we do is we define beta of kappa to be the square of the L2 normal. Of kappa to be the square of the L to norm minus 2 times the imaginary part of alpha. Now, since the L2 norm is conserved and alpha is conserved, beta is also conserved under DNLS. And now if we look at the quadratic term of beta, we can see once again exactly what we get, and this is exactly what we want. This really captures the square of the L2 norm of the high-frequency part of Q. So we get. Of q. So we get that q is equal to continuous in L2 if and only if beta 2 of kappa goes to 0 as kappa goes to infinity uniformly in q. Now, the problem here, one comment I want to make is that, well, where does this 4 pi come from here? The 4 pi needs, we need this L to norm assumption here because the problem is, well, so beta, alpha has this series. Beta, alpha has the series expansion. Beta has a similar series expansion, right? And beta2 is the first term of the series expansion. We know that beta is conserved, but we don't know that beta2 is conserved. It's not. So really the hard problem here is showing that beta2 is really the leading term of this series. And that becomes very hard because L2 is the critical space. So we don't have a lot of smallness to control the k. And that's exactly where this L2M assumption comes into play. comes into play. So okay, so having the continuity result, we can prove the a priori age is found. Takes some work, it's not very hard. I won't talk about that. What I want to talk about is how we go to the global proposal's result next. So once again, we're going to use alpha and the method of commuting flows. So alpha admits the following asymptotic expansion written down here. So from this Written down here. So, from this asymptotic expansion, we can recover all the previously known polynomial conservation laws. They appear as the coefficients here. And this leads us to the following. So, if we take the real part of alpha here, this term will drop out. And then, if we multiply, so we have only this term and then these lower-order terms. Now, if we also multiply by 4 kappa, we'll get h, the Hamiltonian, plus some lower-order terms. And that leads us to consider the following new Hamiltonian. The following new Hamiltonians, h kappa, defined as core kappa, that's the real part of alpha, because that will be the Hamiltonian of DNLS plus big O of kappa to the minus 1. Now, this H kappa define flows that Poisson commute with each other for all kappa and with the NLS. Moreover, they commute. They commute with, the Poisson commute with alpha, are conserved quantities. So they also conserve alpha. And we can run through the arguments of our equinuity result and our H's bounds result and get them also for this H-cupp of flows. So now we have all of these for this H-cupp of flows as well. And moreover, these flows are much nicer than the DNLS flow itself. And it's actually fairly easy to prove that they are well closed in HS for every S curve or equal. For every s greater or equal to 0. So, how are we going to use that? What we're going to use is prove that these H-kappa flows conserve to the DNLS flow as kappa goes to infinity in HS and then use that to boost the global verposeness of H-kappa flows to the global verposeness of DNLS. So, if I wrong around a sketch here, so the thing is that the H's bounds are not in. The thing is that the HS bounds are not enough by themselves, right? Knowing that our solution is valued in HS does not help us get global well bosons. We know that our solution is valued in L2. That does not give us global well bosons immediately, right? What we need to do is be able to control differences of solutions. So if we have, let's say, a solution Q with initial data Q0 and another solution Q tilde with initial data Q tilde 0. Data q tilde zero that are very close to each other, we want to see the following. So if I take q0 and I flow it under the h kappa flow, I will get something, let's say, q kappa of t, and then I will get something similar for q tilde kappa of t. Now, since the h kappa flows are globally well closed, the fact that these two are closed tells me that these two will remain closed. And then showing that the difference And then showing that the H-kappa flows convert to the DNLS flow, essentially what we show is that the flow induced by the difference of H and H kappa will converge to the identity. So if I take this now and I flow it under the difference flow, I will get the DNLS solution with this initial totem and the DNLS solution. And the DNL solution with this initial data, and then because the difference flow converges to the identity, this and this should be close. Maybe it doesn't look that close the way that I drew it. Use your imagination, right? Okay, and this is precisely where the S greater or equal to 1,6 becomes necessary because, as we saw, the H capa flows are all the way down to L2. That's not the problem. The problem is the computer. Not the problem. The problem is the convergence of the difference flow. And if you're wondering why 16, the answer is that, well, we have a cubic nonlinearity, so in order to make sense of it, we need our solution to be L3, and hence why we need H16. And I have a couple more minutes to talk about how to go towards the critical poses now. Now. So we saw that the H-kappa flows are globally interval bossing 2. That's not the problem. So all we need to do is adapt the convergence, right? All we need to do is show the convergence of the H-kappa flows to the DNLS flow in L2. But as I said, well, we were not able to do that, right? We required H16 that we are in L3. It requires some additional regularity on 2, which on Q, which Regularity on 2, which on Q, which we don't have if we're working on L2, where are we going to get this extra regularity? The answer is local smoothing. So locally in space, on average, in time, we can gain half a derivative, and this is exactly what we're going to use to boost us from all two so that we can close our argument. So here is the local smoothing result that we proved. So in fact, the So, in fact, the most important one is showing the local smoothing for the difference flow, and that's actually also the art. So, we prove local well-smoothing not only for the DNLS flow, but also for the flow induced by the difference of the Hamiltonian of DNLS and then H kamba Hamilton. So, here are the results. If we have set of initial data, subset of O2, bounded and equal continuous, and some nice cutoff, then for every T solutions to DLS with T solutions to DLS with initial data in Q satisfy this. So if I take the local smoothing norm, so I take Q multiplied by this nice cutoff, and I measure it in H one half, square it, and integrate in this finite interval of time that will be bounded by the square of the altinoin of the H of that. And then a similar result for the Biffin split. Now, I want to draw your attention to one word on this slide. Well, it appears twice because once in each theorem, that maybe you didn't pay that much attention to, and it's a word equicontinuous. So we have local smoothing for the continuous sets of initial data. And this is important. In fact, we don't have local smoothing if we're not looking at the continuous sets of initial data. And here is once again some concrete. And here is once again some concrete evidence that that's the case. If we take a stationary solitome, given by that, and we rescale it, again using our scaling from before, then we get a family of solutions that have exactly the same L2 norm, but now if we measure their local smoothing norm, it looks like lambda, so it goes to infinity as lambda goes to infinity. So we cannot bound it in terms. So we cannot bound it in terms of the L2 norm. L2 boundedness alone is not enough to control the local smoothing norm. And just a brief word about the idea of how to prove local smoothing. Once again, we're going to rely on alpha, but this time we will not rely on the conservation of alpha itself, but rather on the corresponding microscopic conservation law. So alpha can be written as linked block of this density. Of this density row here, and we have these microscopic conservation laws. And integrating here, we can, well, what we have to do is, well, this so we have to, we get something like this, and we have to make the local smoothing norm appear in appropriate places, and we bound everything else in L2. And we followed the same argument both for DLS and for the difference flow. And for the difference flow, the general idea is the same, but for the difference flow, the proof is much, much harder because, well, if you think about that for a second, local smoothing is a dispersive effect, right? It's a dispersive phenomenon. We have the high frequencies traveling very fast, leaving any compact level in finite time, so they leave behind this the low frequency part, which is smoother, hence we get local smoothing. Hence, we get local smoothing. But what we were saying about the difference flow is that it converges to the identity. So nothing really moves, right? So we have this very delicate balance that we have to find some, you know, very weak remaining dispersion hidden there, exhibit a lot of cancellations to make this actually go through. Okay, so thank you very much. Question or comments? So so initially you had the restriction by 4π, but in the final result you don't have any. So I'm wondering, is it still possible to see some difference between plus bigger than 4 pi and below 4 pi? 4π and below 4π for solutions for solution one. Is there any significant difference or is it just a technical problem? Yeah, I don't. Oh, that's a good question. I don't know. I don't think there is a difference. Absolutely. The notion of repositance is very difficult between below 4π and over 4π? No, no, it's the same. Below H1 half and above H1 half, yes, it's different, but yeah. Um uh yeah, I wait for my question. The wave of microphone. Uh oh yeah, uh the solitary wave has zero energy. Excuse me? The solitary wave has zero energy or no? The algebraic soliton. Yes. Yes. For the algebraic soliton, all the conserved quantities are zero other than the L2. Okay, so if So it's very similar to the Peregrine silicon. Peregrine silicon has every conservation law equals zero. Okay. And you don't have a two conservation law and every quantity says okay. So it's a very similar thing. Thank you.
