As I said, I'm going to be talking about this. It's some work that I did over the last year or so. And to begin, let's get, you know, just remind everybody a few basic definitions. First off, the radial function is just going to be, well, given some convex object, sorry, convex body, the radial function is just the distance from the origin to the boundary of our body. Of our body. And now we have the perpendicular hyperplane, same notation as typically used. This is just going to be the Euclidean inner product right here. And one apology here. This should be Sn minus 1, if you read that. Okay. And then we have the supporting hyperplane. The supporting hyperplane to the body K is just going to be a Is just going to be a hyperplane that intersects the body non-trivially and contains the body in a half space bounded by that hyperplane. You'll notice that the body is contained on the side and it also has a unit outward normal. Fine. Now, the last thing to remind everybody about is the support function. The support function is just going to be the distance from the origin to said hyperplane with that particular given outer normal. And one thing Normal. And one thing to note about these definitions, to keep in mind, is if your body is very close to the Euclidean ball, you'll notice that these two directions end up being the same direction, or very close. And you'll notice that the radial function and support function are very complementary. Okay. Now, let's introduce one of the operators that we are actually interested in discussing today. The first is the intersection in body of a convex buck. Convex body. The intersection body of a convex body, K, is denoted with this calligraphic IK, and it is defined like so. We are encoding information about the central section, the volumes of the central sections of our object, into the boundary of our new body via its radius. You can see here we have the cube, here is its intersection body, and similarly we have the silver. And similarly, we have the cylinder and its intersection. Just from the definition alone, you can identify that: yes, the Euclidean ball is going to get mapped to a Euclidean ball if we want to look at it like that. Notice that it doesn't matter which direction we take our central section in, the Euclidean ball is just going to have the same volume, right? So at the end of the day, we end up getting the intersection body of a Euclidean ball just to be a dilato. And you can also notice from these pictures, Curtis and Gardner, that if we started with the cube, we end up with something just slightly smoother. And it starts to, well, look a little bit more like the Euclidean ball than the rather spiky cube that we started with here. Similarly, you'll notice that if we are with our cylinder and its intersection body, you'll notice that again, it smooths everything out a little bit. Well, not Everything out a little bit. Well, not every point, the vast majority. And it makes it look appear or appear a little bit closer to the solution with an integral. If you do, this is just going to be, well, just this integral on the perpendicular hyperplane. Here, lambda sub n minus 1 is just the n minus 1. Lambda sub n minus 1 is just the n minus 1 dimensional Lebesgue measure on that perpendicular hyperplane. And if you expand it using in spherical coordinates and then evaluate that integral, you end up with this representation. Okay. Now, the one thing to note about this is that it is, well, we started with the radial function of our body. Radial function of our body, and we end up with the radial function of our transformed body. So, this actually gives us a very nice relationship between quantities of our original object and its transformed. Now, we can also rewrite this with the spherical Radon transform, as brought up by Mike Loyden. Is that the correct pronunciation? Sorry. And this is just going to be this. This is just going to be this integral operator right here. Okay, so the other operator that we are going to need to discuss is going to be the polar intersection button. This is the one we're actually going to be using, and to do that, it's good to define what the polar body is in case anybody threw it out. This can be defined using the radial function and support function. The radial function and support function, like so, the support function of our polar body is just going to be 1 over the radial function of our original body. And just composing this operation and this operation, you'll see that we have a nice definition of our polar intersection. Okay. Now, the other operator that we are interested in discussing is the centric body operator. Is the centric body operator? The centric body operator can be defined of a convex body can be defined like so. What we are going to do is we are going to take a half space with a outer normal of theta. Then we are going to intersect that half space with our convex body. And the center mass of that intersection is going to be a point on the boundary of our center. Our centroid bottom. Okay, denoted with gamma right here. And if you vary the directions across all possible directions, you're going to end up getting the entire body. From the definition, you can also identify that the centroid body of a Euclidean ball is also going to be a Euclidean ball, right? It doesn't matter which direction you take this half-space, you're always going to get the exact same object. So the distance to So, the distance to that center of mass is just going to be all the same, and you're going to get your Euclidean ball back all that time. Okay. Now, again, we can rewrite this using integrals. This is what we get. Now, this integral right here is just the integral average of this, the dot product of our direction that we're interested in and our point that we're interested in. That we're interested in looking at. And what we can do is we can, well, rewrite it using spherical coordinates and evaluate that inner integral just as we did before. And you'll notice that we get this. Here, this is going to be, again, the Lebesgue measure on NRN, and this is going to be the spherical Lebesgue measure on. The spherical Lebesgue measure on Rn minus 1, or Sn minus 1. And as before, this actually ends up being a very nice linear operator. You can rewrite this as the cosine transform of our radial function to a power. It's actually worth noting exactly what that is, so I'm going to write that. The cosine transform of a sufficiently nice function. Of a sufficiently nice function f is just going to be as follows. We're going to just get the integral over s n minus 1 of our function of this phi. And we are going to take f of theta. Okay. And this is D, and then here is our nice little measure. Okay. Okay. Let's check you. Nice. So this is going to be our cosine transform. I don't believe this was discussed in a previous talk, though it could be wrong. Okay. Now, now that we have introduced both of the bodies that we are interested in, let's define the problem. Okay, so the two problems that we are interested in looking at for this particular talk is going to This particular talk is going to be these two. If n is, if the dimension is at least 3 and k is an origin symmetric convex body in Rn, and its centroid body is going to be a dilate of the original body, need our body be an ellipsoid. We saw that the Euclidean ball satisfies this, but as it turns out, linear transforms commute with the Commute with the centroid body operator. So, as it turns out, if a body satisfies this, so does the Winnier transformer. Okay. Now, the other question, oh, and one other thing to note is that the constant in that particular case, since it commutes, is going to be the same. Regarding the other problem that we have, if we consider the same setup, we have Consider the same setup. We have dimension at least 3. We have our origin spectra convex body k. And suppose that it satisfies this criteria right here. That is to say that the polar intersection body of our body is a dilate of our centroid body for some constant, need k be an ellipsoid. Well, again, linear transforms commute with our centroid body operator, but they don't quite commute with the other one. Quite commute with the other one. It turns out you end up paying a price of some constant that's dependent on the determinant of our particular linear transform that we're selecting. But that is to say that if a body satisfies this criteria, then so does the linear transform. Now, these are both very hard questions. Uh in fact Gardner's book has a whole host of these types of questions that are open and well resolving them would be rather challenging. Well, resolving them would be rather challenging. As a more approachable, well, first step, we are going to follow in the footsteps of a paper by Maria Palvonseka, my advisor, Mazarov, Ria Bogan, and Yeskin. And we are also, and there was another group that also studied similar types of problems. That would be Fish and Mazarov, if I remember right, Ryabogan and Yaskin again. Revogan and asking again. So, in those two papers, in the first one, they were studying the intersection body, and the second one they were considering a, if I remember right, not the projection body, the polar intersection body. Now, okay, now that we have our problems defined, I just want to note that in this particular case, we are restricting ourselves. This particular case, we are restricting ourselves to just being very close to the Euclidean. Hence, my earlier comments. Now, let's take a look at the proof of the first question. Well, a very rough sketch of it. So, we're going to cheat and make a few simplifying assumptions just to make our lives just a smidge easier. First off, well, this is us just being close to the occluding ball, namely, we're just going to say delta is a small number. Delta is a small number, and we are going to take the radial function of our body just to be plus or minus delta, right? This is saying that the boundary of our body is very close to the boundary of the Euclidean ball at any given point, right? Now, we are also going to say that CK is going to be the constant associated with our body if it satisfies that criteria that we are interested in. We are interested in. And we, since linear transforms don't affect whether or not it satisfies that criteria, we can take a dilate of it and let the volume of our body be the volume of the ball. This is not too much of a problem. There is, however, going to be a few other simplifying assumptions that I'm going to make that are not quite fair, but let's go. So here, this is going to be the projection onto the zeroth harmonic of our function. Of our regular function, and we are going to assume that's one. Since we've already picked a dilation of our object, this needs some justification. But as the zeroth harmonic of our function is just the integral average, and our function varies between plus or minus delta in a neighborhood of one, we can see that this isn't so far from the truth, right? It's going to be one plus or minus. From the truth, right? It's going to be 1 plus or minus over the point. And this will allow us to rewrite the radial function as 1 plus gamma, where gamma is the sum of all the higher order harmonics, spherical harmonics. The second assumption we are going to make here is that the constant c sub k is the constant associated with the Euclidean ball. This is not something you can assume, as I noted earlier. This constant is invariant under linear transforms of our body. Transforms of our body. So you can't really change it, but you can prove that if it satisfies this criteria and it's close to the Euclidean ball, as it turns out, this constant is also close to the constant of the Euclidean ball. And finally, we are also going to assume that the cosine transform is normalized. Really, what we are doing is we're saying that c sub b here is just 1, and or you can think of it as us using our constant. Think of it as us using our constant to normalize our linear alpha. Wonderful. With that out of the way, let's take a look at our problem. All we are going to do here is we are just going to linearize just by adding the plus or minus the zeroth harmonic. Okay, now what we can do is we can use the binomial theorem, expand everything out, nothing too complicated. And now if you look And now, if you look at these terms over here, notice that the difference here is gamma, right? And we said that gamma here is very small. It's of the order of delta, right? So what we are going to do is, since we have two of these guys on every single one of these terms at least, we are going to use, we're going to factor out one of these and then overestimate this whole term by something of the order of gamma, right? Wonderful. Wonderful. Now, as our cosine transform is a nice linear operator, we can distribute it and move terms around. Namely, we are going to distribute this term, remembering that our cosine transform was normalized. This term is this term. We just moved it over to the other side. Similarly, this term here, well, we just apply our nice linear operator to do this. Okay. Operator to do this. Okay, and we get this quantity right here. Again, we are just moving this term over to the other side, and we are left with just these higher-order terms on the right-hand side. Taking L2 norms on both sides, we get this relationship. And noting that our cosine transform has an operator norm of 1 in L2, well, because we normalized, of course, well, Of course. Well, what we can do is we can rewrite it like so. Wonderful. Okay, now, actually, as it turns out, I claim we are done right here. There is a nice little lemma by Alfonseka, Nazara, Farivo, Benaskin, that says if we have some strong contraction M and there exists some small quantity, well, delta sub. Well, delta naught, such that our body lives in a neighborhood of that little, sorry, is that close to the Euclidean ball and satisfies this other criteria right here. As it turns out, this implies that the radial function and support function are equal and they are just constant. Now, if we take a look at what we have at the top here, this is The top here, this is well, this criteria. Keeping in mind that delta here was in our control, we got to pick it. We can pick it small enough so that whatever this term is, it's less than delta naught, right? This is not an issue. Our constant here, this one right here that shows up right here, this will not satisfy that. So we are going to take the constant one that's being, well, just visible up in front of. Being, well, just invisible out in front of this. And we are going to take our linear operator here, M, just to be this guy. Okay. So, this is going to be our setup. And now, just to remind everybody what a strong contraction is, for convenience, well, this is what we have. We have n is a strong contraction if it is a bounded linear operator on L2. Certainly, the cosine transform is going to satisfy this. Now, Now, we also assume that for each j there exists, well, some constant cj such that this is satisfied. This is just going to state that the eigenspaces of our linear operator are precisely the spherical harmonic spaces of degree j. And these are just going to be the eigenvalues associated with those spherical harmonics of degree j. And the third criteria that we need is that. Criteria that we need is that the eigenvalues for our spherical harmonic spaces need to be strictly less than one, and they need to go to zero with respect to the degree of our spherical harmonics. Okay. Now, investigating what the eigenvalues associated with our particular operator are, we get this wonderful little quantity. Now, Yes, this is true. It is kind of laughable. If we take a look at this guy very closely, though, we'll see that our zeroth harmonic is distinctly greater than one. This is a problem. But keep in mind that we, well, the one that we're removing from our function was the zeroth harmonic. So effectively, this thing has no zeroth harmonic, right? So we may as well consider our operator restricted to just degree two and higher harmonics, right? With higher harmonics, right? Not an issue. Now, if you evaluate this for j equals 2, you will also notice that we have the I b value associated with the degree 2 spherical harmonics just to be 1, which again is not exactly where we want to be. As it turns out, in the same paper where they were discussing this particular lemma, they also showed that by picking an approach, Showed that by picking an appropriate linear transform of our objects, you can actually go ahead and estimate the second harmonic of this guy right here and show that it's something of the order delta times the L2 norm of this quantum. That is to say that you can estimate the second harmonic of this guy separately, and the one isn't going to bother us. So, removing that second harmonic and evaluating that separately, now we can restrict our operator to. Now we can restrict our operator to just degree 4 or higher, and as it turns out, at that point, this guy is going to be strictly less than 1, and they are going to decrease to 0. So we're in good shape. Okay, so this actually resolves that first question that we are interested in. Now we're going to jump gears and talk about the other one briefly. No questions. Very good. Questions. Very good. Okay. So the other question that we were interested in could be described like this: right? All I'm doing here is I'm going to say that CK is the constant associated with the cleaning ball. Unlike the previous one, we can actually choose this to be the case merely by picking an appropriate linear transform, right? Because we get the determinant popping up. The determinant popping out when we use a linear transform. So we can, in fact, choose our particular constant, and we can choose it to be the constant associated with the Euclidean ball. Okay, so this is what we have for our question. Again, we're going to be in the same setup here. This is our zeroth harmonic. These are our higher order harmonics. And the first step that we're going to do is move this pesky minus one power over to the other side and take the inverse Radon transport. Take the inverse Radon transform on both sides. Doing so, we get this quantity right here. Now, when we do this, we are also going to use our constant C sub B. By definition, this is going to be the normalizing factor for both the spherical Radon transform and our cosine transform. Using this to normalize both of these, we're just going to say that these. Of these, we're just going to say that these are normalized now. Now, expanding the right-hand side of this using again binomial theorem, you're going to get this quantity. And doing the same on the other side, you get this. If you look very closely for k equals 0, this is just going to evaluate to 1, which is going to give us the inverse radon trend to look 1. And since it's normalized, we're just going to get 1 for our k equals 0 term. equal zero term, and that will cancel with the one over here. And we can also rearrange terms, namely like so. We are going to move the higher order terms of this guy over to the other side. We are going to divide each side by n minus 1, and we are going to pull out the k equals 1 term. This is going to correspond to our linear component of our operator, and we get this. So again, here's our So again, here is our linear term. Here is going to be our higher order terms and of the right hand side. And here is the higher order terms of our left hand side. Now, as it turns out, we have basically exactly what we want. We have that this is a contraction for a degree 4 and higher harmonics. We use the same technique as before. The same technique as before. You can get rid of your second harmonic, estimate that separately. So we know that this is some constant less than one. Sorry, the operator norm of this guy is going to be strictly smaller than one. Okay. You can also notice that right here, these terms, if you run through some rather awful calculations, you can find that this is of the order of our deltas. Of our delta squared. Okay, so again, it's of the same order as these higher order harmonics, or sorry, of these higher order terms, but we're in good shape. Now, all we need to do is if we took L2 norms of both sides and used a nice triangle inequality here, you'll notice that we have a number. Sorry, sorry, sorry. We have some number. We have that same number multiplied by the operator norm of this guy, which is less than one, plus uh. Than one plus something of the order of delta squared, which can be as small as we need it to be. This is to say that, well, we have something is less than a constant less than one multiplied by that same number, which implies that this thing must, in fact, affect zero. Okay. Now, a couple words that I want to say about this particular term right here. This is actually the hard part of the proof, getting this all to work out. Proof getting this all to work out because effectively what's going on here is you're essentially comparing the contractions on the lower order harmonics of the cosine transform to the dilation caused on the higher order harmonics of the spherical Radon transform. This is because when you take two spherical harmonics, multiply them together, you're going to get a whole litany of Litany of spherical harmonics of degree less than the degree of that product. So if I took a degree 5 and another degree 5, when I, well, take it to the k power, I'm going to have a degree 5k polynomial here. And I could get non-zero projection onto the degree 5 harmonic space, which means that I'm going to have a much stronger dilation caused by the Dilation caused by the inverse Radon transform than the contraction caused by these lower order terms. And this is the hard part of the thing. Now, the last thing I want to say is just a couple words about some of the sources that I was referencing. This is that first paper regarding the intersection body. Again, we were following. We were following the techniques of this paper and this paper down here. The question that we were considering is somewhat related to the Booztime Petty problems, so I thought to leave those there in case anybody wanted it. As well as Richard Gardner, this is where I took a couple of the pictures from, as well as the Sarglu Spavage paper. This one is in the same vein as these other two, but deals with As these other two, but deals with the projector model. And that is all I want to say. Okay, any questions? Yes. We are locally close to the median board. Correct. And the reason is because we want to detect the effect of the higher order script. So again, so if you look at the technique we use back here, where are we going? Where did I put you? Okay, right here. So this is all done locally, right? Th this is primarily one of the reasons we are sticking to locally. Primarily one of the reasons we are sticking to locally. Dealing with this question when you're far away from the Euclidean ball is not something I really know how to do right now. I am interested in solving this question and it's something I've been playing with, but I haven't quite figured out exactly how to deal with when you're really far away and then this starts causing problems. Sorry if that's inadequate. Sorry if that's a inadequate answer, but any any more questions? Okay, so then let's thank Chase at the end. We have a break of ten minutes.
