Higher regularity in congested traffic dynamics. And as the title says, the PDE I will talk about is motivated by a model for congested traffic dynamics. So I think what this means is clear from the name. We have like cars flowing in the street, and this should be modeled. And this should be modeled by a mathematical model. And maybe the most famous model coming from game theory is due to wardrobe. This is the so-called wardrobe equilibrium. This equilibrium relies on two principles. The first one is the user equilibrium. And this says that each user chooses the route that is the best. The route that is the best. So, this means the journey times in all routes actually used are equal and less than those that would be experienced by a single vehicle on any unused route. The second principle, the system optimality, says that the average journey time is at a minimum. So, in particular, users behave cooperatively in choosing their routes to ensure. In choosing their routes to ensure the most efficient use of the whole system. So, this is the again theoretic model from Wadro. And starting from this model was derivated, Fabia Montober. Kandovovich optimal transportation problem. And in a second step, the traffic flow was related by duality to a very general elliptic. So I will not go into the detail of the derivation of this model, since this is not the subject of this talk. But who is interested in the model? I refer to the literature. The literature. So, the game theoretic model is due to Wadko. Then, the derivation of the optimal transport model and the existence of minimizers was done by Cavier, Jimenis, Sandambroccio. And finally, the characterization by the very degenerate elliptic PDE is due to Brasco, Callier, and Sandambroccio. Certainly, this list of different This list of literature is not exhaustive. So, what I am interested in this talk is this very degenerate PDE and the regularity of solutions. Therefore, I now explain how such very degenerate PDEs look like. So, the simplest model of a very degenerate PDE is this. This one, it looks quite similar to the inhomogeneous pillar does. So if we would replace this weight by the gradient of u to power p minus two, we would have the Two, we would have the pilot plus, and here some parts of the gradient are replaced by the positive part of gradient minus one. Certainly this PDE can also be the solutions are also minimizes of a variational integral. So This one also, this one looks similar to the p-energy, but once again, the gradient to the p is replaced by the positive part of the gradient minus one to power p. So then I have drawn the profile of the integrand. So this is the integrand, these are the coefficients of the PDE. Of the PBE. And we see that for large gradients, this profile looks very similar to the p-energy. But for small gradients, so for gradients with modulus between zero and one, we have this degenerate part. So here the energy, it does not give a contribution to the energy. To the energy. And this is the fact which makes this PDE or minimization problem very interesting from an analytical point of view. And yeah. What I was interested in was regularity of solutions. And let's see what we could find in the literature. What we could find in the literature. So, first thing is Lipschitz got the new idea of solutions. And this is quite realistic to obtain because let's go to the profile of the integrant. If the gradient is large, the behavior is more or less like the PILA. Is more or less like the Tilopas, and if the gradient is small, this is not important. This is even good for Lipschitz regularity. So it's very natural to expect Lipschitz regularity to hold. This is in fact true. So in this colour setting, this was proved by Rasco, Callier, Sant'Androccio, and also in a separate paper by Rasco, the Victor. Paper by Prasco, the Victoria setting is due to Block, Chova, Hatame, Pasabeli, Dinopoli. But we can see this Lipschitz regularity even in a more general context, because these very degenerate PDEs are a special case of an so-called asymptotically regular problem. So these are exactly PDEs that behave like more regular. Like more regular PDE, when that gradient is large, out of this more regular PBE is the pillar plus. So we can see this very degenerate PBE as an asymptotically regular one. And if we put it in this context, then we can find a huge literature about Dipschitz regularity. And we can, for instance, refer to Chippot Evans Raymond. Shipo Evans Remo for Foss for the even other articles. So lits regularity settled and then we ask for more. So can we have more regularity than lipids like C1 alpha? C1 alpha. And here we look at the easiest possible case, namely when the right-hand side f is equal to zero. And we see that better than Lipschitz continuity cannot be possible because this weight appearing in the PDE becomes zero when the gradient is smaller than one. Is smaller than one. So any function with a gradient smaller than one is a solution. And this could be something which is just Lipschitz continuous. So we cannot get more than Lipschitz continuity. But But one could modify the question a bit. And this was first done to obtain so-called Sobolev regularity. So the question is, maybe not the solution, but some combinations of the solution have a higher weak derivative in L2, for instance. And And Rasco, Callien, Santa Bruzzo proved that this guy is in W12. So, and I would say this is quite natural because for the kilometers, once again, you know that the modulus. The modulus of the gradient to power p minus 2 over 2 times the gradient is in w 1 2. And so this higher differentiability result is, I would say, the natural analogue of higher differentiability for the P1 plus. For the PLA plus. Then there's also a vector-valued version by Dlock Chobon, Parkami, and Pasarelli Di Northey. Yeah, this is Suboleph regularity so far. The next question is: what about continuity of the gradient? As mentioned before, in general, In general, this is not true. Counter examples. So, one has to modify the question. And what can be proved is that a combination of the gradient with some other function g is continuous. And this is continuous for any function g that vanishes. That vanishes on the unit wall. So G has to vanish on this bed set where the gradient is smaller than one. And then we know that G of D is continuous. And this result was first proved in the special two-dimensional case by Santa McChield and Bestry and the general case was obtained by Colombo. Was obtained by Colombo and Figali. This result is for very degenerate elliptic equations. It is formulated even for more general equations than the model equations I showed at the beginning. But yeah, I do not want to. Yeah, I do not want to show the precise assumptions here. So, this was the starting point, and we were asking, is a similar result also valid for the vector-valued case? By this, I mean the following. Now, instead of considering solutions with scalar values, we consider solutions. We consider solutions with vector values, which is vector valued. And yeah, this results in this very degenerate system of elliptic PDEs. And yeah, then we were again asking the question for. Asking the question for regularity. So Lipschitz regularity is settled, but we are interested in higher regularity, like this continuity property of GHP. So what can we expect? On the one hand, we have to take into account that solutions are often less regular in the vectoriality. Less regular in the vectorial case. So we know due to several counterexamples, the first one by the Georgi, that solutions of elliptic systems can be quite unregular, unbounded, and even if the coefficients of the system are quite nice. On the other hand, we know that solutions of some That solutions of some particular elliptic systems are regular. So, for instance, solutions of the Pilar plus system are of class C1 alpha for some Holder exponent alpha. And this is the famous regularity result of Unig. So, what can we expect? We observe the following. following um this is the the weight in our in in our elliptic system and this weight only depends on the modulus of the gradient so in principle this elliptic system is of the type what we often call ulmeg structure and these systems behave a bit better than general systems and so General systems. And so we thought that there could be some hope for regularity of solutions. So now I can present the main result, which is in cooperation with Frank Buzzer, Staffa Ela Chova, and Antonella Sarelikinakolli. So we consider any p larger than one and an inhomogeneity f, which is integrable to some exponent strictly larger than the dimension n. And then we can show that g of du is continuous for any continuous function g which vanishes on the. Which vanishes on the set where the gradient is smaller than one. So, this is the perfect vectorial analog of the West in Santa Brocho, respectively, Colombo and Figali result. So, what about the optimality of the result? What can we instead? What can we expect, and what did we get? So we were able to treat any exponent p larger than one. Moreover, as I explained before, on the set where the gradient is smaller than one, it could be discontinuous. So also with this respect, we are optimal. Moreover, one could ask for Ask for a better regularity of G of du, but there are counterexamples already for the equation. So held a continuity is in general not true, even if this G is small enough. And finally, but what could be the case is that there is What could be the case is that there is some modulus of continuity. This is something which could be investigated further. So we get continuity, Hoda continuity is not possible, but maybe sometimes it could be. Finally, the right-hand side. So here it is also known that right-hand side in Ln is not enough since then the brain. Not enough since then the gradient is possibly unbounded. Okay, so in the second half of my talk, I will give some hints on the proof. So I will just explain the main strategy since it is quite technical. So the first step is to get Lipschitz regularity. From this we know that the gradient will be bounded. This one can get from the literature as I explained before. Then the second step is to do a regularization of the elliptic system and this we do by adding epsilon By adding epsilon times held plus. So instead of u, we consider this solution u epsilon of the more regular elliptic system. And the advantage is that we know that u epsilon, for instance, has strict derivatives, and so we can do all computations we want to do. And the third and most difficult step in the proof is the Hilda continuity. And we do not directly prove the Hölder continuity of G of DU for some general function G, but we do something different. And this idea already goes back to the paper. To the paper of some temprojon best way. We consider some delta larger than zero and then we prove that g delta of du epsilon is held a continuous. And this function g delta is defined in this way. And the main idea is to subtract something more of the one. So to subtract So to subtract minus one minus delta to make the part which you do not see larger and this function only sees the part where the greater is larger than one plus delta so there is a small slice in between and one gains Gains, we do not have to consider the coincidence set there. Yeah, so this is the most difficult part of the proof. And certainly, we have to be careful that all constants are independent of epsilon. Then, once we have established the Holder continuity, we have to look at the density to the limit. Look at the desert to the limit. Here we first let epsilon go to zero, and this is quite easy by comparison arguments. And then we obtain that G delta of du is further continuous with some exponent that depends on delta. And this is. And this is the main point when now we want to let delta go to zero. And since the Holder exponent depends on delta, it is clear that this will give some problems if we want to retain Holder continuity. But as it's said before, this is not possible. We only can get continuity. So So, what we get is continuity of the limit function, and the limit function is exactly this one. You get continuity of this function. So, finally, we have to translate the continuity of this function into the continuity of. Into the continuity of g of du for some general function g. Also, this is quite easy because this function here is invertible on the set where the gradient is larger than one. So the really difficult part of the proof is the holder continuity part. And therefore, I will go I will go a bit more into detail of the proof of this part, of this step. So the group is motivated by the C1 alpha proof of Ulbet and furthermore by the C1 alpha regularity proof due to the Benedetto and Friedman for. The Benedetto and Friedman for the parabolic pillar system. The main goal will be to get a Campanato type estimate for G delta of Du. So this constant is the limit of the mean values of G delta of Du. And once we will have this companato type. Once we will have this component type estimate on any ball, an arbitrary ball, you will get the Holder continuity. Okay, how do we come to this Kampan arbiter estimate? First of all, we know already that du is bounded. So we can suppose that on some arbitrary Some arbitrary ball, the supremum of g of g delta of du is smaller than some constant mu. Let's say mu is comparable to the supremum of G delta of du. Then we distinguish between two regimes. One will be called the degenerate regime, the other one the non-degenerate regime. Non-degenerate regime. And this distinguishing is done by considering superlevel sets. So we take a very small parameter nu and we consider the superlevel set where g delta of du is larger than one minus nu times mu. So on this set, g delta of u of du is close to its. Is close to its supremum. And then we say that our ball is in the non-degenerate regime if the set where the gradient is close to its supremum is quite large. So this is non-metrenal. And in the other case, that our ball does not satisfy this. Satisfy this assumption, it satisfies the opposite inequality, and this we call the degenerate issue. And now we have to operate differently if distinguishing whether we are in the degenerate or non-degenerate regime. So at a certain point, our elliptic system has to come into the play. System has to come into the play. And this is done by choosing a good testing function. We choose a testing function of this type. Theta is a cutoff function. phi of du can be chosen later. So this function phi can be chosen later. And this is multiplied by some. Some partial derivative of u. Then, testing with this function, we get for simplicity, I take f equal to zero, we get this integral inequality. This is quite formal. I do not show what this A and B are. These are some bilinear. Are some bilinear forms depending on the gradient du. But we get an inequality which is structurally of this form and this inequality will be used in two different directions. It will be useful for both regimes, for the degenerate and for the non-degenerate regime. So, first of all, So first of all, we observe that these bilinear forms are elliptic. And so the first one bounce from below the second derivative squared and the second one bounce from below the gradient of the modulus of du squared. So if we can get an estimate. If we can get an estimate for this third term, this inequality will give us energy estimates for secondary vertics. And these will be used in the non-degenerate regime. For the degenerate regime, we make a second observation, namely that this and this are non-negative. Non-negative. So we observe that since this function phi is non-negative and non-decreasing, the first integral is non-negative. So if we put it on the right-hand side, we can discard it. Okay, so we can discard this integral. Discard this integral, and then we know that the integral in the second line will be non-negative. And this can be used to show that a certain function of the modulus of du is a sub-solution to an elliptic system. So let's take some function capital Phi which satisfies which has Which has V as derivative, then we can get from this inequality that of the modulus of du is a subsolution to an elliptic system. And this is the key to treat the degenerate regime. So here we choose phi of t is equal to the positive part of equal to the positive part of t minus 1 minus delta. And then we get that the positive part of du minus 1 minus delta squared is a sub solution to an elliptic equation. But this is exactly the modulus of G of du squared. So this is a sub solution to an elliptic equation. And then we can start the job. The Georgi theory, the Georgi classes theory, and from this we get a reduction of the supremum. So we can show that there exists some kappa strictly smaller than one, such that on the ball with half radius, g delta of du is smaller than kappa times mu. This is what we get in the general cuisine. Degenerate regime. In the non-degenerate regime, we want to compare with the linear system. Therefore, we define the excess of du and then we take the measured theoretic information which characterizes the non-degenerate regime to show that on our ball the excess is small and moreover. small and moreover the mean value of du is larger than one plus delta plus mu half. This allows us to compare U with the solution B of a linear elliptic system and to obtain a comparison estimate. The solution of the linear elliptic system satisfies The linear elliptic system satisfies very good excess decay estimates, and we can use this excess decay estimates to transfer them to U and get a nice excess decay estimate for du. Then we can prove that once we are in the bondage. That once we are in the non-degenerate with Shimonov, it will remain non-degenerate on any smaller ball with the same sample. So we can iterate with procedure and we conclude that the limit of G delta of du exists when the radius goes to zero. I don't hit you, Virina. I am afraid we lost the connection. At least I did. We also cannot hear. Yeah, it's very unfortunate, but it happened. Very unfortunate, but it happens. The talk is almost finished. My connection broke down. Can you hear me again? Now, yes, yes. Could you continue? Yeah, maybe if I have two minutes more, I could finish. Yeah, go ahead, of course. Thank you. Okay. So now we have to combine the two regimes. We define a sequence of radia tending to zero and then we suppose that on some ball of radius rho i that the channel radius rho i, that the general regime is satisfied for let's say for i equal to zero until i naught. Then we can reduce the supremum until this index and we get that the supremum on this ball is smaller than kappa to the i times mu. Then maybe at a certain Then maybe at a certain index I naught, the general regime is not satisfied. So we switch to the non-degenerate regime, but then we can get this Campanato type estimate. On the other hand, in the degenerate regime, if we reduce the supremum, we could certainly also estimate this companatotape into verb. So we can get this estimate also. Can get this estimate also for this Balsam delta general regime. This means we get a Campanado type estimate for G delta of du on arbitrary radio. And yeah, then we use Campanato theory to conclude the Hilda continuity of G delta of Pu. Of being. And this was a very brief outline of the proof, and I would like to stop the talking. Yeah, thank you very much for your great talk. I am sorry for the broken connection. Are there any questions or comments? Questions? All right. If there are no questions at this moment, let us thank the speaker again. Yeah, thank you. And we will meet in about seven minutes. Thank you.
