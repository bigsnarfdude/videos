So I'm a Feng Shu from Shenzhen University. I'm now working in the life school and also in the medical school. Today I will share our progress on the mechanic medicine. So we have witnessed significant progress in biomechanics and mechanical biology. But now we really want to get much closer to the clinics. So today we talk about how we progress from biomechanics and mechanical biology to the mechanical diagnosis. To the mechanical diagnosis and mechanotherapy. So, with significant advances in the sequencing and imaging, so basically we can see cells, modulus, and also we can spend about 200 US dollars for our sequencing. But the problem is that even we can see smaller and smaller, but our understanding of disease doesn't seem to have a significant progress. One of the problems is that when you talk with kidney doctors, when they think about disease, they always When they think about disease, they always think about biochemistry. But actually, for the natural biological system, the biochemical cues and biofuel cues, they coexist, they work together to affect the disease. So the problem is that how the biochemical and biophysical, the CC synergistically affect the disease. And also, you also need the theory, mechanics, also the device for categorical understanding. For categorical understanding and also in the wind. So, basically, when I come back from Harlan Medical School in 2011, we found our center by Inspire and UniBiomic Center. We really want to understand, see the bio system from the physics perspective. So, I funded this center together with the profitlu. So, our strategy is very straightforward. You can see here, we really want to have some dig after the scientific question from the clinical phenomena, and then finally want to go back. And then finally, one go back to the bed. So actually, in clinics, we have witnessed the application of different physicals, like optical, sound radiation. But actually, if you talk with clinic doctors, it's very difficult to convince them to say we have this kind of mechanical medicine or thermal medicine or the magnetic medicine. Basically, there are two physical cues which have been well accepted in clinics. One is acoustic, the other one is radiation. But why is not the others? But why is not the others? So, basically, this thing is that the applications in areas of other physical cues in clinics is very limited, and the understanding is now far from well understood. So, actually, in 2021, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was awarded to the funding of TPRV and also the PRO, which now that more biological and clinical people understand that the response to physical cues is not just. response to physical cues is not just for neural system but for almost all body systems and also in the 2021 the nature paper said that of force they grave their life so if you think of the evolution of the mechanics in our health you can see before century we see the uh acupuncture massage and about the last century the 1930s you have sports uh medicine and then you have this uh biomechanics and mechanical biology Biomechanics and mechanical biology. Basically, if you talk with doctors about these two keywords, biomechanics and mechanical, it's very difficult for them to differentiate them, right? And then if you check the Google Scholar about 10 years ago, you can check the term mechanical medicine. You can just check it. But for now, we still have no systematic understanding. What is mechanical medicine? If you have acoustic medicine, you have ready medicine. What is mechanical medicine can tell us? So if you think about the medicine, basically. Think about the medicine. Basically, you have a symptom, then you diagnose them. After you understand the mechanism, you have this kind of therapy method developed. Then you can cure the disease. Actually, you can see the force, the mechanical force, have been well applied in our life. Actually, you can say mechanical properties are inherent to the human body. Actually, it can be used for detection. Just as we have heard from previous talk, this kind of compression stiffening can be used as a biomechanical feature. Used as a biomechanical feature for the disease diagnosis, and also mechanical simulation is commonly used for the disease treatment like acupuncture or massage. Okay, so we define our understanding of mechanical medicine. So at a cross-scale level, at different levels from organ to molecular level, how we can extract such mechanical cues from biological system and then how we can understand them, which is basically the mechanology. But for clean doctors, But for clinic doctors, they do not care so much about biomechanics or microbiology. They only think how you can use such biomechanical features or microbiology biomarkers for the diagnosis and the treatment applications. So we define this kind of four aspects. So actually two months ago, if you check this kind of the 50s annual special issue from a sale publisher that also mentioned this, mechanical medicine will become important field of intergenerational research. If you are interested, you can check this special issue. You are interested, you can check this special issue. Okay, so today I will go briefly about the four aspects for our understanding of the mechanics. First, how we can extract such a mechanical information basically is biomechanics. So, if you talk with kidney dogs per se, at a different biologic level of biologic system, there exists some physical cues like the magnetic or electric. It's very difficult for them to understand. But if you say, Okay, at a different level, they have mechanical cues, they say, Oh. Mechanical cues. They said, oh, it's mostly, yes. So at different levels, the cell, the force can exist as a different format, like the protein direction for the contraction at the teacher level. So the key issue is how we can track them. This is very difficult. In clinics, we have this MR or the ultrasonic for extract some stiffness or viscoelastic. But in visual, it also develops some system. So in our center, we have some junior. So, in our center, we have some junior faculties that develop different methods. At organ teacher level, you can use the indentation, FM, and also at the teacher level, you can develop this kind of microcell-sized microparticles. It's basically elastic. After you use the imagery, you can get the deformation and combined with artificial intelligence, you can extract such mechanical properties. And also, you can develop different influencer probes for measuring the cell membranes. The cell membranes, the tension, or the nucleus membrane tension. So, basically, you can see we developed this different device, but in this case, it's scanning electrochemical microscopy, which can give you the structure and functional information at the tissue and cell level. And also, we have developed this system, which combines objectives, focal, and also FM. Basically, it can give you the tissue level and cell level, and even sub-cell level, then you can cues. And with this, you can give different queues. Different the tooths to categorize mechanism. In this case, you can see the periodopatisis tissue from the teeth to the soft tissues and bone to tendon and also for others. I will give you some examples. For this case, you can see for humans, the teeth are very stiff, but the surrounding soft tissues are very soft. So you can see they have a very interesting stiffness gradient. In this case, you know, around about 20 micrometers, which basically is even smaller than the single-cell spreading. The single cell spreading the distance. And you can see if it's a disease, in this case, you can see the disease will change this gradient. In this case, it's blue one, this health one is a red one. Okay, you understand this is from native human teacher. And then in visual, you can engineer a system which can be used to mimic such gradient. Then with system, you can try to answer some questions like when you have this kind of disease, why the stem cell cannot be The stem cell cannot be, can do well for this tissue regeneration. Is this the case in the massive stem cell? You can say at a single cell level, there is living gradient, which will change the immune phenotype of MSC. If you're interested, you can go to this paper for all the details. And also, we develop this kind of microparticle flash. You can see the elastic one, and if you implant, encapsulate this particle into the tissue, like in this case, it's cancer. Like in this case, it's cancer, then you have the deformation, and after you combine the imaging with the artificial intelligence, you can get all the mechanical information. And also, for this case, if you have big ones, you can have cells which sit on the surface of the ferroid, and then you can use cell traction force which deforms this particle. Then you can use images to get all the mechanical information from this system. And also, you can develop this kind of nuclear acid-based precedent, the proofs. Present the proofs for measuring the cell membrane tension and a nuclear membrane tension. If you're interested, you can go to the details. So, also, we have developed this kind of artificial intelligence program. Basically, if you want to know the structure like the nucleus or the cytoskeleton, basically you need fluorescent staining and also you need confocal. But for this case, it's a very cost-effective microscopy, about 10 key Chinese yuan. And for this case, all the fluorescence structures. All the fluorescent structure you see here are from the artificial intelligence program. You can see the nucleus, you can see the psychosatant structure, and also you can check out the functional stuff like the Japan test. And with all this, you can predict the cell fit. Think about this. You have a cell culture in your incubator. And on your mobile phone, you can check every day what's the duration of your stem cell. It's very costly effective. It's very costly effective. So, this is very interesting the program we can use. So, your first part is think that with the disease, we have witnessed the change of the mechanical cues. But how such mechanical cues will affect the progress of the disease? So, just like the physician, Feynman said that what I cannot create, I don't understand. Basically, for the biomedical people, what I'm going to use is the animal model or the cell model. For cell model, they just culture cells on the culture plate and they test everything. And they test everything. But a lot of people that have published should show that there exists a signal difference between the 2D cell model and the native situation, and even between the different species. So for this case, you also think that you need some microfabrication method to engineer the disease outside the body. And for that, you need different materials. Basically, the hydrogen to mimic the native actual cell metrics. So, you know, we have developed different methods because when I worked at a harvest medical school, Worked at a harvest school. My team focused on developing different by printers. So you can see here in our center, we have different facilities. We can print the cells or the sub-cellular level. You can also engineer different materials. Think about if you tell us what kind of disease, what kind of mechanical properties you want to engineer, we can engineer such cardiacs for you. It doesn't matter if it's stiff or visible elastic or visible plastic. So besides that, we know that the So besides that, we know that the biomedical people only do the molecular cell level, the experiment. But for us as engineers, we can use mathematics to understand much more from such phenomena. So at a multi-cell level, at a single cell level, sub-cell level, we have some junior faculties that work on different models to combine with our experiment. I will give some examples. This is one paper from Nature Materials, we published with the different labs from the world. Different labs from the world. Basically, in this case, the labs found that if you have a different type of cells, some cells like to migrate from the stiff area to the software area, but for the other type of cells, they move from the software to the stiffer. So, what's the basic control rules for that? So, from mathematics, you found that if you have this adhesion reinforcement, this will control how they migrate from software to the sleeve or from sniffer to the soft. So, we use this model. Soft. So we use this model to understand that. And after that, we also said if you have a teacher like the kind of teacher, basically, if you ask the medical people, they say, okay, the tumor is stiffer than the normal teacher. But this is too simple. We also know that from mechanics perspective, we have the visco elastic, viscoplastic. For this case, if we force us to mimic this stress relaxation, we engineer such hard gels so that it can mimic the native native the two motitures. The native native to mutations to give you well-controlled relaxation behaviors. And after that, we can see as the endostellar cells can give you different blood vessel generation. And we understand that you can use the integrating, clustering, all the mechanical transaction, which is general. We can use this to understand that. And also we move further to the mechanical, the plasticity. So for this case, we construct hydrogen with well-controlled stimulus and tunable plasticity. And tunable plasticity. Basically, you can see we have using how to do here. You can control the plasticity, and also you can have the well-controlled stiffness. In this case, we can check the effect how the plasticity affects the blood vessel generation. In this case, we found that the medium, the plastic matrix, promotes the body and operation of the blood vessels. Use some mechanical action partly. Understand that. Pathway, understand that. I'll give one more example on this. For this case, you can see the breast cancer. It's a human tissue. From left to right, this initial stage and this advanced stage. In clinics, from the biposside, you can see that at each initial stage, there are no channels for the cells to migrate out. But with the advancement, with the development of disease, you can see you have a simple channel and then you have three-dimensional network. This is well known in clinics. Is well known in clinics. But we ask this big question: how the can cell generates this can channel, how to generate channel from the simple one to the 3D complex ones. Then we capitalize the cancer cells, the braid cancels in our metrics, basically the collagen gel. After culture for about 10 days, you can really recapitulate such three-dimensional network. It tracks. Now we asked how to generate this. Okay, if you go to check the single cell that we can see is that during the digging of the check. During the digging of the channel, the can cells contract the electrocymatric. In this case, it's collagen fiber. So, how the two nebulae cells can know each other so that they can dig the channel to each other? That's interesting. But you can see this case here. If you have the two nebulin cells, the can cell contracts the collagen gel because they contract the fibers that can deliver such a mechanical information to the nebula cells. To test this, we do not. To test this, we do not use this kind of cell spot in size. Instead, we use object and FM. We manually to contract the fibers, we can control the direction of the tracks of the can cell dig. So you can see in the case, if you check them, they can dig this out. And then we do the single cell sequencing. We find that in all the cance cells, in the case of bread cancels, they have sub-step, sub-type, which have much better capability. Have a much better capability for digging the codes. Then you can find all the mechanics related, the expression of the proteins or the markers. And finally, for the first time, we use mechanics understanding to understand how the brain cancer is developed, how they form this kind of three-dimensional facts. Okay, so for the second part, we know that, okay, we try to combine some methods, experimental methods, and modeling to understand how the To understand how the mechanical cues affect the cell behaviors, but for the Klin Doc, they are more interested in this kind of mechanical diagnosis. I'll give you some examples for such a case. Actually, in our previous work, a talk, we have heard about how the compression symbol can be used as a biomechanical marker for the disease diagnosis. In this case, I'll give you some examples. All the references are from literature, not from ourselves. In this case, actually, last year from Nature. Actually, last year from nature, there is one people said that if you give the brain, if you know the structure, actually, you can know the function. You don't need all the biochemical analysis. And if you go to the decrease level from organ level to level, you only need to the ECM structure, then you can know the liver diseases. And also, you can see the published paper have also shown that if you know the cell or nuclear morphology or the competing structure inside the nucleus, you can also be used as. Nutase, you can also use be used as markers for the disease. Actually, in cancer, especially in the tumor diagnosis, people have used stimulus and collagen or the morphology or the molecular level intervening or pyrrho as bimarkers for the cancers. For our case, you can see that this is the liver fibrosis. People have used different levels to show that if you have these mechanical cues, you can use them to fabric, to differentiate the liver fibrosis. Liver fibrasis. In our own group, we also use this case for the mechanodiacy. For the indicators, is liver cancer. We got the human liver cancer from clinics, but for our case, we can match different areas from center to the outside. This is one interesting phenomenon that we found the peripheral stiffness at the outer layer, which is highly associated with five-year survival rate. Year survival rate. It's not just the overall stiffness of the liver tissue, but only the surrounding peripheral area. This is very interesting. So, after even though this, we can use this for diagnosis and also we understand this is because this kind of different kind of transaction pathway for that. And also, we develop different variable strength sensors to measure the tissue stimulus or other physical properties. In this case, you can see we developed this kind of variable strength. This kind of variable strain sensor, and we can get all the different information. In the case, it's hydrogeosis microfree spinning of strain fibers. And also for all the methods, we can now use this at different levels to measure, characterize the stimulus. You can see from the healthy liver to the stiffened liver and to the liver cancer. As the teachers, at the teacher level, you can see here, at the teacher level, the liver cancer is different. Liver cancer is different than a normal tissue, but at cell level, it's softer. Just as we heard about from previous talk, because if you at a tissue level, you have cells and also you have a cellular matrix, this will tell the difference. And also, we have this kind of at a molecular level developed different device for the protein and the nucleic acid detection, especially for the integrating the period or the molecular level. But we are more interested in how this can be used for clinics. Can be used for clinics. So, we have a previous postdoc now is the associate head of the hospital. Now, we have built clinical patient, clinic patient, about 500 patients. We use our mechanical cues. We combine with traditional biochemical and clinical markers. So, we use all these kinds of things for predicting the disease and the progression of the treatment response, or also treatment safety. We found that. Children's safety. We found that if you have this kind of mechanical cues included in your all the markers, which can be which can significantly improve all the predictions of four aspects. Now, finally, we will go to the treatment. So people can go if you understand such mechanical change and mechanical biology, how they can help it for treating the different disease. Actually, at different levels in clinics, people have tried to use mechanical cues for treating disease. I'll give some examples. Disease. I'll give some examples. In this case, we have worked really with the clinic doctors. In this case, if you have a skin wound, normally people know that if you contract the wound, this will speed up the self-healing of the wound. What we did is very simple. We use a mobile phone to take an image and use the AR program to analyze the position of the wound on your body and predict how much force you need to contract your wound. You need to contract your wound to your designed area, designed size. We then upload it to the cloud. Then we have by printer. Then we download the information to byprinter. We can print this dressing. And we adhere this dressing to the wound. Basically, the surrounding area, they adhere to the skin and that contract because it's stimulus responsive. Stimulus responsive addressing, then it can contract your wound to the design area. So, we test our AR program and also we test this program in the big animals, in the case in the pig. We found it can really speed up the wound healing process. And also at the molecular level, if you understand the mechanical biology, how it can help the clinic doctors, in this case, is a specific skin disease, is AD. So, for the AD, you know, they have a strong. So for the AD, you know, they have a scratch. The scratch gives you kind of stretch. This will damage cell-cell connection. In clinics, people, the clinic doctors always use the OS, the inhibition, the agent for treating the disease. But we found how this stretch will generate this kind damage of cell-cell connection. I found that fact, focal Hesian kinase, play a significant role in this process. What we did is very simple. What we did is very simple. We combined this ROS inhibition and affect inhibition agent, and we found that they can signal improve the treatment of the disease. Like this case, so that you can say we combine this biochemical and also the mechanotherapy to treat this kind of AD disease. And then I'll give you another example how we can use this stuff. So, this is a tumor-related stuff. It says stomach tumor. In this case, you can see. Tumor in this case, you can see if you have the same tumor, but if you give the different patients the same drug, they give different response. The chemical of the doctors always said that because the patient the difference. But what's the meaning of difference? We check out easy because mainly because the extracymatrix, basically because they have different density stimulus alignment. If you get such information, we develop a mathematical model which we can predict the diffusion of the drugs into this. The drugs into these tissues. Basically, just need to give our tissue information. We can predict which kind of drugs can be better, give you better results, student results. And also, we can develop different pre-drug agent. For this case, we can use it to degrade different proteins so that it can give you better controlment. And also, we are all interested in the kind of immunotherapy. How immunotherapy can be combined with mechanics? We have been invited to publish several. We have been invited to publish several papers and also special issues for this tactic of physical environment for the two more immunotherapy. I will give a specific example here. It's a clinical example. Basically, clinics, we found that for the liver cancer, the cancer will migrate to the liver. But for the lung, if you apply this immunotherapy, they give you really good results. But for the metastatic side, But for the metastatic side of the liver, it's very bad. Okay, so the clinical ask, this you can see, this is the clinical data show that the lung give you better results, but not liver. This is very straightforward for us because lung have a stretch, but liver doesn't. But liver is a little bit stiffer than the lung. So the organ specific mechanical environment will affect such treatment response. To test this, we tested this kind of lung. This we tested this kind of lung cancer, we give it a site cyclic stretch. We found that this will really increase expression of the PDL-1, which means that it can give you a better immunotherapy response. But the liver doesn't. The kidney said, Are you saying that we need to stretch the liver? No, definitely not. This is what mechanical biology can tell us. The mechanical biology tells us that the cancer cells sense The tensor cells sense the stretch while the PRO signal password. That means we only need to use this kind of Yoda 1 to increase the PRO1 expression in the liver. You don't need to stretch the liver. You just need to apply this agent. Then you can let the cancer cells in the liver to feel such stretch. So you can convert this cold cancer to hot cancer. Cancer, we call it cancer. This is a very interesting project we are doing. But this is not crazy enough. What do we do? It's just a part mechanically, we kind of thinking to the killing problems. So this is scientists, I said the logic we get it from A to D, but only medicine we take away. I'll go quickly about this part. So today, everybody talk about the artificial intelligence. This is because we have human health intelligence, then you have a neural system, then you have the artificial intelligence, then you have the GPD. Infinity this then you have the GPD right in every laptop and the people use this for different tasks like revising the research papers right but if you don't have the neural system will they have such intelligent behaviors 20 years ago in this nature paper people imagine imagining that the plant may have an intelligence 20 years later last year in the sale paper people said that if you have this plant right you have you stimulate them they can Have you stimulated them? They can generate voice, but in the extra sound range, and then can talk with each other. That's interesting, right? If your plant can have such intelligent behaviors, we need to think everything in different ways. Okay, how about the basic unit of the human cells? In this science paper, you can see here if you have a group of cancelled in myth, they can come out. But only for the group ones, the single cancelles will be tracked there. Single 10 cells will be tracked there. That's interesting, right? So, this intelligent emergence in cells and single cell levels, they do not deliver a behavior like the intelligent behavior, but as a group, they have this one. So, how? This is very simple, very straightforward. Because you have a group of cancer, they will eat all the nutrients around. Let's generate this kind of gradient. Then they move out. It's very straightforward. Okay, if you think about this, I can give you another example. Example: In this case, we know that all cells have mechanical memory. If you culture the cancer outside the body for a long time, then you implant the cells inside the body. The cancer will go to the boom, as these people reported. So, in the past 10 years, we think about if cell can have this kind of intelligence. So, we promote this kind of term, cellular intelligence. I will give you an example. When people think about fibrosis, they always think fibrosis is not reversible. Is not reversible. It's basically if you ask doctors. So we ask students a simple question, right? The basic cell for the fibrosis is fibroblast, right? In the same memory, you have different mechanical sensors, like an integral or pyrotele. Why? The same cells have different, the multiple, the sensors for the same cues. So we use mathematics, we found that these two. So, we found that these two use the case integrated pyrrho, they can generate mechanical positive feedback. If you just degrade extra symmetrics for five-routing tissues, they will keep segrading the extra metrics. You cannot reverse it. But if you at the same time, you damage this kind of feedback loop, make it possible to reverse this fibrous purely from mathematics. Then we test this in cells and in animals. In cells and in animals, in front of that, it's really durable. That's very interesting. Another example is stem cell mechanical memory. In the past 10 years, we have seen a lot of papers probably say that because stem cells have such a mechanical memory, if you culture them on the substrate for long enough, right, that we memorize this kind of culture history. So, Professor Lin Ming in our center, they said, if you have this kind of memory, they definitely have some kind of system to remove. System to remove the memory. So they found that this kind of in category can really be used to remove the mechanical memory. For this case, you have stem cells, then you capture a difference. If you control the in category, then you can remove, delete such mechanical memory. This is a very interesting case about this. And also, we go further. We know that this year we have witnessed the two Nobel Prize for physics and chemistry, both for the artificial intelligence, right? Actually, then. Actually, then last week we published this paper, which we call artificial intelligence for mechanical medicine. As I have mentioned, biomechanics, mechanical biology, mechanical diagnosis, and then mechanical therapy. How artificial intelligence can enable all these four aspects? For biomechanics, you say, if you want to extract such mechanical cues from your body at different levels, actually intelligently can definitely help you for that, enable you to get more and better. Get more and better information for that. And follow me biology. We have an ongoing project. When people study some kind of mechanical biology study, they say, I need to check this pathway from pyrotech to the cycle to nucleus randomly. So I asked my people to collect all the mechanical related pathways and to train artificial intelligence. That way you need to know that I have different mechanicals, I have different type of cell types. Tell me which cell pathway is. Tell me which cell pathway, signaling pathway, I should focus. That's very interesting strategy for that. And also, for mechanical diagnosis, you can see for most of the case, not a purely mechanical biomarkers for diagnosis. You need to combine them with other say by chemicals. For this case, artificial intelligence can definitely do a lot of things. And for the mechanical therapy, you can use this for personalized treatment. For this case, for boom implant. If you want to design some kind of matter by materials, right? You need to have a different strategy. Right, you need to have a different structure, microstructure design. I think that can definitely help you for that. If you engineer, can go to these people for that. But this can be really applied almost to all the disease because mechanics is so general for the different organs or different cell types. So, we now work really with different departments, in clinical doctors, in hospitals, like IR Skin Bone. Actually, we have published, I'm sorry, for the Chinese, we have published different reviews. We only publish them in the clinical journals, like Zhong Hua Shi in China. Clinical channels like Zhonghua Shile in China. So, we really want the clinic to read this to help them to understand mechanics really play an important role in disease. So, this year we have been awarded for a key grant from SFC. So, this is for focus on the tumor mechanomedicine. So, this case is very simple. With the development of the cancer, you can see exymmetrics have such a remodeling. Such remodeling will affect all the disease. All the disease progress and also the treatment response. And then, okay, so for the first aspect, we first need to know if you have the specific tumors, how you can characterize the different biomechanical cues to understand from stimulus, which is going to take from T level to cell level. So, how such cues, how they relate to disease is not clear. And then, if you have different cues, you need to engineer such rich models to well control. Models to well-contribute such stimulus, visco elasticity or viscopality, so that you can understand such a mechanical transaction pathway, the mechanism. And then you combine this, from our clinical patients, we use biomechanical cues and mechanical biological markers for the tumor disease. And then we want to really develop some the treatment method to intervent this combined biochemical treatment with our mechanical interventions for improved mechanical. For improved mechanical therapy. So, in this case, we form this kind of mechanical medicine. Basically, it is a calibration. Then, we use the mechanical models. Then, you understand the mechanism. Then you can use this for tumor disease and treatment. Okay, so we have published several papers in the past five years. Maybe some of you guys may be interested. So, finally, I would say the mechanics can really power future medicine. Maybe not. Future medicine. Maybe not the mechanics and other physical cues, but mechanics is for now is much easier than the other physical cues like magnetic or electrical for kinetic understand. This is why we focus on mechanics for now. So in the past 20 years, we have tried to combine the biological world with physical world. But from 2021, we think that the next two or three decades, we should really combine this digital world with biological world and physical world. Digital war with biological and field reward. The biology, the digital world is not just affinity, there's much more intense that. So, the last slide, I would say, I would really acknowledge the funding, the support from SFC. And also in my center, we have about 32 faculties and also more than 100 clinical doctors working in my center. So, this is really helpful for us to much better understand the clinical problem. Thank you all for the attention.
