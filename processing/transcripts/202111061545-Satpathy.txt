So Patty Ponia is a postdoc fellow at the U of A working with the Banish Patnik. Before that, he was a PhD, he got his PhD at University of Michigan, Annabelle. His interests include the spectral theory of locally symmetric spaces, harmonic analysis, An Lie groups, macro-local analysis, and Fourier integral of rate. And Fourier integral operators. He's going to talk to us on the scattering theory of locally symmetric spaces. I just want to make sure. I'm sharing my screen. Can everyone see that? So, can it be full screen? Yeah, we can all see it, but can you make it full screen? Screen, uh, I think I think f5. I don't know if you oh, you're using Mac, or I'm not Mac person. I'm not so it's a Mac actually. Habiba, you're the Mac expert. Um, so I'm gonna again just reshare my screen because I know something happened. Okay, okay, so hi everyone, I'm I'm Punia Satpati. I'm currently uh I'm currently a postdoc at UF Alberta, and before this, I was a PhD student at the University of Michigan. So, today I'm going to talk about geometric scattering theory. So, it's a subject on which I did some work as part of my doctoral dissertation. So, yeah. So, the subject of geometric scattering theory was actually introduced by physicists, Ludwig Fadiv and Viktor Popov, to establish a rigorous framework.  Given by, let's say, a modified factor which is just non-zero in the unit disk, but outside the unit disk, it's zero everywhere. Everyone. So that's what scattering theory does. So there are several frameworks for studying geometric scattering theory. The one that's of main interest to number theorists and people working in geometric analysis and spectral geometry on manifold is the framework developed by Lax and Philips. So due to the shortest time, I will not be able to talk about the Lax-Philip framework, but what I will do is focus on some of the geometric aspects. Geometric aspects of this Lax-Phillip framework and the kind of interesting results that one could get for locally symmetric spaces based on studying geometric scattering theory. So the one problem that we'll focus on is scattering on locally symmetric spaces. So as you know, locally symmetric spaces are generalizations of hyperbolic surfaces. So my first example. So, my first example to present is scattering on finite area hyperbolic surface. So, this is the work of mathematician Victor Guillemi. He was the first one who realized that just like in the case of a compact manifold, for a non-compact hyperbolic surface, you can produce a class of geodesic called scattering geodesic that run to infinity in both directions. So they run between cusps, and you could And you could produce a Poisson-type relation that relates the geometry of these scattering geodesics to the scattering matrices, which are essentially describing the continuous spectrum of a finite area hyperbolic surface. So here's the setup. I start with the upper half plane with the assigned hyperbolic metric, and then I have associated hyperbolic Laplacian. Haulic Laplacian, which is given by delta equal to minus y squared d2 over dx2 plus d2 over dy2. Since that is a complete Riemannian manifold, the Laplacian also has like a unique self-adjoint extension, which I'll also denote by the same notation delta. So I'm now going to consider a co-finite discrete torsion free subgroup of PSL2R and take X to be H mod gamma, the associated finite area non-compact high. Finite area non-compact hyperbolic surface. And I'm going to assume that it has n inequivalent casps. So, what one then knows from reduction theory is that I could choose a sufficiently large positive number a, so that I could write x as a disjoint union of a compact subset x sub a. Now, it's going to depend on the choice for a, but all I want is to choose a a that's large enough and give such a decomposition. So, I want to split x into. Decomposition. So I want to split x into a compact code x sub a and finite number of open sets x sub i. Now each x sub i is going to be the cusp neighborhood corresponding to the cusp ki. And one knows that each such x i is isometric to this set where this is a subset of the upper half plane. But the real part is between negative one half and positive one half, and the imaginary part is assumed to be like. Part is assumed to be like bigger than or equal to A. And as everyone knows, this is like the standard caste neighborhood. So once I have the setup, I'm going to introduce a class of geastics called scattering geastics. So what is a scattering geodesic for such a finite area hyperbolic surface X? It's a godesic that spans, you know, that's contained outside the compact core. So that's Outside the compact core. So that's contained in X difference X sub A. So that means contained outside the compact core for large positive as well as negative times T. So then I can go further ahead and make this definition that a scattering geodesic that's contained in X sub I for T significantly less than T naught and in X J for T sub significantly bigger than T1. It's called a scattering geodesic that's scattered between cuspens X side. Scattered between cuspens xi to xj. One then defines the associated Sojourn time of such a scattering geodesic to be the total amount of time the geodesic spends in the compact core X sub A. So which means it's the time that starts when the geodesic enters the compact core and then time stops when it finally exits. So here is a quick review of how to construct scattering. Of how to construct scattering geodesics for such a finite area hyperbolic surface. You assume one of the cusp k sub i is at infinity and the other cusp k sub j is on the real axis, so it's the point x j, zero. And assume that the cusp neighborhood of x kj is bounded by these two geodesic, sigma 1 and sigma 2. So now I want to produce a scattering geodesic that runs between. Scattering geodesic that runs between the cusp Ki and the Kj. How do I do that? I choose a Jodasic sigma that joins this cusp Kj on the real axis to a point to some arbitrary point Q on the real axis. My only condition for sigma is that it should lie between sigma 1 and sigma 2. So I want to choose sigma in the following way. And then what I could do is I could look for an element. Could look for an element B inside gamma such that Bq is infinity. There is at most one such element. And then if you take the image of this geodesic B sigma in H mod gamma, that'll be a scattering geodesic. One could show that. So this kind of lays out the construction for all the scattering geodesics, and one could show that this construction, in fact, gives you a countable number of scattering geodesics between any two given cusp neighborhoods. Any two given cusp neighborhoods. Now, in order to relate these scattering geodesics to the spectral theory of finite area hyperbolic surface, I'm going to introduce what's called isosign series and scattering matrices associated to different cusps. So, we start with an isometry of the vertical strip Z between, real part of Z between negative one half and half. So, this is a subset. Half. So, this is a subset of the upper half plane. And map it onto the jth cusp neighborhood, such that psi f infinity is kj. So, then associated to the ith cusp, you have your Island series. Now, we make this change of variable and then define e z tau to be this modified Eisenstein series where I'm restricting the real part of S we have. And then this is kind of the main result of land. Kind of the main result of Laggs-Phillip theory that if you take this integral of yeah yeah so if you if you take the integral of this function e from negative one half to one half so that's like calculating the Fourier coefficient in the expansion of e zeta In the expansion of EZ tau in the J-th cusp neighborhood. This is how you define the scattering matrix Cij tau. So the Cij tau contains important spectral theoretic information about the finite area hyperbolic surface. So once that's established, here is the main result of vector glamine. So let's say tau ij be the set of sojourn. Say tau ij be the set of sojourn times for geodesics that are scattered from the i-th cusp neighborhood to the jth cusp neighborhood. You define the following integral. And then if imaginary part of tau is less than or equal to negative 3 halves, you have this following relation, which kind of mimics the Selberg trace formula. It only deals with the continuous spectrum. On the left-hand side, you have these scattering matrices that are Catering matrices that are kind of parametrizing the continuous spectrum. And on the right-hand side, you have these geodesics that run to infinity and spend a finite amount of time in the compact code. So if you recall Selberg Tree's formula for compact hyperbolic surfaces, there you have a similar relation where on one side you have length spectrum of closed geodesics, on the other side you have the eigenvalue. The other side, you have the eigenvalues of Laplacian. So, in that sense, this is kind of the continuous spectral theoretic version of, or at least a modified version of Selberg Tree's formula. Okay, so now I want to talk about scattering geodesics on general Riemannian manifold. So, how do I define such geodesics in a general Riemannian manifold? I start with a complete Riemannian manifold S. A complete Riemannian manifold S, and I want to introduce this class of godesic called scattering geosics and S. So, how do I make such a definition? All I want to do is I start with the geodesic gamma t and I require it to be eventually distance minimizing in both directions. In the sense that there exists T1 and T2 less than T1 less than T2, both real numbers, so that gamma restricted to this. That gamma restricted to this half-closed interval from minus infinity to t1 and gamma restricted to this semi-closed interval from t2 to infinity are both isometric embedding onto its image. Now, here is a very generic example of geodesics on a cylinder. As you can see, I have used color codings to label three different kinds of geodesics. There is the There is the blue geodesic that's a close geodesic that's parallel to the base of the cylinder. Then I have these red geodesics that kind of spiral out to infinity. They run to infinity in both direction, but they're not eventually distance minimizing in either direction. And then finally, I have the green line that's representing another class of geodesics on the cylinder, each of The cylinder, each of which is parallel to the axis of the cylinder, so that's the green line, and that's going to be a scattering geodesic. So that's kind of an example of what a scattering geodesic might look like. Now, I'm going to restrict my attention to locally symmetric spaces showing up as quotient of the form x mod gamma, where x again is a symmetric space of the form g mod k, g being a semi-ising. G mod K, G being a semi-singular Lie group, K is a maximal compact subgroup, gamma is an arithmetic subgroup of G. Now, just like finite area hyperbolic surface, such locally symmetric spaces, even though non-compact, they have this nice decomposition into a compact core, and you get a finite number of ends that go to infinity. Now, there is a precise statement about this, and it's A statement about this, and it's called the reduction theory of such a locally symmetric space. But essentially, the picture that you get is similar to what you see in the case of a finite hyperbolic surface. You have a compact core, and then you have finite number of n's. And in fact, the number of n's is closely related to the class of parabolic subgroups of G. Now, for such a locally symmetric space of finite wall, Locally symmetric space of finite volume and non-compact. One could define associated sojourn time for a scattering geodesic, just as we did for the finite area hyperbolic surface. You can just define the sojourn time of a scattering geodesic to be the time it spends in the compact group. So when the rank of S is one, so which should be the case when G has rank one, Lijian Z, who was my Lijian Z, who was my advisor back at Michigan, and Misi Zorsky. So they actually in 2000 wrote a paper where they studied scattering geodesic on a rank-on locally symmetric space. So essentially generalizing vector equilibrium's work. So again, in this case, scattering geodesics are these eventually distance minimizing geodesic that run into infinity in both directions. And then one can define an associated sojourn time for such a scattering geodesic. So, germ time for such a scattering genesic. And then one of their main results was that the frequency of oscillations coming from the singularities of the Fourier transform of scattering matrix occurs at sojourn times of the scattering geodesic on the locally symmetric space. So, for those of you interested, here is like a more precise statement. So, assume that the rank of this locally symmetric space S is one, then S is one, then let sigma t be a scattering geodesic in S between the ends associated with two rational parabolic subgroups q1 and q2. Then the first result is that sigma t lies in a smooth family of scattering geodesics of the same sojourn time and the set of such scattering geodesics could be parametrized by a common finite covering space of the associated boundary locally symmetric spaces. Associated boundary locally symmetric spaces. And you further see that the set of Sojourn times form a discrete sequence of points in R of finite multiplicity. The second result is a little more technical. So what it tries to say is it kind of generalizes Victor Guilleman's argument result. On one hand, you'll have these scattering matrices. Again, they are coming from the continuous spectrum of the Laplacian. Continuous spectrum of the Laplacian associated to this non-compact locally symmetric space. So you have that on one hand. On the other hand, you have this set of Sojourn times. And there is, in fact, a precise relation that you could write down just as in the case of finite hyperbolic surface, where it's going to be kind of a similar exponential sum as we saw from Victor Quillimin's work. So that's about scattering geodesics. So what I So, what I did in my PhD thesis was I was looking at locally symmetric spaces of rank strictly bigger than one, and then I tried to produce generalizations of these scattering matrices. So I call them scattering flats. So they're essentially immersed flat submanifolds in this locally symmetric space S. And then I tried to study if I could produce some. If I could produce something analog to the Sojourn time and then relate that to the scattering matrices coming from the continuous spectra. So here is the definition. So as before, I'm taking S to be a locally symmetric space of the form x mod gamma. And then say g be the Lie algebra of this Lie group G. So here is a definition of the scattering flats. Of the scattering flat. So you start with the abelian subalgebra of this V algebra G. Denote by sigma, the set of roots corresponding to the adjoint action of A on G. And then a scattering flat is a flat submanifold of this space x mod gamma. It's of dimension equal to the rank of A. It's given by a smooth immersion of this form, such that for any choice of a full subset of positive roots with the associated positive chamber A plus. Associated positive chamber A, we have the restriction of psi to a certain shifted wheel chamber to be an isometric embedding into X mod gamma. So again, what this definition essentially does is in the case of a scattering geodesic, there are only two directions to look for. But since these scattering flats that I'm considering are essentially images of an abelian subalgebra of G. In sub-algebra of G, I need to look at all the chambers in A and make sure that each chamber with an appropriate shift is like isometrically in B. So again, due to the lack of time, I'm only going to discuss the case of scattering flats when G is SL3R. So let's quickly review some basics about Lie algebra and parabolic subgroups of SL3R. So I'm going to denote by again script G the Lie algebra. By again, script G the Lie algebra of SL3R consisting of 3x3 traceless matrices with real entries. H is going to denote the Catan subalgebra consisting of diagonal matrices in G. And I'm going to identify H with this subspace of R3. We have these standard functionals defined from H to the real. And then G beta is the associated root space in the Lie algebra G. In the Lie algebra G for any arbitrary non-zero linear functional beta. And then one has the root space decomposition of this Lie algebra G. And one can choose a set of positive roots to be alpha one to alpha two three alpha one three. One can choose a set of simple roots. You can define a half sum of positive roots basically this way. And here Basically, this week, and here is the chambers in the Cartan subalgebra of SL3R. As you can see, each chamber has an associated set of positive roots that I've labeled in here. And of course, there is the associated real group, which is S3, the set of permutations on three letters. And it acts on these chambers essentially by permuting requirements. So, yeah, so from the standard Yeah, so from the standard theory of parabolic subgroups, one knows that each chamber in H gives rise to a minimal parabolic subgroup in SL3R with a common split component H. And any arbitrary minimal parabolic subgroup of SL3R is K conjugate to one of these six parabolic subgroups. So each of these chambers would give a rank two parabolic subgroup for SL3R. Any other parabolic subgroup is just going to be K-conjugate, K being SO3. K being SO3. So I'm again going to denote N by the set of upper triangular unipotent matrices in SL3R and then denote by P0 the minimal parabolic subgroup of SL3R consisting of a triangular matrices. And we have the following Langlands decomposition of P0. Now, apart from P0, SL3R has two other standard maximal parabolic subgroups. So I'm not going to look at them. Going to look at them for the purpose of this talk. So now let's look at the associated locally symmetric space. So we take again G equal to SL3R. K is SO3. I'm taking gamma to be SL3Z. So we look at two-dimensional scattering flats in this locally symmetric group. Now, since there is only one gamma conjugacy class of minimal parabolic subgroups of SL3R, and I've already chosen a representative. And I've already chosen a representative P0. P0 is just the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in SM3R. One can say that any such scattering flat actually scatters between the Ziegel and associated to P0 and itself. So I choose a gamma in gamma minus P0. Gamma admits of Bruhet decomposition like this, where U1 and U2 are in N, gamma is in A. This should be A, this should be so A is defined previously here as the subgroup of diagonal matrices with positive diagonal entries. And Z is M0, which is like just plus or minus 3 by 3 times identity matrices. W is element on S3, the set of permutations on three letters. So this is essentially what happens for scattering flats for this nuclear symmetric space. So every Nuclear symmetric space. So, every such a choice of gamma gives rise to a scattering flat, or rather a family of scattering flat, with a common associated Sojourn vector. So this parameter kind of generalizes the notion of Sojourn time. It's a vector-valued parameter. It sits inside the Cartan sub-algebra. And gamma A is coming from this Brouwer decomposition. So once this is So, once this is done, what one could show is that if P0 and P1 correspond to adjacent chambers, so for example, chamber 1 corresponds to P0. Chamber 2 is like the second parabolic subgroup of the form W, P0, W inverse, where W is the element 1, 2. So, in such a situation, what one could show is that you could choose a maximal parabolic subgroup Q containing both P0 and P. Q containing both P0 and P1. And what would happen is you could show that this family of scattering flats actually projects down to a family of scattering geodesic in H mod SL2C. That's when you choose gamma so that P0 and P1 correspond to adjacent chambers. So you started the family of scattering flats upstairs in Flats upstairs in SL3R, mod SO3, mod SL3Z, and then project onto a family of scattering geodesics. And as you know, in HMOD SL2Z, we completely understand all the scattering geodesics from Victor Pulemitz work. So here is kind of the main result of my thesis in the case of G is equal to CL3R. So if two minimal parabolic subgroups correspond to adjacent chambers with respect to a common split component, A common split component. Then, first of all, you have a family of scattering flats in the locally symmetric space S, which is the space in here. It projects onto a family of scattering geodesic in H mod SL2C. And all these scattering geodesics that are obtained through this process of projection have a common Sojourn time given by the norm of the Sojourn vector of the scattering flat upstairs. Vector of the scattering flat upstairs. So that's one of the main results. The other one relates this set of sojourn times tau to the scattering matrices. So for further reference, I'm going to denote the set of sojourn times associated to the scattering geodesic running between the single cusp of H mod SL2ZST. And then I look at rank 2 scattering matrices associated to S. So again, it So, again, due to lack of time, I'm not going to go into detailed definitions of these objects. But again, they're very crucial to parametrizing the continuous spectrum of this non-compact space. There are six of them, each depending on one element of this permutation group of three letters. So that's one entry. And the second entry is this lambda, which sits now in the dual of H. Now, in the dual of H tensored with C. So, this is a kind of my extension of Victor Guillermin's result. So, you take the element W equal to 1, 2 in S3. You have Lambda at such an H-dual tensor C. Assume that the real part of Lambda is sufficiently positive, and AB is chosen. Is chosen in this set so that A is less than B and W is bigger than WB. There is only one possible choice for such an AB. You can see that. So here's kind of my generalization to vector Guillermo's result. On the left-hand side, you have rank two scattering matrices. On the right-hand side, you have the similar exponential sum where T ranges over this set of sojourn time. So the only thing that you see Time. So, the only thing that you see which is of interest is that I don't get a sum over the set of Sojourn vectors, but rather I get a sum over the set of Sojourn times of these projected scattering geodesic. So, that's essentially related to the fact that there are factorizations of these higher-ranked skatering matrices into rank one skatering matrices. So, that's all. So that's all part of Langland Sahish Chandra General 3D of 569 CD. So yeah, I think that's it for me. And towards the end, I just want to give you a summary of this whole technique that I used in my thesis. So I start with by looking at scattering flats in this bigger locally symmetric space, X mod gamma, with a common Swiss vector. The next technique is, you know, optimizing. Technique is you know obtaining a projection into scattering geodesics in a lower dimensional locally symmetric space. So, in the case of SL3R, this lower dimensional symmetric space was H mod SL2Z. Now, this direction is already covered by the work of Victor Gulemin, Z, and Zorski. And this direction was essentially the one that I tried to unravel, which was the factorization of Uh, the factorization of higher-rank scattering matrices. So, so that's kind of the picture that I wanted to present with this talk. So, I think I'm done. So, thank you.
