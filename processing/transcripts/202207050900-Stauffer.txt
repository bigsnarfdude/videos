Okay, so just a quick recap of last lecture. We looked at the progress of the picture. And we showed positive speed by the already simple one-scale argument that was accelerating. We had a statement at the top. And we're saying, as the infection progressed inside and outside, And it's outside, it will hit several sites with several particles, and it infects several particles. And once we get several particles infected, I can ask that this one goes to each of the neighboring logs in one square step. That was what we did yesterday. And the crucial thing we use the data is no matter what happened outside. No matter what happens outside the box, if I look at this box, no matter what's happening outside the box, the moment the infection enters, the distribution of susceptible pathways is IID possible. I don't get any information about the susceptible pathways inside, but I only serve in what's happening outside. That's crucial, because it allows us to just say, oh, now I can define what a box, what means what box will be put in there. What misfortune also we move in there, and actually, the definition was even independent of different flows. This is just not true in the SIS, in the SI model, because now septo particles are also moving. So if I observe things outside, I can get an information on how the particles inside. So we need to do a bit more work to draw this. So that's the whole thing. So that's the goal for today. We're going to look at the SI models for particles are moving, susceptible and infected particles with the same rates. And then we want to see whether the infection spread respaws. Okay, so the idea is to try to mimic what we did for the fraud model. So the basic events that we look at is essentially going to be the same. If the infection enters the box, I want it to hit several particles so that several particles So that several particles get infected. And then I have several particles infected. I can ask one of them to go to each neighbor. And then this can cascade and give bosses. So that is to me the same argument. But a little bit more delicate. So first, let's start with scale one. We want to remove scale ice for this, but let's start with scale one. And this is already different than from all because I have to specify space m time. So here I've been. So here a picture now space and draw everything in one dimension. So space here is the horizontal lines with space and the vertical line is time. Just take this region of space and time and desolate it. The desolation is slightly more complicated, but the bots actually overlap. So let's go step by step. So let me go step by step. We're going to desolate space, we're going to partition the space into boxes of size L1 over 3. So we'll build in this time box and find intervals in the dimension. L1 over 3. Then for every such interval of my stesillation, I will create a box which has this as its center and has size and load. So this center is mimics, that's those centers. Symphony that's those centers and the box mimics those boxes. So now I have overlapping box. So this center also has its own box that's here in space. Okay. I'm not drawing just not to confuse the picture, but you can imagine that if I draw like a bubble here, you have these boxes and also the other ones. Okay, time. Okay, time I'm just going to partition it and partition into length L1, which for us is going to be more or less what had before, L1 square. But I will put a small constant in front, which will be good. So time does not overlap. And not when I say box overlap in time. It's just really a partition of my time in. In okay, so now I have one box for each interval of time and each box of space, and this is what I call Q, and now I have to carry this index one, which means scale one, and has two coordinates, one for space, which I which is in Z D, and power, which lives in Z. And it's just a coordinate for the time interval of the box. So this is the definition. Here's the definition. So it's a box, the iPad is a box of length L1 in space. It's shifted always by L1 over 3. So then by 2 over 1, but the length of the box is here. It's L1. Then this time we said the next component of this box is just a middle. It goes from tau S1, S1 is the length, to tau plus. S1 J length into tau plus one S and Tau just a minute okay and similarly I have what I was calling before the center of the box I also have the center of the box here which will be these integrals of length L1 over three so those are the space it's an integral it's a box in space of length L1 over three and this is it really And this is really the designation of space. But the center of the box is just one unit of time. At first, I'm just going to count it in the dotting. So this is. I just don't want to spoil some picture where you can go one big box. One big box. Yes, that's right. One big box. Yeah, that was a bit small. Oh, these one is the three, and here's what we call this center of the box. One here, here's the center, and everything needed is the box. And there's another element you have to add in space. So the center is only in space. It's space-time, but there is only one unit of time. So the center, if you look, it's the data space components, the data time components, just one unit of time. It's just this unit of time. But the next box will have its own center, its own unit of time. Time interval. It's the same height as the big one. Yeah, it's at the bottom of the time interval. Oh, it has clouds. Okay, it's a single one. So it's the center is really that box in that time. It's the center of this box. So this box will have its own center, which is different from this one. From this one. It's just one unit of time. Let's see what the space-time subside. And then I call it the base, which is essentially the same as the center, but the whole thing here. So this whole part here is the other part is different. Do you mind drawing a part that overlaps with the neighbor box? How much of that overlaps with the base overlaps in this instance? So, this is the base of a box. The box that has this center here will have this base. Okay, but no time overlap or is it time? It's the same time. It's the whole, yeah. But if I change the time, then it don't overlap. Okay, why all this mess? It's going to be more messy later, but I suppose we'll read it. So why all this mess? Because if the infection, no, I'm going to look at the infection at this time, if it is at the center of this box, I will observe it inside this box. If it's not in the center, if it's If it's not in the center, if it's on the side here, it will be observed in this box, the box that has that integrated center. But if this box has an infection, an infected particle, which is centered, then the game is on for this box. And I want to do the same thing as in the frog mode. I want to let this infection run for a while. Here is space-time, so it's always running up, up to some time, during which I hope it will. Hope it will meet several of the susceptible particles so that I can now send the set of particles to the neighbors. So I want it to meet several susceptible particles on its way to some fixed time that I'm going to fix. And then when this happens, I'm not a box here, but if it meets several particles here, so we'll Several particles here, so we hope that I can send one of them in this integral, go to the center of that box. Remember, this is S1, which is of all the L1 squared. So for any given particle that the affected particle meets, there's a positive probability that it ends there, and it has to cross a distance of order L in time L1 squared. So it does that with. So it does that with positive probability. So if I need several particles, at least one will get out of it. Okay, so that's exactly the same as a problem model, but in a space-time fashion. Sorry, do you ask that goes to the center like in the picture or could also be a center? No, I'm not asked to go to this center. It could be also this center. It doesn't make a difference. Just don't want to go. I just don't want to go to this entire because then I cannot guarantee I gain something. I just need to gain an odd of L and this proceeder. Okay, but I think it has to be. And the dependence is going to be either particles on mass. That goes along with the dependence. I don't think we will manage to catch independence today. Okay, so that's. Okay. Okay, so that's clear. So let's start setting. First, let's set this interval, what it is. What do I want from this interval? Well, it has to be large enough so that my infection hits several particles. But not only that, it cannot be super large because I don't want my infected particle to leave the box. Why? Because, well, I want to guarantee the distance between each part where I hint on this way and the neighboring box is of order L. So I don't want this to go and wander around. I needed to control how uniform bound on the problem that any part of my meet here will end there. So I'm going to control this. So what I'm going to do is I'll take this length to be smaller than a low square so that this. Square so that this part was not liable to exit. So I have to pick a choice. I just click L draw. Just maybe I will draw. Okay, London is good enough time, it's blows you at L1. Enough time is to blows with L1. So we hope that we are going to meet a number of pathways we meet on its way. It's going to be of the order, not of the order of L1, maybe, but something that blows with L1. That's enough for us. So, sorry, I don't understand what would be the problem if it goes out after a long time, meanwhile it has touched a lot of susceptibles. Yeah, what if it touched susceptible inside? If it were to go out back and meet a lot of susceptible particles inside, A lot of susceptible part was inside, it's still okay, but I'm gonna ask a little bit more. I'm just gonna ask it to stay in so that I don't run imaginatively. But after the time, after the time, what after the time you forget the particle and you call only the susceptible that you have? That's right, I will forget about the infected particle at this time because I collected so many other infected particles that small demand that you said I look at that, not at their own. I look at that, not at their own single one. So, this party has done its job exactly. Because you can imagine that if the infection is to have positive speed, it's by transmitting, right? It's not a single part for it to do it. So, a single part will play its role, transmit to some, and then one of them does what you want, goes forward, and then there it meets several, and then one of these new ones will do its job, and so on. John's so I understand like but if it left you know that it visited L sites that's right but this doesn't give me any information it's not the problem often so I don't I don't know how many steps of particles I visit on this way for example if this particle simply shoots off right then it does it so quickly that maybe I don't hit any part Yes, it will be about the time that spends the box. Okay, but I need a little bit more than this because I need to control the pegness at the end. So I don't want these particles that I meet on the way to come from far away. I want to restrict them to come from the base of the bottom. So that if I look at this junk box at the same time, they are independent. That's just a simple way to get independence across states. If the box over left, they are dependent. Okay, we'll take care of that. But if they are disjoint, they will be independent. This state. Okay, so we want our Our part, which could give it a name to be sell when this part was not from this. Okay, so that's what how I'm going to define a box to be good. So so we have a box q1 with an infected particle. That's the assumption u on its center and then I say that defined. Define one I thought to put is two things happening. This is exactly the same as the current model I'm just going to write. So Q how many pathways it's going to visit. So I'm going to define what several particles mean several particles in that first interval, which is tau s1, tau s1 plus l1. You have to hit several pathways during that small interval, side one. F L1 and particles which were inside and then here is the event that described here and then you need to do this second step is exactly on the problem model for each Each neighboring box J, but here J is not of L1 distance one to I, but it's actually one, two, and three. So each J I can ask one other thing. That's okay. As before, I need to give a name to this all this collection of particles for each j at least one part of it. goes to sensor that's j what is the next answer tau plus one is tau plus s one Tau plus one is tau plus one. Okay, sorry. Okay, is it the event we want to do clear? So the definition is actually the same as in the probable model, but a little bit more work because it space time, you don't want to control the events. Okay, so the question: how do we do this? Sorry, for particles that you hit, they could be infected, you don't care because I don't care about care, yes. Yes, that's the simplicity of the SI and SIS model with respect to the SIR. But then I wouldn't have to care, but here I don't care. Yeah, okay. So, how do we do this? So, first thing to simplify our life, what we what we're not sure if that's really simplified, but what we do here is this particle Q, that is effective particle that turns out to be here, could be anywhere in here. And we don't know where it is because otherwise it would depend on everything on the text. So, the first thing we do is that we just don't really look at Just don't really look at this particle. We just take each side here, not each side that is inside the center for each X in the center of the box. Okay, now it's a little bit complicated because X is space and Let's write it in a better way Enter and so for each side here inside the center I just simple a simple random path up to Simple random path up to time of work. And that would be the path that an affected part would do if it turns out to be that side. They know that each such path visits several patterns. visits several parts. And what the box does is when the process gets to the time of the box, the box will look, do I have an affected part with my symbol? If there is one, it just takes the corresponding path, looks at the site, takes the corresponding path, and gives you that path, and that part is compelled to do that path. If there are model one, we choose one. We don't need to bother with model one. No, we don't need to bother with modeling one. You choose one particle, some other die order on the sides, you choose one and give the path. And I'm going to ask that each path hit several parts. Okay, that's not the problem because I have just of all the L1 to the D paths in the profit that needs to succeed. It's going to be roughly exponential. Okay, so now for us. Okay, so now for us, it just means to look at one path for a site here and see what's the probability that I hit several buttons. So there are many ways you can do this, or at least two that I can think of. You could try to control how this path looks like, because if I knew the path, then each particle that's down here just has an independent probability of heating. And the particles are independent. Of course, they are not identical. Of course, they're not identically decided, but each one will be in a different position. But they are independent. But depending on how the path looks like, its probability will change. But still, we could try to limit the possibilities of paths and try to argue this way. I'm going to do it a little bit different way. I'm going to do it a little bit of a more in-zone way. The bad news that I have to introduce another subscription. But that's the last one. So, what I'm going to do? And this is just to go through the dependence, but as these particles move across the other path, each particle depends on what it has on the class. So, I'm going to do the following. I'm going to produce something that is between the center and the base. And the base. Something that lies here. And actually, I'm going to be a really integral space-time. And but I didn't have a bad name, I call it the half of the box. That's why I choose this to be of length algorithm. So the half of the box, maybe I should try to write it here. So the half of the box. For each box, I'll have one, and it will be of length L1 over 2. And then it has an interval in time that goes out of time L1. So power plus 1, tau plus 1. That's one, that's all. That's the half. And now I'm going to force the path not to leave the half in this include. I'm going to ask more from the red path. And not only I don't want it to leave the box, I don't want it to leave the half. Why? Because if this path dangerously starts to get close to the boundary, Get close to the boundary of the box. Recall that I only want to look at particles that start from the base. Here, if I ignore the box by stationary area, I have a density near of particles. But as they move up, this density decreases because I'm not looking at particles on the other side. So I'm losing density. To avoid this, I'm going to run away from the boundary. So I'm going to take this in. Take this inner input space here. I'll restrict my path to stay here. It doesn't change much, but this distance is of order L. It is a time of order. L is L1. So it doesn't change the estimates. This red path will stay inside here with the probability that Joan has explanation in it. So I can take the bounds, no problem. Now, by doing this, Now, by doing this, and now you can test the record this thing. I've got description here. And this description, I zoom in in one of them. It had in space some small. In space, some small L and in time L square. And L is not really, there is some conditions on L, but to make a choice for it to be concrete for two, I choose it to be L1 to some small power. I want to put one over D plus two here, but actually two doesn't work quite well, and one doesn't work. 12 and one doesn't work either. So I have to put something between. So I have to put three halves. So these things just come out of computation. It's a big first clear why I don't can't do the two. But for the moment, the only thing we need to know is we take a half desolate. And why? We desolate it because we try to make the effect. To make the effective particle meet other particles at these times, not in between. I'm not going to care about what happened in between the times of this tessellation. I'm just going to look at one of each of these and see here. Does Q intercept a part? Yeah, I don't know. And also start. And why going through all this maths? Is that Through all these maths, is that for each of these boxes, I can ask what's the probability that inside the box, or that we write in this zooming, so what's the probability that here at the beginning of this box, there are at least what you expect divided by two files. Particles. Particles always from the base. So just imagine that our particle system now has only particles here and that where it is in. So clearly the expected number to be like mu L to the T like because as we go up here, we lose slightly density from parts that not come from. Part that not come from outside. But since this is on the L minus Z L, we don't lose much. So still, the expected value is still strictly bigger than mu L d over 2. And I just ask, what's the probability that is mu L d over 2? This is likely, right? This is just shun of bounds for post-monomenum variables, fields for post-monal variables, possible number variables. And I just get an exponential probability, exponentially likely that this happens. Likely that this happens. For each balls, I just have polynomially many boxes. And that's why L is polynomial, you know, little L. Do you have control over how many particles are at the base? At the moment, I'm relax stationary. I'm ignoring everything else and I say, here I'm starting with Poisson. If I start with Poisson, here. With Poisson mu here, then here we have a slight thinning of this Poisson mu for the particles that don't come from the side. And that's two. The number of particles do Poisson. Now these small boxes are definitely far from independent, right? Sorry? These small boxes are now definitely not independent, right? These small boxes are not independent, but then I do the rough thing. I just do a union bound. So for each given box, I have to put this valuability and just do a union. Box and put this mobility looks to a union box. Now, what happens here? I look at my particle Q. So maybe I will draw. I have my particle Q moving. And suppose it enters one of these sub-boxes. So this is one of the sub-boxes. Square and it enters here if I know that inside here I have at least L d over two particles. That was not what I wanted to say, sorry. Suppose it's actually going above. Actually, it's going above, it's here. It could come from here or outside, that doesn't have the effective particle. If I knew that my effective particle gets here, the end of one of these subboxes, and I know that at the starting time of the subbox, I have these many particles, there is a positive probability that one of them meets the given position of the affected part. Why? Just because Why? Just because each of them, our time is L squared, so each of them will visit that position. We probably one over the time to d over two. But again, the amount of, yes, a given one visits these sites at this time with probability that as of this order, so some constant here. So it doesn't do it with probability one minus this. With probably two and minus these, but each of them is moving independently. So just get these two mu L to the D over two. And this is just a constant. You can have L to the D here and L to the D. It's a constant that depends on mean, but doesn't depend on me. So you can get that bound that doesn't depend on me. So as long as you know that as you follow the infected part of the behavior, when you get time, When you get time, you end up with C. And right before you have mu added mu at two particles, there's a positive probability that one of them visits you. And then you just, if there is one, you just say, okay, I have one particle at visiting. That's, you know, I'm counting these particles and how many that visit. Can I do this for each of these? And I to this point is important. Of course, I don't want to count parts of that list any more than once. And that's why the setting of L comes into the game, because the number of such iterations is just, well, L1 divided by the length square, and this gives me. And this gives me, well, exactly, what's the best change? Yes. So L1 is L to D plus three halves divided by L squared, and this is much smaller than L to D. So I can actually eliminate in each step. In each step in this procedure, I get mu L square particles here, but even if I disregard the one I have already encountered before, I still have mu L d d over three particles to do it, and I get the constant probability at each step. So just that's why I set the L in this way. It's one of the functions. Okay. Okay, but now I have a constant probability of meeting a distinct part by this step. It's given that I get all circles with enough particles, I still have this constant probability at each step. So just chain of bound gives you that the number of particles I meet on this way is Stochasta dominates a binomial with the With the positive probability and this number of interactions. So, no, it's concentrated on the number of interactions. And this is what I hear. This is this number of iterations. Okay? Is it clear? The important thing here is just that this number grows with L, whichever L you think, big or small, grows with L. That's it, but that's what matters. That's what matters. That I'm getting a number of paths with this procedure that grows with L. And then, if I get this, I can guarantee that one of them will go there. Okay, is this clear? I assume it's okay, but I'm trying to figure out why you don't have dependencies caused by asking for having a lead. Caused by asking for having at least this UL LGBT over two particles at the bottom of each box, yes. So you can do it beforehand, right? You can say each time you have a movement level with the probability given by your bounds on what's the probability that I bound the here, what's the probability that... The bounded here, what's the probability that once the infection is here, and you have that mean particles there, what's the probability that at least one of the ambiguities I get is this bound, this probability. It's a uniform bound. So I can let each time here have this uniform bound. And my benefit of variable samples. And I'll let your process run. If, so you can already count whether your benefit of variables sum to the Sum to the number of particles you want to meet. This is the second you do the event. And then you're going to say, if this sub-box has the right conditions, I can couple. But the probability that they have that condition is very large. This regards the part of this doesn't look great. So, so, like, with high probability, you have to spy on the problem. Yeah, probably that goes to one with actually goes to one exponentially stretched exponential. So, this is whatever the whatever the first half. Yes, just because I just because it's so if I fix these times on the sub box, I can guarantee that with high probability they all have enough particles. They also guarantee, and I don't know how they are distributed here, just so they have too many particles, could now have competence. But as long as there are many particles here, If there are many particles here, after time of L square, I can guarantee that the given position here. It could be that these guys really on the side they are all dead. So meeting before would be unlikely. But I don't want to look at this fine detail, so I just say let's give it a space of L square so that it can actually have a chance to look. Okay, we survived the first scale. So, this is the first scale. The first scale is usually the most dedicated one. But I want to just tune all the definitions so that we get, if you have a good box, you get to do what you want to do. In particular, just for sale check, you have to imagine if all boxes of scale one were good, then I get positive score. And that's the kind of things. And that's the kind of things you want from a scale one box. And if all scale one blocks are good, and you are given this, your blast will be given this, and you get positive speed. So several particles would be this L to the D plus three over two. Several particles would be this, this L to the D minus a half. Okay, so how much time we have? Okay, half like half an hour. Good. So the problem is, obviously, that we do not have good blocks everywhere. So we have to kind of find a way to control bad blocks, and there are also dependencies between blocks. Unfortunately, many of the most scale analysis, the type of mood scale I'm going to present today, do very much the same thing with higher scale box. And it's almost like a recipe. So what they do is not a participatory. This do is now I'm going to isolate the same space-time into bigger boxes. So I'm going to have I'm going to have to define what LK, the size of box of scale k. Remember, it's going to be really similar to this. So there will be a partition of LK over three, and then box, we'll have one box for each partition at the center. And then there is time, time will be escape. And here I'm going to concrete. And here I'm going to deconcrete just for you to have a feeling how we set these things. So LK is going to grow like a constant. K to some large power, and LK minus one. And then Sk is going to be something that kinds of look like linear, but not linear. Linear, but not linear. So it's going to be delta. Delta I already used before just for consistency, but I already need this delta and I'll tell you why. Delta to the k L1. So this is the same L1 C1 L K. Okay, particularly S1 is exactly. In particular, S1 is exactly what we had before. It's delta L1 times L1 and on the scale. So in scale one, they are diffusing, right? In the scale between time and space. But at higher scales, they become more and more similar to linear. If we ignore these, they will be linear. But there's this this guy. And this guy doesn't doesn't make it much. It looks exponentially small if we think that the alpha is small, as we should. As we should. But how big does LK grow? So, LK, if we continue with this, k to the kb, and replace this by the same value, and you continue, you get the k factorial. So, you get something that looks like k factorial to some large power, 10b. Much power than B. Little exponential terms will be a much smaller one. So this is K factorial, so an exponential term in K, okay, it's an important term, but it's not, it makes this bigger than any power of L K, any small power. It's still big. So it's essentially linear from the L. And then I'm going to assume that in higher scales, I perfect pesollate the box. That is, if I play, I will draw here, but this is really this picture will be here for 10 seconds. So if I take my box and say okay. My box at scale k. I find that the scale k minus one box that I completely contained inside is a perfect escalate. Yeah, perfect escalator. So you go from this side all the way there and also all the way here and so on. Just for simplicity. Just can imagine that you could do this. Now I need to define what means for box to be good or not. More than 10 seconds. So now box are defined exactly the same way. We are just changing L1 by LK and so on. So box QK right now, so a given box of scale K, is going to be bad. Okay, it's gonna be bad if companies at least to these joint boxes to disjoint. Put this joint boxes off scale against the scale against the material. So you see this definition almost the segment of the paper that's going to be doing boot scale renormalization. They define higher scale logs in this way. Where two would be 10, could be thousand, could be three. It's always this number, and we're going to take the simplest of them. Sometimes you see that they grow with scales not like they did, but as a power of LPM. But as a power of LPM1, so it goes a little bit faster, so it becomes double the exponential growth instead of factorial. But actually, this lowest you can grow the scale, the better the estimates get. And we're going to see it here why soon. But of course, if you want to grow too slowly, the rice things break down, other things break down. So when it's slow, so we're going to grow the bare. And for us, the subject is enough. But the idea is really to see it everywhere. Is it possible to get to exponential growth only in number? And I think we're going to see this as well. I already tell you why I want the time to go sublime or near linear, let's say. The reason is I want the boss. I want the box, I want to show positive speed. I have my box here, it's high scale, and I want to show positive speed of the infection. So suppose I have the infected part at the center. If it has positive speed, I don't want it to leave the box from the side. Because if I leave the box from the side, remember that I actually have my desolation, I'm only desolating. My desolation, I'm only desolating intervals in time, so I'm not overlapping time. So I wanted really to go to use the whole box all the way to the end of the time of the box, so that I know that I pass through a certain number of smaller scale boxes inside this box. That's the reason. So I make time shorter, less than linear, so that I force it to leave the box one time. Want that so it falls a little bit smaller box so that it goes longer. Why is it useful? Now we're going to be scale one, so I can erase this button. Yes, we're not going to see. Why is this useful? Call it row k, the probability that a given box of scale k is red. So, this is just a probability that this box has at least two disjoint bed boxes of smaller scale. So we can. So we can compute a bound for this. Instead of probability, there exists two blocks inside that are bad. So let's take the union bound on ways to choose two blocks inside. So how many blocks are there inside? Well, we just need to do the fraction. In time, it's going to be sk divided by sk minus one. In space, it's going to be lk divided by lk minus one. I calculate minus one. Okay, box overlap, so maybe I should divide by the side of the centers, and this becomes the d is the number of box of scale given as well inside the box, but I need to pick two. Then I need the probability that these two given boxes are both bad. If box were independent, I will just write here. I will just write here road k minus one square. Since the box are not independent, I don't have an error term to this, but I'm claiming that I can handle dependence. So I claim now that I can write some error term, which I can write the error terms here. The error term is what makes everything work, but actually the thing that is not important to the recursion. The only thing you need to guarantee is that the error term is more than this guy. We're not going to do the error term today, but the only thing we want to guarantee that is is more than twice because then this two just gets absorbed here. Then the stew just gets absorbed and hated, but it's important. Whatever comes out, they say it's in work, but then it gets evil. Minutes to show a small number. I'm thinking of just an analogy with the multi-scaling method complexity. So, in the definition of that, don't you also need some also need some you know extra supervisive and yes i i i will i'll get to that yes i will need i will refine that a little bit yes but before let's see why these two solves all the problems but suppose we have this uh we can control the average We can control the error term. You can even imagine there is no error term, the street doesn't harm anything. This is quite big, right? Sk is huge. It's like the LK. This has LK minus 1. So actually, you get this fraction LK delta p minus 1 to some larger power, maybe T plus 1. And if you just write this to a essentially linear. To a essentially linear, you know, k like this is let me write this easily. So, this has a delta k becomes a delta of k divided by minus one of k minus one to the t. And these all applies. I have this rule. By the way, we define this Lk and Lk minus one. This fraction is just some k to some power. So actually here, again, this is some k to some power, this is some k to some power. You can write all of this as some k. K some large power times two okay but then we can iterate this now we have rho k minus one square you can replace rho k minus one by the same recursion and we're gonna get so that we can get phenomenal p squared. So that we can get free enough of these spirits. We get a k here to the power negative two. Then we have something that's going to be squared and it's going to be k minus one to this large power and two to k minus two square. Essentially, when I get a square inside, I just get two v, I have a lot of two. And you can continue this. Each time this power gets another two. Next time we get two to the third, and so on. So if you continue this recursion, you're going to get a row one, the two, the k minus one. The k minus one for the powers at the sum, and then you get this product of this elderly stuff now. Let's see, we start from actually k or k plus one. I'm not sure it makes a difference. And that's k minus 1, k minus 2. That would be k minus j2 is the j version. What's important here is as j is small, which means the first terms here, you get a large value here, k with a small exponent. As you progress, the okay. As you progress, the okay decrease and the exponents increase. So I believe you agree with me that this will be dominated by the last term, the term that has a largest exponent. But then in the last term, maybe this is the k minus 2. But in the last term, you just get 2 to the k minus 1 here. So we're going to get something of the following type. Type this is just algebra or you're going to get some power, some constant here, some other constant to this is what we solve all these problems. Something that just culminated by the last step, which is just some constant conflict due to the j to k. And this is row one. Now the crucial thing is row one. Roll one is our scale one probability, and that probability is very small. Probably scale one box is small, is bad. This is stretched exponential L1, if you recall. So hypothesis that rho one kills. So it processes that rho one kills the C, because this C doesn't depend on the energy. That's the so this machine is really vastly just puts go through and it outputs the protein as long as you can make diverter terms smaller in this. Okay, so that's the bound you get for a box with a dead that's still okay. A box with that, that's still okay, even if you can control the error. And notice that your bound is this z rho one, the two to the k minus one, and it doesn't depend on anything of the module. It really is this shape of bound just depends on the fact that you are doing two pad boxes definition higher state. If you want to replace two by five, you have two. By five, you have two get replaced by five. But the bound itself doesn't depend even how you grow the scales. As long as you can make the scales grow so that things can be controllable, the bound is the same. So that's why it is lowest to grow your scale, the better it is for the bound. Because K is always K. But if your scale goes lowlier, L K is closer to 2 to the K. Is closer to 2 to the k minus 1. For example, if your scales were to go exponentially, W would be exponential in k. Here we don't get exponential in k, because that's slightly smaller. The larger I make my L K, the worse my bound will be, but the bound will always be the same. It's just that L K is going to be much larger than 2 trials. That's it. So far, so good. Okay, let's see. What else can we do? Ah, look. So now we have this part. This one is doubly exponential. Great part. It's not the only exponential, it's double exponential. So the bigger the scale is, now I can look at the boxes. I can look at the boxes that have its center contain the origin, the origin of space-time. Take the origin of space-time where the game starts, and then look at the scale one box that contains the origin. I can look at the scale two box. I can look at the CO2 box that contains the origin and so on and so forth. Just like what I'm contending, but this is double explanation, it's more than some book. I know that there is a k, a random value for the scale so that above that scale, all the box containing the order that have served at the origin output. That gives me What I need now is to say, okay, but what does a boot box at origin give me? And I explain that does give positive speed. Let's do some rough calculation. I'm not going to erase this because I have to get back to the farthest point. These I think I'm going to erase. So let's look at the abort of scale K same identifier. And suppose, let's suppose by induction, is suppose that if the box of scale k. If the box of scale K, self-renewed, is moved, then the infection moves some amount of time. Infected at the end of the day, I think it's a very important thing. And at the end of the box just as the name of blocks as distance this dec, which for me is going to be the speed of scale k, and I won't show the lenses times. Times Sk. And I want to show that dk is bound away from zero, skull. That's my goal. I'm assuming that this half of our scale k, let's prove that it half of our scale k plus one. And we're going to run into problems. Going to run into problems. So, what happens? Oh, look at scale k plus one. So, sorry, what is dk? Vk is, I'm gonna do, vk is gonna be bound on the speed of the infection. So, assuming that sk is k, I can show that after the unit of time of the box, s k, I find a part that moved, an infection that moves more than dk sk. I can find an infection. Scale. You can find affected buttons that far away from the range. So, Vk will be a bounded speed, and I'm going to relate to Vk with Vk minus 1, and this will relate to V1, and then in V1, we have a boundary. So, that's the business. So, what we get here now that all bots have been used to do that. Assuming now that all bulks are good from scale. So, what do we get here? We get we have to look at how many and take the box that said that the origin, so I know the infection is there, and it's fancy. So, there is an infected part for the origin. And k plus 1 so that I get. k plus one so that i guess the induction so this is k plus one let's assume it's good so as in fact as as the process progress here how many wood boxes well that that is how many bed boxes i can find inside this box In this box, as I go in this unit of paper, suppose all box k were good, then I would say, well, by doing my induction step, I can say the box of scale k minus one, scale k here, at a times k, I will find a diffraction that's further than what is here written here. But that's the next step. Again, if the box is good, we can find an effective pattern that moves even further. Another VK Sk, I just need to count for many timing intervals. I have here of scale K minus one. So this would be SK divided by screen as well. Sk plus one divided by S. Because the SK will just cancel, and I'll get even the same speed. I'll get a retracted pattern that's further than 5 kg escape as well. Obviously, not all boxes are good, some are good decks, but I notice at most two disjoint, there are no two disjoint boxes that are there inside of Screen Clue. Inside of screen theory. So the number of boxes that are bad here has to be a constant number. Box overlap. So if a box is bad, the overlapping box can always be bad, but I cannot find two disjoints. So there is a bound on the number of box I find. So I can do this, but here I cannot do all that, but I may find times in which I pass. But I may define times in which I pass through a bad box. So I need to discount some constant number of times. But then I have to discount what happens in that box. Well, that box would be quite bad. I don't know where the infection goes. And so far, I didn't control it. So I still need to discount here, let's say, moving backwards that could happen in bed box. That's enough of the problem that we didn't control, so that's why we run into issues. So, this is not enough for our definition of bad box. We need to do a little bit more refining, but we need to control how much we can track in bed box. So, we're going to hold a box to be bad if either this happens or in the smallest scales inside. Scales inside this infected part match that the path is gamma that I defined for the infection each box. I don't have it strong here. These paths move too much. So, box edit if it contains or get a s a box q k minus one. K minus one type time. It's containing okay with a pastor how I define how I denoted the past. I'm gonna tell you a name. I mean, the path gamma let's call it x of prime x has to be in the center of the prime which moves. more than more more than badistically that would be more than off more than so badistically here would be so this guy has length sk minus one so more than let's say s k minus one in time s k minus one so so if one of So if one of these paths moves too much, I just take that one's path. Notice that I'm controlling the scale, the smaller scale inside. So for example, if I go back to my picture of scale k plus one, if I know that the box is good at scale k plus one, then I know that it is model scale k inside this infected part who cannot move monobalistically. Otherwise, the paper was one box, it would be bad. So, but one box could be bad. One box here can be bad. This can be bad. But the fact that the big box is good implies that the infection here, if there is an infected particle here, does not move more than one instead. Because the definition for the scales is a smaller scale. For the scales, the smaller scales, and in all sub-meteors. You just want to control that if the peak box is good, these special effective paths cannot do often things in these modern scales as well. And each of these scales may have their own definition of it, but Okay, then I can control this. If I add this, I know that embedded box here is best not to move modibalistically. So the most I can lose here is of course the number of this bed box I can encounter, but then even S k minus one. S k yes, because that is k and then we get so we get And then we get, so we get, so it's convenient to write this in terms of vk plus one sk plus one. So just get vk plus one sk plus one times, if I don't need the time, just do this first. This uh let me explain this first, it's a bit easier. S k plus one minus c. minus c and there is that c s k so that's meant c prime okay now it's convenient like this vk plus one s k plus one because that's the bound we want to get so this becomes vk by vk plus one minus time vk I have to say the value. So dating the C that was missing on the small because the K is going to have this. I don't have to K. Yeah, but you yes, KsK times C, and then I have another CSK. I just it doesn't really matter because it is the SK plus one here. I don't understand how you absorb it in C because decay. C because dec is going to be smaller or potentially small. Yeah, decay is going to be small. You're subtracting not constant decay, but you're subtracting constant. I could put the other one. Yeah. Minus some c s k divided by k plus one. The idea is to make this something bigger than one. So that is all bound by the k plus one s k plus one. I can do this just like the k plus one to be a little bit smaller than the k, but still want it to be. But still, wanting to be in a way that s k goes to infinity, it doesn't go to zero. You know, to the case of the skill. But the important thing is to look at the scale by scale one. So, what's this? Yes, um yes, it's. Yes, it's so sk plus. Let's do s t plus one. S t plus one is equal to we have it there plus one l one l k plus one is equal to equals minus L D minus L K. So this fraction is super small, but there is a L K here, there is an L K there, so S k divided by S k plus one just gonna be not the k L one L K divided by this. LK is applied by this. LK fails so that we get a large power of k. So you only want this to be this large power of k. So what VK equals one to be something like VK. Like Vk times one minus some inverse power of k. No, not like 10d, let's do 2d. So that this fraction gets used something like one plus this, but this is still much bigger than this guy. Much bigger than this guy because the k here has a larger power. So, actually, everything here is bigger than one. And as we expect, this doesn't go to zero. But the one over case it could be a seven. So, that's yes, I'm already over time, but that's the whole thing that I want to say today.
