And thank you very much for the very nice invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. So this exactly. I hope you will answer some of the questions that have been raised earlier. And I will talk about in various states of Gaussian quantum Markov semi-groups. So the outline is to provide some preliminary. Line is to provide some preliminary zen notation. So we ate and so maybe we forgot, but I try to keep them in a compact way and to present them in a slightly different way. Okay. So to give a bit of an understanding of the meaning of the whole process. So for instance, I will often talk about like unbounded operators and things without worrying about domains and subtleties. And subtleties. But everything can be, and like the proofs are all rigorous. Plus, this is also a work in progress. So I really appreciate if you have any comments or remarks. And please feel free to interrupt me at any point of my presentation. So after that, I will provide a characterization of those quantum Gaussian, quantum Markov semigroups, which admit an invariant state, because there are some of them who don't. So for instance, there is like the quantum generalization. There is like the quantum generalization of the Brownian motion, is one of the most prominent examples. And then I will present how the structure of invariant states is and what kind of consequences it has on long-time evolution. Okay, so first of all, bosonic Fox Pay. So we have the one-particle space, which is finite dimension, so it's on finitely many modes. And this is described by D degrees of freedom. Then if we had to Then, if we had to describe an a priori unknown number of particles, what we would do is take this direct sum of tensors of the one particle and the size of the tensor grows with n growing to infinity, following all the natural number. Since it's a bosonic framework, what we have are undistinguishable particles. So, what we need to do is take a closed linear subspace of the pre- Linear subspace of the previous Hilbert space, which is given by symmetric tensor vector. And this is the bosonic Fox space on D modes. So what are the modes? I just recall it because I don't want to take anything for granted, plus it will be important later. So if we fix any orthonormal basis, this corresponds to the possible states for the part. To the possible states for the particle. And this is not a unique choice, of course. And this basically splits the Fox space into the tensor product of the D modes, okay, corresponding to these states. Each one of them is a Hilbert space that is isomorphic to L2 of N. So it's an harmonic oscillator. And basically, it counts how many particles there are in each one. There are in each one of these states. Each one of the modes have their own creation and annihilation operator that increase or decrease the number of particles in that particular mode, plus the position and momentum. So that constitute the coordinates in our non-commutative phase space. So the main characters in the evolution we are going to study. In the evolution we are going to study, are the field operators, which are exactly linear, real linear combinations of position and momentum. And they are indexed by the one particle vector. And they're exactly the coordinates of our phase space. So we can see how to obtain easily. So the vectors of the canonical basis of canonical basis of C D and I times them give position and momentum observable with a minus sign. Plus we have some commutation relations, which are the canonical commutation relation between fields operator. And the only important thing is that the commutator is a multiple of identity containing the imaginary part of the inner product of C D, which is also called this implementation. Which is also called the symplectic work. And these, so since we're interested in field operators, what we are interested in, so the feature we are interested of in C D are its structure as a real vector space, as we were saying. So this is basically the identification I will use along all the talk. So I will identify it with R2D. With R to D, and we have we can transform a complex vector into a real vector with twice the dimension, real part, and imaginary part. And you can see from the expression of the field operators that they are basically the coordinates with respect to position and momentum operators. So the inner product of this real Hilbert space is given by the real part of the complex inner product, and the imaginary part is represented in the real. Represented in the real inner product by this matrix, which has already appeared, which is the symplectic. Okay. As I said, so this is to understand everything, but all the proofs are more conveniently done in terms of the while operators, which are just the group, let's say, unitary groups generated by the field operator. So our bounded operators. And basically, And basically, the canonical commutation relations are encoded by this formula in terms of the value operator. Okay, what are Gaussian states? Again, I will be quick on this. So to each density of a state on this quantum system, we can associate uniquely a function, which is the characteristic function. A function which is the characteristic function, so it's a trace of the density operator against value operator. So, this is a function with complex argument or with argument which is in R2D. And it's basically the characteristic function of each of the field operators. So, a state is called Gaussian if its characteristic function has this form. So, it's the exponential of a polynomial of first order, which contains basically the. Order, which contains basically the averages of the field operators and the covariance term, which is a polynomial of second order. And we have a mean vector and a covariance matrix, which is positive definite. So it says that the field operators in this state have all Gaussian distributions. And as we already observe, the covariance matrix cannot be arbitrary. So it has. cannot be arbitrary. So it has to satisfy this inequality in the complexified space. And this reflects the Eisenberg uncertainty relation. Okay, so Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups. Here I will look at the evolution of Gaussian states are such that if we start with a Gaussian state with mean m and the covariance matrix sigma, the evolution will stay Gaussian and Will be will stay Gaussian and will have mean and covariance evolving according to this differential equation, which are linear. So, this is why at least this is what we expect for the covariance. So, it's kind of bilinear. And this is why these systems are also known as linear system in the physical literature. So, we have, as we said, a drift matrix, then a shift vector, Z, complex Z, and then Complex state, and then a noise or diffusion matrix, which is C. And initial conditions are, of course, given by the initial state. And again, Z and C cannot be arbitrary. So we have this restriction where the transpose is again taken with respect to the real inner product. And this inequality ensures that the covariance matrix stays. The covariance matrix stays a valid covariance matrix of a Gaussian quantum state. Okay, so what I aim to do is to find some conditions on Z, C, N, and Z, well, say it's worse, but like complex Greek Z, in order for the semigroup to have admit at least an invariant state, then to characterize Hussein Distructure invariant states and study long time evolution. Studied long-time evolution. Okay, before passing to that, I want to present like two examples which should be very familiar to everyone here, which kind of represents two extremes. So the first one is the number operator. So we look at the one mode, bosonic Fox space, which again is the harmonic oscillator space. We consider the orthonormal basis and the number operator, which to each EN associates n. Associate n times EN. So the domain is the usual one. It's a self-adjoint operator. Now, we can consider basically the automorphic evolution driven by the Hamiltonian given by n, so literally the harmonic oscillation. And this is a Gaussian semigroup which has metric Z 0 minus 1 1 0. So basically our 1 1 0. So basically, a rotation method. C is equal to 0 and the shift is equal to 0. So the fact that c is equal to 0 indicates that we are looking at an Hamiltonian dynamic reversible one and the shift is just, I chose it this way. So the fact that it's a rotation will be important later. So in this case, we don't have a unique invariant state. We have infinitely many. We have that all the extra. Many, we have that all the external invariant states are the one-dimensional projections on the orthonormal basis. And then we can take every convex combination and limit them. Then we have stable Z, which we've already seen. So we have a Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup with Z, C, and Z, such that the spectrum of Z is contained in those complex numbers with strict. In those complex numbers with strictly negative real power. So the semi-group generated by Z will be strictly contract. And in this case, as we've seen before, these are the solutions of the differential equation I showed before. So this bit, for instance, looking at the mean, this bit will goes to zero and this will converge to something finite. And this will be the asymptotic mean and the same for. Will be the asymptotic mean, and the same for the covariance. So, every Gaussian state will go to a Gaussian state, a quantum Gaussian state with these parameters, and the Gaussian state with this parameter is invariant. Plus, as it was mentioned earlier, it was proved by Franco and Damiano, this convergence holds in trace norm for every initial state. So these kind of semi-groups have a unique invariant state, which is a Gaussian. A unique invariant state, which is a Gaussian. And one example of in this class is the usual Orsenul, the quantum Orsenul, where the Z matrix is a multiple of the identity. Okay, so unique invariant state, it's a Gaussian state. So what about the general case? Well, we'll see that actually these two things put together represent all possible scenarios. Possible scenarios. So, one thing I need to introduce first, and it has already been mentioned, are symplectic transformations. So, symplectic transformations are a group of linear transformations on the one particle space, okay, R2D. But they are peculiar because it exists a non-unique unitary operator on the bosonic pop space such that the automorphism induced by these Induced by these unitary operators is basically applied to field operators, map them to the field operator of the transformation of the argument according to this transformation. And the same for Weil operators. Now, since UM is unitary, we expect it to preserve commutation relations. And as we said, the commutator between field operators. Between field operators are okay. Here I there is the identity which has been avoided, but basically are given by the symplectic form evaluated at the argument of the field operator. So we expect these two things to be equal for every Z and every W. So basically M R DOS transformation needs to be a transformation that preserves the simple active form. This is a necessary condition, but it's also A necessary condition, but it's also sufficient. So, actually, simplective transformations are exactly those transformations that preserve this bilinear form. If we have a Gaussian quantum Markov semi-group with parameters Z, C and Greek Z, we consider any simplectic transformation and then we transform our semi-group in this way. So we apply first First, these automorphisms of the algebra of bounded operators, then we apply our semi-group, and then we apply the inverse automorphism. What we get is that this stays again Gaussian. So it's again a Gaussian Panto-Markov semigroup with different parameters. So Z gets transformed in this way, C gets transformed in this way, where again the transpose is the adjoint with respect to the real inner product on Respect to the real inner product on R2D. And also the shift gets transformed into this. So what we need to do is quotient the Gaussian semi-group. So we consider as the class of a Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup, the set of all Gaussian semi-groups that can be obtained via this transformation from the represent with the unitarizing. With the unit that is induced by all the elements in the simplex. Okay, so we are now ready to present the main result. So the following three things are equivalent. So the first one is that the semi-group admits an invariance. The second characterization is in terms of the Is in terms of the parameters of the semi-group. So there exists a denote which is smaller than d. V was the total number of modes. So basically, there is this a subset of modes with cardinality denote. There exists denote angles, so real numbers, and there exists a semi-group in the equivalence class of the original one, such that Z and C can be. Such that Z and C can be expressed in this form. Okay? So, first of all, the coordinates that we pick are. So, the first one are the coordinates corresponding to the first node modes. So, we have the classical symplectic basis. So, the first denote vectors of the canonical basis and I times them. And then we have all the other modes. So, basically, Z is diagonal in Is diagonal in this splitting of the one-particle space. C is diagonal as well. And basically, the first modes are in the kernel of C. By the way, this doesn't mean that Z and C can be diagonalized simultaneously because the transformation on the two were different. Okay, what does this mean? That basically the evolution of this group of modes. Of this group of modes do not interact at all. Okay, then we can also express the shift in terms of like its decomposition in these two subspace. So Z node tilde here, which is how Z acts on the first denote modes, is given by a rotation again. Well, the generator of a rotation, sorry. So where this phi is Where this phi is the matrix which has on the diagonal the angles I mentioned at the beginning. Plus, the shift, so some of these angles could be zero, and the shift needs to be in the support of Z node tilde. So these should already call for the number operator in the code. And then we have the action of the semi-group on the other modes. So on the other modes, So in the other modes, the spectrum of Z minus tilde is with the real part strictly smaller than zero. So basically, Z tilde minus is stable. Plus, we need to ensure that the uncertainty relations are preserved. So basically, this is the standard requirement. So again, what we notice that the What we note is that the evolution of these two groups of modes are completely independent. They do not interact. On the second group of modes, we have a stable evolution. And on the first group of modes, we have something that really resembles an evolution which is Hamiltonian because we don't have any C, any noise, any diffusion matrix, and it really resembles the evolution driven by a number operator or a multiple operator. Operator or a multiple operator. Plus, this is also related, as I mentioned, to the spectrum of Z. So basically, these two group of modes are connected to the spectrum of Z in this sense, that if we look at the spectral projection of Z corresponding to all those eigenvalues with a strictly negative real part, those are the second group of models. While Z. While Z on the first group of modes only have purely imaginary eigenvalues. Okay, we can translate these in terms of the Hamiltonian and jump operator appearing in the generator 4. So again, the first line is the same. What we have is that the Hamiltonian is given by a sum of two Hamiltonians, which compute. Which commute. Each one acts only on a set of modes. So H node tilde is the one corresponding to the action of the semi-group on the first modes. And it's given by a linear combination of the number of operators of the first modes corresponding to the first modes plus some shifts. And here we have the basically equivalent of the fact that Z node was supported. uh z node was supported in the support of the sorry for uh the clash of word on the support of z node tilde so when this angle which are exactly the angles appearing in in z is zero then we we cannot have any shift and this is everything for for the first modes for the second modes what we have is a an Hamiltonian which is quadratic in creation and annihilation operator with respect to only two Operator with respect to only to the left modes, and then jump operators which are linear. So here they can be completely general, apart from the fact that this same reduced action needs to be stable. So we see that not only the evolution is given by two non-interacting evolution, but the first one is an Hamiltonian closed or automorphic evolution. So it doesn't have any jump operator. So, it doesn't have any jump operator. And the second one is instead dissipative and it's ergodic. So, it converts to a unique state. So, we can easily, once we have that, okay, so these, sorry, were the three equivalent conditions. And now, once we have these, it turns out that the structure of the semigroups with an invariant state is quite nice and seen. So, for instance, And simple. So, for instance, we can characterize a set of invariant states. They are given by product states where the splitting is induced by the two group of modes. So the second factor is unique, and it's the unique Gaussian invariant state to which the evolution on the second group of modes converged. Instead, the first one, so the evolution here is completely Hamiltonian, and it's given by all. Completely Hamiltonian, and it's given by all those density matrices commuting with the Hamiltonian. With this, what I mean is that they commute with all spectral projections of the Hamiltonian. Now, the Hamiltonian is given in this form, okay? So it's not exactly a linear combination of number operators, but that's not a problem because it only requires a further unitary transformation. Okay, so what we've used are unitaries induced by... used are unitaries induced by simple active transformation. We didn't use vial operator, so shift in the phase space. So when phi is different from zero, what we can do, we can write this term corresponding to the j mode in this form as phi j multiplying basically the number operator corresponding to translated modes. So if we move uh to these new modes, which are shift of the old ones. Which are shifts of the old ones, and these amount only to conjugating with respect to a value operator. And this again is an operation that preserves the Gaussianity of the semigroup. What we get are exactly an Hamiltonian, which is now a linear combination of number operators corresponding to different modes. And this Hamiltonian can have a spectrum which is unbounded on, let's say, both. On, let's say, both ways, positive and negative numbers. But it has a spectrum which is completely discrete, and it has like an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. So, in a certain sense, this is why the case of the number operator evolution and the stable one are basically the whole universe that can happen. Okay, once we have these, we can easily. Easily deduce some criteria in terms of like the coefficients appearing in the evolution, so Z, C, and Greek Z, in order to have some nice properties of the evolution. So, for instance, the semi-group has a unique invariant state if and only if Z is state. If Z is state. Because it means that this Hamiltonian part will always have the general many, many invariant states. So this Hamiltonian part should not be there. And the Hamiltonian part corresponds to those eigenvalues of Z, which are purely imaginary. So in this case, we have an if and only if. Plus, we can see that actually if the semi-group has a unique, If the semi-group has a unique invariant state, it cannot be anything else than a Gaussian state. So basically, all the assumptions you made are exactly the minimal ones you can make. So Z-stable is the right assumption for all the questions you studied. Plus, it admits a faithful invariant state if and only if we have. If we have this condition, so basically, this how could we fail to have a faithful invariant state? It's not fault in this case, the fault is not of the part corresponding to the Hamiltonian evolution, because here we've seen that we always have an orthonormal basis of vectors whose corresponding projections are states. So we can always speak Always pick a faithful invariant state on that factor. The fault might be of the Gaussian state. So this state could be unfaithful. So the semigroup admits a faithful invariance if and only if this state is non-degenerate. And this amount in this matrix to be strictly positive. One other condition, so we might be interested in Be interested in irreducibility. And again, if the semigroup has an invariant state, when is it irreducible when it only has a unique invariant state? And again, this happens if this Hamiltonian part is not there and this is faithful. So basically, putting together in a certain sense the two conditions of before. And this can be. Condition of before. And this can be seen to be equivalent to this condition. So there are no non-trivial Z-invariant subspaces in the kernel of what was defined CZ earlier. So all these conditions have very easy, translate in an easy way in terms of the coefficients of the evolution. Okay, the last topic I want, so yeah, I'll probably finish a little bit earlier. So the last topic I want to. So the last topic I want to present is related to what will be presented tomorrow by Veronio. So that's also why I don't want to spoil too much. So if we have an invariant state, at least one, then what one can prove is that, again, here I use the good representative in the class, in the equivalence class of our original quantum. Original quantum Markov Sem group. So the evolution for long times becomes a closed evolution driven by the Hamiltonian acting on the first modes. And this happens starting from any initial bounded operator. So it's this evolution acting on a particular, so the image of the original. image of the original, the initial operator under this mapping, which is the conditional expectation with respect to the Gaussian invariant state. So basically, the previous results told us that the evolution was driven by non-interacting parts. This further result tells us that actually the evolution decoupled in time. And this is what it's known as environment-induced decoherence. So, these I just want to mention a few things. So, there is a lot of results about this topic, which intensively studied by all the people who spoke about Gaussian quantum Markov semi-groups here and other players in general, in full general. In generality, in full generality, not only for Gaussian one-to-markov semi-group. So, the original definition was given by Blanchard and Olchievich, 2003, the mathematical one. Then there are like some general results, but they don't apply to this particular situation. Why? So, the ones I want to mention are one by Rafaela Carbone and Anna Yenkova in 2020. 2020. So, what they assume, well, they were first of all dealing with discrete time evolutions. And what they assume is a fateful invariant state. They claim that the technique can be extended also to general semi-groups in continuous time, but still they cannot get rid of the assumption of a faithful invariant state. And then there is the work that I assume Veronica will present tomorrow, which again assumes for Which again assumes for environment-induced coherence a fateful invariant state and a bounded generator. So, in this case, this holds even if the invariant state is not faithful. Okay, an interesting question. So, we have that the evolution starting from a general operator becomes closer and closer to the evolution of the operation. Of a different initial condition, which is given by this operator which I called x hat. So I think there is here the whole framework for studying the speed of this process. And the hope is that building on your results on the stable part, I mean, in a certain sense, you already understood completely the convergence of the stable part, and I assume that. Stable part, and I assume that that should, in a certain sense, be leveraged to describe what happens here. It might be that the speed is completely governed by the dissipation and the rate is the same, but I still don't know about this. But this should not be too hard to study. Okay, some open problems. Well, as I said, there is the speed of the coefficient. Said is the speed of the coherence, then there are some more general quasi-free semi-groups. So, basically, quasi-free semigroups are those can be described as those that map basically value operator into value operator, where we have a transformation of the argument times a scalar functional of the argument. So, Gaussian quantum Markov. So Gaussian quantum Markov semigroups, in a certain sense, preserve Gaussian states and basically in the factor only contain the mean term and the covariance term. But there are more general quasi-free semigroups, which for instance were treated recently by Barkelli and Werner, where you also, if you think about the characteristic function of Levie processes, you also have jumps. So those kind of semigroups have some Of semi-groups have some jump operators, which are, if I well understood what they are, vile operators. So it would be nice to understand what are the invariant states of those more general semi-groups. And a seminal work regarding this can be found in a paper by Desmond and some other people from Louvain, a very old one from the 79, where they started to Where they started to work about finding some information about the invariant state of these more general semigroups, but they only had some partial results in the completely dissipative ergodic case. And of course, there is the natural extension of all these results to infinitely many modes. Modes and with this, I concluded my talk. Well, thank you very much for the attention. So just to understand, is your question, can we say something about like convergence of initial state to like some limit states and in which Some limit states, and in which norm, and is that correct? Sure, sure. Okay, so yes. In a certain sense, here you might have that some states keep wandering around because you have like this Hamiltonian evolution. Let's see, but well, yeah, I don't have a good so for instance, okay, you can also take trivial initial states where you have like something that is left still by the Hamiltonian part, it's a product, and then you have an arbitrary state on the second factor, and then basically you have convergence in interest norm using the previous result. For general states, For general states, I actually don't know. So the decoherence free, so establishing the decoherence speed in a certain sense tells you how quickly the convergence is in the L2 norm in a certain sense. So because here it was, of course, in the Eisenberg picture, but you can but yeah, I don't know about uh general initials. That that's of course an interesting question. Of course, an interesting question. So, for those who converge, if this convergence is enormous, I would expect, yes, but I don't know.
