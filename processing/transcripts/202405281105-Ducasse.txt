Okay, so first I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation, for the opportunity to talk in this very nice seminar. I'm very sorry that I cannot be there with you. So I would like to tell you about compartmental models. So compartmental models are reaction diffusion systems that appear in epidemiology mostly, in chemical reactions. So Jean-Michel Roghoff already told you a bit about. Jeanichel Rogjov already told you a bit about these models yesterday. So, the most famous is probably the SIR model by Kermack and Mark Hendrik from 1927. So, the equations are here. Originally, it was an ODE system for you have a population. The population is divided into three classes, three compartments. The compartments are susceptible, infected, and recovered. The susceptible are people who have no disease. Are people who have no disease, the infectious, they have the disease and they can transmit it? And so the probability of transmission of the disease is alpha times S times I, so it's proportional to a constant positive constant alpha and to S times I, that is the probability of meeting between a susceptible and infectious. This is a law of mass achievement. Then people who are contaminated, they become infectious. The infectious, they can stop to be infectious with some rate. To be infectious with some rate μ and they become recovered. So, recovered means that you had the disease and you don't have it anymore. Okay, so it's a very well-known model. Jean-Michel already told you about it. So, one way to turn this into a spatial model is to add some space variable x. And the simplest way to do so is to add some diffusion on the infectious. So, you have a La Passion on the infectious. So, this was done by Carlin in 1999. So, this was done by Carlin in 1984. So, for technical reasons, we put diffusion only on the infectious. Maybe if you have questions, I can tell you a bit about why we do that. But for now, in this talk, I will consider diffusions only on the infectious. Okay, and if you do this, you can prove you have this following result called the threshold phenomenon, which tells you that if you define this quantity R0, the basic predictive ratio or basic predictive number to be alpha times S0 divided by. To be alpha times S0 divided by μ. This quantity, if it is lesser than 1, you can prove that the disease does not spread in a sense that I will explain. If it is larger than 1, the disease spreads, there is an epidemic. It's rather easy to explain where it comes from. So probably many of you are already familiar with this, but still I give you the ID because it's very simple. So you can rewrite the model. You can write the model. So you have this term alpha times S minus mu in the equation, the orange term in the equation for I, the equation for I. For i, the equation for i is a linear public equation after all, and so this orange term, if it's positive, it's gross term, if it's negative, it's a decay term. So, if you assume that r0 is larger than one, so this means that alpha times s0 is larger than mu. So, it means that at least for small time, alpha times s minus mu, the term here, the linear term, the parabolic equation, this will be positive at least for small time, okay, because it's positive for time zero, so it will be positive for small time. Be positive for small time, and this means that you have a gross term in the equation. So, if you start with a population of susceptible, which is, say, constantly homogeneous, constant, and the population of infectious individual, which is compatibility supported, which is the natural way to the natural setting to consider in models. Then, the infectious, because the gross term, the orange term is the gross term is positive, the infectious will increase. So, this is what happened: the infectious increase, so you have. The infections increase, so you have a decrease in the susceptible because they are contaminated. So, you have this plateau that appears here at the center. And this plateau will be very small after some time, it will be small, so small so that alpha times s minus mu will become negative. The orange term here in the equation for i will become negative, so this will be a decay term, and so the infections will decay at the center of the plateau here. And so, you have this shape with two bumps that appear, one bump to the left, one. One bump to the left, one bump to the right, and because you have diffusion, the bumps will move. The diffusion on the infectious make the bumps move, and so you will have two travelling bumps, and the susceptible will make a shape like a double front if you want to with a plateau at the center. Everything is computable in this. You can compute the speed of propagation for the bumps, which is the same speed at which the interfaces here move. You can compute the level at which the level reached by the The level reached by the plateau here. Yeah, so everything is computable. Yes. Okay, so it's very easy to do. So I will not give more details about it, but basically the idea is that you can rewrite the whole system as a reaction KPP reaction diffusion equation. So, Jean-Michel already explained it yesterday, so I will not give more details, but okay, you can prove everything. Okay. Okay, so these last years have been interesting in these models, and one question that really interests me is to understand what happens when you have several compartments. That is, when you don't have only one population, but several populations which can interact, which can contaminate each other. So, why is it interesting? So, first, it's natural in epidemiology to consider situations where you have different variants or strain of the disease, but this But this kind of question also appears very naturally in some models in social sciences. So, for instance, there are some models for spread of opinions, evolution of languages, or things like that, which are based on contamination models and which use several types of compartments. So, yeah, this is the main question that interests me here: understanding the dynamic of compartmental models. When you have several compartments, okay, so of course, there are many ways to generalize the SIR model to the case of many compartments. So I would like to present one simple way, say. So the system we consider today is a Hesaya model with several species. So the species are indexed or structured, structured, if you want, with a trait omega. Omega can be one, two, three. Omega, omega can be one, two, three, whatever. And the dynamic is the following. So, as before, you will have two types of individuals. Some are susceptible. I call them susceptible or receiver, and some are infectious or transmitter, if you want. Depends on the model, the context of the modeling, whatever. So, the susceptible can adopt a new trait, and the infectious can transmit a new trait. Okay, so like in the SIR model. So, the trait will. SIMODA. So the trait will be, I will call it little omega. It belongs to the set capital omega that we will choose after. And as before, I will use the same notation. I call S at time T and point omega and straight omega, the number of receivers susceptible with straight omega, and I at time t and omega, the number of transmitters infectious with straight omega. And we call alpha eta omega, which is the it was alpha was the contamination. was alpha was the contamination rate before, and now alpha depends on eta and omega, and it's the rate at which an infectious restraint eta can contaminate and transmit its straight to a susceptible receiver with straight omega. So a priori alpha is not symmetric at all. So in this model, I will assume for simplicity that when there is an interaction between two individuals, the infectious gives all its traits to the susceptible. So there is no mixing, there is So, there is no mixing, there is no food transmission. So, if you write everything as equations, you have the following model. So, this is the SIR model with all these rules in it. So, the susceptible, you can see they can be, so you have the contamination term in the susceptible equation. So, there is no space for now, only time and trade, but I will consider space after. But for now, there is no space X. So, the susceptible. So, the susceptible they evolve with a contamination rate and they can be contaminated. The susceptible can be contaminated by all the infectious, apparently all the infectious, whatever the trait, eta, with some probability alpha. And infectious, the infectious of time with trait omega, they can be created by infectious with trait omega when they meet with susceptible with any other trait. Okay, so this is basically what I said before. So, let me mention that this is different from the model. That this is different from the model by Kendall that John Michelle presented to you yesterday. The model by Kendall is a contamination, is the SR model where you have the contamination is non-local with respect to the is non-local in space, but it's not the same model at all. Okay, so this is the type of model I would like to consider. So first, this model really is a generalization of the SIR models that I just Of the SAR models that I just mentioned, it's very easy to check that if you take omega to be 0, 1, so a set with two elements, if you take alpha to be a Dirac, then you can find back the SIR model. If you take omega to be 0, 1, so you have only two populations, then you find back this model. So it's the generalization of the SIR model. So the first case I consider, so this was something which is now a bit old. Something which is now a bit old. And I already presented this work here in Banter, I think last time, last year. So it was the first work I did on this topic was a work with Samuel Nortman. So I will quickly present it again, but very, very fast. So what we consider with Samuel, so the full model here is very hard. This model, the full model is rather hard to understand, to study. So we consider specific cases. So basically, I studied two specific cases. The first one was Samuel Norman. The first one with Samuel Norman some time ago is the following. We consider a situation when you have your n plus one population, you have a population that I denote empty set, which is a population where the individual have the trait is denoted by empty set, and you have population one, population two, population three, etc. And so on. The idea is that the contamination rate is positive only between populations which have Between populations which have an integer number and the population empty set. So, this model represents a situation where you have a population of people who have no, in epidemiology, this is a situation where you have a population which has no disease here, this one, the empty set, and this population can be contaminated by disease number one, disease number two, this is number three, this is number four, and so on and so on. And so, this is a very simplified model. So, you can be contaminated only by one, and the population. By one, and the population empt here can be contaminated only by one trait, one disease, if you want. Okay, so this model, if you write the model down, so from now on, I will consider model respiratory. So I tell the same equation as CalN, into model by Cal N. So if you write the model I presented before in this setting, you end up with this equation. The population with index empty set, this population here, population. This population here, population with no disease, if you want, can be contaminated by all types of infectious. So you have this equation for the susceptible. You have this equation for each type of infectious. They all can all contaminate the susceptible. And with rates in UK, each infectious in some sense comes down and becomes of type SK, which so in this situation, the SK is kind of a recovery, if you want. They are not very important in the dynamics. They are not very important in the dynamic here. The solid equation is not important. Okay, so this was the model we studied some time ago. So let me show you a simulation because here the interesting things will happen. So the simulation is the following. So we have so in black, sorry, in black, you have the population. You have the population, um, the susceptible of the population with uh who are infected by nothing. So, and in red, green, yellow, and purple, you have the density of infectious with trait one, trait two, trait three, and trait four. And if you let the system run, this is what happens. So, let me play it again. So, you see that you have the infectious with different traits. With different traits, they propagate. So, for instance, here you can see that the red one, so the infectious with straight one are fast, are the faster, they propagate, so they contaminate a portion of the blood susceptible. And after the passage of the red bump, there is a proportion of the blood susceptible which are left alive, left untouched. And then you have the purple infectious, so trait number four, which propagates and they contaminate another proportion. And they contaminate another proportion of the black sceptible, and so on. And so, this is the interesting thing here: that you can see that only the trait 1, 3, and 4 propagate, and the green trait, the traits 2, does not propagate. Okay, and this is what we call propagation, the selection phenomenon. This is what we call the selection phenomenon. Selection phenomenon. So we can prove the following result. If you start with the model with n different traits, and then you can show that there is a subset of these traits that propagate and only a subset. And we can compute which traits propagate and which do not, and we can compute the speed of everything. Maybe I can give you an analysis ID why it happens. When it happens, so that is the following. So you have the number of susceptible who have been affected by nothing at initial time. Then you have the first trait that propagates. So the first trait, assume that you have only two traits, a red and blue one. If the first trait is faster than the second one, then in this case, what happens is that the first trait propagates, contaminates a proportion of the susceptible. Of the susceptible of the susceptible here. And the blue traits, when it tries to propagate, it will have to propagate in a population that influence, which is made of, sorry, the blue trait propagates in a population which is made of only a proportion of the initially present susceptible individuals. Okay, so you can see that the blue trait here, the blue bump, when it propagates in front of it, it only sees this plateau. It only sees this plateau here as star, which is a quantity that we can compute, but it's implicit. And it does not see the whole initial population as zero empty set. Okay, so this is just what I said. Okay, so because of this result, because you have this selection phenomenon, which is rather implicit, because it depends on the traits which propagate. The traits which propagate really depends on the speed of each other traits. So, this makes the dynamic a bit intricate. So, I'm sorry, I'm being a bit fast maybe. So, let me show you just this simulation. So, don't look at the first graph. Maybe look just at the second graph here. So, in this graph, I run the system for several values of S0. So, the S0 with an empty set, so the number of individuals. empty set so the number of individuals initially present in the population who have not who have been infected by nothing at all and i i computed the number of individuals uh who who have been infected by nothing at all so s empty set when t goes to infinity so this is the number of uh if you want the number of individuals who were untouched by any traits after after the after a long time uh so Time. So I have only two traits that propagate traits one and two here. And so, what was a bit surprising in this system is that you have this following graph that appears. The number of untouched individuals. So when S0 is small, this is the identity. So the dialogs are not the same, of course. So for small S0, you have the identity. Thus, the number of surviving individuals are equal to the number of initially present individuals. The number of initially present individuals. And then, when you increase the number of initially present individuals, you have a decay in the population, you have a decay. So, this is classical in epidemiological model, but what is not classical here is that when you increase the number of initially present individuals, then you have an increase in the number of surviving individuals. So, what does it mean? It means that That when you have two trades, two diseases that can propagate in one population, there can be some interferences for some value of the parameters that can, in some sense, save the population. Okay. Okay, so this was what we did with. Okay, so we skip the ectogenous case. So this is what we did with. Case. So, this is what we did with Samuel Norman some time ago. And I would like to present to you very fast a work that we did with Samuel Treton, that we are finishing with Samuel Treton, who is a PhD student in Juan University. So, before the case I considered here in this situation was the case where you have a population, a neutral population, and where you have end traits that can propagate in this. N traits that can propagate in this population. And the individuals can be contaminated by one trait and only one. And so we wanted to consider the with Samuel Treton, we wanted to consider the other situation where you have a population and where you can get contaminated by one trait and then by and then by another trait and then by another trait, etc. So, this is a situation of accumulation, if you want. The idea is the following. You take the set of You take the set of traits to be the integers, and you assume that people with trait K plus one can contaminate the people with trait K. Okay, and that's all. So you have population one, which can be contaminated by the population two, which can be contaminated by population three, and so on, and so on, and so on. So if you put every single equation with the same formalism that I used, so this is always the same system with different rules. Or with different rules, the system becomes this one. So the population K, the susceptible of population K, can get contaminated by the infectious of population K plus 1. And the infectious of population K, they contaminate the susceptible of population K minus 1. So the infectious of each population contaminate the population before. Yeah. And so the question we have with this model was. question we have with this model was um how far can you go so assume that you have the first population here you have a number of susceptible with type one which is given and you want to see uh if you will have susceptible of type two that will appear and then if you have susceptible of type three that will appear and so on and so on okay okay so i hope it's clear it's a very uh it's a bit intricate model but these are the equations These are the equations. Okay, so this is a graph which was done by Samuel to explain it maybe a little better. So you have to start with the population. Three minutes? Sorry? Three minutes? Three minutes. Okay. So very, okay. So basically, the idea is you have a population type zero. Population with type zero can be continued by the infections of type one, which then come down and become. Which then come down and become of type one or specific people of type one, which can get controlated by type two, and so on, and so on. And so, for this type of uh, okay, for this type of equation, you can prove a similar result. You can prove that there is an integer p, which can be an integer or which can be infinity, depending on the parameter of the system, such that only the traits one, two, up to p will propagate. So, this means that, uh, yeah, in this model. Yeah, in this model, you can start with population of type 1, and maybe you will end up with maybe the trait 1 will propagate, maybe the trait 2 will propagate, but it will stop at trait number 5, for instance. Okay, so I will not give the mathematical details. Maybe I can just mention that the idea is basically to introduce another function, which the recovered density for each k you introduce the density r. For each k, you introduce the density Rk. And this function you can prove that it satisfies almost KPP equation, almost an heterogeneous KPP equation. Yeah, I'm running a long time, so maybe I will get it. So now what we are trying to do is to try to understand what happens when you have more complex interactions possible. So when you can have When the iteration graph is a tree, for instance, I'm rather confident that we can basically extend all the results we have and we can prove that there should be a subgraph of all the traits that we persist. Okay, maybe I will stop here and I will thank you for your attention. Any questions? So, hi, Roman. This is Hiroshima. Can you hear me? Hello, yes, I can hear you. Okay, so I don't know if I understood your result well enough, but when K increases, the SK decreases gradually because is it the reason? But is it is it the reason that the transmission stops at certain K or is it because SK decreases as K decreases? What is the reason behind that? Yes, this is in post model. This is the reason why. So the idea basically is, for instance, here. What happens is that when each population, when a trait propagates, so this is the situation, I'm showing you again the situation where you have one neutral population and different traits that can propagate in this population. So the idea is always the same is that each train, each trait propagates, consumes a portion of the population, and then you are left with an And then you are left with a number of susceptible, which is much lesser. And so each remaining traits is trying to propagate in a population where you have less susceptible. But if you see if the population S is low enough, then R0 becomes less than one, so the propagation stops. Exactly. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's the idea. idea totally thank you any other questions any questions from audience online i ask one follow-up question here sure yeah uh kind of building on Hiroshi's question if you tweak the parameters so that some parameters grow as k grows as well they become unbounded you know as k tends to infinity could you get an infinite sequence of propagating solutions yes um Yes, um, yes, so this is we are checking this with Samuel. So, you are talking about this model, the second model. So, yeah, I presented a lot of things. I'm sorry, it was a bit, yeah. So, here it's possible, it's possible that you can have an infinite sequence of all the traits that propagates. Maybe if you take the alpha, if you choose well the alpha k, the mu k, and the dk. The alpha k, the mu k, and the dk. So, because what happens here, you start with a population of susceptible of type one, then a proportion of the susceptible of type one is contaminated by trait two, and so you have a certain population with trait two. And then maybe this population may be less than the population with trait one, because only a portion of the population with straight one is transformed into the population with straight two. So the s1, s2. So the S1, S2, S3 will be decreasing, that's sure, but if you choose well, the alpha K, the mu k, the DK, you can play with the basically the idea is to play with the basic reproduction number. And you can ensure, I'm rather sure, it's not completely proven, but I'm rather sure that it's rather sure that you can have all integers that propagate. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any more questions? May I ask a question? Sure, yeah. So I understood after Hiroshi's question, I understood why certain traits in the first case, why certain traits do not propagate. But in the numerical example you gave, where trait 2 does not propagate, could you exp Could you explain? I mean, is it possible to explain why it is straight two, which does not propagate? Why it is the specific one? In this situation? Yes. Yeah, so here, so what I put it here, so this is a situation where you have the traits empty, so our population who have no trade, population with one trade, population with, sorry, population with trait one, and population with trade two. So trait one and trade two can propagate in the population with no. Population with no wait a moment. You had four traits. The first case you did. This one. This one here that I'm showing on the screen? No, I don't think it was this one. You had trade one, two, three, four. Ah, yes, sorry, this one. This one, yeah. Yeah. This one. I'm puzzled by the fact that it is exactly trait two, which does not propagate. Yes. Propagate, yes, um, yes, this is the interesting thing. Uh, so you can see that you have the trait one which propagates. Why? Because if you look at what happens at initial time, so this is initial time, okay. At initial time, all the traits one, two, three, four, they are compactly supported near zero, okay? And all these traits, you can imagine that all these traits try to propagate in the susceptible, in the black susceptible population here. The black susceptible population here, okay. Um, empty set, S empty set in my notation, whatever. And so they all, uh, the trait one, trait two, trait three, trait four, they all have their own diffusion, they have their own contamination rate, they have their own remission rate. The D alpha mu depends on the trait. And so among these four traits, one is faster to propagate because the speed of propagation depends on Depends on diffusion, contamination, and transmission rate. So, what you can do is you pretend that the traits are alone, and you look at the speed they would have where they alone. And for instance, in this situation, I chose the parameters so that the red trait, the trait one, is faster. So the trait one starts to propagate. And the trait one, each trait when it propagates, it Each trait when it propagates, it forms a bump. So, the bumps, in some sense, looks only at what happens around here. So, if you look at the red bump in front of the red bump, the population of susceptible, the black population, the population of black susceptibles here is only one, and after him, it's equal to 0.6. Then, all the other epidemics, all the other traits, they want to propagate also. But the other traits, the two, three, and four, The two, three, and four, they won't propagate. But what they see in front of them is a population of susceptible, so the black line, which is the population seems to be only equal to 0.7, basically. So all these traits, they will try to propagate in a population of susceptible which is composed of only which is of 0.7, not 0.7, not one, sorry. Okay. Not one, sorry. Okay, 0.7. And so you can show that among all these three populations, maybe one is faster. Okay, so, and so on, and so on. But after some time, you can see that after the yellow one was propagates, so the yellow one propagates, but the population, the black line is very small, so it's not zero. You can prove that it's not zero, but the density of susceptible black here is like very small. Like it's very small. And so the yellow, the green population, population number two, if it tries to propagate, it will have to propagate in population made of, I don't know, like 0.01 maybe, a population made of 0.01 susceptible. But when you look at the formula for the speed of propagation, okay, so it's here. So the speed of propagation depends. Depends on alpha times the number of susceptible available minus mu. Okay, but this will be negative because L0 is very small, is very small for the green population. When the green population tries to propagate, the number of susceptible left alive, if you want, is very small. And so it cannot propagate. This is the idea. I don't know if it's very clear. It's very clear. Thank you. I'm a little bit slow, but now I understood everything. Thank you very much. I presented a lot. Very much. It's fine. I presented a lot of stuff. So, yeah. Okay, very good. Just thank the end.
