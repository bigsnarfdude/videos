Well our workshop, Ren Bo will tell us about some of her work in the miner scale, fluid fluctuations during the brain and additional course making up time. Hi, thank you all for sticking with the program. I'm happy to end this whole workshop. It was really interesting to be here. Awesome location box for people that have selected this. This is absolutely the girl's dream. Absolutely the girl's dream when I was 18 about this is what an intellectual gathering should look like in the mountains. Anyway, I'm here today to talk to you about my project. I'm going to go over the background of what I'm doing at the moment as a postdoc. And so we'll go over a little bit over NMR methods and then go into rapid profiling. And if time allows, I will give you a sneak peek. Allows, I will give you a sneak peek into what I'm doing with snow because I'm a snow scientist, I would say. Some say environmental physicist, some say environmental engineer, but I did my PhD in snow metamorphism, so I looked at how snow, the quality of snow is changing over time. And this project is a Maurice Carie project, so it's together with two experts. Together with two experts, so an expert in Montana State University with Sarah Cott and Joe Seamer, that are expert on magnetic resonance imaging of complex materials. And together with Professor Alex Henson from Norway, we have come up with a nice approach where we combine these experiments with network modeling in the future. And today we talk about the setup of our experiments and how. Of our experiments and how it's gone so far. In principle, I'm looking trying to answer some questions on snow melt and dynamics of water in snow. And this obviously is a very traditional engineering question where large-scale models need consistent laws at the Tarsi scale. And we need like liquid water, how much water can the snow hold and how much energy we have available to melt the snow. energy wave available to melt the snow and what's the interaction between the melt and the positive equations. So basically what snow is, is just a collection of ice grains with water in between and air. So it's a three-phase material and as such we have phase transitions and therefore it is a non-Newtonian problem. However, Problem. However, if we look at the poor scale, the physics that is involved, we have a very classical two-phase flow problem, but including a third condition, which is the phase transition here, up. And this has a coupling between the liquid water and the available energy for melt. And as Alex already has shown you, Already has shown you in the previous talks that upscaling this problem is already problematic if you do not include the snow melt. So, if you include snow melt, it's going to be more difficult. So, predictions are performed for saturation, cluster sizes, and characteristics are very problematic. And yeah, so there is work that is presently done at Antenu, which is very interesting. Is very interesting, and so my goal is basically to see if I can have high-frequency experiments that can guide both ways, right? So, both to the physics of two-base flow, but also give insight into the characteristics of water flow in snow. And traditionally, in snow, we use micro CT as a way of doing our experiments. But if we introduce water, we cannot. Water, we cannot see or distinguish this water from ice basically. And this is why you have to go to other methods. And MRI is preferably a very interesting one to go to. So I'm going to explain basically the very principles of MRI. So if you imagine a liquid with protons and we put a background field on it, a magnetic background field, then all the spins Then all the spins, the quantum mechanical spins, have either a value plus one or minus one, and they will start to align or anti-align with this magnetic field. And this gives us a net magnetization M0 in the vertical plane. And this is slowly spinning. And if but it's since we have as many plus, as many minus at room temperature, this At room temperature, this net magnetization is very small. So, what do we do? Because if we want to measure this magnetic response, we give it a radio frequency pulse into the transverse plane. And this means that all the spins are adding up and the signal becomes much bigger. And this is where I can measure it. So, there's a nice illustration about that. So, imagine this, it's spinning around. Imagine this, it's spinning around, its axis is M0, and you have to give it a pulse with a certain frequency that is resonating with this spinning so that you can tip it nicely into the vertical plane. We've all seen this in our physics classes, right? With the spinning wheel, if we give it the right tip, then it will start spinning in the vertical plane and stay there. So, what do we see if once we do that? See if once we do that in a transverse plane, it starts to relax. This we added energy, so we added energy by this radio frequencies pulse, and now it starts to dissipate, right? It starts to go back to its original position. So we see that the magnitude, the amplitude is slowly decaying. And so we can see here, this is the signal, if we look at the signal. Sorry. If we look at the signal, we would see it's slowly decaying over time. And there are a couple of time scales involved. First is the frequency that we are measuring, which is specific to the proton in liquid water in this case, but you can have also other frequencies with different species too. What is the basics of imaging? So, in principle, we can apply We can apply a gradient on this. When we have tipped it in the transverse plane, we can apply a gradient on it such that each spin at each height is spinning at a different frequency. And this is how we apply, like how we select the signal at a different height. And if we look at the signal, it will show you decay, but if we apply a Apply a 180 degrees, this signal is starting to come back, and we call this an echo. And this is where we acquire our signal. So in K-space. So in principle, this echo, when we get it back, this is a measure of the irreversible processes that I cannot get back. So in principle, this can be case very fast because all this Very fast because all the spins they start to be coherent. They have different velocities, for example, that they have they start to have different angles. And you can see this here. So if we look at the phase angle, you can see that if we have the different velocities here, you start to have faster and slower spinning. And if we have that in one plane, then the net magnetization becomes less. And this is, we can actually reverse. We can actually reverse it in the echo, and we can apply the gradient to minus g, then we can have that velocity contribution reversed. And so, this, the difference between these two points, is actually a measure for our irreversible distances. And this one just wanted to tell you that the absolute value of the signal that we get is related. To the spin density, and an exponent that tells you how that's related to the diffusion processes. And in cases of different velocities in our field, we have effective dispersion. And if we look at the phase angle, so we can measure in two planes, right? So we can actually retrieve the x in the y direction, we can actually retrieve the phase angle, we can get that. Angle, we can get access to the velocities as well. And this is basically the principle of imaging. So if we would look at snow, for example, in 3D, then close to the melting point, we could see that there is the ice we won't see, but the liquid warming we can see, so we see the liquid films in between. But we can also look at velocity, so we look at the phase angle, for example. Look at the phase angle, for example. So, if you take the transverse plane through a porous media where there's a flow on it, we can see the different velocities in there. But we can also apply an echo train, basically what I just explained. We take each echo a different image, and we slowly watch our vacuum signal decay, and that's then the basis of diffusion imaging. So, these three. So these three basic ingredients we have at our availability for complex fluids to measure. And as always, it's measured and it's not at the same time. You always have a trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. And so these images take a couple of hours to make. So if we want to look at snow like fluid dynamics, that's not really good enough. Not really good enough. And for example, I wanted to show you what we're also doing in the lab. This is a TC student and she's really, really good. And she looks at narrow crystalline cellulose. And with different concentrations, I think we've already seen quite some of this complex fluids around. We can see that we have different types. We can see that we have different types of velocity profiles. For example, she was looking at: if you take an eight-hour average for a velocity profile in a quad flow, then you see that it's actually quite linear for low solutions. But if you go higher, then you see something very interesting appearing if you look at the smaller time scale. So if you take eight seconds. So, if you take 8 seconds image, then you see fluctuations. And this is because of the liquid crystals starting to form, where you have tumbling of these particles. And if you would look at longer time scales, it actually looks like it is acting like a new tunnel through it again. And if you go to higher concentrations, then you have definitely a non- Yeah, so I just want to show an example of what we are doing in the lab. I'm not doing these kind of experiments, so don't ask me about it. Ask Erica, ISO as she knows very well. Yeah, so also in snow, actually MRI has been used before, for example, to get the retention curves out. And this is a very static approach, right? Very static approach, right? So we see the pressure head and the saturation, and we wait until we do our measurement until everything is equilibriated. And the problem with this is that these, of course, go into the models that we use at larger scales, but they do not include any types of phase transitions or dynamics of the flow. And this is where we then come in with our With our new experimental approach, we are using nuclear magnetic resonance. Everyone knows what an MRI is. My colleagues have taken out from the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging because one of my colleagues was caught in the plane looking at the purple nuclear magnetic resonance and she was caught into security and the plane was deployed. Into security and things today happens to all of us. I'm just making sure I read a novel about Kostovsky because it's not interesting too. Anyways, so what I'm gonna do is to explore the static regime to no, sorry, to go to the dynamic regime instead, and I'm going to sacrifice my dimensions. So basically, what I do is to Basically, what I do is take one knee profile and by sacrificing the other two, I can go really, really fast into a vertical profile at every 17 microns to adapt to this. I'm sorry, it's wrong. I went to faster even to 70 micro microns, so 70 milliseconds, 17 milliseconds and 70 micron resolution. Resolution. And the basic setup is actually quite simple. So we'll start with an experiment that with a simple experiment where we just have a tank that we drain and we refill. I'm called draining and division. So when it's empty, we know what we're looking at, right? So we really try to use this simple experience as a benchmark. And then later on, we go to And then later on, we go to more complex experiments where we put force media in it, and exactly same experiment. So, what does it look like? This is the intensity data of a very simple experiment. So on the y-axis, we have the height, and the image is the intensity of my signal at each height. And over time, we see that if we start. See that if we start the draining process, the interface, the liquid-liquid-air interface, is slowly going down. And we can clearly see we can very well establish the difference between air and water. But what we also can see is a very thin line here, which is the onset of the flow. And when we look at our phase data in the same image, we see that this very clearly shows up on the phase angle. Shows up in the phase angle. So we see everywhere, and this is very uniform, so if we calculate the difference, this is exactly related to the velocity that we have. And therefore, we know that we establish that we can either measure saturation, but also the velocity. There's one big caveat, however, which is noted here is the phase drift. And this has everything to do with the phase phase. And this has everything to do with how much water I have in my system, right? So the quality, how you call it, of the Q vector of my magnet, depends on how much water I have. So I have to tune and match all the time and have a different saturation. I cannot do that every 20 milliseconds, obviously, because it has to be done by hand. So I just have to deal with space trends. This is just a given. Now, I do the reverse. And I just have the same flow rate, but I imbibe it. So we have a jet flow. And this is the first time I looked at it and I thought, what am I seeing? This is not good. I'm losing all my signal. And why is that? And we found out that if we reduce the flow rate, That if we reduce the flow rate, we get rid of the attenuation. But if we increase the flow rate, then we get more attenuation. So, when we also started looking at our phase angle data, we saw huge fluctuations. So, the conclusion was here is that we have, when we have turbulence in our system, because if we have plug flow from below, we have a a jet stream basically going up, and that does cause vortices. And those causes vortices. This means that if I have velocity fluctuations in my system, I have a time emission. And instead of thinking this is bad, we're going to use it. Because if we look at force media, this is a simple 3mm beatpack training process, we see that we can get a lot of structure in our data. Structure in our data. So we can see we have started, we normalize by T0 our signals. So we have one as an intensity at the beginning, and then we start to have flow. We see our whole sample as attenuation, and then we see those stripes appearing. And this is a log scale, so if we see green, then this is a measure for our porosity, right? And these stripes These stripes were puzzling to us, right? So, what is it that we're measuring? Because we know we have velocity fluctuations because we see attenuation. But, and this is supported by the phase angle data where we see that those dark stripes are exactly correlated with a jump in my phase angle data. So, the first thing is what I did is to try to understand. is to try to understand the average attenuation due to flow. So as we looked at here in the beginning, we saw that we have an intensity drop right when I start to have the flow. And when I looked at it, so the blue curve here is an attenuation as a function of mean velocity, what we see is that we get attenuation straight away, right? At the velocity. Velocity. So, at some point, it becomes more or less linear in the exponent. So, what we can do is to also look at the second echo. So, this means that the velocities are refocused, so I can regain that signal. And it's very well seen by this orange curve. I keep the signal at almost 1%, and at some point, it starts to. And at some point, it starts to decay too. Because at that point here, we start to have that our signal is moving out of frame. So if the velocity times step is larger than our resolution, we lose signal. And this is exactly what happens in our experiment. So the velocity fluctuations are so fast that I lose my signal. I lose my signal. And this is what we're going to use because if that's related to the velocity, we know that the amplitude of the attenuations are related to that. Alright, so we know that before it starts to get out of view, so we try to stay below this for the mean flow at least to below that threshold. That our second echo is not attenuated, so we lose nothing. Attenuated, so we lose no signal due to that, but we know that the attenuation then is related to the effective dispersion. I'm going to speed up a little bit. So just going to show you here two different experiments, drainage and permission. Two different keys are here. So it's the same flow rate is that the interface is much more diffused during drainage and much more sharp during vision. During vision, and that the stripes here are much longer and much darker during high vision. Sorry, due change. Then when we change the grain size, we see that we have, first of all, no grain appearing, so we have more liquid water in the residual sample, which is logical. We have the smaller grain, so it's more to hold more water. To hold more water, but we also see that the interface is much more diffuse for smaller grains, which makes sense too. Alright, so what do I do? I try to have an actual measure for these attenuations, right? So I am taking at each height, I take the average value of my signal, and then I extract the variance of it, and then I in Of it, and then I integrate over the whole sample my variant, and then I get a cumulative variance function. And this can be done for either the intensity, but also for the velocity. If we zoom in, this looks something like this. So if you colour is a function of height, so the largest attenuation is the final accumulated signal. So for all those dark stripes, we see that we have clear peaks. We have clear peaks, and for the velocity data, we have the exact same peaks, but slightly different in quality. Because they do represent different physics, right? So, what did we find if we look at amplitudes and event spacing? So, here I quickly sketched what that means. So, at each peak, I measure the the the time, the duration of this peak. The time, the duration of this peak, and the amplitude, and then I would recover the spacing between it, and also the length of the extent of the attenuation along the vertical profile. So, first of all, the amplitude is very clearly seen, as we already saw visually, that for drainage in orange, we have much larger amplitudes than for impivision. And we also see that for smaller brains, we have For smaller brains, we have smaller attenuations. In addition, so the mean spacing between these events is therefore related to the flow rate. So the more events I have in my system, the smaller the event space is, basically. And what we do see, however, is that the amplitude is in the beginning is dependent on the high velocity if it's low velocities. If it's low velocities, but if it's higher velocities, then they start to sort of balance out. And this is also sort of what I would have expected. The peak duration is hard to get out. This is very challenging because we're right at the limit of our resolution, where we see that, yes, the flow rate has an influence on it, especially for the larger grains. Especially for the larger brains, that's what we see. But if we look at the extent of the attenuation, so the length scale of the system, we clearly see that this does not depend on my flow rate, right? So the fluid that is involved in the event, so for example for the the grain sizes, the largest grain size has an extent of about two to three grains. Two to three grains. And the two millimeter beefx already has an extent of three to four, and then we go to five to six to seven grains as an interaction scale, more or less. And this is independent of flow rate, which is obviously a good interesting part. So that this depends on flow rate. I'm not entirely 100% sure if this is robust because of the Because of the difficulties with the extraction of the matter. Then there was another curious thing. So previously I've looked at the variations in intensity. If I look at the variations in the phase angle, I saw that the amplitude does actually depend on my velocity of the phase angle. And that's surprising, right? Because we just said that it should not be depending on the velocity. Not be depending on the velocity. But if we think about it, that if the amplitude of this is unrelated to the velocity, then we're looking here at the difference. So the amplitude is where it starts from, where it goes to. And the starting point is actually very much dependent on my mean velocity. So remember at the beginning, we have a phase drop due to mean velocity, and this is where you start for all. And this is where you start from. And if you go to something that is independent of flow rate, you'll get something that is actually dependent on flow rate. We saw some differences in glycerol comparison to water. We do need more experiments to get this out. I think this is not very robust yet. Acetone, I have also tried, but this was a very hard experiment to do. So, in conclusion, To do. So, in conclusion, we have looked at variations and velocity fluctuations, and this is highly influencing our signal. We're using this as a measure for flow dynamics. We've extracted these four parameters in our system, and this is interesting because we can use for the phase angle and for the intensity data. We've got some interesting results that the lengths. Results that the length scales are independent of flow rates, and I think there's much more information in it, so there's much more to do in the future. One thing that we're going to look at in the future is the power law of the statistics of these events. First attempt was showing quite similar results as to what Acker found in What Acker found in the pressure variation data. So that's promising, but we are very, very careful at the moment because we notice that we have noise on our data that is correlated. So we have to be very, very careful to know for sure that we can get this exponent out. And that's why it's in the Outlook. Two minutes about snow. So this is obviously where we were going with the project. Going with the project. Snow, so this is a difference. So we look at the variance of our image. So in red is the variance in time, and blue is the variance in space. And we see those, we have a trip flow on two similar pore media, one class B's, one is snow. On the left we have class B's, on the right we have snow. So we see that there is a very, very clear difference in how those pore spaces are being filled up. Poor spaces are being filled up. And this is very important to move forward because those models that I'm going to use should be able to capture this. And that's very hard, and we expect also that this type of dynamics is caused by the pre-wetting of the snow. So if we have liquid water in our system, it means also our grains are at zero temperature, and that means also we have a liquid film everywhere, which is highly connected. Connected, obviously, leading to these types of patterns. This is a rain on snow event, which is actually really one of my favorite pictures, where we can really see that the raindrops are hitting the snow at correlated time. So this one, so droplet comes in, and this one is when it hits the snow. And you can imagine that if we look at this type of data, we can really learn a lot from the mechanics of snow because we can really look. Snow because we can really look at the instabilities and what are changing over time. And I just wanted to show you this picture because I think a lot of you guys are working on petrochemical problems and I wanted to tease you a little bit because snow is such a fascinating material. It has physical elastic, visco plastic, brittle tuck tail behavior. Ducktail behavior enhance powder cloud behavior, right? So, this is a dry avalanche, and this is a wet avalanche. So, it's completely different physics, and all in the same material at the same time, right? And I want to leave you with that. And many thanks to my labs, so Clero Lab, America Present Lab, and For Lab, and I want to acknowledge also that. Want to acknowledge also that money could be funding an incredible way of doing really cool science. So, yeah, snow is really cool. So, if you're thinking of doing something more environmentally, this is really, really urge you to add it. Any questions? Any questions?
