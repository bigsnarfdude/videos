So this is joint work with Juan Pablo Acosta. Can you write the variables? So it's another unit. So this work started off from or is a spin-off from a series of works that I had with Kobe and Yetir. And in the last work we were doing, we had to quote all sorts of results from on On piadic loot groups, and it turned out to be a bit hard to do it because in the literature, I mean, we needed only very, very basic results from, let's say, the first chapter of Woo-Bakis on lead groups in complete fields or something like that. But this is always done for analytic groups, for example, and it's done. And it's done for groups, and we needed it for local groups. And sort of, we managed to circumvent this somehow. But since we were working in this 1H minimal setting, I asked Juan Pablo whether maybe the theory could be developed more smoothly if we just did it directly. And thanks to David's talk, I don't have to introduce the To introduce the framework, but it is a recurring theme in this paper of the three authors on 1H minimality, that this is really a notion developed with the intention of creating a valued field analog of O-minimality. So much of the theory is developed in parallel to what's been done in the context of O-minimality. The context of o-minimality. And the aim was to try and develop an analog of Pele's theorem for definable groups in this setting, and this would save us a lot of problem. And so the aim of the project was to check that in the one H minimal context, nothing surprising happened. And as far as we could check, this is indeed the case. So I will not define 1H minimality beyond. H minimality beyond what David defined because the definition is rather technical. I can give an equivalent definition, a definition that is equivalent to one H minimality, not to zero H minimality or to the higher ranks of H minimality, that does not reveal the analogy with O minimality, but it's the it's more illuminating for what we need here. For what we need here. So, this is a geometric definition. So, definition: valued field. K is, so it's either a definition or a theorem. One inch minimal if If one is geometric, which means that ACL satisfies exchange and it eliminates exist infinity, so it has uniform finiteness. So it's a geometric field in the sense of Khrushchev and theory. And two, it satisfies A value of version of the mean value theorem. So, what it says is that if f is a unary function, Function is a definable function, then there exists a finite set C. So the note C. So, what I'm defining here, so to keep things simple, I'll define it only in the equicharacteristic zero setting. The definition in the mixed characteristic is essentially the same, but requires some technicalities. And I don't want to get into this. Another way of defining the one age minimality, or in general, age minimality in the mixed characteristic situation is just to say. mixed characteristic situation is just say take the canonical 00 course name and if that's h minimal what h minimal than the original structure was so so you just go from the mixed characteristic to the canonical uh zero zero coarsening and if that's h minimal then the original one was so but on on the level of statements you have to be a bit more careful so there is a function Careful. So there is a finite set C defined over the same parameters such that on any ball B disjoint from C. From C F is differentiable, and for all X, Y, and B, we have f of X. So I'll be using, just to keep the analogy with the reals or with the o-minimal setting, I'll be using multiplicative notation for the valuation. I think it's much more revealing than the usual. Revealing than the usual additive notation, so I'll write it as an absolute value. So f of x minus f of y is equal to f prime of x times x minus y. So this is the valuation. These absolute values are the valuation. So just notice, for example, that because the rows of x and y are completely symmetric, what this means is that. What this means is that actually the valuation of the value of the derivative on B is constant. Right? Because this is for all x and y. So I could replace, I could plug in y here instead of x. So this means that the evaluation is constant on this O. Okay, so that's the definition. I think that it gives a very good intuition of what one could expect. So let me. What one could expect. So let me give a list of nice properties of such. So David gave a few examples. So every pure Hanzibian valued field is 1H minimal. So this poses an interesting Pauses an interesting question, in my opinion, because what this means is, especially in view of another things that David mentioned, that you can put any structure whatsoever on RV, is that this does not fall into any reasonable into any nothing classifiable. This cannot fall into any classifying class. Because you can have You can have whatever you want here on the residue field. So, the question is: how do you do? I mean, these are extremely nice fields. So, how do you classify them more theoretically? I mean, where do they fall? You will need some sort of, I don't know, tameness over the residue field, tameness over the R V sort, something. I don't know what is the right notion, but I think that this is a th this is worth investigating. This is worth investigating, I think. This implies David's definition? No, it's the other way. Yes, it does. Yes, it does. Yeah, the definition David gave is implied by this. This is a stronger condition because what David gave was what he called zero H minimality, and one H minimality is a stronger probability. So for every n and for omega, there's a And for omega, there's a different notion of H minality. It has to do with very delicate issues about choices of parameters, and I don't want to get into this today. Okay, so other examples include analytic expansions of the additively closed fields, of T-convex power-bounded expansions of O-minimal fields. Expansions of O-minimal fields, V-minimal fields, so quite a few of the tame-variant fields that model theorists like to work with. So this is a rather wide class of structures. So here is a list of So, here is a list of properties, so some properties of a one-h minimal field. So, one they are Henzelia. Essentially, this is this follows from definable spherical completeness. Well, my intention was to cheat you, and just say that, but David said that in the zero P case, this is not quite the case, but you have something, if you have. But you have something, if you have fast enough decreasing sequences of walls, then they do have non-empty intersection, and that's enough for proving and the reality. So this is one property. So of course we have, because they're geometric, then ACL gives well-behaved dimension. Because these are valued fields, they have a topology, and this topology, and you can really read off the dimension from the topology. So, for example, a definable subset of k to the n has dimension n if and only if it has non-empty interior, and more generally, it has dimension a definable subset of x. A definable subset of x of k to the n has dimension r if and only if you can find a projection onto k to the r such that the image has non-empty interior. So you can, so the topology and the dimension are closely tied together. Another property that is useful is that if you have a definable set, then you can always You can always find on a generic point, and you have a generic point with respect to this dimension, on your definable set. You can always find small enough ball around that point such that it and the projection into a lower-dimensional set such that the projection is a homeomorphism, restricted to this ball. Projections are a subset of coordinates. Yeah, on a subset of coordinates, and the image is an open set. So it's homeomorphic to an open set. So geometrically, this is very nice, very well behaved. A property that we will need quite often is that definable functions, so this for. Definable functions, so this follows from the definition. Definable functions are generically strictly differentiable. And I remind you what strict differentiability is. So F is strictly differentiable differentiable at A, so F is defined on some open set. If there exists a linear function A, so of course. A, so of course, from the same with the right dimensions, such that the limit as x and y tend to a of x, f of x minus y, minus a x minus y is okay. So, this is a slightly stronger definition. Slightly stronger definition than actual differentiability. Right, if I plugged in here A, then this would be just standard differentiability. In the reals, in real analysis, why use two colours to variables x, y and not just z for x minus y in this limit of a z convergence. Well, because then what does Z tend to? You need the X and Y to be close to A. Yeah, X and Y have to be. But then X minus Y, oh, it tends to zero. Yeah. So couldn't we just write Z tends to zero and everything? Well, but then how does it depend on A? But what but maybe just just this is equivalent. For z equals to zero, x minus y is in the outside on the right hand of the image, it's just z. There is no x and y alone. Here, I think that's the crucial point where this appears. Anyway, in real analysis, for a function that is strictly differential, that is strictly different function strictly differential on an open set, namely a On an open set, namely on every point of an open set, even only if it is C1. Do you mean if x is x1, so interaction is a significant thing? No, so yeah, so I wrote something incorrectly. Sorry, yeah, no, of course. Yeah, let's let's make small sets, yes. Careful, clear sets. Sorry, thanks. So anyway, in the reals, this is equivalent on open sets to smooth differentiability. In in our context, we don't know if if it is equivalent. I mean, the the standard proof uses just integration and Just integration and it doesn't transfer automatically. We haven't really looked into it, but it would be nice to know. And another property that we need is that definable functions, and this is also not surprising because we had this Jacobian property, this mean value theorem, this valuative mean value. This valuative mean value theorem, then this is also not very surprising. Then definable functions are well approximated generically well approximated by the app to any degree. So what this means, I don't want to write a technical statement, what this means is that if you have a definable function, you can define a definable set of small dimension such that whenever you take a ball that is disjoint from that set, That is disjoint from that set, your function is differentiable the required number of times for the level of approximation that you want, and then you take the Taylor expansion with the Lagrange residue and its remainder, sorry, and you get this level of approximation. So, this is what it is. And as I said, And as I said, those fields are definably spherically complete for all in mixed characteristics. This is not quite correct, but it is close enough to being correct. But I'll just ignore the difference. So we set up to understand definable groups and we proved the following theorems. So I'll state what is that we prove. Nothing is required. Nothing is surprising. You should not be surprised with anything. So, theorem one, so I put it under quotes because the way I write it is incorrect, but it's close enough to being correct that I'll make the corrections later. So let G be so k throughout is one h minimal. So let G be a definable and So let G be a definable and infinite definable group then G can be endowed with neatly even With a strictly differentiable manifold structure, the final manifold structure. And G is strictly differentiable with respect to this function. And again, the group operation is that what you mean by G? The group operation? The group operation in the case. So it's really a strict strictly differential Lie group. Lie group. So this is really Annan's theorem for in the both in Qp and in the o minimal setting, because this theorem includes both settings. So the first reason we needed this result was we needed the basic Lie correspondence, so we have it. Correspondence, so we have it. So, theorem 2, here I don't need quotes because this is correct. So, let G in K to the N be a definable infinite group H one, H two defined. H2 definable infinite subgroups then one h1 h2 are submanifolds and two um if If the tangent space, if they have the same tangent space, then as subspaces of these are both contained, because they're sub-manifold, then they are both contained in the tangent space of G. So it was sub-manifold. Of G, so it was sub-manifolds. We can, we can this has a meaning, right? Because they're sub-manifolds. Then h1 intersected u is equal to h2 intersected u or some open u containing unique. Is that unique? Is it unique? Here? Yes. Panel groups have connected components? I don't think so, no. And I guess you mean the intersection is not empty, probably? Yeah. Okay. They have the same, this, wait, the right formulation is the. is the the the Lie group determines the germ of the of the uh the the least of algebra sorry determines the the the germ at the identity origination identity is a class there's no component no no there's not there should not be some loops um I should mention so these two theorems are are proved Are proved very much like in the O-minimal setting, but there are some intricate points where this does not work. So, for example, in the O-minimal setting, this is proved using the theorem of Marga, Anand and Kobe on uniqueness of solutions of differential equations. We don't know whether this theorem holds in this setting. I mean, it's a nice question. We haven't really looked at it. The obvious, the proof. Obvious the proof does not translate because it uses definable connectedness in a very significant way at some point, and we don't have anything even resembling definable connectedness in this setting. So we have to go through a different path to prove this. But the proofs are reasonably close to what you would expect. I should just state another theorem that does not appear in. Another theorem that does not appear in this paper. This is something that Juan Pablo proved a bit later. So another theorem 3 if G is a definable local subgroup. Subgroup. So it's not a definable group, it's just a definable local subgroup. Local group, sorry. Then G admits a neighborhood basis at P consisting of the same. Consisting of definable subgroups, of definable groups, or let's say subgroups. So every local group has arbitrarily small definable subgroups. So this is extremely useful in many settings that you don't have to work with, if you want to work locally, then you don't have. Then you don't have to consider local groups. You can always reduce, at the cost of adding parameters, to a smaller set that is actually a subgroup. So, local groups are just... Local groups just means that you have multiplication only in an open set. Multiplication in this. So this theorem, its proof is much harder than the other two theorems, and it uses totally different techniques, and it involves some. And it ha it involves some initial study of definable compactness in this setting. And it's hard. Definable compactness in this setting is non-trivial because, for example, Will Johnson's been recently working very successfully with an analogous statement or an equivalent definition of definable compactness, which is that definable directed families of closed sets. Directed families of closed sets with a finite intersection property have non-empty intersection. This is not true here. This is just not true. The closed balls don't have this property. So you have to work with closed and bounded sets, and this becomes tricky. So this is a different theorem. So, how much time do I have? 12 minutes. Okay, so I'll just say what is the correct statement for theorem one. So the problem is that one-H minimal theories have a notion of cell decompositions, but cells do not project homeomorphically onto, I mean, even they don't project on cells are not bounded by functions. Cells are not bounded by functions but by correspondences. So you don't have enough definable functions. So, one solution to this, I should say, that it follows from what David said, that you can enrich the RV sort as you wish. You can always expand your language so that ACL equals DCL, and then theorem one is true as stated, but in an expanded language. The way to reformulate it is that. That so definition, I've just tried quick definition. A set u in k to the n is an etal domain if there is a definable A definable F from U to K to B R, but is a local homeomorphism. And you should K to be R is for that. K to be R for it. So so it's it's a function with finite fibers, uh such that locally it looks like a homeomorphism. And the only thing I need to make the statement of theorem one correct is that in the definition of a manifold, instead of the atlas using open subsets of k to the n, I have to use etal domains. That's the only difference. That's the only difference. So, once you do that, we call this a weak manifold. So, a weak manifold is an abstract manifold in terms of just the structure on it. It's a manifold, but we don't have a finite atlas for those. And in order to make the atlas finite, we have to pay the cost of passing to etau domains instead of domains. So, all the notions of tangent spaces, the morphisms. Spaces, the morphisms of such things, you don't have to change them because abstractly these are manifolds. You have this finite set of etal domains. Precisely. All right, let's talk. I think we're going to be behind so that you can ask us some questions later. And yeah, we'll move two minutes to the next topic. So So you look at the expansions of the fields for here. So, oh, I didn't have time to say that. All one dimension is good. So
