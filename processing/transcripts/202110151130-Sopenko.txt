I'm going to talk about some work in progress with Anthony Capustin. And the goal is to define some invariants, which are in some sense generalization of barycurvature for quantum mechanical system. And in order to define them, I first have to describe some formalism. That's going to be the first part of half of my talk. It might be a bit abstract, but. It might be a bit abstract, but hopefully in the second part, when I'll discuss application, I'll convince you that it is actually useful and that this invariance appears in a natural way. But first, let me give you a bit of intuition what I really mean by invariance of states. And kind of global goal is to study the topology of the space of states of matter at zero temperature, of course, from a certain class with some restriction on with some locality. With some locality. And what I mean by matter is that we have some like spin system on the lattice in the Euclidean space. You can take a Delana set and spin system, but anything that I'm going to talk about can belong to generalized performance. And since we want to define invariance of phases, we actually have to develop some formula that is true in the thermodynamic limit. So we have to work with this operator algebra. And the class of state that we're going to consider, well, you can roughly think of it as a gap state, but it might be that gap condition is not a very good one. Like the Hamiltonian itself contains a lot of information, and probably there is some other property that is enough for defining invariance for the states. And on these states, we have some sort of natural equivalence. Natural equivalence physics perspective. We can say that two states are equivalent if one can be obtained from another by some evolution by local Hamiltonian. And another thing that we can do is to add to the system some disentangled degrees of freedom, which is also seem natural because we want, for example, well, if we have a state which is just a product state of pure disentangled spins, then we want it to be in a trivial. angle spins then we want it to be in a trivial phase it should not depend whether we have like spin one half or spin three half and so on and in general of course it's very difficult to even define what we mean by by the space maybe there is some class some subclass of gap state that we can hope to solve but at least we can try to define invariance for such families Find invariance for such families. And by that, I mean that we have some map from a finite dimensional manifold of such states to this underlying space. And it might be just a point. So like maps from a point to the space, they kind of feel the connected component of the space. So it's like an invariant of a phase. But it might be also some finite dimensional manifold that kind of fills the holes in this space. And to give it, well, let me give it like an example where I can understand everything. And this example. Understand everything in this example of a zero-dimensional system, we don't have any locality at all. And in the thermodynamic limit, the homotopy type of such states, so every state is just a rank one projector in the Hilbert space, and the homotopy type of such states is just Cp infinity. And the only non-trivial homotopy group of the space is pi two. And the corresponding invariant that fills this. That feels this non-triviality of pi 2 is a famous very curvature. So, if you have some now finite-dimensional family of states, we can always associate some canonical line bundle to it. And on this bundle, we have actually canonical curvature. Well, if this family is smooth, and the class, this line bundle, we call it a baryclass and gives abstraction to the triviality of the family. structure into the triviality of the families. If it's non-trivial, we cannot just contract this family to some fixed state. And kind of the question that we ask is, is there any meaningful generalization of this for many body systems? And I want to emphasize that we consider interacting systems, because of course, if you consider like systems of free firmaments, people use very phase for many applications to define invariance of free systems, because everything effectively reduces to Because everything effectively reduces to a single particle picture, but we want something that is true for any state. And yeah, first, in order now to formalize a problem mathematically, I have to discuss what I mean by local Hamiltonian and what I mean by states that we're going to consider. And let me first discuss Hamiltonians. And the simplest locality that we can think of is just a strict locality that is a Hamiltonian. That is a Hamiltonian, it's just a sum of local terms, and we can associate each term with the side of the lattice and require that this local term, a j, that they're all uniformly bounded and that they're localized on some radius r. And we also consider traceless observable because the constant part, it actually doesn't really play a role because we use the Hamiltonian then to generate. We use this Hamiltonian then to generate some evolution. And an observable this Hamiltonian acts as a derivation. So we take just a commutator with elements of the algebra and constant doesn't play a role by this derivation. And of course, derivation is unbounded, so it's not an element of the algebra. It's just a formal sum in the infinite volume. But there is some domain where this derivation is defined. Where this derivation is defined, and then we can generate this evolution that is defined on the whole quasi-local algebra. But one can easily see that this description is ambiguous. And ambiguity is related to the fact that, for example, we can take some observable A on side zero and add it to H minus one and to H0 on a spin chain, and it's going to be the same Hamiltonian. So there is some kind of gauge freedom in the description. And we can try to fix this ambiguity by This ambiguity by some constraint like fixing the gauge, but we want to define it in some sort of gauge-invariant way. And one way to do this is by introducing a certain chain complex where n-chains are anti-symmetric functions from collection of n plus one sites to observables which are local on each of this each of these sites. So basically, that means that if you take So basically that means that if we take a collection of some n sites and we consider like balls of radius r, then this observable is supported on the intersection of the balls. And if one of the side is far away from the others, then it's going to be just zero. So the thing is kind of localized on each of the side. And the constants, so they're all uniformly bounded and the radius of all these bolts, it is the same like for all. It is the same for all terms. It can be arbitrary, but it's important that it is the same for all terms. So it's like uniformly local. And to give you some intuition about this object, let me give you some examples. So zero chains, which are just maps from side to local observables, we can just use them to define these Hamiltonians in this non-gauge invariant way. Or we can also define global charges in this way. And one chains correspond to currents on the lattice. For example, if you have some electric charge on Hamiltonian, which is invariant on the U1 symmetry, we can define this object JKL using these commutators. And we can consider some sort of divergence of this current, just summation over one of the indices. And it's going to be time derivative of the charge. So physically, it corresponds. Charge. So physically, it corresponds to, well, it measures the charge that flows from side J to side K. And it's kind of a natural expression we can consider for a current. And another example is just an energy current. If we just have a Hamiltonian, we can just take a commutator of these local terms. And again, its divergence corresponds to time derivative of local term, Hamiltonian local term. And as already defined in the previous slide, we can define this map, divergence of the current on any n current just by summation of one of the index for this chain. And it's a map from n plus one chains to n chains. And so all these currents or n chains, they define some chain complex. And the good thing about this chain complex is that actually Complex is that actually the homology is trivial except for degree zero. Moreover, there is some certain map which is called contracting homotopy that basically allows you to construct, well, if you have some closed end chain, so conserved current, it allows you to construct its pre-image under this divergence. So it allows it to represent it as a del of some n plus one chain. And there is just explicit formula for it. And there is just an explicit formula for it. And using this gene complex, well, so it has trivial homology except for degree zero, but we can extend this complex, like augmented by this homology to make it exact. And I claim that this zero homology, which we call dl, it is precisely this uniformly local Hamiltonians that we just Uniform local Hamiltonians that we just considered. So it describes the whole ambiguities that we have in defining it by local terms. And it's just a useful way to think of it like in a gauge-invariant way. Well, again, to give you some intuition about these chains, let me compare it with differential form on a manifold, which we can encounter in field theory and hydrodynamics. And from this perspective, like zero chains. and from this perspective like zero chain it just corresponds to uh top form if you have like d-dimensional space space it's a d form and then they correspond to like density of energy of charges and similarly one chain in this correspondence correspond to d minus one form or currents and our map is just a dram differential but we also have some additional operations on on on Operations on cohomology. So we can ask: is there any analog of that on chains? For example, like integration or product of differential forms. And the answer is for integration, yes. So we can just take some regions in our space and just consider contraction of this chain with this region by just summation of all sites which belong to this region. So divergence is like an example of this kind of operation, where you contract with the whole space. We can track with the whole space. Again, to give you some example, let's consider one-dimensional case. And suppose we just have a current in this, well, in one dimension. And let's consider regions which are like two half-lines, which are complements of each other. And let's consider contraction of this one current with this half-lines. Well, in general, if all regions are infinite, it's not going to be local observable for n-chain. But if you consider like chain but if you consider like uh um d if you consider d chain in d-dimensional space and contract with a certain uh infinite region then it's going to be local like in this example so it's easy to convince yourself if you sum over uh well because of the fact that like g is zero j is zero when two sites are far away from each other this construction is going to be local and physically just measures the charge that flows through point P Through point P. And similarly, we can consider, like in two dimensions, we can consider two currents and contract it with this kind of trisection of the plane. It's still going to be local observable. And it sort of measures some circulation of this two current around this point P. But important thing is that if this current is conserved, then it doesn't really matter how we split the plane into this. Plane into these three regions, this contraction is going to be the same. And we can compute it anywhere in the space. So it's just, again, like if we look at this analogy, D-chain in this language corresponds to just a function. And conservation of this D-chain corresponds to the fact that this function is constant. So the fact that when you compute this current, this trisection or some high-dimensional generalization doesn't depend on it. Generalization doesn't depend on it, it's just the fact that, like, a function, like, value of function is the same in any point if it's constant in any point of the space. Okay, so that's integration. So, now we can ask what about product. Is there any product in our chains? And it turns out that there is no product in the sense of this differential form because of non-commutativity that we have on observables. But what we can define is Observables. But what we can define is a certain degree one bracket that maps n chain or n current and m current to n plus m plus one current. And it defined just by simply taking the commutator of these local terms and then anti-symmetrizing over all indices. The good thing about this bracket is that that satisfies some nice properties, like satisfies a graded version of latinist rule and Jacobi identity. And altogether, And altogether, the whole structure defines what's called Digi Lie algebra on this chain complex of chains. And on the zero homology of this chain complex, on our Hamiltonians, it defines the Lie algebra. So if you have two Hamiltonians, it's meaningful to consider just commutator of these things, though they're unbounded derivation. In general, they do not form Lie algebra. But with this locality, they actually do form Lie algebra. And this graph. Real algebra and this bracket that we just defined induces it and examples of this like operation where it is natural again. We can see it in our previous discussion about currents. So for example, if we have some Hamiltonian and some charge, then we can just take the bracket of this two-zero chains, and it's going to be some one-chain or current. And we can do the same thing with just, well, the product of Hamiltonian with itself. product of Hamiltonian with itself on zero chain this bracket is symmetric and again we get some one current so in this bracket it doesn't have analogy in this differential form so I don't know what is the analog of it so perhaps it's like only defined on the lattice okay but so everything that I have discussed so far was about this local Hamiltonian so this About this local Hamiltonians, this strict locality, but it is too strong to consider such Hamiltonians. It's too strong assumption because even like the upstates of finite range Hamiltonians, they're not connected by evolution by the strictly local Hamiltonian. The best we can do, this quasi-adiabatic evolution by, well, first introduced by Hastings, and now it's like a theorem, at least for like trying to change Yapp Hamiltonians. Hamiltonians, the best we can do is to do this evolution by some decay which is slightly slower than exponential. And we have to somehow work in some framework where we can allow such Hamiltonians, but we still have some structure. And the decay that is sufficient for us and seems to be nice to work with is a decay, super polynomial decay, faster than any. Super polynomial decay faster than any power, and localization can be described in the following way. So, we can say that some observable is, so you can take some function b, and you can say that observable is b localized at some site j if it can be well approximated by some local observable on a ball of radis r up to this arrow, which is like b of r and decays very fast with r. And then, and with this localization, we can similarly define. Localization, we can similarly define chains. So we can just require that these components of n chain that they are almost localized, localized with some, well, there is some fixed function, and every component is localized with respect to this function on every side. And it turns out by this decay is useful that all the structures that I just described, it holds for this almost local uniform. For this, almost local, uniformly almost local chains. So, this complexity is exact. We still have this bracket and we have certain Lie algebra on such Hamiltonians, which turns out now to be complete in certain seminars. So, there is a Fresh Lie algebra structure on this Hamiltonians. And well, it seems like just a technical tool, but it's very important in defining. Important in defining smooth families of states or smooth families of Hamiltonians. Because basically, this thing allows us to work with such concepts. And it's very important in the proof. So I don't know. Perhaps if we try to generate automorphism with respect to this Hamiltonians, perhaps they even form some Fourier League group. But yeah. Um but yeah, we don't have a proof of that okay now let me discuss uh states that we consider um so everything so far was just about observables uh and well if you have some uh pure state it is natural to ask what kind of uh currents what kind of hamiltonians do not excite it so um and by And by that, I mean that just commutator of this derivations or some change with any observable from our algebra, that the average of it in the state is zero. The theorem is that actually if we consider some ground state of get Hamiltonian and we consider chain complex of these derivations and currents. Perturbations and currents which do not excite the state, that this chain complex has the same structure that I discussed just for all currents and Hamiltonians. So that it is exact. And moreover, there is, again, this map that for any conserved n current that doesn't excite the state, produces some n plus one current. And again, we can just explicitly construct. And again, we can just explicitly construct it using the Hamiltonian, but it's not canonical and it doesn't really matter which formula we use for it. The important fact is that this map exists. And it seems to be slightly quicker assumption than requiring that the gap, well, the state is gapped. And what we are going to do in the following is just define the class of. The following is just define the class of states for which this property is true. And we call them pseudogap. Maybe it's not the best name, but at least it doesn't really use a Hamiltonian. So, well, probably it's some property that is like, well, we don't use this information about high-excited states in the Hamiltonians. And probably, maybe this property is sufficient already to define some meaningful problem. And I should say that some similar condition was introduced in the paper by Swan and Martin and others. And if I'm correct, you were calling it non-local charge fluctuation condition. But you were discussing it in the context of U1 charge. But we think it's meaningful to consider it just for. But we think it's meaningful to consider it just for all observables, for the whole algebra. Okay. And let me also discuss a very important subclass in this class of states that we just defined. It is a subclass of invertible states, which is introduced by Kitayev. And by invertible state, I mean that if we have some state on the lattice, then we have some another state on another lattice. We have some another state and another lattice, such that the state in the composite system is in the trivial phase, so that it can be disentangled by some local Hamiltonian evolution. And we can also consider like gene variant version of this. That's what is also known as SPT states. But well, the good thing about this, like invertible states, apart from the fact that they define purely in a manner that doesn't involve hymnal. Like, in a manner that doesn't involve Hamiltonian, is the fact that we can actually try to classify all such states. There is a hope that we can actually define the space of such states. And there is a conjecture by Kitai that they actually form what's called loop spectrum. And perhaps it is possible to actually prove this conjecture in this framework, right? Okay, so now let me finally go to applications. And the first application that I'm going to talk about is Holenburns. So now suppose we have some pure gap state. So we just require from the state that it is pure and satisfy this property. And suppose we have some U1 symmetry. So our charges correspond to some derivation on the state that doesn't excite it. The state that doesn't excite it. And we may consider some univariant part of this chain complex. So it is sort of clear that we can, well, if we have this exact complex which is non-U invariant, we can always average all observables over this charge to produce some new invariant exact chain complex. And now let's see why this formula isn't actually useful for constructing. Why is this formula actually useful for constructing such invariants? Okay, so we have this charge, which is a derivation, and we know that the complex is exact. So it's going to be a del of some zero chain. But I should stress that this zero chain is not like the usual concise representation of the charge, because this one site term, they can excite the state. And this is just some representation. But importantly, every term doesn't excite the state, every Qj. Like every Qj. And what we can do with this zero chain, well, we can take the bracket, natural bracket that we have. And since this Q0 can be chosen to be one invariant, this one bracket produces some current, and this current is exact. Okay, but if it's exact, sorry, it is closed, but since our complex is exact, this term is actually exact. So it's del of some two-chain, which is two-curves. It's del of some two-chain, which is two-current. Okay, now what we can do? We can consider two-dimensional system and contract with this two-current with some tray section on this plane. So I claim that this thing is invariant of the phase, that it doesn't depend on the way how I split my plane into three into three cones, and it is invariant of the phase precise. It is invariant of the phase precisely because of this local computability. Because if I have some local Hamiltonian evolution between two states, I can perform it in one half of the space. And then I have some sort of interpolation between my initial state and the final state. And I can compute this invariant, well, far away from this interface on the one half and on the other half. It is going to be the same. Another half, it is going to be the same because of this like conservation of the average of this current. Well, and yeah, the average of this current is conserved because so del of this current is just average of this commutator. But average of any bracket of like chains which do not excite a state is just zero. So though this current itself is not conserved, like as an operator current, if when I take the average, it's going to If when I take the average, it's going to be conserved. And the claim is that if our state is a gap state of, it is a brown state of gap Hamiltonian, that this invariant coincides with whole conductance. And this definition is sort of similar to definition for free-ferminic system that was done a long time ago by Avren, Saler, and Simon. Avrin, Seller, and Simon. Well, rewritten in a similar language in Getai's Appendix C. And for special class of invertible states, it is actually possible to prove that this invariant is quantized. For fermions, it is an integer, and for bosons, it's even an integer. And the proof is, well, in this framework, was done in paper with Anton, but it used. No paper was entering, but it uses methods from the proof of the quantization of how conducts on a torus by Hastings, Michelakis, and Sven and others. But importantly, I want to stress that the way how we define it is that, well, we actually show that this invariant is locally computable. And from this perspective, it doesn't really matter whether we live on the infinite plane, whether we live on a torus or maybe. Plane, whether we live on a torus or maybe on the surface of genus 2, this is going to be the same invariant. So it doesn't kind of use the global structure of our space. Well, important thing, we don't have like boundary because it's kind of hard to prove something from interacting systems in case we have some, well, gapless Hamiltonian. But from the practical point of view, we just need some large piece of the material, which is like a mixed state, and from that. Which is like a mixed state, and from that, we kind of expect that we can extract this invariant up to some small error. Yeah, and the proof is kind of similar for fermatic systems as for free systems, but for bosons, we actually have to use some additional trick, just I think from a paper by Michael and Santo, that, well, we can define certain vortex excitation in the system and then consider statistics of this vortex. Six of this quarter is it okay but we can actually go further uh so now we constructed this two current we can ask what else we can construct well we can take the bracket of this two current with zero chain and we get some get some uh now it's going to be a three chain which is exact and then it should be del of some four chain uh and we can like continue this process like constructing um some two k Some two k chains like for any for any k and it can be nicely packaged into this single equation so we just introduce some sort of generating function can be recursively defined and the claim is that if you can track this like if our space is even dimensional and we can track this d chain again with this conical intersection and it's going to be invariant of the phase so it automatically gives us invariant Automatically gives us invariance for all even dimensions. For example, in four dimensions, we expect that there should be some invariant related to nonlinear response, just described effectively by some Chun-Semin term. And in this language, well, we get the rigorous definition of this invariant for all event dimensions. We don't know about quantization of that, probably it's possible to. Quantization of that, probably it's possible to prove that for invertible state it is quantized. And yeah, it's an interesting problem. It's just more complicated, probably not that interesting because in the real world, we just well, we only have dimensions one, two, and three. Okay, and in the same way, we can also define invariance for a non-abelian Lie group. If we have some, well, if the corresponding Lie algebra is G, this invariance, they just correspond to some multilinear forms of this Lie algebra. And for example, in two dimensions, we can just consider. So we have some global charge generators of this Lie algebra, and we can just consider, again, current of this zero chain that represent them. And it's going to be some quadratic form. So when we take the average with this trisection, it's going to be just number valid quadratic form. And like every such invariant quadratic form is proportional to killing form. Proportional to killing form, so it's going to be well just some collection of numbers, which again we can think of some characterizing like effective action for such system, which correspond to Chern-Simon's theories for non-abuilding Lie groups. Okay, now let me give you a second application. And second application is going to be like inverse for families. Like inverters for families of states. And I was talking about just invertence of a single state, like the family was just a point. But for finite-dimensional manifold, I actually have to define what I mean by family of states. And what I mean by that is we have some smooth manifold and we have some family of states already. But in addition, I equip it with some Hamiltonian values one form on this manifold. And all this data, it has some compatibility. It has some compatibility condition, which is the following. So, suppose I have like, well, I choose any two points of my family, and I consider any smooth path on my manifold. So the compatibility condition says that if I take this one form and I do this evolution from one point to another, then it doesn't depend on the path. It's going to be the state of this family. Of this family. So, if I apply this evolution to psi lambda one in one point, then I should get psi lambda two in another point by doing evolution along any path. And again, we can show that the complex of this chains on this smooth manifold is exact with respect to this del, but now it's going to be. But now it's going to be, well, it has additional grading, which is this cohomological grading on the manifold. And we're going to work with not only with currents right now, but also with currents which take values in some differential forms on this manifold. Okay, now how we apply this formalism? Well, if you want to construct something for a smooth manifold, for a smooth family of states, we have to use something. And the only thing that we have is And the only thing that we have is this one form value is this Hamiltonian value one form. We can, well, it's sort of a connection because our states correspond to, well, they're parallel with respect to this connection on some trivial bundle. And we can consider the curvature of it. So we can define it in this way. And this curvature is now going to be a two-form, which also takes value. Be a two-form, which also takes valision Hamiltonians. But important fact is that now it's not going to excite the state. It just follows from the fact that from this compatibility condition, this one, four. And what we can do, we can do the same procedure that we did for whole conductance. We can try to build some descendants of this two-form. And all those descendants can be nicely packaged into a single equipment. Nicely packaged into a single equation. It looks very similar, except for like the first term, which is this covariant derivative of the descendants. And now this F bullet, it takes values in, so it is n-chain, but now it takes values in an n plus two differential forms on the family of states. In the case of systems, zero-dimensional systems, when we don't have any locality, Systems when we don't have any locality. This F that I just defined in the first formula, it's a good, it's an element of the algebra, and we can just take the average of it. And it's going to be the barycurvature. But for many body systems, the average of this F doesn't make sense, but what makes sense is a contraction of this descendant with this conical intersection. This conical intersection well in the corresponding dimension. So, the claim is that if you consider the d-dimensional system and we contract this decurrence with this trisection, then it's going to be invariant. So, that it doesn't depend on the trisection, it doesn't depend on the phase. Sorry, it doesn't depend on the state in the same phase. So, we can smoothly deform this family. And this thing is going to be the same. Is going to be the same, and we call it high-bury classes. Uh, it was well, the idea that such classes should exist was introduced by Kitayev and later formulated in terms of Hamiltonian with some reasonable physical assumptions by Anton and Lefspod and Nika. But in this formula, we can like define it just from a state if we use this to the gap condition. And let me give you an example. Let me give you an example. So, for example, in one dimension, this invariant should take values in circular homology. So let me give you an example of some family of states which actually has a non-trivial baryclass. And this sort of a prototypical example similar to spin one-half magnetic field, which has non-trivial, well, which is non-trivial time memory for the Euro. Non-trivial, well, it's a non-trivial family for the usual battery character, and we can describe it in the following way. So, our family is going to be three-dimensional sphere, and we're going to consider just spin chain of spins one half. And on the North pool, the state is going to be just a factorized state where all spins point up. So, equator of this. The equator of this three-dimensional sphere is now going to be some two-dimensional sphere, and on the equator, our state is going to be again a factorized state, so it's just a product state. But now each spin, well, it is, well, it is a product state of some spins, but each spin is going to be a non-trivial family on this S2. And which is it such that even spins have positive. Like even spins have positive Bary number, the usual Bary number for a spin man half, and odd spins have negative Bary number. And we can interpolate between this state at the North Pole and the states on the equator by just acting by an evolution which acts only on pairs of spins. So it's a product of unitaries. Each unitary acts only on spin j, on spin 2j and 2j plus 1. Plus one. And we can do that in two ways. We can do this interpolation, like by acting on 2j and 2j plus 1, but we can also do that by acting only like shifted. Well, so we can consider the splitting of these spins into pairs in a different way. And that's what we do in the southern hemisphere. And in the South Pole, we again have this factorized states where all spin point out. So we sort of do. So, we sort of do the same process, but in two different ways in the northern and southern hemisphere. And I claim that this family is non-trivial. So, one can compute this Berry class and see that, well, in some units, it's plus one or minus one. It depends on the way where you have this plus or minus ones on the equator. On the equator. Okay, now give some remarks. Well, first of all, it is possible to show in this formula that for invertible 1D states, this class is always quantized. So in the same way as barycurvature for like zero-dimensional system quantizes, it is true for invertible states. And there is an underlying geometric reason behind it. In the same way as we have some line bundle for zero-dimensional systems for this one-dimensional system. Dimensional systems for this one-dimensional system, we have what's called line bundle jerp, and it's a certain generalization of line bundle. And connection on this object is now not like one form on patches, it's going to be like a two-form on patches and like one form on the intersections and some gluing function. And so it has the curvature of this object is going to be some three-form and the cohomology class. And the cohomology class of this reform actually corresponds to this bary class. But in contrast to zero dimensional, it seems like there is no canonical curvature on this line bundle jerk. So the only invariant information is the isomorphism class of this line bundle. And in fact, it is believed that homotopy type of such 1D invertible states is what's States is what's called case 3, so it's Ellenberg, third Ellenberg-Maclean space, and the only non-trivial for group Z, and the only non-trivial homotopy group of such space is pi 3. And that suggests that this baryon variant is actually a complete invariant for such states. So that if we have a family which has a trivial bary class, then it should be possible to contract it to a point. Well, in order to actually prove this, we first have to define the topology of the space of states, and that we don't really know how to do yet. And though, like the situation that I just described with this prototypical example, well, it seems like a rather simple family of states, this like one-dimensional state may appear in a rather non-trivial situation where we have some complicated and Some complicated interacting system, and for example, we have some sim well, some symmetry that acts in the bulk of two-dimensional system, and then we can restrict the action of the symmetry to half space. And again, if the status is gapped, then we have this property that we can restrict the action of this group to the boundary between two half spaces. Uh, and uh, also, well, if we act by some element of the group, uh, we get a state which differs from the mobile ground state only on some one-dimensional slice, and that produces effectively one-dimensional family of states. And it may be non-trivial, and it's actually one way of proving quantization for this invariance defined for a non-abelian Lie group. And also, it appears like in physics by the name resonance. By the name resonated with invariance. But in high dimensions, we don't really know how to prove it. So it's probably possible for invertible states. Well, the underlying geometric object is going to be some generalization of unbundled work. So it's a more complicated object. But perhaps, well, we don't really need all that. So it's just a very simple version of this object. So it might be possible to just construct explicitly some cosmetics. Explicitly, some cost cycle that gives this quantization. Okay, so now let me give you some final remarks. First of all, well, so I gave you two applications, like application for the case with symmetry and applications for this high baryclasses. But in some sense, they just have the same origin. They all originate from very curved and zero dimensions. And so everything can be actually packaged into a single equation where if we have sort of generalized curvature here, we introduce some additional parameters of degree two. And we have this the same equation as we have for Berry classes. And now we have, well, this bullet contains all possible terms that we can imagine. So we can recursively define them. And they, in addition to invertions that I described, contain Invariance that I described contain what we call tau list invariance. So the simplest example would be just a tauless par. So if you have some family of one-dimensional systems in the presence of your one charge, it might be non-trivial. And so that if we evolve our system along the loop, we get some charge transport on this line. And it is all, well, all that is contained inside this B. And it seems like. And it seems like all invariants that we can produce from, well, which have this origin in very curvature for any Lie group symmetry, can be obtained in this way. For discrete group G, we don't know how to define this invariance for any gap state. The only thing that we can try to do is define it for some invertible states. It for some invertible states. But in this case, we already have to consider some multiplicative version of this condition because, like, now group X, not so, it's not going to be some exponential of some derivation. It's going to be just some automorphism on the algebra. And we have to require that we act by some automorphism, let's say, on some region. And we should be able to rigorously prove. Able to rigorously prove that this action is the same as action on the boundary. And it's not just a more challenging task, but it should be possible to do so for invertible states. And I guess that was, well, you saw that already in Yasheko's talk. But conceptually, I think all these inverts come some sense from this very current. Okay, that's, I guess, all I wanted to say. Thank you for your attention. Thank you for your attention.
