My idea for this presentation here was to present you ideas, proof techniques that work when you want to bound these families of parameters that are showing up in sparsity, especially. So specifically these hundred chromatic numbers, but I've and then and there we have the product structure at least one. We have the product structure at least in one nice instance. But I also had an idea to show you other proof techniques like cordal partitions, but they were quite covered already, so I will make that part rather quick and just serve you an overview and my thoughts about where are we stuck when it comes to getting the right asymptotic clouds. asymptotic clouds so um so this way it happens that the most of the most of the talk will be based on the one single paper uh that is uh let's go out to it with um i don't have these names quickly here so with stefan tessner with uh felique schroede and uh and michaelemski uh does the work on the central schematic numbers but okay let's let's start let's Let's start it, and I'll try to make it easy for you and for me. So, the centered coloring. So, this is at first a weird graph coloring, which we call the vertices, and the only thing we care is that whenever we have a connected subgraph, then we want to have a unique, a color that appears exactly once the That appears exactly one step, and that's uh then there's this coloring is okay. We call it uh we call it a centered coloring, and the centered chromatic number is the minimum of colors you need to color to show your graph. And this is uh what you can observe first is this coloring is proper, right? Because the edge is a connected subgraph, so you cannot have the same color on both ends. But the thing that most of us know, I guess, is that this peculiar Yes, is that this peculiar graph parameter, the central chromatic number, coincides with tree depth? And the tree depth is just to remind you is another graph parameter that we want to embed as efficiently as we can a graph into the closure of a forest. So we have a graph on the left and we have some rooted forest on the right. This is a single tree here. And then we can find this graph in a closure of this forest. In a closure of this forest, the closure is that you add all the edges between ancestors and descendants in the forest. And then, since we can do it here, this witnesses that the tree depth of this graph is not too big. The number that witnesses is the height of the rooted forest. In this case, the height is five. So, the tree depth of this graph is at most five. And yeah, and the central, and this is really easy to see in both directions that the centric chromatic number points are. Directions that the central chromatic number coincides with the tree depth. So, yeah, what next? So, we have a chromatic number, we have tree depth, and here is one of the ideas, not the only one, how to interpolate between the two parameters. So, now fix your favorite integer p and again consider a graph color, a vertex coloring of a graph, and now And now, when we look at the connected subgraph, we are happy if there is a color that is used exactly once, but we can trade it off if there are lots of colors on the subgraph, more than P. And then we call this coloring P-centered coloring. Yes, so for any connected subgraph of a graph, either we see lots of colors or there is a color used exactly once. And this, and then we do not. And this, uh, and the minimum number of colors you need to column this way. The graph is the p-centric chromatic number of a graph, and yes, and here we have a sequence of parameters. So the one-centered coloring is nothing else but the proper coloring. And the two-centered coincides with something that appeared yesterday with star coloring. And when you push this parameter to infinity, Push this parameter to infinity, you actually get back to the first definition of the centric colouring itself. So, this way we have a sequence of parameters that sits between interplays between chi and to treat it. So, yeah, this family is studied. It happens that it captures these concepts in sparsity. So, just for example, a class of graphs has bounded expansion. Class of graphs has bounded expansion, whatever it is, but it coincides with the fact that there is a universal function such that for every integer and for every graph in the class, the p-centric chromatic number is bounded just in terms of p. So that function of p. Yes, so the bounded expansion is something that we like, we study it a lot. Is something that we like. We study it a lot. It has algorithmic facets, it has combinatorial facets. But it also includes all the nice sparse classes of graphs that we know, like planar graphs. Most of this talk will be just about planar graphs. So we can focus on one thing. And people say that Zenek, he's not here. Zenek asked that That posed the question if the P-centric chromatic number of planar graphs is bounded by a polynomial in P. So I actually never confronted him. But so you see, because planar graphs have bounded expansion, we actually know that these numbers are bounded in P. But the proofs, if you go through general proofs, they give you exponential bounds at best. And before And before the work of Miho and Sebastian, the best known upper bound was single exponential, and it went through the Wickering numbers of linear graphs. So Michael and Sebastian proved a polynomial bound. And this is actually the paper which inspired later on the product structure. And then And then we understood that actually cubic polynomial is a quite standard application of the product structure itself. And this is one thing I want to present you within the next couple of slides. This will be a fairly complete proof. I will even give you an idea how to prove these bounds that I need for the tree rate or simple tree situation, because indeed. Simple tree situation because indeed we have bounds there. So, again, Miha and Sebastian proved that whenever the trivert is at most t or k in this case on my slide, then the p-centrichromatic number of the respective graph is at most p plus k choose k. And the binomial coefficient from Pat's talk is exactly this coefficient here. Yes, you can play with simple g-width. play with the simple g-width and then if it's uh if it's at most k then you then you have one exponent of which is which is useful when we are fighting for the best uh polynomial balance so what we will need here what we will apply here is the simple three uh simple tried three situation so uh if you don't remember what is simple turtles it's just three with three and planar so um So, okay, so that's that's an that's our first goal here to get this nice polynomial bound on the p-centric chromatic number for planar graphs. So yes, that's our hero. So a planar graph is contained in a strong product of a graph of bounded gee width and a path, but we will actually use it here with a Use it here with a stronger conditional true it. So I like to have true it at most free, or as I said, simple through it. And then we take a product with K3 extra. So yes, so now we enter to the proof situation and here's what we would like to see. We would like to see that our parameter behaves nicely with respect to the strong product. This is what you have seen. This is what you have seen in a number of situations here this week. So, for example, during Louis's talk, but actually the very same I approved was with the vertex rankings quite bad. So, this is what we would like to see, that whenever you take a product of two, then it's enough to color the properly on the one coordinate, on the other coordinate, and take the product coloring. So, you would get this inequality, but this is not true. Get this inequality, but this is not true. This is not true, and that's actually not specific only to this application because we've seen that we need to strengthen the idea of, for example, non-repetitive coloring to get this inequality working. So we will make it working. And yes, so what is this bar? We need a slightly stronger notion of coloring here. And let's call it a distance L coloring. It's a distance L coloring. So again, L is a fixed integer and what? And we color the vertices of a graph in such a way that whenever two vertices are in distance at most L, they receive different colors. And the minimum number of colors you need is this parameter here. So a property that I would like to point here is that when you look in the path, In a path in a graph between two vertices of the same color, then you see more than L colors on that path. That's a quick consequence of the definition. And this is the one thing we will use at some point. Okay? So, yes. So this inequality is true now. And when we prove it, we will quickly complete the proof as it follows here on this. As it follows here on this slide. So, by the product structure, we know that the planar graph, the planar graph is contained in something like that. And then we can study this sequence. So, the first inequality is just monotonicity of our parameter. The p-centric chromatic number behaves nicely if we go to the subgraphs or to the supergraphs. And okay, that makes us important. Yes, sometimes. This is important, yes. Sometimes we would like to have it, and this is the place we are stuck. And then we apply a lemma, yes, and we take the product out. And we apply a lemma again, and we take the product out. And then we use some common sense, like I don't know, we are talking about three vertex graphs. So if we put three different colors, any reasonable color definition should be happy. And for a path, so we have a For a path, so we have an arbitrarily long path, and we want to have a distance p coloring. So we hey, we alternate p plus one colors, this will work. Yeah, that's why that's why we have p plus one times three. And then and then here is the moment that we are using because this h is not any h, it has small trivial, or as I said, small simple trivial at most three. So we apply the bound we know. Apply the bound we know, and we finish with a nice cubic bound. So, there are two things that we miss in this to make this proof really complete here in this room. So, one is the lemma, and the second is this bound for this simple truit situation. So let's look at the lemma. Yes, I actually told you the proof strategy, right, a moment ago. What we do is we take a p-centric color. We take a p-centered coloring on the first coordinate, and we take the distance p-coloring on the second coordinate. We will take the product coloring and we claim that it's a p-centered coloring of the product. Okay, so let's prove it. So how do we prove such a statement? Well, we need to check that this coloring is a p-centric coloring. So we need to go over all connected subgraphs. So let's take a G-connected subgraph of the string product. Subgraph of the strong product. Let's look at the first projection and the second projection. From the property of the strong product, they also, and the fact that G is connected, they also must be connected. This comes from the fact that when you have a path in the strong product and you project it on a coordinate, you have a lazy walk. Yeah, so sometimes you can stay in the vertex because the other coordinates moving. It's moving, and uh, but this keeps connectivity, so it's it's it's fun, it's okay. And now, and now let's so, what we took a connected subgroup and we want to show that either we have lots of colors or there is a color used exactly once. So, if there are lots of colors at the first coordinate, then okay, we are done, right? But if not, and the first coordinate is connected, this means that there is a This means that there is a color used exactly once there. And this is what we will stick with. So let's say that it's the vertex V1. It's the color on the first that our graph projected to the first coordinate is the color that happens exactly once. And then fix. P once and then fix a fix a vertex in our original g any vertex that is that is using this v1 at the first coordinates say it's v1w and okay maybe v1w has just a unique color in our subgraph which makes us absolutely happy and if not then there is other vertex of the same color but since at the v1 will have the only color at the first coordinate that other vertex also has need to have v1 at the at the first coordinate have v1 at the at the first coordinate okay so we have v1 w and v1w prime they carry the same color and this is in our connected subgraph g so let's consider a path between them in our graph g and let's project that path on the second coordinate now as i said this is a lazy walk now but but we connect two vertices on the same coordinate with the same color With the same color with a lazy walk, which means that on that path we need to see lots of colors. And this completes the proof because you see lots of colors on the second coordinate. So you have lots of colors. So here you can see at the last step that we actually using a stronger definition of the coloring on the second coordinate. And I wouldn't be able to complete the proof if I had just a piece of coloring there. If you think for a moment, this is. If you think for a moment, this will have a problem. And as I perhaps mentioned, the respective inequality isn't true if we just stick to the p-centric chromatic numbers. Okay, so that was the lemma. And this leaves us with the bounds for the true or simple trouble situation. So graphs of simple troubled at most k admit p-centric color. admit p-centric color rates with roughly p to the k minus one log p colors. Now I keep avoiding the definition of a simple triute but I can tell you that simple triode one is are just paths I guess collection of paths yes linear forest this is simple triute one and then it wouldn't work because there you can use well doesn't make much sense over there even this so but there there you there you need p plus one colors and p plus one colors is enough. One colors and p plus one colors is enough, but starting from simple tree and two, and simple tree two is nothing else but uh outer planar graphs, yeah. And we in this case, we we say that the p log p colors is enough, and actually, the proof of the statement above is an induction on k. And then, really, 90% of the work is to prove the auto-taincraft situation, but But simple tree with one can't you use like two log peak colors that's binary you want to use uh but uh but uh making colour path and like qp with two log p colors right but you want either P colors. But you want either a unique colour or at least p colors. And if you're not even using p colors, you will never have p colors. That's a fair. That's a fair point. Good, good, yes, yes. You just color the middle vertex with single color and then the two middle vertices in there with another colour. Yes, Boyan, but here you are that you have a bound level path. Yeah. And you don't. We want to color any. Should we want to color any path? Oh, just log P here, right? Yeah. If the path is of length P, then yes. Yes. This is actually a bit confusing because for the weak coloring numbers, we have a logarithmic bound, and that's the proof strategy over there. But yes, so these parameters differ at the base, but then they coincide with the asymptotics, as we will see later in this talk. Yes, so. Uh, yes, so uh so p log p uh is enough, and uh and actually this time this bound is tight. I mean we have lower bounds, but let me not discuss lower bounds at the moment because I want to present you idea how to prove this so we can complete the proof of the for the planar graph. That's my kind of motivation here. So, uh, instead of working with alter planar graphs, I could take maximal outer planar graphs, obviously, because our Also, plane across, obviously, because our parameter is monotone. I will talk with you about three of funds because, well, they are outer plane, so I will show you that p.p is enough. But all the proof ideas already happen here, and then this is just like slightly more technical, two more paragraphs. That is not convenient for slides. And what is nice is that they are actually forcing p-look p-color, so the lower bound works for them. Looky colours so the lower bound works for them for the smaller class of graphs. Okay, so tree of funds. So we have a we have a fund that we start with, arbitrarily long, and then from these vertices on the path, you can start another fans, and you continue, and that's your tree. And this is the graph, as deep as you want, as long as the path that you want. Okay, so what do we do there? So here is an easy strategy how to color this graph. So just So just, I mean, for the first root vertex, just put one color and never use it again. But when you have a path there, just take a palette of P plus one colors and use them alternately. One, two, three, P plus one, one, two, three, P plus one. Yes, the strategy that we applied for the path. This is what you do on the first path. Then look at the paths on the second level and take another palette of P plus one colors, disjoint with the first one. Yeah, and apply the same strategy. One, yeah, and apply the same strategy on this collection of buffs and continue, yeah. But now at some point, you can start to reuse pallets, yeah. So you should take p plus one pallets to make it working, and then you can start over again. And this is this is a coloring that uses p plus one squared colors, and it's good. It's a p-centers coloring. Why? Well, if we want to verify this statement, we should think about a connection. The statement: We should think about a connected subgraph of our graph. So, here it is: G, and there are two options: either G hits more than P plus one levels, but then it hits consecutive levels and it gets at least one color from each palette. So it carries at least more than P colors. Good. Or not. And if not, then look. then uh then look at the second thing is that the when you when we have this connected subgraph and we look at the highest fund that it intersects it actually it's it's connected over there actually it's a it's a path yeah so like here like i suggest here in the figure and then again we have two options either you use all the colors of the palette of that palette on that path and you're happy more than p colors or not but if not then then these colors Then these colors that you use there are unique because you are not getting to the next time that you're using the same palette. Piece word, pieceword from above. For a long time we were stuck here. We didn't know even if it's the right answer. But there is a way to. But there is a way to use P-lock P-colors. And here is a sketch. Here's an idea. So, okay, say that you had a palette of P plus one colors and you applied it to your path, the way we apply it alternatingly. But now you go to the next level and you rather would like to avoid taking a completely new palette of colours. You want to reuse something. You want to reuse something what what what can you reuse or what's what is forbidden actually yes is uh is a question I so you we are looking at this fan that is that is growing here this little one and obviously this is this red vertex the color of this red vertex has to be forbidden because if you use it down there you have a monochromatic edge this is not good right so we should forget about So, we should forget about this color, but there is more that we forbid. So, remember that the path up there is colored alternatingly with 1 to p plus 1. So, let's forbid one. Let's forbid p plus 1 to make it clean. And now, now imagine that there is like a binary tree sitting on it. And look at the middle color. Forbid it. Forbid it. Go towards your fun. Look at the middle vertex on that path. Forbid the color. Move on. Forbid the color until you hit your vertex on your fan. That's it. All these colors on the sequence, this is what you forbid. So you're forbidding log P colors here, right? And the others, you're okay to reuse. Okay, to reuse. That's what we so you're taking another palette which can overlap with your palette and you apply a coloring here on the on this on this fan down there. So, okay, so please note that if there is another fan growing from some other vertex on this path, then it might it will use a different palette of colors, right? Yes. And now another thing is that we forbid it, we did forbid the log P colors, but we are forbidding it consistently, p levels down in the subtree. P levels down in the subtree. Yeah, I don't want to see it on this path, but I don't want to see it all over the subtree up to P levels down. And that's already a definition of a coloring. How large set of colors do you need? Well, how many colors are forbidden when you look at the single vertex? Well, P levels up on each level, log P colors. So you forbid P log P colors roughly. So if you So if you have just P more, you're good to color. So this is a coloring. It uses, it uses something like P lock P colors, asymptotically at least. And all we need to argue is that it's P-centric coloring. So, okay. So we have a connected subgraph of our graph. Only two options. Either it hits hits more than p plus one levels but then if it does just look at this path down you see of like p plus one you see vertices of different colors they they cannot reuse the color from above because it's forbidden so uh so it's good if you hit at least p plus one levels you have lots of colors in your subgraph so maybe In your subgraph. So maybe you don't. Maybe you don't. And then look at this highest fund that you hit. It's a path over there. And then either you span over all P plus one colors on that level, and you're absolutely happy because you use lots of colors, or you don't. But if you don't, then you're sitting in. And if you don't, then you're sitting in this interval between one and p plus one. And then, from this kind of property of this binary structure that we devised, take the like the highest in this tree vertex that is hit by the sub buff. So, intuitively, I took the middle here, but this could be somewhere on some side. And this color over there is unique because this vertex appears on the sequence of every vertex on that subpath. Of every vertex on that subpath when we're considering forbidden things down, and that proves that proves that it's a p-centric coloring and that's p log p. Okay, okay, there was some proof in this talk. So, only one. Simple to it. Yes, so now I'm preparing to actually, because what we are To actually, because what we are using in the planar graph situation is not the outer planars, but one level up, not the simple three-way two, but simple three-wheel three. So, I decide to give you this idea of the induction. And this is, as I said, 10% of the work. So, but now I need to tell you what is the simple three word, at least. So, we have a tree decomposition of a graph, and it's case simple if the bugs are. If the bugs are of size at most k plus one, but then whenever you take a subset of k vertices, it appears at most twice in the bags. And then the least k that you have, a k simple three decomposition is simple three width of a graph. It indeed sits between how was it three-width and three-width plus one of a graph. But that's not important. There are two things that usually we need when we do this kind of arguments. So, one is embedded in the other. So, the first one is that when H is a minor of G, then the simple trial of H is also a simple trial of G. And the second is this, which is that, okay, so you have a connected graph, you do the BFS layering, you look at the subgraph induced by a single layer, this simple two-wheat. The simple truit goes down. The true it goes down. We know it. It's a simple observation. You contract the previous layers and you have an apex, right? But the simple true goes down as well. And this you can prove by, and when you have it, we induct on the final statement on the upper bound for the p-centric polarized. So the base case is fine. We just did it. K equals 2. And when K is greater. two and when k is greater than two how do we color think of k equals three this is what we apply for the planar graph so uh fix uh this tree decomposition that witnesses simple tree with k and then we'll need the kind of chordality so we take a super graph so put clicks on each back yeah and from g you go to g plus the this the same tree The same tree decomposition works for the larger graph, and it's as simple as the previous one was simple. So, the simple tree rate of G plus is the same as simple tree rate of G, so K. And our parameter, luckily, is monoton. So, it's enough to bound it for the G plus from above. Okay, so it's time to color something. Fix the PFS layering. Fix a BFS layering, we can color connected components independently in our setup. So look at the connected component, fix a BFS layering. Think about a vertex, say it's in layer, it's in the I layer in VI. How do you color it? Two coordinates. First coordinate is a number of layer modulo P plus one. That's alpha on my slide. Second coordinate, apply a local coloring. Apply a local coloring on the graph induced by this layer. As we said, simple teriod goes down, so we know how to color it. Yeah, in the simple teriot free situation, the layers are autoplanar. Okay, so that's a coloring. It uses the right number of colors because we multiplied by p plus one, the previous number. All we need to prove is that it's All we need to prove is that it's times p centered, and it is. Take a subgraph of our connected subgraph of our graph, G plus. So the subgraph is H. And then we need to use something which is called shadow completeness, right? So, actually, okay. The property that I'm using here, which follows The property that I'm using here, which follows from shadow completeness, is that if H is connected and you look at the first layer that it intersects, it's connected over there. Yeah? It follows from the fact that if you were looking at how this H interacts with Vi minus one, the interface would be a click. Yeah? And then And so, this is what we have. So, from a connected subgraph H, we actually get to the connected subgraph within the one layer, which sounds very useful in our setting. So, how do we finish the proof? Either H hits at least P plus one layers, so it hits P plus one consecutive layers, and then because of the first coordinate, you have more than P colors, you're happy, or not. Or not, and if not, then just look at this first layer that you intersect. It's a connected subgraph over there, and on the second coordinate, you have a p-centered coloring of that subgraph. So there is a color that is unique over there, but since you didn't go to a moment that you could reuse this color later on, it's unique. Okay, and that completes the proof that P7. Completes the proof that the p-centered chromatic numbers of planar graphs is big O P cube log P. Okay. So let me overview what we know about the P-centrichromatic numbers. Actually, so on the left, you have class of graphs. The left, you have a class of graphs, and on the right, you will have bounds on the maximum possible p-centrich chromatic number that you can see there. So, I already mentioned that the upper bound in the 3th at most case situation is p plus k choose k. And we actually prove that it's tight, absolutely tight. So, p plus k each is k, which gives a quadratic lower bound for the planar graphs because. For the planar grass, because two trees are planar. And but this is not the best that we know because I kind of mentioned that these belts for simple turbid that we have are asymptotically tight. I didn't show you the arguments from below. No lower bounds here in this talk. But they are. And then simple 303 is also planar. planar which gives us p squared log p lower bound for the planar graphs and that's that's all what we know about planar graph situation uh in the in the bounded degree case there was an interesting story because uh people didn't know there was even a discussion if uh if in for cubic graphs if the if this parameter cubic cross if the if this parameter could be exponential in P but it's not it's linear it's linear and and we prove it using entropic compression methods so lots of fun and actually actually I actually I think it's a it's a it's a nice it's a good one to read if you want to just see how entropy compression works because it's fit so perfectly over the Yes, so p times delta squared, so dependence on p was critical in this line of thought here. But then when we look at it, we could shape off this exponent from delta. And I'm talking about it because, so it's not delta squared, but delta to the two minus some epsili. And I'm saying that just only because there was another paper. There was another paper after ours by Dubois, Jorin, that are now Martin Gripchuk and Pietro, where they showed actually the same bound from below up to this logarithmic factor in the denominator. Yeah, so surprisingly tight, right? Okay, and your construction then is probabilistic, right? Instruction Venus probabilistic, right? Over there, um, yes, so this is this is what we leave here in this topic. Uh, we really believe that the answer for planar graph should be p squared log p. And this off set one in the exponent, we believe is a factor of the product structure, uh, proof technique, and it shouldn't be there. There is another question about people. There is another question about pivot colorings, but let me skip it because I don't want to. And people are annoyed by this problem anyway, so I don't want to promote it. Yes, so do I have time? I was really slow. Let me share you some thoughts about similar families of parameters that also capture the sparsity concepts. So, weak current numbers, strong current numbers. I also say something. Stronger in this. I'll also say something about the visibility because there was a nice progress. There is a nice progress now these days. So, uh, uh, so these parameters showed up over this workshop already, but uh, okay, I defined them. Uh, so you have, okay, you have a graph, you linearly order the vertices of the graph, and then a vertex V, R strongly reaches U if there is a path like that to U. At most, our edges and all the intermediate vertex. And all the intermediate vertices are to the right, except U, which must be to the left. And then the R weekly, which is U if there is again a path at most R edges. Now intermediate vertices can be anywhere, but U must be left most of everything. And then you can try to minimize what you reach. So respective parameters, say the strong coloring are strong. Say the strong coloring, our strong coloring number is the minimum, so the best ordering that you can get. Take, and in this ordering, you take the worst vertex. So the vertex that reaches maximum number of things. And then this number that it reaches is the strong colouring number. So this displays of the idea, this generalizes the idea of a coloring number of a graph, yeah, that we know, which is degeneracy plus minus one. I never know. I never know which one. Yes, so we have the families, two families of parameters. They can again interpolate between something that we know. So between mentioned coloring number and on the other side. So which one is larger? Strong coloring number. Our strong coloring number is at most our weak coloring number. So the weak coloring number goes to something larger, which is the three depth, and the strong coloring numbers go to the three width. If you let our If you let r to the infinity, it's actually quite easy to prove, it's nice. Uh, why do I mention it? Because we have the same game over there, we know that it's bounded because when the parameters are bounded, we have bounded expansion. But if you ask what is the bound for the planar graphs, let's just focus on planar graphs, it gets interesting. So, for the weak coloring numbers, which are more related to the p-centric chromatic numbers, because To the p-centric chromatic numbers because they go to the same parameter, which is the 3-depth. The bound is cubic, R-cube. You can have a bound using product structure, but then you get an extra log R. And the cubic bound goes through the chordal partitions. Something initially I wanted to show you, but we've seen these ideas. But if you would like to see how chordal partitions work, this is... Partitions work, this is a great example. I think most of us learned it from this paper by Van der Huybo, also the Mendeskiros have been often. Yes, chronic partitions also give linear upper bound for the strong Kuring numbers for planar graphs. And the lower bound, so we have a small note with Gwen about recoloring numbers and how do they behave with the simple qubit. Behave with the simple truck, we get the tight asymptotic bounds, and as a result, we get this lower bound for planar graphs, which is r squared log r. We believe that this is again, we conjecture that this is the right asymptotics. A lower bound for strong coloring numbers in the planar case is actually ah, this is actually a nice, this is a nice thing. Uh, this is a nice thing. I even don't know where I should attribute it to whom, but this is it's witnessed by the grids, right? So, you it's mentioned in the paper, okay, okay. So, it's a it's a it's a nice thing to think about that the grids, uh, the strong calling number of grids behaves linearly with respect to the R in the parameter of the strong calling number, anyway. Uh There is this gap, right? And there is another family of parameters, admissibility numbers. What you are measuring over there, let me get back, step back a bit, is that you are more in the strong setting. So you're looking at the things that you can reach in a strong sense. But now for a vertex V, you are trying to reach things. Trying to reach things with different paths except the source V. So you're wondering how many things you can reach with like a subdivided star that grows from V and it has and on each branch it has at most R edges and it ends on the left to the left of V yeah and this and this is this is this is the the thing the set that V is reaching and you can you can define respective parameters again and Again, and obviously, the RF admissibility number is at most the RF strong colouring number. So they are rather low. They are the lowest of the three here. And then over there, I'm not entirely sure. So there was a workshop earlier this year where people were working about it. And from what I understood, Zdenek Vozhak came already with an example or with an Or with an idea of an example that forces our admissibility number to be r log r from below. It's at most r from above because we have a bound, linear bound for strong curry number. So it's most r from above. And then, so that's the lower bound. I don't know the example, honestly. And now there is a very new. And now there is a very new thing by Nederlov, Pilipchuk and Danzitsky where they prove a matching upper bound. So now I should close with this proof technique. So I showed you product structure and we have lots of ideas similar to that. There is this chordal partition technique, which is super nice, and it gives us the best out in the recurring number situation. And actually, as you heard, David, David believes that. Heard David. David believes that there is something to it, and maybe we can prove things even above for Katie Minor free situation. But there is another idea completely independent of the previous ones. It's the Kissing coins theorem by Keber. So planar graphs can be represented by these circles that are touching. And imagine what if you so think about the strong coloring number. If you take a number if you if you take a ordering that orders the coins from now i should think from the largest or from the largest right from the largest to the the smallest this is a good ordering this is the this uh we sometimes call it call it the volume type argument so we've seen it in the row stock right that all that project was based on that i on on on this idea specifically and uh but there for strong coloning numbers you can prove uh quadratic upper Prove a quadratic upper bound. So we know it's linear, but this way you can prove it that it's quadratic. I'm actually not sure if there is an example that it's not better than quadratic. I wouldn't be surprised. So, okay, so these guys, they actually took this ordering given by the coins and they proved that the boundaries are log R from above. Okay, so that's it. Three aspects: yeah, product structure, color partitions, and kissing coins. Maybe we can mix them one day all together. Thank you.
