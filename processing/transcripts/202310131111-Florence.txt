Pleasure to be here again with all of you. Since I'm the last speaker, I never know whether organizers should be thanked before or after, but that's always the same problem. Is it before or after? So I think the audience is maximum now. People will leave because they have the training to take and my talk is bad. So I would like to let me thank all the organizers for this wonderful conference. Okay, so to begin with, I have put some references to text, which so on my web page it's not at all updated. I apologize for that, but it will be updated soon. So perhaps I will begin with a short introduction. So there are five people involved: Andrea Contis, Felix DeMarche, Charles de Clay, Charles de Claire, Mathieu Florence, and Jean-Carlot Luquin Artouce. And since I actually don't care about names, I can cite myself with absolutely no problem at all. And so the five texts are here. So the first text is actually we finished it yesterday with Giancarlo and Charles. So it's about lifting bit vector bundles. So there are some geometric ingredients for tackling. For tackling the problems of lifting Galois representation. But it's not about Galois representation, it's just about geometry of each vector bundle. But the purpose is actually to be applied in the next papers, right? And then there are three papers, smooth profinite groups, one, two, three. One and three is a collaboration with Shaw and the two is also part of the story, but I'm doing it myself, and there's still a mislead to be clear. There's still a mistake to be corrected. So, actually, everything is about correcting this mistake. So, since I'm the only guy involved, if it fails, I will be the only one bearing burdens. So, no one else will be harmed. We are sure. But then, seriously, so I think I now have corrected the mistake, that it has been a long piece of work. And I hope that in the upcoming two months we can put some version. Some version, but I will wait until there is something really readable. And by the way, so I will now make clear what the story is. But so in this paper, there is a statement about lifting flags of Galois representation. And if it indeed holds, everything is hold, as all other papers are correct. And so the last one is with Andrea Conti and Cylinde de Marche in that actually we investigate lifting of their representation for local Lifting of their representation for local fields and everything can be computed explicitly. So, this text will be available very soon, and it actually gives a positive answer to the general statement, an even much stronger statement in the particular case of local fields. So, I will now say what the story is about. So, P is a prime number. Number. So, what we would like to do, as was also done by Marco Yair and Mascaria in their talk, is kind of consider multi-peach homology, Galois homology, but without referring to the field. So, we just want to extract information that is needed in order to obtain Galois theoretic results. So, the idea is to remove the field and keep only uh some data which is relevant for Galois comology. Relevant for galva chomology, for instance, for block cattle. So I will work essentially with the p square. So Merco Yef and Mascalvia, they use the Zp coefficient, meaning Z mod P R for all R. So in my impression that for most results, Z mod P square coefficients are sufficient. So let me just recall a basic result about the invertible group Z mod P cross. Z mod P cross, Z mod P square cross is canonically isomorphic to F P cross times Z mod P. So I will use this without further reference, but I just said it because if you don't know, it might be surprising. So actually, this thing here is the group of P minus one roots of unity inside Z mod P square. It's canonically this thing. And this inside this group, Inside this group, it is just one plus PZ mod P square Z. So I will constantly use this identification. So sometimes I take some Z mod P torso, but in fact I view it as a Z mod P square cross torso and I use it to to twist uh Z mod P square. So with this uh situation, if I have a character carried uh from some groups, uh From some group, so G will always be a profinite group, satisfying some extra assumptions. So if we are given some character with value in Zp cross, often it will be sufficient to specify the value on this factor because this kind of generates a prime TP degree field extension and can be can be dismissed. So if there is such a character, So if there is such a character, I will use notation Z mod P square chi to denote the group Z mod P square twisted by this character. So actually this is a G module. The G module which as an abelian group is just Z mod P square and action is given by cap. So j just spend some time to make this clear because I Just spend some time to make this clear because there will be plenty of such notation. And so now comes the definition of what, let's say, 4 mile to the power of 90 is to keep Herculev's notation. So let me take some character chi, like this. Chi is as a ball. So the pair G So the pair G and Z mod P square of chi satisfies formal Hilbert 90, at minibald F H 90, formal Hilbert 90. And in our terminology we say that it is a 1,1 cyclotomic, so it's a bit unfortunate but it's not a problem. It's clear what it means. So if you see one It means. So if you see one, one cyclotomic, it means exactly the same thing. If the following holds, so for every open subgroup H inside G, so all subgroup consider will be open. So here it can be closed, it makes no difference by definition. The following map is subjective, so consider chromology, so just usual group chromology. So, just usual group homology with values in Z mod P square of chi, then reduce mod P, the coefficient, so we get Z mod P of chi and this map should be on. That's the definition of the So in a Merco talk, it's exactly the same actually if but instead considering coefficient Zp, the full periodic integers. And actually surjectivity for periodic integers is equivalent to H1 QP mod Zp of 1 being divisible. It's the same statement. It's an exercise in group column. So I kind of stick to this statement because I like to This statement because I like to leave stuff that's a personal taste, but if people do want to do it by dividing into some amount, this is fine too, of course. Okay, so this is the definition. So often this Z mod P of chi may be assumed to be trivial because so perhaps not so clear, but the component of the character i with this uh direct factor can be ignored. The argument factor can be ignored because this is a group of order p minus 1. So it's by a restriction correctional argument in practically all statements, this reduction can be assumed to be trivial. This actually is true in this setting of formal report 90. If we can prove things assuming that the p-reduction of the symptotomic character is free, which is not at all the case in general, it's much less of. General, it's much less obvious, but for using this point of view, it's the case. So often I will assume that this relation is a trivial. So now what we will be interested in is mainly complete flags. So perhaps I should give some some ex examples. So of course as a Mercury F and the Scaviato so From the scaly at all. So basic example is G is the absolute Bayer group of L field. And here take the module of P square root of unity if characteristic is not P. Otherwise, take Z mod P square, characteristic P. So in this situation, let me just mention that if the field has characteristic P, it's much easier. A coefficient. Much easier. A coefficient of the trivial action and the homological dimension is one at p, it's way simpler. So the interesting part is really when characteristic is not p. And then there are some other examples. For instance, you may take the pi1 of some curve over an algebraically closed field. And what is really nice is that there is absolutely no assumption. Nice that there is absolutely no assumption media on the curve. It may be affine, not affine. It can be smooth, not smooth. It works for singular curves also. So this is the basic geometric example. For higher dimensional varieties, it doesn't work at all, but for curves due to some fact that the degree has value in Z and some other property, it's at It satisfies this property. Is there a reason why you develop a star? Which star? When you twist by chi? Because this just means it's an abelian group Z mod P square on which G acts via chi. So this is actually equal to This is actually equal to Z mod P square. It's a group, a free Z mod P square module. So it's a G module. So it's an abelian group with an action of G. So as an abelian group, it's Z mod P square. And the action is provided by chi. Chi has to learn or the multiplicative. It's G L one of a G L one of a So this is stronger than the individual of the kind uh well Uh well, i in the usual hypothetic chi is the cyclotomic uh character mod p squared. But here it m it may be any any character that providing it satisfies this property. So we can modify it to ensure that the mod p reduction is trivial, which not the case for which you need. So, of course, this is weaker than the definition used in a micro Ex talk, but I'm gonna use only talk but I'm gonna use only this definition. So now there are statements. So actually the goal of this first paper is to convert this information into some more geometric information using Z vectors. So let me just say that there is this gadget, I just use W2. So W2 it's a ring scheme of a Z so it's Ring scheme of a Z, so it's a fun space of dimension two with a very famous ring structure. That's the ring scheme. And let me just say that if we apply this ring law to Fp, we get Z1P squared. So it's a kind of very much non-linear functor that takes rings into rings. And if you apply it to FP, we get Z1P squared. And if you apply it to some ring where P is in. To some ring where P is invertible Q, W two of Q is Q times Q. It's just a basis kind of interpolates between some important thing and just a direct product of two copies. So it's very useful stuff. So let me now state the result we prove. So this is proved. It's checked. I don't mind correct in the first paper. So there is a definition which Which we say it's a 1,1 smoothness, and smoothness is a bit like cyclotomic or formatic ornamentality, but coefficients are removed. It depends just on the group G, not on some module. So G is a profinite group always. So G is one, one smooth if and only if. If and only if the following holds. So if I'm given a finite number H1 up to HR of open subgroups of G, and for each of them I have a homology class Xi in the usual group homology, just H1 for now. In H1 of the subgroup H i with With values in FP. It's not important to, you can assume action of on FP is trivial. So if I am given such a data, so a finite collection of subgroups, for each of them, a coherengi class like that, then there should exist a chi uh like this, so uh a character chi from uh g to z mod p. Z mod P. So by that I mean the multiplicative component of chi is trivial, such that for each i this coverg class lifts two mod p square coefficients twisted by car. Xi Xi lifts to the group H1, Hi, Z square twisty button. So there's no universal chi that may work for all faces, but given a finite number of them, there's always one. And of course, I consider just this component. Ah, okay. Because the mod P. Because uh the mod P reduction is trivial, so um and uh so of course if the group is satisfied formally about nine t, then I can always take uh Z mod p score of one regardless of what the data is. But here the advantage is that it does not depend on some Z mod P score of one, just depends on the group. And so there is a theorem uh which is uh in uh our In our paper on smooth profinite group 1. So, one of the main results is that 1,1 smoothness is equivalent to the following to the property which I will denote by L, so good notation the L to implementation the L2 let's say L2 so L2 of G of G is a L2 of G so this means that by definition I'm going to define what this L2 of G is it's it's a property depending on G okay so the following so uh for all so now the idea is to operate Now the idea is to upgrade coefficients Fp to some FP algebra with an action of G. So the point is that the group G will act in a very complicated way on the coefficients. And we replace Z mod P square by W2 of this algebra. So let me start first. I should write L G two so let Letter A be an FP algebra which is perfect. So it means that Frobenius is an isomorphism. This assumption can be removed, but we have to add some extra stuff to make it simple. I assume perfectness. So let A be an F algebra perfect with an action of G as an algebra, as a rule, right? And I always assume that the action is continuous, meaning that it has open kernel. Having open kernel, it means that the action actually factors through a finite continuous quotient construction. It's always the case. We never take things that are all action factors through finite potion, but through the construction, this finite quotient becomes. This finite quotient becomes smaller or smaller. But G always acts everywhere through finite quotient. It's also one of the reasons to consider finite coefficients instead of continuous state homology. Because continuous technology is no longer true, this type of... Having open kernel, okay, right? Such that event, sorry, then one map is subject. One map is surjective, so this map will be the analog of this map here, but with upgraded coefficients. So let me write down what these coefficients are. So I take homology of G itself. So in this degree of generality, I don't need to restrict to open subgroups because I so it's it's a I mean the possibility to restrict to open subgroup is hidden in this in the the choice possible choice for A. Choice, possibly choice for A. So here I take W2 of A and three parentheses. One, two, three. And then I map to the reduction, which is just B2 or 3. So let me comment. So this should be on 2. And let me just comment. And let me just comment on the so V2 is the Borel subgroup EGL2. So that's a standard object. And so V2 is a and it's it's important to take V two and uh not uh not ones ones are not allowed, otherwise it's not correct uh the fish. So this is inside uh G L two. So, this is inside GL2. And so, but I say that if I take homology with values in B2 of some FP algebra which is perfect with the G-action, then I can lift this with coefficient in B2 of the V vectors of A. And so it's easy to count, it's easy, it's not too hard to see that if we take A equals F P, actually we kind of recover the usual lifting statement. There are some three stars. Lifting statement. There are some twist arguments to be done. But then again, the full proof is not too that obvious because first of all this doesn't depend on any subgroup, but in fact all subgroups are encoded in the possible choice of A. This would work for M. Is it A commutative? Yeah, a pure commutative actually. Otherwise big vectors are not definable. I don't want big vectors or something non commutative. Part that you wrote here, it's the meaning of L2G. Is that correct? Yes, exactly. For every A, the following should be true. So, okay. So now what I'm going to state is: so this is the first part of the work, and then the idea is to work with this definition to prove in the second paper a result. In the second paper, a result which is not finished to be proved, so I will present it as a possible theorem, a result of mine, which is the goal of smooth profile net groups 2. And I'll just present the version with the FP coefficient. So, actually, it's very simple, the statement. So, I put here Here I should have put, yeah, no, it's done. So this is two here, yeah? And the two corresponds to the two here, let's say. So I could as well put some higher value, let's say some D, right? And here, put D instead. But W2 would still be W2. Still W2. So in fact, it depends on two things. In truth, it depends. Things in truth depends on the dimension here and also the R, but here I stick to W2, but we could try to go to the W3 and so on. It's another question. Actually, I stick to the W2, it should be enough. So the thing that actually the L2G implies L D G for all is the state. L two G implies implies L D G for all D greater than 2. In fact, it becomes increasingly complex because if third activity holds here for D equals 3, for instance, then it holds also for D equals 2 because B two is a subgroup of B three, so the the the higher you go, the harder it is. And actually the the hardest case is the case three. If if you can prove three, then I need to prove. If you can prove three, then I need to prove anything. It's all the subtlety is already from passing from B2 to B3. So let me just translate what that means. So as a concrete corollary, it's a possible corollary. So let G be some absolute Galois group. absolute Galois group, Gala Fs over F and uh consider a representation rho from G to B. Let me just state that B D for instance. So what is such a homomorphism? Such a homomorphism is a representation of G over F P with the open kernel, that's always the assumption. And the fact that the morphism lands into B D instead of GLD means that the representation is equipped with a complete filtration. It's a G invite. So this is exactly the same as a complete flag of representation of G of dimension D over F P. It's the same thing. And then this should lift to a representation mod P square. Then Then this rule lifts to the same type of gadget, that mod P square. And actually, this is much stronger than the similar statement with GLD instead of B D. So if you can prove liftability for B D, it's easy to deduce liftability for G L D on s subtle. To lift things with a filtration is much more subtle than lift things. much more subtle than if things work without. But in the degree of generality of an NFP algebra with coefficients uh as coefficients instead of FP, actually both are equivalent. So if we consider this kind of statement but applied to an arbitrary FPG algebra then this question for B D or G F are actually the same. So let me just say that so Let me just say that uh so with uh with uh Cyril De Marchion and uh Andrea Arconti, we we uh we have an elementary proof of this in the case of Pier Dec Fit. Control elementary for F a P add finite extension. That's a finite extension of Qp. So, in fact, for this type of situation, the key ingredient which makes things way simpler is that H2 of F with values in, let's say, UP, so Fp of 1, this group is one-dimensional as an FP vector space. So, because when we want to lift representation. When we want to lift representation, there are obstructions in H2, and if this guy is one-dimensional, this can be solved in quite quite elementary, explicit fashion. And the proof is not too long, so we will release the paper very shortly. But if this graph is not one-dimensional, it's way more complicated. So now what I would like to explain, that was my main goal, that I spent time to explain other. Spend time to explain other things, is the content of smooth profile 3, where we use this possible theorem to prove the non-residual isomorphism theorem. So, I want to explain how to deduce from this the non-residual isomorphism theorem, and for that we can provide a full proof. It's not too long, so that I hope I have time to explain in detail. And this also has been checked and the paper is written but not available on the twitches. So the FIFRL is most profanite groups free. So warning, it uses the possible theorem. Using that. So we show the following. So assume G is a 1,1 symptomic. So it means it satisfies 4 multiplied 90 mod P squared by definition. By definition. So if G satisfies formality mode P squared, then so perhaps what I could do, which will be better to do, is just to say, okay, so I will remove this dependence on the possible theorem and just say that this L D, the property L D G for all D For all D implies the vanishing of higher box types. Implies that surjectivity, that for all n bigger than 2, 1 actually, the map from H n with values in Z mod P square twisted. P square twisted by n down to h1 g f p twisted by n is onto. And as an input, I should assume that actually g satisfies formal Libra 19. But actually, to get this So, but actually to get this result, we need, for the time being, we need the full formal reversal, meaning Zp of 1. So, if we just assume mod P square, let me just say Rally, if we just assume mod P square, then actually, given a class here, we can lift it, but there is a twist which changes and we have no control on the twist. So if we assume Z Z mod Z Z P of one coefficient, it's okay. If we just assume Z mod P square of one, then we obtain a given class here. There is one lift of the coefficient to some Z mod P square of chi such that the class lifts, but this may not be Z mod P square of N. This is a problem. So I will. Okay, so I will now try to prove five minutes ten fifty? Oh, that's perfect. Okay, good. So I would like to explain how this is proved. So, proof. So, let us ignore the twist here. So, assume that for simplicity and actually. And actually, this is no restriction because if there is a cyclotomic character, there is also one with a trivial twist here. So, this is essentially no serious restriction. Then I can also do, I can also assume the following, that G is a probe group. This is also no big deal. Why? Because liftability of a given class is equivalent to some vanishing of some. is equivalent to some vanishing of some class in HL plus one and this can be checked after restricted to a propici load by a restriction, co-restriction, so that there's no harm in making these two assumptions. So now let's pick a class C in HM of G with values in F P. So then this class G comes from the cohort is inflated from cohomology of a finite quotient of G. Of a finite quotient of G. So that there exists a quotient, a continuous quotient of G. So this is a finite proof. Continuous kernel is open. A continuous quotient of G such that C is inflated from this is a This is a general fact. It can be taken the definition of group cosmology as the direct limits of all such groups. So now I will just study to begin with this class as a chain of some finite group. And as such, we can represent it as a unitary extension. And so let me pick a very particular nice way of representing it. So there is a we have this nice exact sequence which is dual to the augmentation map, right? So this is an exact sequence of of uh Z G naught module, right? So G0 module, J is usual notation for this co-curve L. And then we can represent by dimension shifting in college, while you can represent C as an N extension in the style of Unido. Unida so FP goes to FP of G naught. Then what we get along the way, J bracket G naught, then J cancel to bracket. I will expand show here how this is done. How this is done. Up to J tensor, also it's n minus one bracket J naught goes to J n and sorry goes to A and then we have F P. So it's a bit so this is just it's a it's a it's a notation for J tensor Z F P. Z F P of uh of uh of uh of J uh G0. The point is that actually these are all uh so you you can do otherwise. The point is these are all free what I what I'm circling now are all three Z free FPGZ modules, FPG0 modules. So I use this particular way of doing things because it's canonical, it's actually the Things because it's canonical. It's actually this loop functor or suspension on FPG motor. It's just obtained by. So if I apply homology here, so if I map it here, I obtain zero because this is free. So it comes from Hn minus one of the guy and I iterate. So actually I just need to have three modules here. That's a basic statement by projective resolution. But here there's a canical way to do it using this JSON so I do that. using this J, so uh I do that. But if you don't like this J, you can use any projective uh uh resolution with uh three modules up to this one. So here it will not be free, but uh that are very tweaking. Okay, so now uh what we do, we extract the the very last uh extension. So we zoom, let us zoom here, zoom here, and so we introduce the co-colour of this map, which is the Co-corner of this map, which is the corner of this one. So that way we get some extension, V A F P, which is an extension of F P G modulus. But actually, this guy here is, we know who that is. It is actually J J tensor N. But it's not needed to go and be used. It can be useful, but it's not needed. The fact is that since we know that J is a pro D group and we are using Fp coefficient, all FP representation of G can be completely filtered. Because it's a standard fact that the representation of a T group in Karate STP has an invariant element. So if you iterate, actually, they're all unipotent representations. So we can take. Representation, so we can equip this guy with a complete FPG environment fly. Equip it, there might be several ways, but just choose one. Equip it with a complete G naught equivariant flag. And then actually, the A becomes equipped with a complete G equivalent flag, and we can have. G equivalent flag and we can apply this L D G for D equals the dimension of A. So by using L V J where D is dimension of A, we actually lift this short exact sequence to a short exact sequence of representation of a z both p squared. So this can be lifted to an extension uh like that. An extension like that, B2. By B2, I mean it's a free Z mod P square module with a G action. So note that here it will no longer be a G0 modulus, because G0 is not smooth. G is smooth, but not G0. So actually, this is a lift to an exact sequence of Z mod P square G modules, not G naught anymore. And here at theory, there should be a twist. There should be a twist by some character, but we can untwist the exact sequence as a whole and assume action here is trivial. So this will be an exact sequence of G modules, not G0. As I mentioned, G0 does not satisfy formal importance. So it's really G button. So now it remains step by step to lift the the entire To lift the entire extension each step by step to Z mod P squared coefficients. And to do that, it's just finish by explaining how it's rather fairly easy. Here now we use that each term, the term that remain to be treated, are three FPG not modules. We use that, and it's not too hard to show how the thing lived. So imagine now. Thing lift. So imagine now, so the the this term here uh so ima uh what I what I want to to say is that this term here is actually uh defined over z. And so this j was defined over z. So we can take the mod p square reduction of this term here and try to lift up the so now try to lift up the The arrow from these three modules, G tax, sorry, A minus one bracket G naught, to the co-kernel, which is B, this projection, to an arrow which is G naught equivariant. So this is actually a mod mode. Actually, mod p, right? And now I want to do the same, but with this guy reduced mod p square to d2. So the thing is, this one is not an FP, is not G naught modules, it's a G modules, right? It's a G module. So I cannot hope to obtain so this is an arrow of uh G naught modules, but this guy here is not a G naught module, so it's a G module. So It's a G motor. So I cannot hope to lift it as such. But what I can do, I can modify this so thi this this mod P. This is a MODP lifting of this guy here. I'm able to modify this MOTP lift such that they are no lift. So let me explain how. So for instance, I will denote this subjection by pi. And my wish is to lift to a G called To a G-covariant map like that. It should be G-quariant. So this fails, but we can modify this graph so that it can be done. So actually, if you compute, there is an obstruction to the existence of pi2, of this lift, which lives in so rooms, these are rooms, that they are H0. So obstruction will live in H1, H1 of G, J. of uh g j with values in uh in a cherry form of f p vector spaces from uh this thing here okay to b so we have a a narrow that we want to lift the obstruction i is naturally uh lift in h one of g with valuation in the whole space which is a representation of g, right? But now it just remains to uh to observe. remain to observe that this guy here is a projective this guy here is a projective FPG0 module so G should be on top sorry okay so actually what can be this obstruction here can be lifted Here can be lifted to we'd like to finish by drawing this square. So we have, so actually there is the endomorphism space of, this is the key here to finish, so of this space, transparent, right? And then we can project onto project onto just by composing by pi, we can project to a form from j dance of n minus 1 j0 to b. This is just obtained by composing, right? Composing with pi. And since this guy here, this is an arrow of FPG modules, which is surjective, this one is projective, so actually this term So actually, this trajectory splits. So, actually, the class that we have here comes from there. So, by using a splitting, what we get is some class, which I like to call epsilon, because it suggests we're going to do some slight modification. So, that way we get some class epsilon in H1 of G with value in the undermorphism space of this module here. Here, right? Let me not write it, so it's the endomorphism space of this module. And then this class, H1, we can use it to deform this lifting. That way we get another lifting, and using this other lifting as a source, then I relift. So we get some we get another lift, let me denote it by oh sorry this one. By this one is M2. We get another lift M2 epsilon such that actually a pi lift to subjection with source this modified lift. Okay, so the key is not to use the obvious lift of this thing to Lift of this thing to a Z mod P square G module, but to modify a little bit, and then the arrow will lift, and then we can go down all the way by the same argument up to here. And of course, the kernel, we don't know what it is, but it will be some, in the end, some free Z mod P square G module frame one with an action hence the statement. So the statement is that we have lifted this extension to an ex This extension to an extens to an extension to an extension of a Z mod P square module, free Z mod P square module, with a G action. And this, taking unique class, we have proved that the starting class lives. And then instead of having Z mod P square of N as coefficient, so actually we would like that in the end. Here we get Z mod P square of N, but we don't get that, we get, we don't know what. Yet, we don't know what. And there's a second part of the proof, which I don't have time to explain, or I could, but it will take another 20 minutes, where we explain how to pass from, because in the end we get some Z mat p square of chi, and we have no control on chi, and then there's a next step to explain that we can actually pick chi equals the correct one, at least. And once we have done that, Done that, uh, uh, so block uh north to isomorphism follow from some uh providing two papers, which are quite uh short Reynolds papers. So, one for P equal two by Mercouriev in 1996, I think, and another more recent by Philippe Gilles in 2007 for P Ode, where they explain using a rather elementary computation, and the paper self-contained. They explain that the They explain that the vanishing of higher box style, which we put here, implies the non-residio isomorphism. But I'll conclude my talk. Okay. Questions? Or we talked about where will you say entry? So epsilon is a class in H1 with value in the endomorphism of this guy. And it's a general fact that if you have an SPG module, mod P representation, if it admits a lift, mod P square, then the space of lift is a principal homogeneous space of H1. I mean, two lifts will differ from an element of the H1 of the undermined. An element of the H1 of the endomorphism space. It's a fact from deformation theory. If lifting exist, then two lifting differs from a class in H1 of G with values in the end and morphism of the objects. It's a very general fact from deformation theory. So that we apply here. So we just have to determine which is the this element uh we use to deform this obvious lift to another suitable lift for the Suitable lift for the arrow itself to lift. At some point in your lecture you said that you were going to use the formal hydro 90 for Zp. But here we use the yellow p square. We don't use it here. We use it for the last step to ensure that the coefficient can be picked to be z mod p square of m. So you're right. So what I have proved so far, it doesn't So what I have proved so far, it doesn't use a ZP of one, it just uses a actually that the group is a small, small p-square. That's it. And if we want the extra data, that the twist we obtain at the end is actually the expected one, then we use ZP of one. But I suspect we don't need that. But so far the only proof we just kept quite short uses is ZP of one. It's a actually what we do is we we mimic So actually what we do is we mimic Laurent extension. When you have a field F, you can do F double RTD. And so in good characteristic, the Gadwell group will be a semi-direct product G, a semi-direct product ZP of one. So if we do, when we have a fifth F, if we pass to the Lawrence series, the Galma group evolves. The Galma group evolves and that. So, actually, this can be done for profinal groups with a cyclotomic character. So, what we do is define Laurent polynomial, which is if G is the smooth profile group, in terms of this gap G, actually the grandma group just depends on G. And so, what we do is if we want to lift some class C, we use some class C, we use um some iterative logo extension instead and try to lift this class C and uh the obvious step product which exists at the level of supposed variables. We try to lift these two classes and we can show that there is a module that works for the two simultaneously. This is actually also uh promote. And uh but actually if this thing lifts, uh the the the module lifting coefficient is is forced to be a C mod P square of M. Sigma P square of M. So that by lifting these two together, we ensure that the module lifting C is also simple P square of M because it's the only one that works to lift the obvious. This is the second part of the product. No questions and comments? Let us thank the speaker again. I want to thank all speakers at this conference for their nice talks, and I wish everyone's fault the other one. One more remark: if you haven't yet paid your debts for beverages or something like that, please don't forget to pay everything before you leave.
