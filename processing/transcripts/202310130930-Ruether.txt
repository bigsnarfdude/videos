Being in Ban, sort of back near where I grew up, sort of my swamping grounds. So I'm going to talk about this. And this is sort of a story about, well, we've seen some talks about quadratic pairs, we've seen talks about quadratic pairs not in characteristic two, we've seen some in characteristic, sorry, not quadratic forms. And this is sort of about the orthogonal involutions in characteristic two, within particular sort of with no characteristic assumption. But Clifford algebras are kind of the main focus here. Clifford algebras are kind of the main focus here. So, a quick review of usual Clifford algebras. I'm sure everybody knows this. But if you're in characteristic not two and you have a quadratic form, you just take the tensor algebra, you make sure that multiplying by the same thing evaluates in your quadratic form, and you have a bunch of properties. There's this canonical involution, which just swaps the order of tensor factors. The even Clifford algebra is just this of even things. It has a canonical involution. If you fix an even dimension, two n. If you fix an even dimension to n, then depending on the parity of n, you can tell the type of this involution. And maybe what earns it the name canonical is that this factors. There's this obvious way to take an isometry of the photo form, you just sort of put it, evaluate it piece by piece on the Clifford algebra, and this respects this canonical involution. This is all sort of standard. But you can also set these up instead of using. Instead of using the quadratic form, if you're in characteristic not two, you can use a central simple algebra. In particular, you could use the endomorphism of your quadratic form. And now the definition, I mean, you have to change it a little bit. You're only going to get the even Clefford algebra, but this is all still sort of standard. You have these two ideals that you mod out of the tensor algebra of A. The first one is you're just modding out for your symmetric elements, you want them to be equal to one-half times the trigger. You want them to be equal to one-half times the trace, but in particular, you need this one-half, so you need the characteristic to not be two here. The definition of j2 is complicated, it's in the book of involutions, but they don't write it this way, they write it in math. But the vibe is that when it's split, the complicated things that define J2 are doing this. I mean, you want it to act like Cleford put it on the previous slide. So, you want when you have the same two things to give you Q. Two things to give you Q. But because you only sort of have even products of V, you need to take care of the fact when there's two between two factors. And again, here the canonical involution is, I mean, it's now you have the sigma from A coming into play, but again, it sort of swaps orders, applies sigma, and you can take care of the types in a very similar way. And it's canonical for a similar reason in that some automorphism of the thing you started with will respect this canonical involution. This is a canonical implementation. And of course, you know, in this case, you get the even Clifford algorithm from the previous slide. So this is all sort of usual. But now we're going to switch to characteristic. Well, we're going to switch to making no assumptions about the characteristic, which means that you really have to assume the characteristic is too. Careful. But these are some conventions that I've been using recently, which are a little different than the conventions in the classical literature. If I have an involution on a central simple algebra, Involution on a central simple algebra, or later an Azumai algebra over a scheme, say of the first kind, you can split it, and once it's split, it'll be adjoint to some regular bilinear form. And I'm just going to use this terminology. So if B is symmetric, we'll call it orthogonal. If it's skew symmetric, we'll call it weakly symplectic. If it's alternating, we'll call it symplectic. And the difference here, if you're in characteristic not two, this is the usual setting. But if two is equal to zero, then one is equal to minus one. This is an easy remote. This is an easy lemma. And then some of these can coincide. So for me, say if the characteristic is two, I allow orthogonal and weakly symplectic to be the same thing. So I might have a symplectic involution which is also orthogonal. I sort of allow for this overlap and it sort of streamlines and unifies some states. Okay. So when dealing with orthogonal involutions in No Assumption on the Characteristic, the standard tool from the book of involutions. Tool from the book of involutions are quadratic pairs. So you have your essential simple F algebra. The information of a quadratic pair is, well, it's an orthogonal involution, but you put some extra information on this orthogonal involution. It's this linear map from the symmetric elements. These are elements such that A is equal to sigma A down to F, and it has to satisfy this. And this compatibility with the trace is what allows it to sort of hide the information of a quadratic form underneath. And I mean, this works in any characteristic. And I mean, this works in any characteristic, but sort of a nice feature is that if your characteristic is not 2, you can take a symmetric element and expand it like this, and you sort of get forced. There's only one f, and this reflects the fact that linear forms have a unique quadratic. This is the definition of a quadratic form. And if you haven't seen quadratic forms, this is sort of the idea behind them. This is how they encode the information of a quadratic form. When you have a split algebra and some. And some, we're talking about the evolution, it'll have a symmetric bilinear form. This will be regular, so you can hook up an isomorphism, similar to how we had when we were counting the Clifford algebra, between V tensor V and the endomorphism. And you get a bijection between the F, which extend this to a predicate pair, and the Q, whose polar form are B. And in characteristic 2, this, I mean, it's not necessarily kind of a bijection, but there might be more than one option for these F and this Q. Option for these f and q. But this is sort of just the formulas for how this gets encoded. So if you haven't seen this before, this is the idea. This is kind of how they fix the problem that not every bilinear form has a quadratic form underneath, et cetera. Okay. Now, a nice classification that also shows up in the book of involutions, which is really useful for keeping track of these things and for doing computations, is the following. Whenever you have a quadratic pair on your central simple algebra, it's given sort of by some element. It's given sort of by some element. You find an element in your algebra, it satisfies this: L plus sigma L is 1, and F of a symmetric element is the trace of L times this element. And this is unique, sort of, there's some orthogonality arguments between Alt and some other things, but it's unique up to adding some alternating element, which is the set of A minus sigma A. And conversely, if you pick any L that has this property and you define this function, this will make a quadratic pair. So this is sort of a nice classification. You have an F. Classic issue. You have an F, you can describe it with an L. It sort of gives you control of all of the algebra. Okay, now we want to talk about Clifford algebras. And instead of just using A sigma, now we want to use A sigma F. So what is the definition? It's pretty much the same. If you're tensor algebra of A, you have these two ideals. J2 is still complicated. But now, where we had one half of the trace of A, F is sort of playing this role. It gets rid of the one half. Is sort of playing this role. It gets rid of the one-half. This compatibility that it has with the trace allows it to do this. And you can see over here that it's sort of the same. This is the way that the quadratic form was cooked up in that previous compatibility slide. So let's just replace this. But yeah, so when you have this F, you can cook up a Clifford algebra of it in the same way. It sort of fixes this problem. And these have a canonical involution in essentially the same way. And because I'm going to, I mean, you can classify the type as well, but I want to focus on when there's. Well, but I want to focus on when this canonical division is orthogonal. And that happens in these two cases. Again, sort of by my convention of orthogonal, oftentimes, if you read sort of standard literature, this case will say that you deal with a symplectic involution variance of two, but I'm allowing this to be the same. Okay, so these are sort of going to be the cases that we're interested in. And instead of writing these things here as just the A, just for clarity, there's this sort of canonical linear map from A, the Clifford algebra. Your map from A to the Clifford algebra, just put it into the tensor algebra in the degree one factor. And so I'll use CA sometimes to indicate the image of it in the Clifford algebra, sort of keep track. But this is how you define them for the right pair. But this, if you're in characteristic two, well, I mean any characteristic, whenever we have an orthogonal involution to work with these properly, we want it to come with an F. We want to work with quadratic pairs. So we want, when this is orthogonal, an F bar. When this is orthogonal, an f-bar. We want to put something here so that we have a quadratic pair. And in the book of involutions, they sort of do everything characteristic agnostically with these F's or most of it. And there's a last couple chapters on triality, where they start assuming the characteristic is not 2, again, and they describe the phenomena of D4. And they describe in the notes that they made this assumption at the end because they didn't have an F bar to put here. didn't have an F bar to put here. But if we want this to be, yeah, so we want to put an F bar here and in order for it to be canonical, sort of our definition of canonical is that a map like this will factor. So we want these things to respect whatever F we put there. And so pretty recently, two years ago, Andrew Dolphin and Ann wrote a paper where they describe how you should define this, what this canonical thing should be. And so it works for your And so it works for your algebra as a degree eight or more. I can explain why in a bit. But if you set this up with a quadratic pair such that the orthogonal, the canonical involution is orthogonal, the way you can define this canonical f is you just take any element that has trace one, you set L to be its image in the Clifford algebra, and then you build this function in this way. And this will be your canonical. They show that it doesn't depend. Will be your canonical. They show that it doesn't depend on the choice of A. They show that it fills this question mark, so this map will factor. They show us slightly more general. They say if you have, like, if A and B are an isomorphism, then you get isomorphisms of the standard line up, but you get this for automorphisms. And so this is nice. This works. This answers the question. It says what you should put there. And they explain sort of the consequences and how you can neutrality over a field of characteristic two. And I don't know, when I saw this, I thought it was pretty clever. I don't know. When I saw this, I thought it was pretty clever because it's sort of exactly this element exactly works out because of the relations that we put on in order to find the Clifford algebra. So, this is just some standard computations. You want this element that you pick to be equal to one. You just sort of expand down to here. But then exactly the way that the Clifford algebras are defined, when you have a symmetric element, you apply f to it. And because of the properties of f, this is the trace. But we pick a trace one element, so this works out. I thought this was very clever. So, we have this canonical thing now over fields. And what I wanted to do is extend this over to a scheme. So, we've seen a couple talks where we're talking about as we my algebras over a scheme and stuff. So, this is the setting that I'm going to work in. I think most of the previous talks were working on sheaves on X, but following the style of a paper by Thomas and Fissel, I'm going to work with the rate. I want to work with the ringed flat site. This is mostly just technicalities, but you have some base scheme. O is the sheaf of global sections, sort of the structure sheaf. And my Nazumaya algebra is going to be just some sheaf of abelian groups, which is also an O-module that's locally isomorphic to matrices. This is one of the possible definitions. And an orthogonal involution that's with natural transformation of sheaves. And when this is split, this should be adjoint to a symmetric bilinear form. This was my idea. Adjoint to a symmetric bilinear form. This was my idea of orthogonality. And a couple of common modules that float around in this theory, which I'm also going to use. I mean, the symmetric we've already seen, but now this is the subsheaf of symmetric elements. And I'm also going to need the subsheaf of alternating elements and symmetrized elements. These are the A minus sigma A, and these are the A plus sigma A. But this image here now, sort of the fact that saves a lot of this, is that because we're working with flat sheaves, this is the like sheaf-ified. This is the sheafified image. It's the image sheaf. So the fact that this thing is not just literal images, but has been sheafified sort of fixes a bunch of problems later on. So in this setting, as I said, there was this paper by Colmez Dassel. They generalized the definition of quadratic pair to this setup. And it's pretty much, I mean, it's sort of the straightforward generalization. You have an Azumai algebra, you put out a care on it, it's an orthology. You put a put out a care on it, it's an orthogonal involution, and it's a function like this where now your base thing is O. You want it to be O linear, you want it to satisfy the same condition, but now you sort of want it to do it everywhere. I'm sort of cheating here, maybe not writing a bunch of notation that you should write for natural transformations, but over any point on your functor, you sort of get these relations. And the Clifford algebra here is defined, again, a very similar way. There's these two ideals that define it, these are essentially the same as. Essentially the same as the J1 and J2 previously. But now, once you're sort of done generating those ideals, you want to also make sure that you sheafify them into a sub-sheaf of two-sided ideals. But modules of those technicalities, these are essentially the same. You get this cursive sheaf Clifford algebra associated to your quadratic pair. And again, it has this same sort of characterization of when its canonical involution is orthogonal. And when it's orthogonal, we want to put. And when it's orthogonal, we want to put a quadratic error on it. But we can't just, I mean, there are some problems where we can't just immediately apply or generalize the construction from Andrew's paper. And the first is that this classification no longer exactly works. You can cook up a funny example such as this and other examples where you have a quadratic pair, but there's no F global. Quadratic pair, but there's no F globally, or no star, no L globally that describes it. So, this is an example from a paper of Philip, Erharden Hare, and myself, mostly Philip's example. You can take an ordinary elliptic curve. If you put it over a field of characteristic 2 and look at its multiplication by 2, you get some torsor. You can use this torsor to twist the matrix algebra. Because this is a quaternion algebra, it has a canonical symplectic involution. But this symplectic involution is also orthogonal to me. Orthogonal to be. So when you twist, you get an orthogonal involution on a quaternion algebra. And you can show, you can write down an f that extends this, but this particular property, the global sections are f. And so if you try and look for any L that has the right property, you won't find it because scalars are always symmetric. So this is just 2L, or in characteristic 2, so this is 0. So you can't just, yeah, this nice correspondence does. Can't just, yeah, this nice correspondence doesn't quite work. So we need some other way to pick up an element to define our L. But it does work over affine schemes. Oh, sorry. No, I'm getting ahead of myself. Okay, so this is a problem. So a way that you can fix this is the following. This is sort of an easy lemma, which follows from the fact that these L exist over afline schemes. But it's a necessary condition. But it's a necessary condition that 1 is symmetrized if you're going to have a quadratic pair on your algebra. So we define a sigma where 1 is symmetrized as locally quadratic. This is certainly necessary. And so if you assume you have locally quadratic, then you have a 1 here. And you can talk about that 1 because it exists. And the classification in this setting ends up being the following. It's not exactly L here. It's the L in A mod alt such that under this sort of Alt such that under this sort of induced map, this alt is in the kernel of this. The L goes to, or the class goes to one. And you could have stated, I mean, you can state it the same way in the previous setting, but here the difference is that this is surjective as a map of sheaves, but it might not be surjective on global sections. So again, the sort of fact that something has been sheafified here when you take a quotient is what saves it and what gives you this bijection. So, again, this is sort of what I got ahead of myself. When S is affine, then actually the story is very similar to all of the fields. Then you have an L, then you have this classification, then sort of everything still works out. And so the way you make this bijection from the previous slide is if you have an A sigma and an affine cover of S, if you have an F and you want to get one of these L's, well, locally there are going to be some Li. Well, locally, they're going to be some li. These things are going to glue together, the class and the alt, they're going to glue together exactly because f exists and glues. And so when they glue, they give you some class. And going the other way, if you're given a class, you can look over your cover. This a to a mod alts is going to be surjective, so you can find some li that have the right property. You can build these local functions, and because of where this was, these will glue and you'll get an f. And so it's essentially the same correspondence, but you have to work. Same correspondence, but you have to work sort of locally because locally things there might not be enough to work with. This is the solution there. Now, the next problem, problem two, is that and construction was based on this element of trace one, and this can also not exist. This same example, Q, if you look at it here, we saw that the global sections were just F. So any time we split this Q and we look at the restriction map, the scalars are going to map into the scalars. Are going to map into the scalars. But the trace of this, because we're in characteristic 2, is always going to be 0. It's going to be 2 times c. So all of your global sections have trace 0. So you can't, I mean, there'sn't one trace one to work with. So again, this is sort of solved by going hookup, but this is the second problem. And so the way that you solve this is there's a fact about Azumai algebras over rings that they do have elements of trace one. And so what it means is that this is a surjective map of trace one. Is that this is a surjective map of sheaves? Again, not surjective on global sections, but surjective is sheaves. So, of course, if you just put the kernel here, the trace zero elements, you get an exact sequence. There's this obvious exact sequence respirating to the Clifford algebra. This is this canonical inclusion. And the lemma here is that when the degree is greater than six, this SLA here lands in the alternating elements. This was essentially argued in Anne's paper. They didn't state it exactly like this, but they. Stated exactly like this, but they have some intersection criterion which amounts to showing this. But it also works over schemes and for these sheaves. And because this kernel lands in this kernel, you get an induced map here. And then you also have to sort of argue that, it's not so hard, but you argue that this composition down here sends A to, there's A times 1. So if you pick 1, the element 1, you'll get something here which maps to 1, which is the correct. Which maps to one, which is the criterion for defining an F. So you should just pick that one. And that's the definition over a scheme. So again, sort of this degree greater than or equal to eight, because we want it to be orthogonal. I mean, degree greater than six makes the C factor, but degree greater than eight makes orthogonal. So if you just pick row of one, this image under here, use that as in the previous couple slides to define an F bar. This is sort of the correct canonical involution over a scheme. Canonical involution over a scheme. It makes this diagram commute, and everything sort of works out how you want. And if you're over an affine scheme or over a field, it's essentially not the same. I mean, there you have the L, everything sort of works out. So this recovers the pin charge. So it's, there's a couple little things you have to take care of in the scheme setting, but after that, things sort of work out, and you get this canonical pair as you want. And because you have this factorization, twist. You have this factorization, twisting properties work out, so this is sort of a nice option for the split object. You just take like the hyperbolic quadratic form of dimension 2n, sort of the one that combines this with that and this with that. If you take this as your split object, it has some canonical f based on the previous, the definition of the previous slide. And then if you just look at the torsor, the PGO2N torsor, which like classifies any other A sigma F. Classifies any other a sigma f. Because of this factorization, you can twist the Clifford algebra with it, and you get the Clifford algebra. So this all sort of works out. Twisting theory works, everything works. These sort of canonical pairs line up. It sort of is the correct choice. Everything's good. But there's one sort of case left when sigma bar is orthogonal. This is degree four algebras when two is equal to zero. And unfortunately, fortunately, Fortunately, it doesn't work. You can't pick a conical quadratic pair here. I was talking about this to someone else, and they said that if you know Lie algebra theory, apparently this is obvious that things go wrong on degree four. But anyway, no matter what you pick, I mean, there are a lot of options. There are a lot of f primes that you can put here. But this map won't factor as maps of sheaves. You will always find some ring somewhere or some scheme somewhere sort of in your category. Some scheme somewhere sort of in your category, where if you look at the points there, it falls outside. And the problem is that the alternating elements are just sort of too small. The calculations that were in Anne's paper, and the sort of same calculations that I used to show that C factors, in this, you're working here and you look in the Clifford algebra of this object, the things are going to be like Vi times Vi star, et cetera. And you can show that Vi times Vj is alternating if you have a third VK. alternating if you have a third VK that you can use, where Vk is not equal to Ij. But if you're in, if there's only two of these, I three, three, four, you don't have this third option, and so you suddenly have a lot less alternating elements, and so you can't get the trace zero elements to land in there. So this sort of goes wrong. And so, like, well, the way it goes wrong, because you don't have enough alternating elements, like even just looking over an affine scheme, if you look at this split thing in degree four, and you take Split thing in degree four, and you take any sort of f, and you want it, if you want it to be canonical, if you want it to try and respect all of these maps, you sort of get forced into this. I mean, you can show that f respecting these is the same, because sort of f only matters up to alternating elements, that this l you've chosen ends up in all when you apply it. You can just do some calculations with a couple of these elements, you're forced to be here. But then this element is only forced is only fixed if OS is a Boolean. If OS is a Boolean ring, like if t squared is t for all of the elements, and of course, this is not respected at all by ring extensions. So if you try and look at the sheaf morphism and you go a bit further down, this is just going to fall apart. But at least one example you can get, if you take a Boolean ring and you look at like this split thing just over that ring, and you pick this L and you define an F, then you'll get, okay, I didn't say that these things are called semi-traces, but they are. These F's. You'll get a semi-trace which is fixed by all the things just in PGO4R. Again, if you take a ring extension, it's not going to work. So, of course, a Boolean ring has to have 2 equal to 0 in order to have this work out. But yeah, so it works there. It doesn't work sheet-wise. It works kind of sometimes for some strange rings. For non-split algebras, I don't know. I haven't taken, like, I want to do some computations with a Cartearne algebra and see if there's something else I can say here, but. There's something else I can say here, but yeah, I don't know if this is useful, if there's more explanation of this, but in general, sort of sheaf site-wide in degree four, there's nothing. And otherwise, in higher degrees, there's this nice generalization of the quadratic pair. And now that there's a foundable quadratic pair, you can sort of start using these to do other things. So, I don't have as good of control of time as Arturo hit, so I'm done here. Thank you. Questions? Maybe I have just one question, but so in degree 2.4, you do get a canonical. Yeah, degree 2 mod 4 if you're in like character. 2 mod 4 if you're in like characteristic 2, if 2 is equal to 0. And yes, that's important in characteristic different from 2. We have a canonical ocean which is in fact. So do you have any idea? Well, if it's in characteristic not 2, then like you were saying, the canonical involution and is 2 mod4 is just the wrong type. It's symplectic, and so you don't need to worry about putting on an affix just. Yeah, if you can, anytime 2 is invertible in your ring or over your scheme, it all just collapses to the classical theory, very analogous to overfields. So that window where n is 2 mod 4 really only matters when sort of 2 is 0. So you mentioned that someone told you that using the algebra. They give you some more details. I mean, are we talking about basic two is I think what did they say? I was talking about the fact that this factors, and this is a Lie algebra, and they just said, oh yeah, we always ignore degree four because this Lie algebra is badly behaved. And then no, they didn't give me more details. I think, well, I mean, it's probably this simpler reason that there's not quite enough elements for things to work out nicely, but not that we sort of have a comment in passing. I would like to know more details, but can't start. No, no. So in in solution one, you're assuming this is affine, but in your proof you're anyway taking an affine cover. So where do you actually need that this is affine? Actually, that this is a cover? Ah, no, you don't. Well, okay, this lemma is used in the fact that because this is an affine cover, these li exist in AUI. So the conclusion is that the lemma holds even if it's not. Ah yeah, this lemma, no. No, that's not the conclusion. So, okay. So what's going on? These are a little out of order. This theorem, the proof or the sketch of the proof of this theorem, is from here down and it uses this independent fact. And it uses this independent fact. Ah, okay. It uses the fact that because when S is affine, this happens, when I restrict UI, which is affine, these ally will exist. I mean, they might not exist over an arbitrary thing, but if you restrict an affine cover, they do, and then you can glue them into something. So that allows false, if not that one? Yeah, there was this example. Was that a scheme? This example that caused the problem. Yeah, you take your base scheme to be the ordinary lifted curve over something. Scheme to be the ordinary elliptic curve over something. And you can show that there's no, like you have a quadratic pair, you have an F, but there's no L that describes it globally. And it's exactly going wrong because this is not F line. Well, it can go wrong because it's not F line. L is not the button global section. Yeah, exactly. That's the global section in here. And I mean, sometimes you can cook up examples where there is a global L, but not always, yeah. If I understand correctly, that's sort of your last remarks. So you have a case where you can take a base a fine scheme, so a base ring, and things go well for a Lasmeya algebra over this ring, but things do not go well for Asmaya algebra over the FPP, the FPP, I'm not an object child used, over this. Is that it? Yes. Okay, so it's sort of weird. Okay, because usually we have this idea that, okay, working over the rainbow of the site should be, as long as the site is over an affine thing, it should be the same. It does not go well. Yeah, I mean, well, this morphism here, like, it will factor if you're looking at points over an affine scheme where t squared is t for all t. But of course, there's going to be a bunch of other. But of course, there's going to be a bunch of other affine schemes that don't have this. So it sort of factors some of the time, but not always. So it doesn't factor as a change. But yeah, it's kind of weird why it holds not, which is needed to think about it more. Very short. Maybe you said this already, but so existence is this L, and can you catch it with an obstruction? Yeah, when this L exists and a couple other things. So it wasn't in this work with Clifford algebras, but this GNR paper, Jill Neher and myself. Jill Meher and myself, it's about these homological constructions. And so, yeah, we sort of detail, you can catch when this L exists in the homological obstruction, you can construct, you can catch for a locally quadratic involution, if an F exists at all with a common volume instruction. We write this all down. Great. No more questions. Thank you so much again. Thank you very much. I really like you now to proceed. Now we have half an hour for Pokemon, then we have half an hour to check.
