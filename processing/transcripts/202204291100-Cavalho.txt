Yeah, I hope you are happy with recording. I didn't ask you before. Sure, sure. Recorded now. It's okay. So I think everybody can see my screen. Yeah. Okay, great. So let me start by thanking the organizers for the invitation to talk here. So thank you very much for putting up this meeting. So, thank you very much for putting up this meeting. And I especially thank Iran Lopez, who suggested the theme of this talk, which is a collection of results where tools from revenue basis, especially footprints, appear in papers on coding theory. So, okay, so let me start by just establishing the notation. Fq of finite field of q elements. We know that the code is a FQ subspace of FQ to dm, so it has length M, vectors of the code. Vectors of the codes are called code words, and we know how to define the distance between two m-tuples. So it's just a number of positions where these m-tuples differ. And the minimum distance is the minimum between the distance of two distinct code words. And since the code is a vector space, this amounts to calculating the minimum of the distance of a non-zero code word to the zero code word. Code word to the zero code word, and this distance between the non-zero code word and the zero code word is what we call weight, right? The weight of the code, which will be denoted by this. Okay, so the question is how to define code. So I want to call the attention. Iran told me that probably there would be some students in the audience. So I say that I call the attention to the students to the fact that. The students to the fact that since the first day, for example, in the first day, Gretchen defined codes using algebraic curves. And this has been happening all during all week. For example, just before my talk, Alessandro associated codes to some geometric objects. Why do we do this? Nobody said, let's just pick a random set of linear independent. Pick a random set of linearly independent vectors and consider the space generated by them. So nobody does this because, if you, of course, you can do this, but if you do this, it will be very difficult to calculate, for example, the minimum distance. So there are many papers on this. I like this only because it has a very strong title, the intractability of computing the minimum distance of a code, even defined over F2. So, what people do is what we have seen during this week. What we have seen during this week. Frequently, we see codes built from geometric or algebraic structures in a way that properties from these structures are used to determine the minimum distance or at least a bound for the minimum distance. Okay? So in this talk, I will present some codes that belong to the class of affine evaluation codes, affine evaluation codes. So the idea is to start with a subset X of the affine space. So let's say that X has So let's say that x has m points. And then we consider this i sub x, which is the ideal format by all polynomials in this polynomial ring, which I will denote by this fq bold x, which are zero. I consider the set of the ideal format by all polynomials, which are zero in every point of x. Then we can we have this evaluation map from this quotient ring to fq to dm, which just takes a class of a polynomials in the quotient ring. Class of a polynomials in the quotient ring, a class of a polynomial and evaluates in the points of x. This is well defined. This is easy to see that is a FQ linear transformation. And also, one can show that it's also an isomorphism. So to produce a code, we do the following. We take a subspace of this quotient ring seen as an FQ vector space. And the image phi of L is a subspace. Is a subspace of fq to dm, so it's just what we call an evaluation code associated to L. Of course, it has length m, and the dimension is the same of dimension of L because phi is an isomorphism. So for such codes, we may use tools from Graben-Bay's theory in order to determine a lower bound for the minimum distance, in many instances, the actual value of the minimum distance. Okay, to present these tools, I need to. I need to introduce an order in the set of the monomials of the polynomial ring. So I denote by this script m the set of monomials, and I will endow the set with a so-called monomial order. So what is a monomial order? It's a total order in the set such that one is the least monomial. And if you have a certain relation between a certain ordering between two monomials, this Ordering between two monomials, this ordering is preserved if you multiply both monomules by the same monomer. So, this is what we call the monomial ordering. Okay, so now a polynomial is just a sum of monoms, sum of a finite number of monomers, maybe multiplied by some coefficients. But since there are only a finite number of monomers which appear, there must be a greatest monomial, and this greatest monomial is called the leading monomial of f. Okay. Okay, so a very important concept is the following. You consider I, an ideal in the polynomial ring. We say that a certain set G1 to GS of elements of I is a regular basis for I with respect to some order, monomial order. During this talk, I will always have some monomial order fixed in the set of monomules of the polynomial ring. So we say that this set is a grammar basis for the ideal if the linear. The ideal if the Linu monomial of any non-zero polynomial in the ideal is a multiple of the Linimonomial of some of these guys. Okay, so this is equilibrium basis. And one game proved that such a set is also a basis in the usual sense of a set of generators for the ideal. And this concept of gravity basis appeared in the PhD thesis of Brunberger, where he showed that starting with a generating set for With a generating set for the ideal, one may enlarge the set using an algorithm that he presented, which, after a finite number of steps, arrive at a graduate basis. So a set which generates the ideal and also has this property that the leading monomer of any non-zero polynomial is a multiple of the leading monomial of the new basis. Okay, so he did this to solve his thesis problem, which was to determine a basis. Which was to determine a basis for the quotient ring considered as a vector space. And he showed that such a basis is given by the classes of the monomials in the set. You take the set of monomials, which do not appear as the leading monomial of any polynomial in I. So, monomials which do not appear as the leading monomial of any polynomial in I. This set is known today as the footprint of the idea. Okay? The idea. Okay. Okay. So if you have a grammar basis for I, say G1 to GS is a gradual basis, it's not difficult to prove that a monomial is in the footprint if and only if it is not a multiple of the leading monomial of any of the generators in the Graven basis. Okay? And using this, we can, there's also a way to see the footprint, so to speak. Print, so to speak, if we associated to this monomial this n-tuple of non-negative integers. For example, assume that we have here a set of three polynomials, g1, g2, g3, which form a gradient basis for a certain ideal in the polynomial ring with just two variables, such that the linimonum of g1 is this monomial, the linimonum of g2 is this monomial, the linear norm of g3 is this monomial. So now we will plot the points. To plot the points corresponding to these monomials using this association that I told you before. So here is the point 17, which corresponds to this monomial. Here is the point 64, which corresponds to this monomial. And here we have the point 81 corresponding to that monomial. Okay, so now we can plot the points which corresponds to monomials, which are multiples of this leading monomer. So all these points here correspond to monomers, which are multiples. To monomials, which are multiples of this monomial. Sure. And all these points in this region corresponds to monomial, which monomials, which are multiple of this monomial. And of course, all these points in this region corresponds to points which are multiples of this monomial. So the points that are not plotted correspond to monomials which are not multiple of the Linu monomial of any of these polynomials which form a grade. Polynomials which form a grammar basis. So, these monomers form the footprint of the ideal. So, maybe that's where the name comes from. So, we can see the footprint. So, other tools that I will use during the talk are the following. If I have an ideal in the polynomial ring generated by H1 to HT, maybe not a very basis, I can associate this delta set of monomials, which are the set of monomials. Which are the set of monomials, which are not multiples of the leading monomials of any of these guys. Of course, the footprint is contained in this delta set, but we have equality if and only if this set of generators form a Graham basis. But anyway, we have this inclusion. So I also can consider the variety associated to the ideal. The variety associated to an ideal is the set of points in the affine space which are zeros of all polynomials in the ideal. Of all polynomials in the ideal. And one may show that if the footprint is finite, then the size of the footprint is an upper bound for the size of points in the variety. And also, moreover, we have equality if, for example, K is a finite field and J is a radical ideal. Okay, so sometimes I will use this in what follows. Okay, so now let me present an example to which we will. An example to which we refer later. So I start with n non-named subsets of F2, and let's say that the size of AI is di, okay, for all i, and we assume this technical condition. So I take x to be the product of these n sets. So we have here points in the affine space, okay? And of course, the size of x is the product of the di's, which I call m. I's, which I call m. Now, in the polynomial, in the polynomial ring, for every i, I take this univariate polynomial, which is xi minus all the elements of ai. Okay, so for example, we know that the degree of fi is di. And let i be the ideal generated by f1 to fn. Then x is just the variety of i. So, of course, x. Variety of I, so of course X, and one make sure actually that I is the ideal of the set X. I already contains all the polynomials which have X as common zero, which are zero in all the points of X. Okay, so now let this L sub D be the classes of polynomials in the quotient ring such that the polynomial is either zero or has a degree up to D. Degree up to D. And it's easy to see that this is a subspace of this quotient ring. And the image of the subspace is what is called the affine Cartesian code of order D. Also, one may show that this set F1 to Fl is a Grebel basis for I with respect actually to any monomial order. This is people that are familiar with Grebel basis know that this is true because if you take in This is true because if you take in two generators, the Linemonomas are co-prime. So we have for free that this is a Gravity basis. Okay. And we can see the footprint of this idea. Because, for example, when you think that n is just two, in the case where n, you have only two variables, here is the point that corresponds to this monom, the leading monomer of f1. Here is the point that corresponds to the leading monom of f2. We take out the points which correspond to monomers, which are multiples of this leading monomer. Which are multiples of this leading monomus. And the footprint in this case is just a rectangle. In the general case, it has d1 times, so one times dn monomus. Okay, like cube or hypercube, something like that. Of course, the dimension of L of C of this code is the same as the dimension of L. And one may show that the classes of the monomials in the footprint, whose degree, if you consider the monomers in the footprint, having degree up to D. Footprint having degree up to D. This is already a basis for L sub D. So, if you want to know what's the dimension of the code, you just count the number of these monomers. I'm not worried about that. I want to talk about the minimum distance. As for the minimum distance, we take a class in L sub D, where the polynomial has degree up to D. We would like to estimate the weight of the score word. Of course, the weight of the scored word is the number of points. the the number of points where i the number of of uh of positions where i have non-zero entries and this is the equal to the number the total number of positions minus the number of positions where i have entries equal to zero which is just just the size of this variety because this variety is composed by points points of x because we have the ideal i here which are zero in f so this is the number of zeros in the code word so Of zeros in the code vertical. So, as observed before, we have that this footprint is contained in this delta set. Here we have the monomies, which are leading monomies of generators of I. Here we have the leading, here we have the leading monom of F. And since I already told you that the classes of monomials of the footprint have an degree up to D is a basis for L D, we may assume that this polynomial is actually a Polynomial is actually a sum of monomials of the footprint of degree up to D, and in particular, the linear monomial of F, we may assume that is a monomial of the footprint with degree up to D. Okay. Okay. Now, it's not difficult to calculate the size of this delta set of monomers because we already know how to take out all the monomers which are multiples of this. Multiples of this leading monomius of i, and now we have an extra point here, which is the monomial of f. We know the point which is has coordinates a1 to am. And so the number of monomials, which are not multiples of any of these monomials, it's just the number of points here in this region. So is the total number, is the number of the regional footprint minus the number of points. Minus the number of points in this area. Okay. Okay. And we also know that this footprint is finite. So we have that inequality that I told you about. So, okay. So now let's put everything together. Let's go back to this equality where I have the weight of this code word. It's the total number of entries minus the number of entries which are zero. And from this inequality here, we have now this inequality. Inequality. So now from this conclusion, we have this other inequality. We know the size of this delta set. I just calculated here, but the product of the di's is exactly m. So here we have a cancellation, and we find that this number is a lower bound for the minimum distance. I mean, this number is a lower bound for the weight of the score. Is a lower bound for the weight of this code word. This number is just a number of points in this area. Okay, it's a lower bound for the weight of this code word. And so what we did, I determined the minimum value of numbers like this with, of course, this restraint in the AIs because this monomule is inside the footprint. So the AIs goes from zero less than the i, and the sum of the. Less than di, and the sum of the i's must be less or equal than d. And the minimum value for all numbers like this is this number here. So we have here as the di's, we also have this L, this K. L and K are uniquely determined when you write D like this. You write D equals D1 minus 1 plus D2 minus 1 until you have a certain remainder, which is less than DK plus 1 minus 1. k plus 1 minus 1. So this is how you determine k and l. And with k and l, you can you know this number. So this is the minimum of these lower bounds for weights of the code words. And then it's not difficult to find a code word which has exactly this number, this weight. So this is actually the minimum distance of the code. So actually this number, this minimum distance was first This number, this minimum, this was first appeared in a paper by Iran and Collaborators independently in a paper by Olaf Gale and Collaboratus. And what I did was just to find a shorter proof for this formula. And these results that I presented, they appeared in a paper of 2013, and the techniques were adapted from techniques which had appeared in the 2008 paper by Olaf George, where he determined the second low. Determined the second lowest honey weight, also known as next-to-minimum weight, of Rud-Miller codes for some values of d less than Q. So let's say low values of D. I also in this paper of 2013, I determined also the next minimum weights for a fine Cartesian coat, also for low values of D. In 2010, Robert Holman had already extended. Had already extended the techniques of Olaf Gale, and he determined the second Hammy weight of reading in the quotes for many values of D. Actually, he determined the next minimum weight for all values of D except those that are of this form, a multiple of Q minus one plus one. In 2017, together with my colleague Victor Neumann, we adapted Holland's method to affine Cartesian codes. To affine Cartesian codes. And we also determine the next minimum weights for almost all D. So we for all D of this form, except when L is equal to 1. And in 2021, we completed this determination under the hypothesis that the sets, the subsets, AI, are actually subfields. So I would like to say something about this paper with Victor Noma, where we also used properties from the footprint. Also, used properties for the footprint and which extended techniques of Robert Roland, which, by its turn, had extended techniques from Olaf George. So we had proved that this number is a lower bound for the weight of this code word. When, of course, the link here is that the linear monom of f is of this form, is in the footprint, and the degree is up to d. Okay, we also proved that for every Also, proved that for every value, every number like this is realized as a code word weight with these restrictions, of course, on the AIs. Then we determined the second lowest value for numbers like this, which I call S2. And this value, of course, served as an upper bound for the next minimum weight because it's not the minimum distance and is realized as a code word weight and is the minimum. A code word rate and is the minimum, the second minimum value of numbers like this. Then we determine the set of leading monomers for which this number is equal to the minimum distance. So this script L is the set of leading monomers such that this number is equal to the minimum distance. And we prove that if a polynomial has the leading monomial in the set L and this set F1 to Fn. This set F1 to Fn and F is a Bregnet basis for the ideal, then the weight of the code word is the minimum distance. So for a polynomial to produce a cold word with weight greater than the minimum distance and less than S2, it should have a leading monomial in L, but this set should not be a Grammy basis, should not be a Grammy basis. Be a granular basis. And after some work, we were able to determine properties of the leading monomial of a certain polynomial G, which is in this ideal, which showed that in the case where we take this D written like this with L distant from one, then we have that the weight of the code word is at least S2. So we showed that there are no code words. We showed that there are no code words with weight greater than S1 and less than S2. So, the idea here: first, when I calculated the minimum distance, the number of points in this area was a lower bound for the weight of the code word. But now we have that this set is not a global basis. So, we found another polynomial whose reading monomial is inside the 3D monomial is inside the footprint, and now we have a new lower bound for the weight of the code word. And this lower bound was already greater or equal than S2. So that's how we did this. Again, extending ideas from Mobiola, which extended ideas from Togo. Okay, so now let's talk about generalized Hamilton's. So in 1991, Victor Wey introduced the important concept. Victor Wey introduced the important concept of earth generalized Hammingweight of a code, C. So let D be a subspace of C. The support of this subspace is just the set of positions where there is some m double in D with a non-entry zero, a non-zero entry in that position. Okay, so for R from one to the dimension of C, the R generalized. Of C, the earth generalized Hamming rate of the code is the minimum of the size of the supports of subspaces which have dimension R. This is the R generalized Hamiweight, the minimum of the size of the supports of subspaces of dimension R. Okay, so for example, if R is one, so you have a subspace of dimension one is just a multiple of a code word. Of course, the size of the support is just the weight of the. Size of the support is just the weight of the code word, you are taking the minimum. So the first generalized honeyweight is just the minimum distance. So it's a certain way is a generalization of this concept of minimum distance. And in a series of PhD theses, which were supervised by Professor Raphael Vigariel, tools from Grandman Basis theory were applied together with new concepts which the students and collaborators introduced to Students and collaborators introduced to study the generalized Hamming weights of several types of evaluation codes. And this started with the thesis of Judico Pitonis, a very important thesis, which received the Weizmann Prize of Mexican Academy of Science, best thesis in STEM area. So very nice. In her thesis, we find these concepts of minimum distance function and footprint function. And footprint function defined for ideals, which can be used to study the minimum distance of projective evaluation codes. I'm not saying much about projective evaluation codes, but these are evaluation codes where you evaluate homogeneous polynomials of a certain degree in the points of the projective space. So here she used this tool to study the minimum distance, which of course is, let's say, it's a first case. Of course, is let's say it's the first case of generalized hummingweights, and her colleague Carlos Vivalis made a thesis where he introduced the concepts of generalized minimum distance function and generalized footprint function defined for ideals, which can be used to study generalized Hammer rates of projective evaluation codes. And in the thesis of Delio Haramijo, which is still ongoing, Which is still ongoing, he defined the generalized minimum distance function in a way slightly different from the various version, in a way that enables him to study generalized Hamming weights of affine evaluation codes. This type of codes I'm treating here in this talk. So all these thesis, they produced many papers with many collaborators. I will present some ideas and very few results of a 2021 paper by Daniel, Maria Vaspintu, and Rafael. Maria Vaspinto and Rafael Isarreal, where the footprint plays an important role. So, recall that the earth generalized handing weight is the minimum of the size of the support of subspaces of C of dimension R. Okay, so again, we have X as a subset of the affine space, I sub X. Now, I didn't use this before, but now I will use that I sub X is a radical idea. Is a radical idea, and this is because Fq is a perfect field and we have univariate square-free polynomials in this ring for all variables. So this guarantees that isobx is a radical ideal. And I use this to guarantee that I have the equality here, equality between the size of the variety of isobx, which is the number of points of x, and the size of the footprint. Okay? And also, And also, this is also holds for ideals like this, i sub x plus j. This is also a radical ideal for the same reasons I just mentioned. So for any ideal j, we have that the size of this variety is equal to the size of this footprint. Okay, okay, so we are talking, we have this evaluation morphism, and which is an isomorphism. And so we take a subspace of this quotient ring and we This quotient ring and with call C the image of the subspace using phi. Okay, so for R from one to the dimension of L, let this L sub R be the set of subsets of L of cardinality R, which are linearly independent subsets. So we have these subsets of L, all of them have cardinality R, and they are linearly independent. So of course, they generate subsets. So, of course, they generate subspaces of dimension R. So, for F, one of these sets, denote by this symbol the ideal in the polynomial ring generated by special representatives of the classes of the elements in capital F. We will assume that this idea is generated by the standard representatives of the classes in F. So, what are these standard representatives? Recall that the Standard representatives. Recall that the classes of the footprint form a basis for this quotient ring as a vector space. So we may assume that any class of a polynomial is generated, it has a representative, which is just sum of the monomials in the footprint, possibly, of course, multiplied with coefficients. So I will assume that this idea is generated by these representatives. Okay, we have this equality. Have this equality between this size of this variety and this footprint, and the size of this variety is just the number of points in X, which are common zeros of all generators of this ideal. Okay, so if I take the number, total number of points minus the size of this footprint, this is just the number of points of x which are Of points of x which are not zero of at least one generator of this ideal, which is the same thing as saying that they are not zero of at least one class in this capital F. So this is exactly the support. This number is the support of the space generated by the classes in F, because of course a point is not in the support if and only if it's a common zero of all generators of the subspace. The subspace of the subspace. So, this is the size of the support. So, we have that the R generalized Hamming weight is the minimum of this, where I let this F run in the set L sub R. Or equivalently, we may write that the Rth generalized Hemiweight is the number of points of X, which I represent by the occasionality of this footprint. By the occasionality of this footprint minus the maximum of the cells. Okay, and this is an important equality that they prove early in the paper and they use many times in the paper. Of course, these results are important for the theory, but in practice, it's hard to determine because again, it's hard to determine the determine the... Oh, I'm sorry, there's a missing bar here. It's hard to determine the size of this footprint. Okay, not to say the mass. Okay, not to say the maximum. But anyway, so the authors introduced the earth footprint function, which is easier to determine. So observe that given a subset here, a set F of composed of R classes, which are linearly independent, we can use Gaussian elimination, so to speak, on the R standard representatives of elements of F, and we may assume that they're leading homonyms. May assume that their leading homonyms are distinct. So, this leads to the idea to consider the set which I call M sub R composed by sets of R distinct monomials in the footprint, all of which, of course, are leading monomials of standard representatives of classes in L, so which produces our code. So, we consider the Code. So we consider the set composed of sets of R distinct monomials in the footprint, which are the leading monomials of standard representatives of classes in L. So they define the Rth footprint function like this. Take the number of points in X or the classinality of this footprint minus this maximum. So here we have the footprint of a certain ideal. Here's the monomial ideal, which is generated by all the leading monomes. generated by all the leading monomials in I sub X plus the monomial I do generated by this represent by these monomials in the footprint which appear as leading monomials of representatives of classes. Okay so this is very similar to what I had done before because when I was talking about affine cardes and codes I mentioned that the points in this here the number of points here they serve as a Here they serve as a lower bound for the weight of the code word. So now it's a similar situation. Let's say, for example, R is three, then we have three monomules in N. So all the points in this region, they are exactly the number of points of the difference between this footprint and the footprint of this, where these three monomers belong to a certain n. So if you take So, if you take this maximum, it takes this number minus this maximum, probably will be a lower bound for the RF generalized Hemingway, and that's exactly what they prove. Okay, so this is just some results which involve footprints. But if you look at their paper, you will see that maybe my presentation is a bit different because in the paper they use the concept of degree of a quotient rate. Of degree of a quotient ring. So when the ideal has them, I don't want to define degree, but when the ideal has dimension zero, which is the same thing as saying when the footprint of the ideal is finite, then the degree of the quotient ring is equal to the dimension of the quotient ring seen as a vector space, which of course is equal to the cardinality of the footprint. So we can use this. Indeed, the same holds for the degree of this potion ring. Of this portion drink. So, the presentation here is a bit different, but I just wanted to show how you can look at their paper as an application of footprints. But of course, in the paper, there are many other results. For example, they provide several examples of the application of the theory. It's just not a bunch of theoretical results. For example, you can take X to be explicitly this criteria. Explicitly, this Cartesian product, which is called the fine torus. So we know that the ideal of this set is generated by these polynomials. So now we take D to be a number between 0 and N, and we let L be the FQ subspace generated by classes of monomials which belong to the footprint and are square free. And are square free. And we collected these monomers of degree from zero up to d. So take L to be the space generated by these square-free monomials, which are in the footprint and have degree up to D. They call the code, which is the image using phi of this space. They call this code square-free evaluation code of degree D. Okay, to calculate the minimum distance, they use that inequality. Use that inequality they had just proved. And of course, here, what is the FP1 is the size of this footprint minus this maximum. So here we have the footprint of this ideal and here is composed of just one holiday, just one monumental. So, and we may rephrase this as being the minimum, the minimum of this difference. And of course, And of course, if you consider D to be zero, you have just one monomial possible, which is one. If you consider D to be one, besides one, you have x1 and x2. If you consider just two variables, if you consider d to be two, you can add the monomer x1 times x2. You don't have x1 squared or x2 squared. Just add x1 times x2. And now you have to calculate this number, which is the number of points in the footprint, the original footprint, minus. The original footprint minus the number of points in the footprint which are not multiple of the leading monomials of Ix plus this monomial. So for example, if you consider the monomial to be x1 times x2, this difference is exactly the number of points in blue here. So it's really, it's not difficult to calculate the number of these points if you have a monomial of degree t, which is a square of. t which is a square free is just a product of t variables always to the power one and then this difference is just let's say q minus one minus one for each variable which appears times q minus one minus zero for the other variables which do not appear so this is this is how you calculate this difference and the footprint is the minimum of this so the footprint function so the minimum is of this So the minimum distance of this number is attained when t equals d, and they prove that this is actually the value of the minimum distance. Now, of course, the paper deals with generalized honeyweights, so they go on to calculate the second generalized honeyweight of this code, which, of course, you have to do many more calculations, but they succeed. And after some pages, Some pages they call it the second Heming distance, the second generalized Heming weight of this code, of course, using all the tools that I have presented before, which were applications of results from grammar basis theory and especially footprints. Okay, okay, so now let me say something about other types of applications which now I Of applications, which now I will treat the case of dual of evaluation tokens. Okay, so this is another interesting application of footprints. For example, in this 2021 paper by Iran Lopis, Ivan Supronov, and Rafael Gujariel, they present their results on dual codes using footprints. So, given a code, C, a code is just, we know, just a subspace of FQ to the M. Of course, you can call. Space of FQ to the M. Of course, you can consider the dual of the code, which is the dual that we learn in linear algebra, which is just a set of or the space of M-tuples, which when you do the inner product of this M-tuple with all the M-tuples of the code, you get zero. So the usual definition of dual. So this is the dual code. Okay, so again, let X be a subset of the affine space. You have this evaluation morphism. You have this evaluation morphism, which we know is an isomorphism. You take a subspace L. So now let's assume that subspace L, which the code will be the image, is a FQ vector space generated by the classes of F1, F2, up to Ft. Okay, okay. Now let's consider this set, L perp, which is the set of classes of the quotient space where Space where for which the representative satisfies this equality here. Okay, you may show that this equality is well defined, doesn't depend on the representative you choose. You may also show that this is a NFQ vector subspace, and may also prove that the code associated to this subspace is exactly the dual of the code associated to L. Code associated to L. Okay, so they prove that the dual of the evaluation code also may be seen as an evaluation code. Okay, and of course, since phi is an isomorphism, there exists a polynomial such that phi of this polynomial is one of those vectors in the standard basis of Fq to D M. So, for example, this is. So, for example, this sub i is a vector whose entries are all zero, except in the i-th position position, there is a one. So, for every standard vector, for every vector of the canonical basis, you have a polynomial which such that phi of the class of this polynomial is this vector of the canonical basis. And when you take a representative for this class, where is where is Whereas all the monomials of this polynomial belong to the footprint, which I said, I already mentioned that is possible. They call this F, this polynomial, a standard indication function for PI. And also they define a monomial in the footprint to be essential if it appears in every indicator function. Okay. So then they prove the following result. Let M be the greatest. Let M be the greatest monomial in the footprint. You assume that M is essential. Okay, now let us consider two subspaces, L1 and L2, two subspaces of the quotient ring, which are generated by classes in two subsets of the footprint. So you consider gamma1 and gamma2, two classes, two subsets in the footprint. You take L1 and L2 to be the spaces generated by the classes. Spaces generated by the classes of these monomers in gamma one and gamma two. Assume that gamma one and gamma two are such that the sum of the sizes is the size of the footprint. So in a way, they have complementary size. And that monomial, which is the greatest, and we also we assume that is essential, is not the product of a monomial in gamma one times a monomial in gamma two. So under these assumptions, the codes. Under these assumptions, the codes phi L2 associated to L2 and the dual code of phi of L1 are monomially equivalent. This means that they are isomorphic, but not only isomorphic, that there is an isomorphism which takes a code word of a certain degree to a code word of the same degree. So there is an isometry, isomorphism, which is an isometry between the code. The code associated to L2 and the dual code associated to L1. So, this is a very nice result. In a paper of 2020, in which the authors, which are Iran Lopes, Greg Matthews, and Ivan Toponov, they treat the case where X is a Cartesian product, just like I was treating before. They prove, I mean, among many other results, that if one takes L1 to be L1 to be the subspace generated by the classes of a certain set of holomions, gamma1, in the footprint, then a basis for the dual of the code associated to L1 may be obtained from the complementary set of monomials gamma 2. So you take the complementary sets. Of course, the gamma 1 and gamma 2 will satisfy that. But here you didn't have any hypothesis about being complementary. Hypothesis about being complementary, but here, yeah, here they show that if you take L1 to be the space generated by the class of monomials, which are in a certain set of the footprint, you take the complementary set, and then from this, you may get a basis for the dual of the code generated by or associated to this subspace L1. In 2021, Eduardo Campus. 21 Eduardo Campus, Eduardo Campus, Iran Lopez, Grashi Matthews, and Elizio Sarbiento. Again, treating the case where X is a Cartesian product, they studied codes file fail, where L is generated by the classes of a set containing the footprint, a set of monomers, with the property that if you take a monom in the set and there is another monom in the footprint, which divides the monomial which is in the set, then the monomium In the set, then the monomial in the footprint is also in the set. So if you take a subset of the footprint with this property and you take L to be the space generated by the classes of these monomials, you take C to be the image of this subspace using phi, the code that you'll be paying, they call decreasing monomial Cartesian codes. Okay, and Okay, and so they prove that the dual of a decreasing monomial Cartesian code is monomially equivalent to a decreasing monomial Cartesian code, which is determined by the set of monomials in the complementary set, again, of gamma. So, this is also a very nice result. For example, you take x to be this Cartesian product, f7 times f7. So, we know that. So we know that the ideal of X is generated by these polynomials. And assume that L is generated by classes of the monomials in red. So here we have a picture of the footprint. So this, if you take the set of these monomers, which are depicted in red, you will see that given a monomial, for example, this monomial, all others that divide this monomial. Divide this monomial are also part of the set of red monomules, so to speak. So this is within the hypothesis. So assume that L is generated by the classes of these monomules. So they show that the code, which is the blue of the code of the subspace generated by these monomules, is monomially equivalent to a code obtained from the monomulus in blue. So you consider first. In blue. So you consider first the monomials in the complementary set from the monomials of the complementary set. You obtain these monomules. Please watch this axis here. So from these monomers, you take this set of monomers, which are 1, x1, x2, x1, tax x2. Okay. And so now using these monomers, you obtain a code which is. You obtain a code which is monomally equivalent to the dual of the code generated by the classes of this monomus. So, this is very nice. I took this picture from their paper. Okay. Okay, so I know that there are some authors of these papers in the audience, and I don't want them to maybe are afraid that other people in the audience will think that I presented them. Audience will think that I presented the main results of their paper. So, let me state very clearly that this is not the case. The results I presented here are necessarily not the main results and certainly not the main results of these papers. There are just some few results which I presented, which, in my opinion, use the footprint in an important way. Okay, but if you want to know, really know about what the papers are, you have to go and look in the papers, and of course, maybe there are also. And of course, maybe there are other people here in the audience which have authored papers which used footprint and I didn't mention, so I apologize. Of course, there are a plethora of other papers which deal with footprints and which, of course, I didn't have the time to mention here. For example, in a paper together with Maria Char and Luciano Poz, we used properties of the footprint to calculate the number of rational points in affine curves related to a tau. Curves related to a tower of function fields. And we also determine the dimension and a bound for the minimum distance of certain evaluation codes associated to these curves. So you have a series of function fields, and of course you have a series of curves associated to them. We calculated the number of the rational points of these curves, of the affine curves associated to this curve, of these curves. And then we produced codes. We calculated the bounds for the minimum distance. Calculate the bounds for the minimum distance, but I didn't have time to say anything about this. But of course, I will present the references of the papers that I mentioned here. And you may look in the references of the references I present here. You will see plenty of other papers that use footprints in an important way to prove their results. So these are the references of the papers I mentioned. Of the papers I mentioned, specifically mentioned in this talk. So I thank you very much, Muches, Gracias, Gracias Porvenir. Thank you very much for your patience. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much, Titoro, for your nice talk. I'm wondering if there are any questions, remarks, or the like. Folks, speak up. Yeah, so I have a kind of general question. Do you know in which cases is the lower bound on the minimum distance by the footprint sharp and when not? If I consider, for example, the BCH bound, kind of the codes that have Codes that have the highest known minimum distance are usually the ones that exceed the BCH bound, even if they are cyclic codes. So can you say something in that direction? In which cases do you have a Schau bound and how does this bound from the footprint compare to say kind of absolute bounds? Yeah, actually, the idea. Yeah, actually, I don't know any papers that deal with this problem, although this has occurred to me for time to time. But what happens is that many instances, people study a very specific code. So, and many instances where the footprint bound is actually the minimum distance. Then we say, okay, so let's. Then we say, okay, so let's publish this. So there are very specific results. Sometimes it has crossed my mind from time to time to make, as I did here, but make a collection of results and try to see maybe a pattern there or at least some patterns so we can really try to determine a class of codes where you could have this. Where you could have this equality. But so far, this has not been done. Although it's a very interesting problem. Yeah. So many trick problems. You mentioned these codes from towers or function fields. Do you know what the situation is there? Yeah, from towers. No, I don't know because in fact, this is the only paper I know that deal with these two concepts, towers of function fields and footprints of ideals. Footprints of ideal. I consider talking more about this because maybe because of the students, too, because there is not much done about that. I have done some research about other papers that would use this, but I think there's many good problems to study there. Really, yeah. Very interesting. Very interesting. Yeah, thank you very much. Any further things? Maybe I may ask you something that always crosses my mind when I see things like these codes treated and minimum distance and so on. I'm wondering, are you aware of any attempts where people have taken this into the ring and modules related coding theory? Yeah, no, really, I don't know. So, really, I don't know. So, maybe Jay would maybe say something about this, but really, I don't know anything about this. Yeah. But you know, this is also something that sometimes cross my mind, especially when I meet James in the conferences, which unfortunately we didn't meet in person this time, but he always gives very nice talks and sometimes describes. Nice talks and sometimes this crossed my mind about the because you know there's a there's a very nice theory of grammar bases using rings and modules and yeah yeah I think this this this there's also room for for research there I think so too yeah any further remarks other things if not I think oh a chat question hold on Oh, a chat question. Hold on. Let me just open the chat. Ah. Footprint theory is also developed in the rank metric case or over finite rings. Well, that was my question. Yeah, over rings, it's known, but I know, I mean, the theory of Webland basis has extension, but I don't know of any application of this, for example, in rank metric case. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know. I really don't know. So maybe this is also something that could be done. Yeah. Or network coding, things like that. I talked briefly about with Leo Storm years ago, obviously, but we didn't go on. And so, but I think probably that something could be done. That would go in theory, for example. Sure. Yeah, very good. Yeah, very good. Yeah, then let me thank the speaker again. And we have time for a little break of three, four minutes. And then
