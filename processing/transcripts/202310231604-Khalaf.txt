I'm going to talk today about some recent results that I'm very excited about. And it's in a sense about a new perspective about an old problem, which is quantum Hawaii's kernels. But I will show you that actually, if we want to understand anything quantitatively about these non-trivial charge excitations in the context of Maury systems, it's much better to think in terms of this new perspective. And I've been kind of, since this is a diverse audience, I was kind of unsure what aspects of this problem I should focus about because there is, I have some results that are relevant to Morris systems, but also some interesting analytical techniques to find these solutions that I think are interesting of their own. And I decided to kind of have a talk that would cover both, but in order to But in order to orient everyone, I will start by just a brief synopsis that summarizes all the points I want to talk about. So you can think of it as a mini talk, first like a five-minute mini talk before my actual talk. So let me start the mini talk now. So the motivation is the following. So numerous systems, we have flatbands. In many cases, these flatbands are topological. Are topological, and when we've got strong interactions in a topological flat band, we generically, at least under some conditions, get some flavor ferromagnets. And this has already been discussed in some of the previous talks. Now, we can ask the question, what happens when we load charge into a topological thermomagnet? And the obvious answer is that we add an electron or hole, but there is also a non-obvious answer, which is that you can, these electrons are. Answer, which is that you can, these electrons and holes could bind to electron-hole pairs to form more complicated excitations. And is there a general reason why we would expect that to be the case? There's actually two perspectives, and both of them give you a reason why you expect some non-trivial charge excitations. The first is the quantum skirmian perspective, which is that if you form skirmish textures in these bands, these will carry a charge, just comes from the top. Will carry a charge, that just comes from the topology. So there is at least a possibility that these are the lowest energy charge excitation. But the second perspective, which actually I will focus on on this talk, which helps us access the microscopics better, is that electron holes pairs in a topological band turn out to have a dipole moment. So if I have a charge and I have a dipole moment in a relatively flat band, it's conceivable that for a range of parameters they will form atomic scope. For a range of parameters, they will form a wrong score. And so, the main goal of my talk is to answer this question: under what conditions do we get such excitations, and what are the microscopics of them? So, what are the energetics, the wave functions, the possible phases they can form? And I will focus on this second perspective because it allows me to access the microscopics rather than thinking of excitations as long wavelength patterns that average over latitudes. Average over lattice features, I want to really account for short distance and lattice and momentum space features. And the approach I will take would be the following. So I will find the limit where I can solve this problem exactly, which means I will find exact wave functions for multiparticle excitations. So they will be charge E excitations that has an arbitrary number of spin flips. I have an arbitrary spin. And then I will show that these wave functions work very well as a variation. That these wave functions work very well as variational states away from detriment. And I will compare these variational energies to the exact single particle energies that can be obtained from Hardy-Fock. And in the limit of it, in the parameter regimes where these variational energies are lower than the single particle excitations, I can deduce with some confidence that these are actually that at least the the lowest charge excitation in this system has to be non-trivial. System has to be monitored. And the way I present things, this is kind of very general, you can apply to any Mori system of your choice, although this was mostly motivated by Twisted Pileographene. So let me just briefly review how this question is relevant to Twisted Pileographene. And I'll say more details later. But in Twisted Palerographene to apply this picture, which is of this flavor ferromagnets, there is Flavor ferromagnets, there is an important caveat to take into account, which is that strain plays an important role. So the picture that I will present is mostly applicable for low-strain samples. These are the samples where, both from theory and some hints from experiment, that there is gap ferromagnets at almost all integer films. Now, in the realistic stream limit for Realistic stream limit for at least most samples, it seems that the kind of states you get are different, where you will get a gap in semi-metal at charge neutrality and you'll get gap in commensurate spirals away from neutrality. And some recent STM work, recent very beautiful STM work from Alias-Denny's group has kind of gave strong evidence to this picture, where in low-strain regions of their sample, they observe gaps. Sample, they observe gaps at neutrality, at least strong gaps at neutrality and also other integers, while in the typical strain region, they observe gap with semi-method of neutrality and incontinence. And since, of course, ultimately we want to understand the strain case very well, but it's much easier to think of the low strain case in theory. So, this at least is the first step we have to understand first before moving the strain. We have to understand first before moving the strain. It makes us in not a very easy position when we want to compare directly to experiments. So I will, but we can just try. And in fact, if we consider transport samples and want to compare any of our results to these transport samples have to have at least an indication that they have no strength. And one such Strain. And one such an indication if there's a gap of neutrality. And this turns out to be the case in the samples from GMA ephetos group. At least there's two samples that show clear isolated gap of neutrality. So these are the ones where there may be some confidence in comparing the results. But we have to keep in mind that with only two samples we don't have enough systematics. It's just something experiment experimentals have to produce more more low string samples in order More low-strained samples in order for us to understand this more. But just if we think of low-strain samples, when we start doping any integer, doping away from integer filling, there is actually a feature which is that there's a strong asymmetry between hole doping and electron doping around any integer, where usually you get indications of quasi-particles when you dope away from neutrality, of light quasi-particles when you dope away from neutrality, and when you Look away from neutrality and when you look towards neutrality. And this feature seems to be common between strained and unstrained samples. So it's one of the most robust observations and disorder strain, right? Random strains. No, these are, well, I'm talking more about heterostra, uniaxial heterostring. This is what most of these words, when they say string, that's what they mean. Say string, that's all they mean. There's also this order of strain. Yes, okay. So that's something that, in theory, at least in the low string case, it's kind of understood why you get this asymmetry. And in experiments, it seems you get it in both cases. So what I will... The main result I will show you is that on the heavy side, there is this strong instability towards, like when you dope electrons, they don't really enter electrons, they like to form a Really enter in vectors. They like to form a bound state with some particles in the vectors. And the possible relevance of this to the phase diagram of TBG would be if you look for in the low strain samples on the heavy doping side. Now, it's known that in the strain samples, when you dope away from neutrality, you usually, the superconductivity usually appears at minus 2, minus epsilon. That's the strongest superconducting lobe. Away, however, in the Away, however, in the low-strain samples, which we don't have a lot of them, it doesn't seem very clear where superconductivity precisely appears. If we believe these are really low-strain samples, there is several domes that appear in many places. But in both of these cases, there is a prominent dome that appears on the heavy side. So here, there is a prominent dome that appears at minus 2 plus epsilon. And here, there is a prominent dome that appears at 2 minus epsilon. 2 minus epsilon. And although this superconductor may seem weaker than the superconductor at minus 2 minus epsilon, if you look at it in terms of critical field, it's actually the superconductor that has the highest critical field. So this is the field data for the same sample. So this is just saying that the statement that superconductivity only appears on the light side is mostly based on typical string samples, but for these few samples which also show gapper neutrality, it seems superconductivity could appear on both. Yes. This one is something also has a team gate. Well, so one has a very closed gate and the other has the gate is further away. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, you know, there's very few samples that I could do. Question? Yeah. So, low and high strain, is it based on measurements of strain? Strain is it based on measurement of strain above certain percentages high, below certain percentages? Yeah, so so the yeah, yeah, when you say low and high strain, so usually what people mean is that so there is a transition between the ferromagnet strong coupling states and these intervalle cyclase spirals, and this happens around point I think 0.3% or 0.4% straight. So that's based on calculations. That's based on calculations, and yes, and in experiment, and it's Yes. And in experiment, and it seems to match what they have seen in STM. Because in STM you can actually characterize strain by just looking at where the atoms are. So when you say strain, this is like uniaxial strain. It's heterostrain. It's uniaxial heterostrain, which means the two layers are strained different relative to each other. Okay. And so why is it you said there's two samples there, right? Samples there. Yeah, why is samples from Ethiop supposedly low strain? No, no, no, I'm just saying, why can't he make 100 and he went that way? Oh, why can't he? Well, I think he has more samples that weren't published. But also, his method, which supposedly produces less strain, also produces less yield because they try to get rid of they try to iron the samples, but this makes them this can sometimes make them. This can sometimes make them lock back to being aligned, so he loses the angle because you also need to get the right angle. But yeah, I think that's the question of why advisors don't know more. Because first, I don't think experimentalists publish all their samples, they just move us through the article. And second, there is only one lab that seemingly produces those three samples. And STM in their rare regions, and they have seen. And they they have seen them, but they haven't completely characterized them. But just a point I want to say is the following: that the superconductor, there seems to be indication that superconductors could appear on the heavy side, and that the superconductor, if it appears on the heavy side, it's actually a very exotic superconductor because on the light side, this superconductor appears out of the Fermi surface. There's an indication that there is a Fermi surface. There's an indication that there is a Fermi surface, and having a lot of a Fermi surface may be not very well understood and twisted by a graphene, but it's not extremely surprising. But on the heavy side, when we don't have direct indication for positive particles, it is surprising to get superconductivity. So this would be kind of the more exotic superconductor. Now, what I will show you in this lecture, and this talk is not related to superconductivity, I will just show you that on the heavy side, the spin polar run or sperm excitation. The spin polar run or sperm excitations are the lowest energy chart excitations, which makes the superconductors that appear on the heavy side a candidate, a possible candidate for a spermian superconductor. Yeah. What's known about the moment state experimentally? Or which superintendent? Meaning these two samples? Yeah. What more, like you mean at two or at zero? No, near two minus. No, two min minus two plus two. So so these normal states uh they are they they I mean in these two they have at least some activation gaps and uh Landelphan has the same degeneracy. It's like the two-fold degeneracy that you get on the side in which you see the state. I'm talking ah the normal state here. Yeah. I don't think much is known, like but Much is known, but there's not like other APGs sometimes. There is no Lambda fan. So that is known. There is no fan that goes this direction. So this region where you see the superconductor, there is no Lambda fan. But usually there's a lambda fan that comes sort of neutrality. Yeah, there is no Lambda fan coming out of 2 in this direction. So it only comes in one direction. So like regular DBG something, there's a line of ideas. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, here it's not very clear because there is also an intervening state. So you could ask the question whether the state, whether it's coming, whether the superconductor is coming out of both the mu plus two state or out of the neutrality state. Is that known experimentally? No, I don't think that's. So this is kind of my mini talk, now to my actual talk. So the start of the story is we have some flat topological bands in the Moray system. And now I'm thinking very generally, I'm going to specialize later to some systems. The first observation is that because we have, because value is a good quantum number, we can split these bands into two values. But because time is Into two valleys. But because time-reversal symmetry connects the valleys but doesn't really act within a valley, the bands in each valley are allowed to have some turnomins, some monster churn numbers. So that's how you usually get topology in this system. Now, if this is one of these twisted TMDs, we have strongly broken time reversal symmetry, so there's no symmetry that ensures there's degeneracy of bands in each value, so we just get one band here and one band there. We just get one band here and one band there. If we are in a generic graphene system like Bernal on Bernard, Bernal twisted on Bernal or monolayer twisted on Bernal or these multi-layers on HBM, then we usually have just degeneracy due to spin. So we have two bands here and two bands there. And that's generally due to protein C2 C two symmetry. But in twisted bilar graphene we have the extra ingredient but we also have C two symmetry which gives us extra degeners. Which gives us extra to generate. So we get eight bands rather than four bands. And there is a way to decompose these also into two transactors, but they are now related by the C to T rather than by time reverse extension. But the main upshot of this whole thing is that we can, at least a leading approximation, think that we have a system of two M bands that are split into opposite churn sectors who that approximate U M times U M symmetry. Sometimes you m symmetry. And for different systems, you can have m equals 1, 2, or 4. Now, next, we want to add interactions to these bands. And the standard way is just to consider projecting some interactions, usually screen coulomb interaction, and defining these band projected operators, rho q, which are usually defined relative to some reference. For example, in twisted biography, we define them relative to choice neutral. Charging travels and kind of thing. And I just want to say that this is an interaction-only Hamiltonian. And of course, for people who have been working with this, it's very obvious that this is a non-trivial interaction. But for someone, for example, who just knew about how you have a density-density interaction in a lattice model, usually the density operators on different sites commute, which means that an interaction-only model could be trivial. But in this case, the main non-triviality of this model. In this case, the main non-triviality of this model comes from the fact that the different density operators do not convene. But it turns out that although this is a very non-trivial Hamiltonian, it's frustration-free at integer fillets. And what this means is that although these density operators don't commute, they have a common set of eigenfunctions or of eigenstates at integer fillings. And these sets are these generalized ferromagnets, where you take one band completely filled, and the other One band completely filled, and the other band and all other bands, so you take a subset of bands to completely fill, and all the other bands are empty. And the diamond functions are related to the filling, and all diamonds values are related to the filling, and also to the charge density of the filled bands. Yes. What is this G and NOG? I know, but delta Q G. Oh, so you mean it's okay? Ah, yeah, this is this is this. Ah yeah, this means that because the density is a periodic function, it will only have. So the question I'm interested in is the nature of multiparticle excitations in this system. And in the limit we've taken where we have this Un times Unsymmetry, there's actually a few simplifications we can make. The first one is that in this problem, we have a conservation of particle and whole numbers independently. And you can think that example you can think of. And you can think, the example you can think of is if you have a ferromagnet with Se2 symmetry, in addition to the conserved, and you're looking at excitations on top of it, the excitations carry a spin, that is, but the SZ is conserved, in addition to the charge, but a spin-flip excitation is just an electron and hole. And this would give you a conservation of the numbers of particles and holes separately. This means we can just classify the Hilbert space by the number, the Hilbert space of excitations. By the number of the Helper space of excitations on top of ferromagnet, by the number of particles and holes. And the Silver space dimension scales, if we are a system with n psi, with n unit cells, scales n to some power, to the sum power of these numbers. This implies that, for example, the case of three holes plus one, two holes plus one particle can actually be solved by brute force. And that's the problem we have worked out in this work. In this paper, also, there is a similar. There is a similar paper from Bernovic and Oscar, which studied this problem. What does that condition depend on? Conservation of particle number? Yes, so actually this here, well, this here would follow from Um times Um symmetry, but you can do it under a weaker condition, which is just if the ferromagnet is an exact eigenstate of all. Eigen state of all the Roche operators. If the ferromagnet is an exact eigenstate of all Roque operators, you get a conservation. You get this conservation of orphans and all sound. Because you act with the interaction, which is a density density. You commute the density. So this is an excitation that has C daggers and C's. Every time you commute the density operator with a C or a C dagger, you get another C or C dagger. You get another C or C dagger, you never create a pair, and then the density operator acting. So, when it goes through all the way, when it acts on the Hamiltonian, it just gives you a number. When it acts on the thermomagnet state, it just gives you a number. So, yeah. So, you have a state that looks like, and here there's some ferromagnet, and you're acting with rho q, rho minus q. So, you can act with rho q. With rho q by commutation with each of these until you hit this one. Now the commutator of rho q c dagger gives you another c dagger. So scale is k plus q. So the only place where you could generate particle whole pairs is when this hits the ferromagnet at the end. That would generally happen if the ferromagnet is not a common eigenfunction of all these operations. But if it is, then the action of rho Q and the ferromagnet. Then the action of rho Q and the ferromagnet just gives you a number times the ferromagnet. Is it clear or can I? I can see this true for one particle, you know, single particle hole pairs for arbitrary number of particle hole pairs. Anyway, yeah. Anyway, yeah, yeah, we'll go ahead and discuss it more here. There's two other simplifications. One of them is that you can just, then you can show that it's always energetically favorable to put all the holes in one band and all the electrons in one band because this minimizes the repulsion because of fermionic anti-symmetry. So if you have your fixed number of electron number of volts, it's just among all configurations, the ones we're going to have. Among all configurations, the ones where you put all particles in one band, all walls in one band is the minimum. The second argument, the second simplification is that it's actually more favorable to put all the particles in one churn sector because you can think of, when you put all the particles in one churn sector, you can think of them as a one-hole plus spin flips. But the spin flip or one hole plus particle hole pairs, but the particle hole pairs, first they have a dipole. First, they have a dipole moment in a churn band, and second, they are gapless. So, you can create very cheap particle-level excitations that have a dipole moment and bind them to your particle to lower its energy. But when you're in opposite churn sectors, the particle excitations don't have a dipole moment, and these particle excitations are gap because they feel a net magnetic field, so they have a land-level spectrum that has a large gap. So, it's very difficult to So it's very difficult to get them to bind to an electron to lower its energy. And that's both of these statements are statements you can check explicitly in the maybe problem that has like two volts and non-particles. And it was mentioned in this paper. So all of these simplifications reduce just problem to the problem of an SE2, of looking at these excitations in an SE2 Chern for a matter. So how do we go? So, how do we go about it? I mean, this still remains a big pro a difficult problem because we have this large number of space. In general, the only at least in quantum related problems, the main analytical progress we can make is by pseudo-potential arguments. So, pseudo-potential arguments, just as a brief review, is usually about writing a frustration-free Hamiltonian whose ground state is. Is one of the fractional ground states, for example, the Lawton state. And one way to think of pseudo-potentials as an expansion of a short-range interaction in terms of derivatives of the delta function and just terminating this expansion. So if we terminate this expansion, we can guarantee, for example, if we terminate it at the first non-trivial term, we can guarantee that the one-third left in the state is a zero-moon. And the fact that this is a positive The fact that this is a positive, this is non-negative interaction would guarantee them that this is a ground state. Now, the typical way you apply these arguments for spinful fermions is you have to start from the first, n equals zero doesn't enter because contact interaction or delta function interaction does nothing for spinless fermions because of fermionic anti-symmetry. But for spinful fermions, the contact interaction is actually a non-trivial potential. And this was already And this was already noted in a paper by Alan constructing Skirmi to the quantum hole problem in 1995. However, because I want to think of particle-hole excitations, I cannot really use the standard form of pseudo-potential arguments because they are always phrased in first quantization. I really need to do things in second quantization. And there has been some there's some work that developed the formalism for pseudo-tensions and second quantization. For pseudo-potentials and segmentalization, but it's extremely complicated in the sense that even the very obvious aspects of pseudo-potentials, like the loftiness state is zero-mode, you need to work really hard to get. So it's not likely that we will get, we'll make a lot of progress by using such an approach. So what I will show you is that actually a different way to do sudo-potential sectorization, which I think is the proper way, which is to use to do pseudo- Which is to do so to do the right operator in second quantization, but not using an orthonormal basis for the bands, which is like, for example, a momentum. But I will use some coherent state basis, which means it's an over-complete basis of non-orthogonal states. But I will show you that this basis is very convenient for this problem. So, in order to do this, I'll assume the bands have this form. This form is. This form is not extremely restrictive, and also because I'm constructing a variation, like some variation of states in some limit, and then I apply it away from that limit. I'm free to do some approximation. But this form is basically just saying that all orbitals have the same momentum. The log states for all orbitals have the same angle, the same momentum depends. But if I assume this form, I can define these band projected coherent state operators. Projected coherent state operators that depend on position R and they're anti-commutators, they're not canonical Fermi operators, instead, they're anti-commutators, give me the band project. And notice that once I define C of R, all the dependence on my choice of parametrization, like basis for my band are done. Because the commutator of C of R is a projector, projector is also basis independent. Now the contact interaction has a nice Interaction has a nice form in terms of these C of R's, which looks like this. And also, when I translate from first quantization to second quantization, I have to write a normal-ordered interaction relative to the Fermi-Mac. So, the nice thing about this form of the Hamiltonian is that it allows us to construct zero modes because if we have an operative, actually, if and only if, so if we can find a state that's under. If we can find a state that's annihilated by all of these m cars, then this is a zero mode, and also zero mode is if and only if it's annihilated. Also, this Hamiltonian is possible. One obvious zero mode of this Hamiltonian is the ferromagnet. So, if I create a state with all down spins, because this annihilates an up spin, it annihilates that spin. But this but this formulation also allows us to create zero zero energy excitations. Zero energy excitations. So these would be created by acting with operators on the thermomagnetic ground state which commute with all of these operators, M of R. For example, one obvious example is just a single hole excitation. So single hole excitations commute with M of R. So they give me zero energy excitations, which is telling me that for this interaction, the whole band is flat. The whole band is flat. But of course, I want to construct some non-trivial excitations. In particular, I want to construct excitations that has n plus 1 holes and n electrons. And I will show you how to construct this first in the Lowest Lander level and then in a more general class of nets. So in the Lowest Land level, the projector has a relatively simple form. This is actually the same as the overlap of two coherent states labeled by complex numbers Z and W. My claim is that this state, that this operator is a zero-mode operator. And I will just sketch the proof. It's quite short proof, actually. So if you commute n and this operator, because the commutator of C and C dagger gives you a projector, what you get is the action of the projector on the lowest lambda level state, but with this extra factor of 1 over z. Now, Now, of course, the actual projector on a Los Land Delaware state does nothing. This is an example, this is a Bergman reproducing kernel. But you can show that the action of the projector on a state that has this extra factor of 1 over z gives you, it has a simple expression, it gives you just this extra shift term, which ensures that the result lies in the Loch Lambda level, that the hole in the denominator is getting. The hole in the denominator is canceled. And using this substituting up, we see that we get two terms. The first one cancels because it's the same operator as one of these operators, and the second cancels because it's a semester. We get zero. Go back to the three previous slides. So it is a fair magnet, but uh it's not a free state. It's not a Gaussian free state, because uh they it satisfy the canonical highlight. Anonymous. Yeah, it's a but but this is but a ferromagnet is a ferromagnet in any way. Like like you're it's uh it's a ferromagnet in these basis, but if you do the basis transformation, it would also get ferromagnet in because you're filling all the available down states. A ferromagnet is uh very compared to talked about before. It's a single straight determinant. This one definitely. This is a single slate determined. Expressed in this language is not obvious, but you can use this expression. You can of o you can use this expression to expand it in the orthonormal basis and you'll find this later determined. But then the P on the next slide isn't the same as this P. Next slide you have this PZ value. Yeah yeah it's the same as P, just specialized to the Los Random. And it's obvious is it obvious that that P is an idempotent matrix? Yeah, this is okay. This is the form of the lambda level projector of the projector and the lowest lambda level, so it satisfies all the properties of the projector. So p squared is d. P squared. And yeah, if you want to derive it, it's this Bergman kernel identity. So there is a way to compute integrals involving this. We can go through after. But yeah, it's ideal to conclude. I just want to emphasize one point, which is that S operator itself is not a zero mode operator. So what I have done here is I didn't take like a zero mode hole operator and attach a ghost to mode to it. That would be a very trivial excitation. What I have done is that I took a hole and intertwined it with some spin flip to get a zero mode operator. That's an important distinction. But the other But the other distinction is that obviously from this form, we can, it's relatively easy to show that if we take s power n, we can form a state that has an arbitrary spin. So we can add an arbitrary number of spin flips to this excitation. Now, this analysis can be generalized. It's not very hard to generalize it to the case of an ideal band, which means a band that satisfies this trace condition. And these were shown in. And these were shown in a very nice paper by Ji Wang and Jen to have this general form, where basically with the log states for the ideal band are the lowest random loss states times some, these two functions are just, this is a periodic function in momentum space, this is a periodic function in real space, and they are related to each other using some integral transform. And you can understand this beta of k as just related to the deviation to the very curvature from the constant value. From the constant value. And I want to just take the perspective that I'm not really thinking of necessarily expanding around any idealized model like the Chiral model. I'm just thinking of these ideal bandwidth functions as kind of general answers to approximate any churn band I want. So in principle, I can choose this beta of k to best reproduce the very curvature of the band of interest, even if the band is not ideal. Is not ideal. Now, to map this problem to the Lando-Level problem, I define this non-unitary transformation. And it's kind of one or two-line proof to show that if you define this Hamiltonian through this non-unitary transformation, T inverse HT, it has the same zero modes as a lowest lambda level Hamiltonian, which means that if you know the zero mode operator for lowest lambda level, you can always construct. For lowest number level, you can always construct theorem operators for the ITF. So, this has been a bit abstract construction. Like, we still need to translate it to a functions and do calculations, which is related to Lin Lin's question. So, if I want to really do any concrete calculation, I will need to go to some orthonormal basis. And, for example, the simplest one, spin-flip wave function. Wave function, I can label it by one electron momentum and two whole momenta. And I will have to kind of write this expression in terms of the lowest lambda-level block states or the block states of my band of interest. And I just need to be able to simplify this indicator. Of course, if you put the formula with the Jacobi theta or Pei-Schlass function, these are usually complicated expressions, but you can simplify them, and at the end you get an expression. At the end, you get an expression like this. And this can be generalized actually to any number of spin flips. This looks like a very long expression, but really it has just three parts. This first part is the only place where this c parameter enters. This is just the total momentum. This is the wave function for a total momentum as a function of z, which tells you that this c is really a center of mass coordinate of this composite object. Then this part is just to ensure that this wave function has the right bound. This function has the right boundary condition. This part looks really like a factory get an allotted state. So this sigma function is an odd function that vanishes at zero. So we have here the difference between momenta for different electrons, difference between momenta for different holes. And then in the denominator, you have the difference between electron and hole momenta. So a few minutes. Yeah. Now, one subtlety about this wave function is. One subtlety about this wave function is that it has actually a singular it has a singularity whenever a whole momentum is equal in electron momentum. And this is really a real singularity. And it comes from the fact that if you look at this integral, it actually is logarithmically divergence at large r when the electron and hole momenta are equal to each other. Sorry, I'm a bit confused. How can this be both a single statute determinant and an alternate state? This is not a single solid determinant. Well, it's also not a really well but it's not it's definitely not a single state. Just high level, earlier you said that it's frustrating free. One construct a ferromagnetic state. No, the integer, the Hamiltonian at integer filling is frustration-free and I can construct a state of determination. But now I'm writing a different Hamiltonian, which is a contact interaction. So this is true for the contact interaction. It's also frustration-free, but its eigenstates are not. But it's but its item states are not suitable to have this one. I mean if you write it in terms of their usual language which is sum over q v q rho q rho q it will not be visible at all at this time when you have any zero modes. Because vq just vq is a constant for a delta Just we curse a constant for a delta interaction. If you just write the expression, it will not be evident at all that this Hamiltonian has zero points. So the difference between the two is really that we chose a different p so that this becomes a... No, so the statement is: if I take a contact interaction, a delta function interaction, and if I'm in a band that satisfies the trace condition, then it is frustration-free. But it's very non-obvious. But it's very non-obvious if you just stare at it. So you have to go to this basis to see. But I mean, if you really want, you can... And I did this calculation, so you can take this expression and substitute in the expression for the interaction in momentum space with a contact interaction and show that it's the zero mode. But it's a very non-trivial. The transformation you did to get this is pointing to me, right? Yeah, but it's a similar. Yeah, but it's a it's a seminal transformation, so it preserves a spectrum. And actually I only care about the zero energy portion of the spectrum, so that's and these are charge-line excitations. Yes. Now just that's kind of the last important point I want to say, which is that because these wave functions have algorithmic divergence, which comes from really this just that has a power location. This just has a power little tail that in any finite system you have to cut by some colour parameter. Which kind of tells you these are not really bouncing league functions, but they're also not extended, they're like critical league functions. However, if you imagine you deviate away from this contact limit and have like some, for example, stream-coulomb interaction, if there is a bound state, then this bound state is expected. Then this bound state is expected to have a large overlap with the state on one hand. On the other hand, it has finite support, it cannot have these tails. So, a very natural variation on zaps for such a bound state is to take this lambda to be a variational parameter, to take it finite, not equal to the system size. And you can verify it works very nicely that if you look at the variation of energy as a function of lambda, it has a very clear minimum at some finite value. And here I'm comparing, I'm doing the three-party, so The three particles, so n equals one, so two holds in one particle, and I can compare the overlap with the numerically exact wave function. I see an overlap as almost 99%. And you can do this with a screen Cologne as a function of the screening distance. Again, this is something to benchmark against because I can solve this problem exactly. And I see that the variational and exact solutions energies almost match, and the overlap is always non-denignable. And overlap is always 99%. This is parallel model now? Well, this is loose lambda level. I'll do parallel. The upper 99% depends on the system size, right? No. There's no... No, I think it's the... The lack of overlap is not... I don't... Okay, I haven't done the detailed scaling, but I don't remember seeing a dependence on the system size. I think it's kind of a real dependence. It's kind of a real, the adjuster is a one percent piece of the wave function that this variational answer cannot get. I think it has to be on the right. I don't think there is, but that's a good wow, but but okay. So you're saying that the yeah Yeah, I have to think about it. Yeah, I think. The calculation was done with some momentum grid. Yeah, yeah, the calculation was of course done with some momentum grid, and I haven't done the scaling carefully, but there is a catastrophe argument. So that's why I don't know if what's happening is that really I'm always getting... So this wave function is truly close to the other wave function, and there's just a small pair, small region of Meitler space where they miss each other or not. I think the orthogonal catastrophe would be relevant if I'm. Catastrophe would be relevant if I'm considering a large number of spins. But this is, or a large number of particles, this is three particles. So there's no reason to have a similar capacity. Now, I want to discuss how to do multiple spin flips, but I ran out of time, so I'll very briefly just flash something that there's actually an alternative way to write this wave function that is. Function that is more physically transparent. It's a wave function that it's a product of electron hole pairs attached to a hole. And using this wave function, you can actually show that you can write all the overlaps in terms of, you can have some matrix representation of all the overlaps in terms of some traces of some matrices. And you can represent these diagrammatically and map them to the number of partitions of n. Partitions of n. So at the end, there is kind of an efficient way to evaluate these overlaps that allow me to go at least to n equals 20 without problems. And this is the results for multiple spin flips. And also, this variation parameter actually increases as you increase the number of spin flips, as you would expect. So just I want to just show the results for the twisted biography. For the twisted biodiagraphene, so in the chiral limit, when you dope away from neutrality, you don't get a bound state. When you dope towards neutrality, so at neutrality itself, you do get a bound state, but after force and flips. And when you dope towards neutrality, so on the heavy side, you always get a bounce. Away from the chiral limit, you have to account both for the fact that the wave functions change, but also you have extra anisotropies in your manifold that could select different shift states. Could select different shift states. For example, in our original picture, it would select this KIVC state, but also based on the recent experiment and also some calculations from the Oxford group, which suggested that electron-phonon coupling favors this TIVC state. So it must follows I'll be agnostic about what the state is. So I'll try it both for KIVC and for TIVC. And it turns out that actually TIBC is better for these states than KIVC. So if for KIVC I have some Seaman term that Seeman term that wants that disfavors a very large number of spin flips. So at kappa equals 0.3, which is a very small value, I already start losing the bounce state for KIVC. When I go to a more realistic value, the bounce state is lost for the KIVC, but I still get a bounce state for TIVC. And for other fillings, at neutrality, I lose the state at so I lose the state at charge neutrality, but at mu equals one. But at nu equals one, I find that both for KIVC and TIVC. So, hold up in the new equals one state, I always find this bound state. Nu equals three depends on the intellects. So, the kind of the summary is that if I hold open u equals one, I find that always the lowest energy excitation is this variational polar state. When I hold open u equals two, it will be the cheapest excitation if it's TIDC but not. Excitation if it's TIDC but not KIDC. And since recent experiments seem to suggest TIDC, this is kind of supporting the scenario that these actually play an important role also if superconductivity appears on whole doping at the new positive state. So yeah, this is the end of my talk. There's a lot of things you can do in these kinds of states because now I have explicit microscopic. States because now I have explicit microscopic wave functions of these states, so I can study much more microscopically possible pairing between them, superconductivity, or possible other cases they could form. One could also think of the problem of even if polarons are not the lowest charge excitations, can think of them as long-lived metastable states, because in some cases I still get the minimum in this variational energy, even if the polaron is not lower in energy than the electron. And this could have implications. Electron, and this could have implications for the physics because electrons can tunnel into this state. These variation power wave functions seem to be applicable to more general systems. And also, this kind of approach to doing pseudo potentials using this coherent state basis could be also useful, particularly for applications of fractional channeling slaters. Thank you. Okay, so I think we've got a lot of questions. Okay, so I think we've got a lot of questions and we're a bit behind, so maybe we'll just move on to you get it until whether or not it gets connected, you can ask questions. Oh, quick question. What's Geminal be? Actually, that's something that Linlin told me in the last meeting. So Geminil, I think it it means twin. And it comes from the word for twin and uh it's usually these angels in quantum chemistry that tries to get carrying. Tries to get carrying. So they do it where electron-electron pair, but if you just, it turns out that this wave function has a form of a gem and electron-home geminal.
