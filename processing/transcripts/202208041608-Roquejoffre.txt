I'm very grateful to the organisers for inviting me to this conference. And I also very much appreciate the efforts that you're making to allow online talks. And I have to say, it's the first time that I give an online talk and it goes straightforward. There's no incident. So thanks very much for that. So here's the question. I'm looking at a very simple I'm looking at a very simple non-local reaction diffusion equation. u t plus u minus k star u is equal to f of u with an initial datum u0 of x between 0 and 1. The support of u0 is compact and the nonlinearity is as is as on the picture. It's Fischer KPP-like non-linearity. Non-linearity. Okay, the two assumptions that I need are the following. I take it C2. And I'm also asking f prime of u to be less than f prime of 0. So the graph of this function, not only the graph of the function is below the tangent, but the derivatives are less than the derivative at zero. The kernel is non-negative, even compactly supported. Compactly supported with unit mass. Okay, so that's it. That's it. The Cauchy-Ipshi theorem and the maximum principle tell you that you have a smooth solution, as smooth as you want, provided of course that U-naught is smooth. The derivatives can grow exponentially because there's no smoothing effect, but actually they won't. Actually, they won't. And we ask for the behavior when time goes to plus infinity. Okay, so the outline of the talk is the following: I will first tell you about the main result, then I will give you not such a short tour of various occurrences of the model, because I think it's important to tell you that this model, although, of course, it's very well known, but it arises from very, very many fields. Many fields, and if I have time, I will tell you very briefly about some steps of the proof. Okay, so let me start with the main result. Okay, so of course, I guess it's not the first time such an equation is discussed in this talk. So, the picture is very classical. You start from a very slight bump, bump grows and propagates, and eventually the stable state one. The stable set one invades the stable the unstable the unstable set zero and you want to understand at what at what speed okay so the quantity i want to investigate is capital X of t capital X of t is the rightmost point X such that U of T X is equal to one half why not and the main result is the following so I can find two constants C star lambda star C star, lambda star that are positive. They are universal. I mean, in one minute, I'm going to tell you how you can construct them. Such that capital X of t is equal to C star t minus three over two lambda star log t plus some constant x infinity plus little o of one when t goes to plus infinity. And the translation x infinity depends on mu of zero, uh, uh, on initial data. So, uh So, of course, in this expansion, C T is very well known. Minus 3 or 2 land log T is a little less well known, also worth C that it has already occurred in some instances. So, what I want to discuss is this. Okay, so before I discuss this, I have to tell you who C Star and This, I have to tell you who C star and lambda star are. So, once again, it's very classical in Fisher-KPP equations. You linearize the equation around the state zero. So, the equation you obtain is Vt plus V minus K star V is equal to F prime of zero V. You look at the linear waves propagating to the right. So, a linear wave is a solution V of T X of the form exponential minus lambda x minus C T. And you take this exponential minus lambda x minus ct and plug it into the X minus CT and plug it into the linear equation. You get an equation which is not a PD anymore, it's just an equation on numbers. And the unknown is lambda and C is a parameter. And so to see if there are solutions, well, you draw the graph of C lambda minus F from zero. Here are three instances. And you draw the graph of two. graph of two times integral so it's a very very very convex function and you see that if you shoot if you shoot very weakly then you then the graph of the linear function doesn't meet the graph of the of the of the of the exponential let us say if you shoot very strongly you meet at two points as is classical and if you shoot at the at some critical value you meet exactly you need You meet the graph of the exponential at exactly one point. And this critical parameter C, I call it C star, and the corresponding lambda, I call it lambda star. So this is how I construct C star and lambda star. And of course, it's exactly the same construction as in the classical Fischer-KPP equation. And of course, once again, it's not a new construction, it may be now something like. It may be now something like 100 years old. Okay. So I have C star along the star and this strange way of writing the position of the rightmost point where the solution is equal to one half. And so what I want is to discuss this result. But before that, I want to give you a few places where this model occurred. Places where this model occurs. Okay, three items. First of all, the connection with the diffusion of order two. Then I will tell you what I know about branching random works and something that was extremely fashionable two years ago, now very frankly, a little less, is the spatial spread of epidemics. Okay, so let me start with the connection with second-order diffusion. So let me take K here. So let me take K your favorite approximation of identity. One over epsilon rho of x over epsilon and epsilon goes to zero and rho is your is the classical Plateau function. Do a little scaling of time. Tau is equal to epsilon square t, f of u is epsilon square g of u, g having the same properties as f, expand in epsilon, throw away higher powers of epsilon. And the equation you get is the following. So there's no risk. You get is the following. So there's no rescaling in X, just in T. V terminal, V term minus D Vxx is equal to G of V with D the second moment of rho. Okay, this is the Fisher-Capital equation. So let me quote the two main results. Of course, this equation has been studied in many, many, many instances, but let me give you just the two classical results. So the first one is the KPP result, 1937. Result 1937. Capital X of tau. So capital X of Tau is the where the solution reaches one half. It's C star tau plus little O of tau. And C star is two square of D G prime zero. Okay, so this actually KPP prove more than this, but essentially the core of their work is this. X after 12 X of tau travels like C tau tau plus some little little O of tau correction. And the second and the other and the next here is due to Bramson in beginning of the 80s. So he takes F of U is equal to U minus U squared. There's a very good reason for that. And what he finds is X of tau is equal to C star tau minus three over two lambda star block tau plus Lock tau plus. Oh, by the way, I forgot to put an x infinity. There's an x infinity in this extension plus little o of one and lambda star is the corresponding exponent. Okay, so there are two very well-known theorems. So let me make some comments. The first one is that the Log Lookspeak correction is known as the Bramson delay. I guess that there were already talks in. I guess that there were already talks in this conference about this quantity. Branson's truth relies on, I mean, totally relies on the study of the rightmost particle in the branching Brownian motion. And less than 35 years later, Fran√ßois Gymnolog and Lanier Logic undertook to give a deterministic proof of Bramson's. Proof of Bramson results. So in 2013, we managed to catch the logarithmic delay and with Nolan Rhysik, we got the full Bramson serum in 2018. And so we gave a reasonably short PD proof for this, which actually is robust and which we were able to elaborate. Okay, so that was the connection with second order equation. The connection with second-order equations. The next item I want to dwell on is that actually this, I mean, the equation I'm looking at, UT minus the non-local dispersion equals to F of U, comes, I mean, some of them, so for some very special F, it comes from branching random modes. What is this? So we take a particle that So, we take a particle on a real line that sits at x equals zero at time zero, and then this particle starts making jumps at random times. It can also occasionally split into two, and the offsprings reproduce their ancestors' behavior. So there are several random events in this process. There is the times at which the particles jump, there is the times at which the particles divide, and there is also The particles divide, and there is also the length of the jumps. So we declare that the jumps and the splitting times are given by Poisson distribution, and the jumps length is given by the density k I just talked about at the beginning of the talk. So you take your favorite universe kernel and declare that it gives you the law of the drugs. Okay, let me call omega of tau the position of the of tau the position of the random of the right most particle at time t uh so the omega of t is a random is a random variable and let me let me call u of t x the probability that omega of t is larger than x there's a very beautiful theorem called the mckean's representation formula saying that uh u satisfies well the non-local equation i just told you about We have the non-local equation I just told you about. u t plus u minus k star u is equal to u minus u square. And why as much of a q square? Because the particle can split into two. If the particle splits in a higher, can split in higher number of particles, then you would get a higher exponent instead of Q2. And the initial datum is given to you by one minus Heabiside. Heaviside. Okay, and so for this very particular, for this very particular non-linearities, so let me remind you that capital X of t is the rightmost point such that u of tx is equal to one half. Then you can study omega of t. Omega of t is the rightmost particle in the branching random walk. And okay, it's not the most trivial thing on earth to do. thing on earth to do. Actually, when you want to study it in depth, there are very elaborate probabilistic arguments. And so the most complete up to date was done by IDECON in 2013. And if you use the bridge between omega of t and x of t, so omega of t is the rightmost particle in the blood. of t is the rightmost particle in the Branching-Brownian motion and u of tx is the probability that u that omega of t is larger than x then what you can prove is x of t is c star t minus 302 lambda star log t plus the translation x infinity plus the little o of one okay very good so let me make some comments Some comments. This totally connects to Bramson's results because Bramson also uses branching random work. His branching random work is the branching Brownian motion. So what is the branching Bernium motion? It's a branching random work with continuous trajectories. In other words, the particles are not allowed to jump. So of course there are some rescalings to go from one to the other, but speaking with Barehand, Speaking with bare hands, it's exactly this way. The branching random walk approach proves our main result as soon as it comes from a McKinsey representation. And as a matter of fact, not all functions f, even concave ones, come from a McKinsey representation. As a matter of fact, people, Linear Rigi thought very deeply about what kind of functions come from burning from Come from McKinley's representation. He issued a lot of them. Actually, there is quite a broad range of them, but not all come from Branching-Browning motion. And so, of course, it's interesting to have a proof which, I mean, where your nonlinearity doesn't come from Macin's representation. And as a matter of fact, there was an earlier PD result with more general F's due to With more general Fs due to Cole Graham that gave a talk on Tuesday, I believe. It's a recent result where he managed to catch the log route shift. So he gets the 302 longest time log T plus and he gets an O. As a matter of fact, everything I said about branching random works, well, I use his paper as a starting point. paper as a starting point it's uh it's really a paper that i that i recommend uh and i recommend that it that it should be read it it has a lot it has a lot of information okay so uh so the this is for branching von works and let me uh before uh before i go on how much time do i have to um Up to 4:35. How many minutes? Because I don't have a clock on my screen. Yes. Okay, good. Okay, so let me talk about another totally different occurrence of the model, which is the spatial spread of epidemics. So, once again, there were talks about the spatial spread of epidemics. Epidemics. So I'm not going to dwell too much on the modeling, but just recall a few things. So the model I want to tell you about is due to, well, I guess the first person to issue it was Kendall in 1956. As a matter of fact, the paper, where it is, it's quite an extraordinary paper. You know, during COVID lockdown, you had a lot of time to read. Time to read, so I read quite a few things, and Kendall's paper is really, really extraordinary. So, actually, it's not a paper by him, it's an answer to a paper in statistics. So, let me call S of Tx the density of susceptibles, R of T Z the density of infected. Susceptibles are the people that can catch the infection. And let me look at the most basic SI model. basic SI model, not even SIR, SI with no with the most basic non-linearity SI. So I chose not to rewrite it. Let me just say that the mechanism of contamination is given by the following thing. An individual, a susceptible, can be contaminated not only by the infected that sit at the same place as him or her, but also by the Her, but also by the infected that are within a certain range of him or her. And so, if you say this, where to account for all the infected that are sitting close to the statistical that you want to investigate, then one way to do it, one very nice way to do it, is convolved by, once again, your favorite convolution kernel. And the system that you get is DTIS is equal to minus beta. DTS is equal to minus beta S times K star I. DTI is beta S K star I minus alpha I. So once again, the pure SI model, the only modification, not a small one, is S i replaced by K star i. And let me take a small, so let me let me take a homogeneous susceptible population. So S 0 X is At 0x is S0, and I at 0x is I naught of X, and I naught is a small compactly supported initial data. So I put a small density of infected, and I want to see how the epidemics spreads. So let me look at the accumulated density of infected. u of tx is equal to the the integral of i of xx y and the equation that you obtained. And the equation that you obtained is u t is equal to s naught 1 minus exponential minus beta k star u minus alpha u plus i naught. Believe it or not, this is almost like a non-local fisher KPP culture. The theorem is the following. So there's a grave thing missing in this statement. It's the definition of or not. So I'm going to tell you. Of R0, so I'm going to tell you what it is. So, once again, let me take x of t the rightmost x such that u of t x is equal to some gamma between the between between zero and the maximal value of u. So, R naught, I totally, as I recycle this, recycle in the talk, I just forgot to put the definition of R naught. R naught is S naught. Not R0 is S naught beta over alpha. So if R0 is strictly larger than one, so R naught, of course, R naught is the basic reproduction number, of course. It is, I mean, everyone heard about it, I suppose. So if it's three larger than one, then the epidemics propagates and X of T is C star T plus little of T. Of little of t. So, this theorem is due to Aronson, 1977. And C star, so C star, so this is why this thing has a lot to do with the non-local Fischer-KPP equation. C-star is computed from the linearized version of the equation. So, you take ut is equal to S dot, blah, blah, blah, and linearize it around u equals zero. What you obtain is a linear integral equation and Equation and you can compute C star, lambda star, blah blah blah. What about the short-term asymptotics for this equation? Well, the result I presented to you works exactly the same. And also, if you work more, you can derive information about I and S that were not available before. Okay. Okay, so that's uh so that's the uh the model for epidemics. And so let me finish the talk by giving you a glimpse of the proof of the main result. So there are two steps. I mean there are two big steps. The first one is to investigate the tail of the solution. As a matter of fact, in this situation, I mean there were talks about fronts that are pushed, fronts that are pulled. Pushed, fronts that are pulled, fronts that are slightly pushed and slightly pulled. This one is pulled. It's a purely pulled front. So you have to understand the tail of the solution, if you want to understand something about the solution. And once you've understood the tail of the solution, then you can understand where the logarithm comes from. Okay, so one slide about the tail of the solution. The tail of the solution. So, first of all, you run with speed C star. Okay, so let me rename X as X minus C star T. And then let me uncover the small values of U by stripping U of the exponential minus lambda star X. So U of Tx is exponential minus lambda star X V of T X. And let me define Let me define an integral operator which is just deduced by making this change of functions. So i star v is equal to v minus exponential minus v star x k star v minus c star dx v. Okay, it's an integral operator that that looks neither appealing nor nor repealing. It's an integral operator at this stage. And the equation for V is exact. Vt plus I star. It's exact. Vt plus I star v plus exponential minus lambda star v square equals zero. Sorry. Equals zero. Okay. The theorem is the following. Let me pick some small delta and for x between t delta and t to the power one half plus delta, u of t x has this strange behavior. It's like, so there is an like so there is an there is an alpha infinity depending on initial datum such that u of t x for large t is equivalent to alpha star x over t to the power three half exponential minus lambda star x minus x square over for d star t d star is some exposure should i finish hello Sorry? So so so s so so sorry nothing nothing. Okay sorry James. Yes. Hello. Okay so so you has this asymptotic behavior. So there's a mix so here there's a in the asymptotic behavior of you there's a mixture of solution of heat equation and expression Of heat equation and exponential behavior, and in fact, you prove it by studying the equation for v. Okay, to just one comment. This theory is really not a trivial result to prove. The starting point is a very enjoyable exercise in distribution theory, where you prove that the following: if you take the exponential of I star, then Of I star, then it's like the heat kernel plus some very small correction. It's a fun exercise in distribution and complex analysis. Once you have that, then you start sweating. And the reason is that there is no smoothing effect. So you really have to keep track of all the constants and divide quantities in epsilon and divide epsilon and so on. So on so it's delicate, but you can do it. And once you've done it, let me tell you what the logarithmic delay comes from. Actually, the proof is relatively robust and universal. So you study the traveling wave at infinity. So there is a traveling wave in this process. And a nice result due to Kerr and Schmaj 2004 says that the traveling wave says that the traveling wave with bottom speed C star behaves like x exponential minus one star x and so what what do you do translate phi c star by a quantity sigma by by the quantity sigma of t which is going to match the solution at x equal to t to the power delta so I just wrote the equation so u I have its asymptotic behavior it's on the left Behavior is on the left. I have the asymptotic behavior of the translative wave on the right. Just solve, and what you obtain is sigma of t is one over lambda star factor of three over two t minus log alpha infinity plus little of little of one. And so x infinity is exactly minus log alpha infinity over lambda star. Full stop. star. Full stop. The end of theorem is that in fact u of tx is like phi c star of phi of x plus sigma of t when t goes to plus infinity. Once again you have to prove something. Once again you have to prove something. But actually it's less difficult than the study of the state of the solution. Okay so this so this So, this is the end of what I wanted to say about the asymptotic behavior of this equation. So, let me tell you what we are doing now. So, actually, there are several directions which we are investigating. So, we have something called the discrete Fischer KPP equation. So, it's finished and on the archive. So, it's something with Christoph Bett. Archive, so it's something with Christophe Bez, Gregory Fai, and Ming Ying Zong, which I think I saw online. So we're doing something at the moment on the Fischer-KPP equation in periodic environments with Novikov and Ryzik. There was an earlier work where it was not so easy with Francois, Nolan, and Ryzik, and also coupled diffusion SI models on S1. Diffusion SI models on this work with the same people as before. So, with this, I think I have finished, and thank you for your attention. Very much for your next talk. So, do you have time for questions, comments? Just please. So, if the kernel function does not have a compact support, but it becomes A compact support, but it decays very rapidly at infinity. Okay, okay. There will be covers by it. Okay, my belief is that my belief is yes, but I would not bet, I would not bet okay, as we say in French, I would not bet my right hand on it. I think it's true. I think it's true, but I. I think it's true, but I think it's not so easy to prove. And there are several places. There are several places, and one of them is when you study the tail of the solution. You devise all kinds of super and sub-solutions. And of course, when you have a kernel with compact support, With compact support, even when your sub-solution or your super solution behaves in a stupid fashion far away, you don't care. However, when you have an exponentially decreasing kernel, for instance, exponentially decreasing or Gaussianly decreasing, you have to prove that the stupid behavior very far away from the zone that you want to investigate doesn't influence the behavior of It doesn't influence things. So I think it's possible. But I don't exclude a place where you're all of a sudden stuck. Thank you. More questions, comments? Yes, please? I guess I should make the comment that my results do apply to a large class of decaying kernels. There's a kind of additional funny market. There's a kind of additional onhomogenicity condition. But I think, given that, I would expect it to be true, certainly. Jean-Michel, I'm curious about how you get a single alpha infinity, because often, in my understanding, this comes from some compactness argument. And without the smoothing in this equation, compactness seems a little bit tricky. So if it's not too horrific, could you comment on this? Certainly. Could you comment on this? Certainly. Certainly. In fact, it's a matter of recycling the old arguments of FifeMacLoud in this particular context. In fact, of course, there's no smoothing, but there's no smoothing but uh but there are there are some kind of trapping uh arguments that you can uh that you can use and uh what you uh what you and in fact for in in fact what you use is uh when uh when uh when um when time when time gets uh when larger and larger, you can use more and more refined seven-super solutions. Seven super solutions, which in the end are going to trap your solution with a single alpha infinity. Very good. Thank you. And as a matter of fact, to iterate on your comment, indeed, you're totally right that your result allows a certain margin of error. However, what I had in mind was the sub and super solution I'm telling you about. And I maintain that That I mentioned that I cannot exclude the fact that if they can behave in a stupid way, far away, and this, once again, I certainly believe that the result is true, but things are delicate, and okay, as long as things are not written, you cannot. You cannot say, okay, it works. Certainly, thank you, Domichel. So, maybe because of the time, we need to stop the question here. So, if you have more questions, maybe you can discuss with Tomichel and Fribate. And so, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you very much.
