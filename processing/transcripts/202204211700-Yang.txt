Thank you. Thank you for the organizer and thank you for the invitation. Today I'm going to talk about Anderson localization for quantum walks with quasi-periodical corn. And this model actually is exactly the same as what Jake talked on Monday. So we can also call it unitary almost massive. Call it unitary almost massive operator or the U-AMO. But today, I want to introduce this model a little bit more from the quantum walk point of view. And the quantum walk is a model which describes the dynamics of a single particle. So it's a quantum analog of classical random walk. And so I want to start with what is random work. Let's take a look at a simple example. Can look at a simple example. If we consider a walker or a particle on Z, so it's one-dimensional, and we start at zero. The process of random walk is we flip a corn, and then if we get head, the walk or the particle move towards right by one step. And if we get tail, then the particle move towards left by one step. And then we repeat this process. So we flip a corner and move core. They flip a car and move, car move. And this kind of process only concerns the position of the walker. This is random walk. But for quantum walk, we consider more information about the worker or the particle itself. So for example, if we use electron as our particle, then in physics, an electron has two different states, a spin-up state and a spin-down state. So at each So at each integer side g, we put a C2 vector to represent the internal states of the particle. And here actually I want to point out that it doesn't have to be a C2 vector, but it can be C3 depends on how many internal states the particle has. So, okay, so if we put a C2 vector, so we have two internal. We have two internal states. And the first step is we act a corn operator on this vector. And the following matrix, this matrix is some standard Halmod corn. And then we act a shift operator. And I will show you how we define a shift operator later. But you can see it's clear that random walk and quantum wall, they're different. So even it's kind of a general. Even it's kind of a generalization of random walk, but they have a different behavior. And this picture, this picture is a probability distribution of quantum walk and random walk on Z after 100 steps. And the blue part is a quantum walk. The orange part is a classical random walk. And from this picture, we can see that quantum walk has some faster spreading behavior. Faster spreading behavior compared to random work. And this kind of property plays an important role in constructing or developing some search algorithm or quantum algorithm in computer science. So this model has many computational applications in quantum computer, biology, genetics, and some many areas. areas. And besides the application in real life, this model itself is a physical system. It's a quantum system describes the dynamics of particles. So this model itself is also very interesting and is very attractive in physics. Actually, a lot of physicists are working on realizing quantum works on different letters using different particles. Using different particles, so not only electrons, but some other particles. So, this area is very hot during the past 20 years. And there are still a lot of open questions, open problems for quantum work models. Okay, now let's define the quantum work model. This model is defined on Hilbert space, the L to Z tensor. L to Z tensor product C2. So compared to random walk, we have a position and we also have the C2x represent the internal states of the particle itself. And we use E plus and E minus to represent the different internal states. And as I showed on the first page, the quantum work model consists of two steps. Model consists of two steps: a corner operator and a shift operator. And this is some standard or simple way to define the shift operator. And actually, you can define different shapes operator and different column operators. Then you will get different quantum work models. So, for example, you can define it using this shift and this column. And if we use the column, And if we use the corn shift language to think about random walk, then random walk can be viewed as a walk model with scalar corn. So the corn is just a number, not a two by two matrix. So it's some special case of corner work, kind of. Okay, and another way that we are interested in this model and we are We are interested in this model, and we are able to study this model is because the one-dimensional quantum work model can be reduced to CMV matrix. And Jake Feldman already introduced the CMV matrix on Monday in his talk. So here I will not talk about more details about the CMV matrix, but I will show you again. This is what CMV matrix looks like. Looks like. And if you carefully choose some Woblansky coefficients alpha n, then the quantum walk model can be reduced to a corresponding CIV matrix. And the name of CIVA matrix confirms the name of Canterell, Morrow, and Velasquez. And they proved the relation in 2010. 2010. Okay, before I start to talk about the model that is called unitary almost massive operator, I want to first mention the following model, which was originally studied by some physicists and mathematically by Jake Fielman, Wang John Zadig, Keep Werner. Werner. And this model is defined as following. This W11 omega theta is defined using this the following shift operator, the most standard shift operator, and a corn operator. Okay, now this corn is not the Hardman corn anymore. This is a rotation, rotation corn. And this is some natural choice of a unit turn matrix. Choice of a unit turn matrix. And you may notice that I put one here. So if you still remember Jake's talk, you actually this model is some special case of the unitary almost massive operator. So it is when lambda one equals one and when lambda two equals one. So in other words, this model doesn't have coupling constant yet. And for this model, And for this model, in 2017, Jake Fieldman, Wang, and John, they proved for any irrational omega, this model has purely single continuous spectrum for almost every theta and zero Lebanemara control spectrum. Okay, we can see that there is no spectral transition for this model. So a natural question is, is there any spectral transition phenomenon in the CMV? Phenomenon in the CMV setting? And the answer is it is hard. And actually, you may wonder that maybe we can introduce a coupling constant lambda by modifying the Woblansky coefficients alpha n to lambda times alpha n. But if you do this, you will not have special transitions. And last year, Ladik Philman and Wang. Lesik Fillman and Wangzi constructed a new model, a new quantum walk model, W lambda1, lambda two, omega theta, by introducing two coupling constants. And here they introduced lambda one in shift operator and lambda two in the corner operator. And for the corner operator, they also modified a little bit on the on the main diagonal. Diagonal, so in order to make it a unitary matrix. And the shift operator is also a little bit different. And actually, this shift is actually a shift plus a corn. Yeah, because this second term, this second term, actually, it changes the internal states of the particle. So it's essentially a shift plus a corn. And this operator is the U. Operator is the U-Armo model, the unitary ARMOS massive operator. Okay, before I show you the results on this model, I also want to tell you that this model actually originates from two-dimensional quantum walks in magnetic fields. Yeah, actually, in one-dimensional, you can define the shape. You can define the shift like this. And on Z2 letters, we can use the same shift operator horizontally and vertically. And then we can pick a constant current, not a rotation, pick a constant current operator. And then one can define the following operator using a constant current and shift horizontally and a constant core again and shift. And a constant core again and shift vertically. And in this way, we can define a quantum walk model on Z2 letters. Okay, but so far, there is no magnetic fields. So if we add a magnetic field with magnetic flux omega, and then the shift will become a magnetic shift. And the operator will become a magnetic operator. And it will be periodic in one direction and quasi-periodic in the other. And quasi-periodic in the other direction. And then one can use Locke theory to reduce this operator into a family of one-dimensional quasi-periodic operators. And this w lambda 1, lambda 2, omega theta, this exactly the unitary almost massive operator. Okay, now let's take a look at the results. Let's take a look at the results on this model. In 2021, Zatik Filman Wang proved the following results. And Jake already talked about their results on Monday, so I will not go over all of them. But I only want to point out the pure point part, which is related to my talk, to my result. And for this model, they show that. And for this model, they show that pupon spectrum for almost every omega and theta. So this result is in a mirror theoretical setting, so not arithmetic. And the proof is due to Dynamic and Von, and where they developed the localization proof by Bagan and Gosten. And recently, I improved. Recently, I improved this result to all Diovantin omega. And before I show you my result, I will quickly show you what is Diovantine. But I believe maybe all of you guys here are very familiar with Diovantine condition. So I will just say that alpha is Duvantine when beta equals zero. Okay, now here is my result. Recently, I proved Anderson localization for all Duvantine omega and all non-resonant theta. And also the sharp asymptotics for atom function per set. And here the non-resonant theta is a full matter set. It's defined by gamma equals zero. And the proof of this Anderson localization is motivated is motivated or developed by Judomoska's technique for almost massive operator. And this is the first time that Judomoska's technique in localization applied to CMV setting. So I feel very excited about this result. And now I want to briefly talk a little Want to briefly talk a little bit about the proof. So, Anderson localization is a pupil spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. So, I want to show this guy's exponentially decay. So, the problem, if you use Green's function expansion, then the problem is reduced to obtain the upper bound for the numerator and the lower bound for the denominator. denominator. And here the capital P is a determinant. And in the proof, the key difficulty lies in the lower bound of the denominator. And this is where we developed the Juda Mosque technique. And here I want to tell you that this is not a simple, not easy generalization. easy generalization there there's uh there are some new ideas needed to make it to make it doable to make it able to apply to CMV setting and for the upper bounds for the upper bounds of the numerator there are still some additional minor difficulties compared to the shredding operator so remember in the shredder case the Remember, in the traditional case, the P, the capital P are entries of transform matrix. So one can simply use the Lyapunox pony of the transfer matrix to control the upper bound. But in CMV setting, his P are entries of the Ziegler cocycle, not the transfer matrix of the quantum walk model. So, okay, since I mentioned a Ziegler cocycle, I will quickly show you what it is. I will quickly show you what is the Goku cycle. It comes from orthogonal polynomial on unit circle. And this phi nz is orthogonal polynomial on unit circle. And this satisfy the following Ziegler recurrence. So this matrix, this matrix is a transfer matrix of Ziegler, Ziegler cocycle. Okay, as I said, the P entries of Ziegler cycle, not the transfer matrix, not the. matrix not the not the cosycle not the transmit matrix of the quantum walk so so there are some additional work that we need to do and actually i did some computation and found that the lyapest the lyap exponent of the transfer matrix of the quantum work model is actually um two times the two two times the lyapeston of Two times the Laplace ponent of the Zygo cocycle, of the Ziegler transmatrix. And I think it's not a coincidence. And since it makes sense that they have some equivalence relation. But I could not find it in the literature. So I proved it and write it down. And this is a lemma showed the equivalence between the transomatrix cocycle and the Ziegler cocycle. And the Ziegler cycle. So here you can see that the Lyak exponent is two times, so LA is two times Ls. And to be honest, the proof is quite simple and you can just do some direct computation to check. But I think maybe it's useful in the future. So I put it here. So can you clarify the transformation? Here is a transfer matrix of a CMV matrix. So, what size is it? It is not 2 by 2, is it? It is 2 by 2. Oh, yeah. But I thought, okay, I'm completely confused. But CMV matrix is five diagonal, right? Right. So what is A? So the CMV, so actually there are three. There are actually three equivalents here. There's also a GZ co-cycle here. So they are all equivalent to each other. And for the MV matrix, it has some LM decomposition. Oh, okay. Okay. So yeah, because I don't have enough time, so I didn't put everything here. Okay. Okay, for the proof, I will not talk more about the proof. And at the end of my talk, I want to show you again about my result here about the pupon spectrum and the result of that big film and one about the purely singular continuous spectrum. So if you compare these two results, actually it's natural to propose the following conjecture on the arithmetic transition. Conjecture on the arithmetic transition line. And for this model, I believe that it has coupon spectrum for almost every theta if beta is less than Lyapunov's exponent. But your localization result is for all data, right? Not for all theta. The way it is listed right now, or is it in sprint? It's for almost every theta. Almost every theta, such as the C, gamma equals zero. Yeah, I would. On your slide that says for all theta for non-resonant. For non-resonant. Okay, so you have a misprint on the slide. Okay. Yeah, so I think if we further develop this technique, we can prove not only for deophantine biofolio variables, so all omega. So there's a there. So they're the arithmetic condition. Yeah, and your result on theta is also arithmetic, right? It's this non-resonant condition, right? Yeah, yeah. I see, I see. Okay. All right, very nice. I will stop here. Thank you. And are there any questions? Are there any questions? I actually have a question. So, in this conjecture, when you say it for almost every detail, is it almost every measured theoretical sense, or you have some sort of a condition in mind? Yeah. Yeah, so it holds for all non-resonant theta. So, here, so if theta is Diosentine with respect to omega. So the conjecture about the critical one is also has to do with the number of when gamma equals zero. So also for non-resonances. And what happened? I'm sorry, maybe it's a stupid question, but what happens for resonant details in both cases? I don't know. I mean, also in your result for localization. So what happens for the rate? So, what happens for the resonants? No localization. So, in this regime, that you prove lambda greater than lambda one, diaphragm omega, and resonant theta, what is going on there? Say it again. I'm saying you result lambda two greater than lambda one, therefore, tight omega, but resonant theta. Still bending by the resonance theta. So, is there a result on singular continuous buttons for resonant theta? That's what would be natural? That's precisely where I'm headed. I I don't think so. Okay. Well, not known yet. Well, not known yet. Would it be reasonable to assume that for resonant t-test there will be singular continuous threshold? Yes, yes. Any more questions? Zoom now, then let us think fun again. This is the last. This is the last talk for today. So we will resume tomorrow at 8 a.m. time. So adjust your time zone accordingly and we will see you all tomorrow. Okay, let us thank all the speakers of today.
