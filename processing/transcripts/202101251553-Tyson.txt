We wanted to understand how opinions evolve in a population, and then we wanted to couple this to disease dynamics to see how opinion dynamics alter the time course of an epidemic. And we all know this happens, but with a model, of course, you can look at it in more mechanistic detail. For our model, we decided that opinion dynamics or changes in opinions are arising as a result of meaningful interaction. So, people getting together. Interactions. So, people getting together, having meaningful conversations about issues of interest, where there's the potential for opinions to change. So, our modeling approach was to develop an attitude spectrum from plus L to minus L, and it doesn't have zero, so anybody can hold any attitude between plus L and minus L except zero, so no one's allowed to be completely neutral. Given a particular Given a particular attitude, the opinion is the sign of that attitude. So maybe the yes is plus and the no is minus, and then the strength of that opinion is the absolute value. And the updating of attitudes and opinions depends on influence and amplification, which I will define. So for influence, we assume that the likelihood of an individual's opinion Of an individual's opinion affecting others depends on the strength of that opinion via an influence function. And we have several possibilities. We could assume that all attitudes have the same weight. That would be uniform influence. We could give more weight to extreme attitudes. So that means that the extreme attitudes are louder, they're more obvious, and so even if they're not actually more prevalent, Even if they're not actually more prevalent, they get listened to more often because they're heard. And the example I've got here is linear influence. We could, on the other hand, give more weight to moderate attitudes, assume that the extremes tend to be discounted as being crazy and people are more interested in focusing on the moderate attitudes. The example I've got here we called collinear influence. And then we also included amplification. So, this is the tendency to become more entrenched in one's current opinion when interacting with another individual of the same opinion, regardless of the strength of either opinion. So this is an interesting phenomenon where if you take two people that are moderately on the yes side of an issue and you put them together and let them talk about the issue for a while. They talk about the issue for a while, they will emerge with a stronger yes position. So, even though there was nobody in the room with a strong yes position, the fact that they were both on the same side means that their attitude becomes more entrenched. So mathematically, what we've got in terms of the model is we've got what I'm illustrating here. So, if we think of the green dot as somebody whose opinion is fixed for the moment, Whose opinion is fixed for the moment. And the purple dot is someone who is picking someone to interact with and is going to change their opinion based on the interaction. So on the left, without amplification, the purple individual is at plus two, interacts with a plus one, and we assume the tendency is to move toward the individual with whom they're interacting. So the plus two would move toward a plus one, and we only allow a Toward a plus one, and we only allow a step of one in this model. Now, with amplification, we actually get the opposite movement because the green individual and the purple individual are both of the same opinion, different strengths, but same opinion. And so the purple individual actually becomes more entrenched and goes toward plus three. Okay, so then we build an agent-based model with these rules. These rules, the individuals aren't moving, they're stationary, but they interact with individuals in their neighborhood and they select individuals with whom to interact based on that influence function. And then sometimes amplification is present. And so we have amplification at just 7% for this simulation. So we start with a uniform distribution of opinions and attitudes. I've got them going from minus 5 to plus 5. From minus five to plus five in this simulation. The first thing that happens is we get a centering behavior where all of the attitudes move towards the center. So we've lost most of the bright whites and the dark blacks, and we've got a bunch of grays. But then pretty quickly, we start seeing this center distribution. We start seeing it widen. Eventually, two peaks develop, and at the same time, we're seeing more clustering, and the darker area. And the darker areas are getting more black, and the lighter areas are getting more white. And then the two peaks eventually move out towards the edges, and by the time we're at time 300 in this simulation, we have polarization. And that polarization is extremely stable, lasts a really long time. Now, with this simulation, as long as, because this is a square grid, this sort of the structure. The structure is extremely stable. But if that doesn't stop the evolution of opinions, we should see consensus on the left eventually, just because there happen to be more opinions over there, more individuals, but it takes an extraordinarily long time. So this polarized state is really stable. If we vary amplification, we can see that amplification is a strong driver of this process. Strong driver of this process. So these are figures for simulations on an attitude spectrum from minus two to plus two, to keep things simple. So the center opinions in orange are plus and minus one, and then left and right are the extreme opinions. And so if there's no amplification, this centering is maintained, and those attitudes dominate. If amplification is creased, and we've got it gradually increasing from 5%. It gradually increasing from 5% to 50%, then we start losing that centering, and it happens initially at the beginning, but the outer opinions, the extreme opinions gradually increase. And that happens faster and faster as you increase amplification. But even a very small amount of amplification will tend to make the population polarize. The influence function. The influence function also has an effect. So, on the left here, I've shown what we get with linear influence. We've also got amplification in these simulations. So, amplification is driving polarization, and the linear influence makes it happen faster because now we've given more weight to those extreme opinions. Collinear influence, so that's more weight to the moderate opinions, can actually counteract the polarization. The polarizing effect of amplification, though it's not quite enough to stop it. Now, if we go to an ODE model where now we have complete mixing of the population, let's let x be the global frequency of attitude A at time t, and then PA is still our amplification parameter, so the fraction of interactions that result in amplification. That results in amplification. And then omega A is the frequency-dependent weight of attitude A at time t. So this tells us how much influence the attitudes has in a mixed population. And the way we compute it is we take the influence of that attitude and divide it by the influence of the other attitudes times the size of the subpopulation that has that attitude. Mark asked me what the axes were on my simulation outputs, so I need to back up. Yeah, they're not labeled, are they? Yeah, no, I just the one that I don't want to interrupt too much, but the early one where you saw the pattern formation and the coarsening and all that, I wasn't sure what the axes were there. Yeah, in this one, it's just space. Oh, it's actually space, okay. Yeah, it's a grid. I see, okay. Okay, so yeah, and these aren't labeled either, they're time and then population on the side. And then population on the side. Okay. Okay, thanks. And I love your question about algorithms, and maybe we can talk about that later. Okay, sure. So, yeah, so then we can write the ODE for the evolution of these subgroups. So, this is just an example. If we take the minus two group, in the case where I've just got a minus two to plus two attitude spectrum, then the only way the minus two population increases is if a minus one individual. Increases is if a minus one individual becomes a minus two, that would increase the minus two group, or if a minus two becomes a minus one, and that would decrease the minus two group. So if an x minus one interacts with an x minus two and this weighting gives the frequency, then we end up with a minus two because that's moving toward the opinion of the partner, the green partner. Of the partner, the green partner. Think of the x minus 1 here as the purple. And then if an x minus 1 interacts with an x minus 1 and amplification is present, then that will also create a new x minus 2 individual. And then similarly, we can count the interactions on the other side that would reduce the x minus 2 population. And so in this way, we can define our ODE model. It's a four-dimensional system. Model. It's a four-dimensional system. And if we tune the amplification right and we put mixing in that agent-based model I showed you earlier, we get the same results. And so the ODE is a good predictor of the ABM with lots of mixing. Okay, there are more results on this model, but I wanted to move to opinion dynamics combined with disease. So let's go to that. So let's go to that. So now what we want to do is couple an SIR model with our opinion dynamics model. And we're thinking about when we started this process paper, COVID hadn't appeared yet. We were thinking about SARS, but it's all about mask wearing, avoiding crowds, washing hands, all of these non-pharmaceutical interventions that we can do. Vaccination is a non-reversible prophylaxis, so it doesn't apply. This is data that we found. There's a site. This is data that we found. There's a site called YouGov, which has really interesting data all over the world showing this particular plot is showing mask wearing in public places. And we can see that there are big changes in behavior over short time periods that are on the same scale as the epidemic. Unfortunately, of course, there are various government interventions in here, so it would be hard to use the data, but it certainly illustrates that these behaviors can change quickly. Quickly. So here's our model. We put the attitudes only in the susceptible population, just to keep the model a little simpler. Of course, they exist in these other two groups, the infectious and removed, but we kept it over here. And then we assumed that each group had a different infection rate. So the plus two is the no prophylaxis group. So this would be the basic infection rate for the disease. And then as in groups And as groups become more prophylactic, their infection rate decreases, and we simply chose a factor Q. Now for influence. So what we did for influence in this model is we just assumed uniform influence when there's no disease present. And then when, as the infectious group grows, that influence changes. And so these dark lines, these dark lines these are so the top one that's the most prophylactic group the next one is the the middle prophylactic the next one is the middle non-prophylactic and then this last one is the completely non-prophylactic and so what we're assuming here is that as the infectious population increases the weight of the prophylactic group opinions attitudes becomes stronger Attitudes become stronger, and the weight of the non-prophylactic attitudes becomes less strong. We're assuming rational behavior here. Okay, and then we looked at three other functions, a saturating. This is fixed order saturating where we took care of the fact that the order swaps here and just kept the order the same. And then the reverse order saturating would be like the collinear influence, where again, it's the moderate prophylactic opinion. Prophylactic opinions attitudes that have more weight than the extreme prophylactic attitudes. Most of the epidemics we looked at were in this 0 to 10% range, sometimes up as high as 20, but this early part of each curve is quite important. Oops. Okay, so our model equations. Okay, so our model equations are the same as the opinion dynamics one. We've just added the disease terms. So I'm showing you the equation for one susceptible group, this susceptible. It would be analogous for the other ones. And then we have the infected and removed groups as usual. And then we can look at the effect of the initial amount of prophylaxis in the population. Now this is only the initial amount of prophylaxis. We're letting the system evolve based on based on the We're letting the system evolve based on the rules that I defined earlier. But these are plots looking at final size, peak size, and duration of the epidemic as a function of the initial amount of prophylaxis in the population. And we can see that final size and peak size both decrease fairly quickly as the initial level of prophylaxis increases. And that's true across the different influence functions. So these different curves, the different So, these different curves, the different lines correspond to the different functions. The ones that are all jammed up together here are the non-linear ones. This is the linear influence. And then, this case is here. I've said no influence. What it really means is that infection has no influence. And so it remains the uniform influence at no infection level. Duration is non-monotonic. And so, with no effect of no response to infection, duration increases as the initial level of prophylaxis increases and then drops very quickly. This drop here corresponds to the basic reproductive number dropping below one. So there's a sudden decrease. Then, for all the different influence functions, we get we still have non-monotonic curves, but they increase at different rates and then decrease. They increase at different rates and then decrease at different rates. Okay, so the initial level of prophylaxis is having an effect on these measures of epidemic severity. And then if we vary the rates, so of course the interesting question here is the relative rate of the opinion dynamics versus the disease dynamics. In the top row here, I have held the disease dynamics at the same rate as before, but increased the rate of the opinion dynamics. The rate of the opinion dynamics. And now the non-linear influence functions are much more effective at reducing final size and peak size, and are also now all of a sudden duration is decreasing almost monotonically. But now if we also increase the disease dynamics, so in the second row, everything's faster, disease and opinion dynamics. What we see here is that this is the co- or the reverse order saturating, so it's like our co-linear inflow. Saturating, so it's like our collinear influence, where the moderate prophylactic opinions are the most listened to. And when that's the shape of your influence function, those opinions are not strong enough to reduce final size. And in fact, you're better off with no influence of disease for some initial conditions. And down for peak size, it's not quite as bad. And down for peak size, it's not quite as bad, but still we see this behavior where the moderate opinions are just not strong enough to bring peak size down. And in all cases, duration goes up with the initial amount of prophylaxis. So this is what we've become familiar with with COVID. You flatten the curve, but now, of course, that stretches it out as well. Now, the nice thing about framing opinion dynamics. Or opinion dynamics in this way is that we can look at things like polarization and what the effect is on the spread of the epidemic. So, this is a function for polarization that we found in the literature. Polarization has been thought about in other fields, so we were able to just borrow this function from other places. And what we're saying here is that polarization depends on the proportion at each extreme. And then on the difference between those proportions. And this is the contour plot that you get. So along this line here, everybody is at one extreme or the other. So the entire population is at the extremes, nobody's in the middle. And so polarization, according to this function here, is highest when you've got 50% on one side and 50% on the other. And that's right smack in the middle here. That's that's right smack in the middle here. And then it decreases as the population begins to skew towards one side. So, up in this corner here, we've got consensus on no prophylaxis, and down in the bottom right, we've got consensus on all prophylaxis. If I go this way, I have the proportion at each extreme is equal, so it starts at 50-50 in the middle here, and then as I move towards. And then, as I move towards 0, 0, we've got 40, 40, 30, 30, 20, 20. And so we're getting more and more of the population is now in the middle, and fewer are at the extremes. And so eventually the extremes cease to matter. And then along each of these curves, the polarization level is constant, but the distribution between one end and the other is different. So this point might be 30% non-prophylactic. 30% non-prophylactic, 70% prophylactic, and then on the same curve, I've got 30-40 again, so the same amount of polarization, but it's on the opposite side where I've got 70% non-prophylactic and 30-prophylactic. And if you've done your math, you know that this point here is 50-50. You plug that in here. Rebecca, you've got a couple minutes left. Okay, yeah, that's good. Got half. So this scale should go from zero to a half. It goes to one because Noah multiple. It goes to one because Noah multiplied it by four because he liked a range from zero to one better. So if I color these initial points as red, so that's skewed towards non-prophylaxis, and on this side I'm skewed towards prophylaxis. And if I take those, take initial values for the population along these contours between the green and the red, I end up with these results. And the red, I end up with these results for the change in final size, peak size, and duration of the epidemic. So it depends not only on the initial proportion, the polarization has an interesting effect on these measures of epidemic severity, depending on where we are in these distributions. Okay, so we find that opinion So, we find that opinion dynamics can have a dramatic effect on final size and peak size, that the initial conditions matter, that increased weight to moderate opinions counteracts polarization, which is good for democracy, but increased weight to extreme prophylaxis is necessary to reduce epidemic severity if the disease dynamics are fast. All right, so these are results that we obtained with a fairly simple model of opinion dynamics. So, for this last slide, I want to talk about some of the more complex. Some of the more complex behaviors that I think are going to be important to include moving forward. I don't have time to talk about all of them. I think I'm down to one minute now. So I'm just going to mention a couple. Belief perseverance is a really, really interesting behavior. There have been a number of studies that show if you take a group of people and then you give them information which you present as fact and you get them to accept it, and then you present them with evidence, and it can be very Evidence, and it can be very strong evidence that contradicts the originally presented facts, that a large proportion of the group, it can be more than 50%, will maintain belief in that original fact, even though they've been presented with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. And this occurs among highly educated groups. Everybody is susceptible to this. And this clearly would have a huge effect on. Clearly, it would have a huge effect on the willingness of people to change their opinions in different contexts. And so, I think things like this are going to be important to consider. This is another result. I found this in the paper by Musaid in 2013 looking at the effect of social interactions. So, in this plot, we see the accuracy of very confident opinions in that group. So, they were given some sort of test. Group, so they were given some sort of test to take and rate their confidence in their answers. And so, the very confident opinions tended to have very little error. So, that's good. This is a nice distribution. But then they let these people have social interactions where they talked amongst each other. You would hope that a group like this, once allowed to interact, would start, would eventually drift towards an even better distribution here where everybody's figured out what the right. Distribution here, where everybody's figured out what the right answer is, but instead, the opposite happens. And now we've got very strong opinions all across the board with very, very large errors, even. And so these are behaviors that are well documented. They are not minority behaviors. They occur all over the place. And so I think it's going to be quite important to look at these moving forward. Just quickly, there are models out there that look at some of these behaviors, and so one doesn't have to start from And so one doesn't have to start from scratch. These were listed in a paper by Anne, and so you can go back to the recording if you want to see these. All right, and thank you very much for listening. Thank you. Maybe we can go back first to Mark's question about social media feed algorithms. Yeah, I've been thinking. Yeah, I've been thinking about that recently. Okay, so, and in fact, some of that came up while I was doing this work here. There are apparently a couple of social media platforms, BuzzFeed is one of them, and I've forgotten what the other one is, it's one I hadn't heard of before, that are trying to present a range of opinions along with some data about how common those opinions are to try and encourage. Are to try and encourage more diversity in people's consumption of news, trying to counteract these echo chambers and confirmation bias. I haven't actually connected our model to that yet. What we do see, I think it's quite interesting that in our very simple model, we get this polarization and it's extremely strong effect. And you only have to have a teeny bit of confirmation bias. Teeny bit of confirmation bias or amplification or anything of that sort. Homophily is another one. That, and you get these polarizing behaviors. And so clearly we have to work really hard to counteract them in whatever algorithms we develop. Are there other questions from Chris? What if you randomly connect individuals? If you randomly connect individuals with different opinions every so often, yeah, okay, so we did that. That was really fun. So, with the agent-based model that I showed you, the individuals aren't moving. But then we looked at mixing in two different ways. We looked at telephoning versus relocating. And that kind of mixing, both of those help. Mixing definitely helps. But the ODE model is the completely mixed group, and we still get polarization in the ODE model. So it's a very strong behavior. Does that answer your question, Chris? I was just going to try and type something, but I'll just, since it's quiet, that the ACE-based model, the just the. Based model, just the figure looks, I mean, sort of very much like sort of in some sense, the spatial aspects of it, etc., look very much like things either the Ising model or which is essentially very similar to the voter model. And have, I mean, there, I mean, it's sort of interesting just to think about what that might tell you. Yeah, so we actually started thinking about voter models, and that's About voter models, and that's how we developed this framework that kind of inspired the way we were thinking. I don't, and we have a paper where we put in media influence, where now we assume a whole bunch of people switch opinions at the same time because they've listened to the same external influence. And there you can use voter model theory to get predict how long it's going to take to get consensus and things like that. We haven't been able to do it with this. That. We haven't been able to do it with this model yet. And then, I mean, I see model that would be having an external field, which would essentially be equivalent to what you're saying. And then you can look at the behavior of that sort of thing. Yeah, and I think there's been some work on that with stubborn opinions, which we also haven't got in here. So they're going to be stubborn agents that just don't change their opinions. But I don't remember the results. But I don't remember the results. Maybe really briefly, one question, and then we have a little time till the dis not very much time at all till the discussion. So is the time scale over which amplification takes effect important for the epidemic? Yeah, really important. So of course, if you increase amplification, you're making that time scale faster. You're making that time scale faster because it happens faster. And so that's connected to the faster dynamics. Now, I didn't change amplification in these figures. We just changed the influence functions, made those rates faster. But amplification has a similar effect. Yeah. So I
