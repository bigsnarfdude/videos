Thanks. So yeah, so this is going to be something a little bit different. So looking at a bit but very relevant, I guess, at some level to T-cell receptor function repertoires. This is work from a student working with myself and Simon Davis. And the question relates to kind of in-situ measurements of kind of protein-protein interactions in cells. And I guess that are relevant to. And I guess that are relevant to modeling that have been used, sort of like re-examining some parameters that have been used in models previously in quite significant, kind of consequential ways, and trying to understand if we can start to make more of these measurements in situ as opposed to using indirect methods based on biochemistry or kind of taking a system apart and trying to understand how it works after it's disassembled. So, I guess the key question. So, I guess the key question is, I guess, related to T cell receptor triggering and how the T cell receptor recognizing MHC peptide complexes would be initiating signals and achieving the very high sensitivity that we observe, particularly for effector responses where you really have single molecule sensitivity for the MAC peptide complexes. And we know, I guess, from previous work that this requires co-receptors, which Coreceptors, which are CD4 and CD8. We've heard a lot about them, certainly, as markers of subsets, but they also play a critical role in the association of the T cell receptor and its kind of reading of the NHC peptide complexes through recruiting non-receptor tyrosine kinases to the receptor complex. And so the fundamental question I guess we'll be looking at is. We'll be looking at is, and again, this is just some additional evidence of both the single molecule sensitivity from some work from Mark Davis's lab, and also the powerful discrimination combination of that sensitivity with basically then the ability to resolve very small differences in the MHC peptide ligands. So these models, So the kind of the one of the questions that's been or important kinds of parameters, I guess, related to coboreceptor function has been the association with this microceptor tires and kinetics L C K. Steprasine kinase LCK, and the ability, I guess the efficiency of that association and the relationship of that coupling to kind of a proofreading process that would basically tell the system about the duration of the T-cell receptor MHC peptide interaction in terms of the timing of recruitment of the co-receptor with a Receptor with the kinase that would then initiate phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of the T cell receptor. So, this is a question that comes up particularly in maybe thinking about selection thresholds in the thymus, which you've also discussed earlier, and the tuning of the tuning of CD4 and CD8 in relation to recognition of MHC class I or class II ligands has been associated in earlier studies with the ability to set these thresholds and basically with CD4 being a stronger recruiter of LCK than CD8. And I guess one of the ways that that's been investigated is Been investigated is through co-precipitation after detergent solubilization of the receptors. And one caveat is that the results, say, for CD4 vary over quite a large range. And this relates to, I guess, selecting conditions for these experiments where you essentially take tissues. Take tissue, sometimes from directly ex vivo, make cell suspensions, use a mild non-IAC detergent to solubilize these transmembrane proteins, CD4 or CD8, and then the most quantitative, so say early on this was done as a kind of a qualitative yes or no, like do these associate with a yes or no answer. The implementation of these sort of fleshytometry-based versions. Flecotometry-based versions of these assays where you'd have like a bead that's large enough to run through a fleshometer, so maybe around five microns. You associate antibodies that'll capture CD4 or CD8. And then once you've captured the CD4 or CD8 from the lysate in these detergent micelles, you'd run two different samples, one with an antibody to CD4 and one with an antibody to LCK. And of course, this antibody to CD4 would be to. And of course, this antibody to CD4 would be to a different epitope than the capture epitope. And then what you'd be able to do is basically quantify the CD4 signal and the LCK signal, subtract any relevant background, and then basically do a, take a ratio of these to get the percent association. So this method again generated those somewhat, you know, kind of, or these types of methods generated some of the lower values in those data sets, some of the higher values. Those data sets, some of the higher values are generated by a Western blotting method. So Alex basically, as a master's student with Simon, just started to, you know, was curious about these disparities, because I guess some of the higher values that were collected earlier were from a collaborator of Simon's, so there were some questions, but why is Ed Palmer's group getting such low values, and other groups are also getting these lower values? So he wanted to basically just try and repeat. To basically just try and repeat the experiments and see if you can get a clear read on this. And his results with thymocytes essentially showed a very, very almost stoichiometric association, so nearly 100% of the CD4 had LCK associated with it. And in fact, even treating these lysates with EDTA, which would chelate a zinc ion, which is required for the interaction, was not able to dissociate it. To dissociate it. And I think, just going back to the schematic, you know, one issue that I guess we're dealing with in the situation is that the physical association of the LCK with the co-receptor in this case is probably mediated by both a zinc-dependent, so-called zinc clasp in the cytoplasmic domain of CD4-CD8 and the N-terminus of LCK, and a lipidation of the correcipitation. Of the coreceptors, which is presumably associated with this micelle. So it seems that even when you defeat the zinc class, basically, you still get persistent association in this case. And it was only when you used a membrane permeable zinc chelator that you could put in before you actually did the lysate that you could impair this association. And even then, there was some, it was actually difficult. There was some, it was actually difficult to totally disengage the interaction, although, you know, in you know, if you mutated the LCK so it no longer could engage in that zinc-dependent interaction, you'd essentially eliminate the signal in this kind of phosphatometry-based assay. But so, what appeared, so it's possible that Alex could have re-optimized the conditions to achieve the results that. Conditions to achieve the results that, you know, say the Palmer group had obtained in the 2014 paper, where they, again, did a lot of modeling based on these numbers. Or we could try and come up with a different way to get the measurement in situ, and that's the equitable use, because we worried that these conditions that he chose here seem quite reasonable. And if you were to change them, it's hard to know if you'd really be capturing, which one really captures what's happening in situ. What's happening in situ. So these are the questions you wanted to do. You wanted to basically take a more biophysical approach to doing making the measurement in situ and then basically move towards asking more biological questions based on those results. So the method we choose to apply was this fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. And this is maybe a technique that goes back to the 1970s and when it was implemented on these custom-built machines. It was implemented on these custom-built machines with large lasers and in a great, very, very complicated. Not many labs would be able to do this. Now, say, device like Olympus Khan local microscopes will run this experiment. Even with that simplified access, point FCS has been complicated to use because what you're doing in this situation is taking fluorescent, say, CD4 and LCK in our example, setting LCK in our example, setting up a situation where you have an observation spot where the molecules are diffusing through that observation spot, and then using the statistics of the fluorescence from effectively single molecules diffusing through that observation zone, and then basically doing a correlation analysis to extract both diffusion coefficients and also if you have two different colors and the system is well set up, you can do essentially color. Is well set up. You can do essentially co-localization, which was the main thing that we were interested in. So, say, have a green channel, a red channel, and then a cross-correlation channel. And when you do these correlation curves, basically the amplitude of this intercept on this axis would be related to the correlation, strength of the correlation at the shortest time intervals, and then the decay of that correlation over time. When this is decayed to half maximal, you'd basically have To have maximal, you'd basically have a measure of the diffusion coefficient or the time that the molecule spends in the observation spot or the time the two molecules spend in the observation spot. So in order to implement this with membrane proteins, because of their slower diffusion, there's an issue that the statistics are actually quite difficult. But you can, because you have more time to make the observation, because the molecules are diffusing slower. Because the molecules are diffusing slower, you can, with these confocal microscopes that have a scanner, you can implement this line scanning XES. And the reason that this is elliptical here is because this is essentially a point spread or an observation volume that's from a line scan. So it's moving in this axis. And then you could, say, collect, you know, 128 or 256 points per cycle. And then, you know, say in your, in an observation that might take half an hour to get the statistics, you can then do. To get the statistics, you can then do in basically 512 times shorter period of time. So a matter of minutes. And for a live cell, it's important to be able to make the observations in a reasonable timeframe. So basically, Alex implemented this line scan SES with help of Falk Schneider, worked with Christian Egling and Marco Fritsch. And essentially, this is just a movie, basically showing a convocal movie. Convocal movie of you know, essentially as fast as the convocal can go. So you could potentially do image correlation on this, but that's probably too slow. You wouldn't have enough, you wouldn't be revisiting each point fast enough to really get the proper correlation curve. But you're basically just scanning along this line. Then you basically get a correlation carpet where you have the distance along the line versus the time. And essentially the decay of that correlation would basically Decay of that correlation would basically then give you, and you can see that this would be the very ideal data. You have a very uniform correlation across the whole carpet. So basically what, so Alex set up was basically, initially we used 293AGK cells. So we're making an NC2 measurement, but we're doing it initially in a model cell line, not in a T cell, because it has to be a transfected system in this case, because we have fluoride. System in this case because we have fluorescent proteins attached to the CD4 and LCK. So, most of the data I'll show you is for CD4. We have a little bit on CD8 also. I'll show you at the end. So, and you have the positive control effectively is a tandem conjugate with GFP and M cherry linked together and linked to the membrane. So it would have similar diffusion characteristics, but they should be 100% correlated. And then essentially, what Essentially, what Alex did was basically look at the cross-correlations for I guess the wild type and basically a mutant. And what you see is that with the mutations that basically the CS mutation where you've disabled the synclasp in the L CK, you can basically get diffusion measurements for Basically, get diffusion measurements for CD4 and LCK, but there's no cross-correlation. In the situations where you have positive control, obviously you have a strong cross-correlation. That's the blue line here. And this value here is basically used to normalize the cross-correlation value from the cherry to CD4 GFP LCK, and essentially then, I'm sorry, I should be doing this here. Here. And that basically tells you that there's a cross-correlation that's actually similar between the tandem construct and the CD4 and LCK, and that this is lost when you mutate the sync class completely. So again, so really it recapitulates very nicely the data that Alex had acquired before, which suggested that the association of CD4 with LCK is very efficient both in... Is very efficient both in C2 in this model where their LCK and CD4 are expressed at roughly similar densities in the membrane, around 200 molecules or microns squared, which again is the physiological range you find in a T cell or a thymocyte. And Alex then went on to do a mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domains. So this is the zinc clasp here. There are two key cysteines in this. So when they're mutated, these are the mutations that basically... These are the mutations that basically disabled the interaction in the previous data. There are also some other motifs, palmitylation motifs that are adding lipids to the CD4, a basic region that's maybe a typical organic stock transfer region for a transmembrane protein, and this amphipathochelix, which is present in CD4 but not CD8, so that was kind of an interesting feature. And what Alex found basically was that among these features, this amphipathic helix, deleting this or mutating it by changing the Or mutating it by changing the sequence essentially decreased the association of LCK with CG4. So there was kind of an indication that basically we can do quantitative experiments with this, identify a new motif that's basically important for this association that hadn't been defined previously, and kind of confirming basically that the zinc class was critical for the interaction, but that the interaction is very efficient in situ. In C2. And so the thing that I think, you know, is, so Alex then did a comparison between CD4 and CD8 alpha beta in the HEK cells. And so the data that's shown here basically is that the association of CD8 with LCK is similar actually to what Alex saw with the CD4 with LCK. To what Alex saw with the CD4 without the epipathochillix. So, again, it suggests that a somewhat weaker interaction, which is basically what was predicted by the biochemical analyses, but the order of magnitude of the weakening of the interaction is totally different. It's not a five-fold difference at a few percent. It's a less than two-fold difference at around sixty percent occupancy versus one hundred percent. Uh is it possible to determine the spatial scale of the localization? So the it's basically codifusion. So there's you know there would be the interrogation spots maybe 250 microns by 500 microns, something like that for the line scan. But that would be, that's a much larger scale than the actual, you know, again. Scale than the actual, you know, again, the interaction at this point, I guess our hypothesis would be based on the structure. But the, and of course, if they were to separate, if they were to dissociate from each other, they could potentially separate over a large length steel very quickly based on the diffusion. Say if they were co-associated in a lipid raft or something through these lipidation, both of them have these lipid modifications. You know, other data suggests. Other data suggest that wouldn't necessarily confine them with this kind of a measurement, with this kind of observation volume, but that would be, I suppose, possible. But it would probably still be on a nanometer, you know, 10 nanometer scale, our model, at least. But yeah, but it's really it's just kind of a statistical method based on the coincidence. And do you want to notice any difference between CB2 and CB? Maybe this guy's supposed to make this. I'll show you some data that relates to, that we can relate to clustering in a moment by just taking some different statistics from the same measurements. But again, the clustering is kind of, it's almost kind of binary, I suppose, in a ways. It's looking at basically whether or not they're associated in that volume. If, say, the molecules were interacting so transiently that they could dissociate while in the observation volume, then you'd have a some. Volume, then you'd have a somewhat more complicated situation. But we don't have any indication that that's the case at this point. We think that these would be, you know, probably, these are millisecond observations. We're probably talking hundreds of milliseconds to seconds for the interaction between the, some say like from BioCore data, the zinc-clasp interaction is probably something that's going to be maybe around the one per second or something dissociation time. Dissociation time. So these are kind of interesting issues. And I think not just the study say occupancy, but the dynamics would be interesting to know about. And we can't get that from this measurement. So one thing Alex has done in the 293, again in the 293 HEK cells is put in CD4 and CD8, and essentially then LCK. And he's trying to get similar ratios, but basically different measurements, different observations. Different measurements, different observations will actually just randomly have different levels of LCK, CD4 and CD8. And basically, what Alex found is essentially that when he sets up this double positive situation, it becomes clear that LCK and sorry, CD4 and CD8 compete for LCK. So LCK has now become limiting. There's 200 molecules per micron squared of each. So L CK is limiting. And essentially, in this situation, CD4 is slightly outcompeting CD8. And again, Up competing CD8. And again, this sets up an interesting question to say to look in thymocytes for any, you know, say evidence of this in the future, although obviously the engineering of the cells is somewhat more of a challenge than in the fibroblast. But the one thing I thought was kind of curious, and again, I think could be interesting to think about from just kind of a modeling perspective, is this observation, which suggests a correlation where, you know, Correlation: where if LCK is limiting, CD4 is out-impeding CD8. But basically, as you increase the LCK, and this is just happening randomly in given cells, you basically find that CD4 and CD8 can have equivalent levels of occupancy of LCK. So again, for your modeling of how basically CD4 or CD8 are bringing LCK to the T cell receptor, you really want to understand is LCK limiting? Is LCK limiting in this situation? And is this going to be essentially a situation where both molecules will bring LCK to the T-cell receptor very efficiently, which is what appears to be the case, or if there was a quite maybe severe limitation in LCK, then CD4 could be essentially, things could conform more to the model based on the biochemistry. Although I think the model based on the biochemistry is The model based on the biochemistry is kind of challenging to go forward with. So the other, you know, another just kind of interesting observation in this is that Alex has looked at, again, at CD8. And in CD8, you have, you know, most alpha-beta T-sl receptors would have an alpha-beta version of CD8 where the cytoplasmic domains are different and only the alpha subunit has the zinc. The alpha subunit has the zinc clasp, which would be required for the strong interaction with the L CK. So, again, when you look at these CD8 beta, alpha beta L C interaction, it's around 60% compared to 100% for the TAN number for CD4 LCK. Now, when you put the CD8 alpha subunit onto CD4 and made this into a monomeric system, it actually performed a little bit better. It performs a little more similar to the CD4. Similarly, the CD4. So, again, this sequence lacks this alpha helix, which in the context of CD4 was contributing to the interaction. But it seems that part of the weakness of CD8 and binding to LCK is also coming from pairing with this beta subunit. And interestingly, when you make a CD8-alpha-alpha molecule, which is just expressed in CD8-alpha alone, essentially you could detect no LCK binding. And what we think is that, you know, for And what we think is that, you know, from other data, we believe that these zinc class kind of homodimerize. And in the context of this covalent disulfide-link dimer, it seems that this system is completely locked in this intramolecular interaction and just can't bind LCK anymore. So it's interesting that I guess a lot of these innate-like T cells have the CD8 alpha-alpha receptor. Again, it may not be able to bring LCK, at least under the conditions that we're looking at. Under the conditions that we're looking at. So Alex then basically tried to develop this method so that he could do the experiments with the jerkit cell. So again, a step towards a T cell. And the complication of this was that the surface topology of the cell is essentially incompatible with these types of measurements. So Alex needed to find a way to basically create this nice flat interface where you hit the measurement. Interface where you get the measurement, so it's indicated here, and also, but without, but with a control, at least for understanding what activation is doing. So in order to, so Simon's lab is to kind of develop this model for CD45 exclusion and forming a close contact with maybe a molecule like CD2 and CD58 will mediate activation of a T cell, a partial activation, through this kind of Through this kind of CD45 exclusion mechanism. But if you use a T cell receptor deficient T cell and then basically look at C D4L CK interaction in this context, you'd have a close contact with no activation. So there's no calcium flux, no evidence of activation. On the other hand, if you use the same adhesive substrate with a TCR positive jerkin cell, you'll have an activation process. And if you include an antiboly, And if you include an antipligant of the T-cell receptor, then you have a very strong activation process. And what Alex basically noted was that obviously the area of contact increases when you have the activation condition. But the CD4-LCK interaction is largely unaffected by this. If anything, the interaction seems to become a little bit more efficient in the context of this T cell, again, a transected T cell. So, but one thing that was really cool that he found basically is if you plot the brightness of the signals that are basically the, you know, the individual entities that are diffusing through this observation zone versus the transit time, the transit times are related to the diffusion. The brightness is related to, can be related to oligomerization. And what he found basically is under activating conditions, the CD4 LCK system seems to form a dimer, effectively a dimer. A dimer, effectively a dimer of heterodimer, a homodimer of the heterodimer. And this is just kind of systematic. Like, this seems like all the molecules are doing this. So the activation process is generating a situation, a condition, I guess, in which now you're kind of altering the CD4 LCK complex. And it would of course be interesting to know if a similar thing happens with the CDA LCK complex or if this is unique to CD4, because this could then be another. Because this could then be another difference between CD4 and CD8 that could help explain the results, that basically the CD4 seems to be a more effective helper for the T cell receptor compared to CD8. And again, I think something that could be quite interesting for modeling approaches. So we can use this line scan SCS to make measurements, biochemical measurements, in situ in a model cell line and also in this jerkin cell line. In order to implement this and say, In order to implement this in, say, a thymocyte, it would be a little bit more complicated because you'd have to actually have a genetically engineered system where you could get access to the thymocytes, maybe a retrogenic system on top of a knockout or something where you could basically do this in a proper way in the thymocyte. So novel characteristics of the CD4 cytoplasm domain that contributed to the binding were identified using this method. CD4 and CD8 both bind LCK quite efficiently in C2. CD4 is more efficient than CD8, and that comes out More efficient than CD8, and that comes out most clearly in situations where LCK is, where there's competition for LCK between the two co-receptors. And the zinc plast seems to be able to mediate both, in the absence of a proper heterotypic partner, it can mediate homooligomerization of both LCK and CD4. And in the context of the CDA alpha-alpha dimer, it seems to actually completely block interaction with LCK. So, and that's basically where Alex is at this point. Where Alex is at this point. And yeah, and basically, this is the team. So, my group, Stephan Ballant, has helped Alex quite a bit in Mafalda Santos and Ed Jenkins in Simon's lab. And of course, Fox Schneider, who's now a postdoc at USC, who was essentially a student at Oxford previously, is a real guru, I guess, for this line scan SCS approach and a lot of these kind of forests. And a lot of these kind of fluorescent space biophysics in general. So, anyway, keep an eye on him used to use these fantastic. So, thanks. So, we have a you always do questions, so Olva, maybe if you want to start. Hi, Mike. Uh, thanks for a nice talk. I'm just gonna hear it why is it uh C D eight alpha alpha doesn't associate with L C K? Um LCK, functionally, it does have a big impact, I think, kind of similar to CD8 alpha-beta. And I wondered if maybe you did the assay in a similar way to how you did CD4. You might see that it induces or stabilizes an LCK interaction. Yeah, so maybe in the context of the jerk it or something, when you have an activating condition, perhaps. Yeah, there's one other piece of information. So in the Stepanec at all paper, The Stepanek et al. paper from 2014, they used a mouse called, that basically had a knock-in for a basically a CD8, CD4 camera. And there were
