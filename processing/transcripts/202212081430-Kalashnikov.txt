I'm ready to talk about the speak. So yes, today I want to talk about the mirror constructions for type A flight varieties. So I'm going to talk about some, not in a philosophy survey, the different constructions for bacteriums and flight varieties. And the constructions I'm thinking about are ones which I think could be generalized to more broader GIT quotients, B1 plot G. So instead of thinking about Grass Manning as a flag ratty main view is Library mainly is GMOP. Everything here is going to be okay. I want to think about things which might, you can hope, will work for something more like this. So I'm going to start by reminding you about what Liana said on Monday in case when she gave the talk during my talk spot. Thank you, Liana. So, about the general picture for new Refranos. So, you have definitely seen this from here before you. So, conjunctually, So conjuncturally, roughly, if x is an n-dimensional banal variety, this set of deformations should mirror certain neural polynomials and n variables of mutation. And so neither the searching nor the mutation part will play much of a role, but this n variable will show up. So that's the general idea. So what does it mean for a fan or variety to mirror a little object in the map? So here are some things you might look for. So, here are some things you might look for. So, first of all, we could express this by saying that two power series agree, where one power series is the quantum period, or the regularized quantum period. So, this is built out of genus zero from a Witten invariant. And so, this should be equal to something that comes out of the. This should be equal to something that comes out of the Law polynomial. So, roughly speaking, this Law polynomial is telling you some enumerative information about your fine variety. And I can write down this definition easily. So this is the sum from i equals 0 to infinity. Power series equals t. And the coefficient in front of i is just the constant term of f raised to the i. So that's, you could have just that. Look for something more. Look for something more. So if you also have one, or I guess you could just have two, but if you, in addition to one, you could add that you get the quantum cohomology ring of your final variety, which is a deformation of your cohomology ring using genus zero once again. You could have you get this from the Jacobian ring of your Laurent polynomial. Or maybe more carefully, you might need to use like all the Laurent polynomials to get the whole quantum cohomology ring. So each one should give you some information about the quantum cohomology ring, and all together should give you the whole thing. So that's the second condition. And this is the one that I'm going to mostly be thinking about today. And then thirdly, which has not really come up, but just But just for completeness, you could also ask that this whole picture should be compatible with Calabianger symmetry. So, if you're more familiar with Claviano Michi. More familiar with collabionar symmetry. Yes. What's compatible with the colours? So I'm sort of thinking of the Tauric picture. So is that enough or? So you say where if you take your anti-canonical collabiale inside your meta variety, that is nearer to compactification of a fiber of the Laurent polynomial. So something like that. So those are some things you could ask for what it means for this here to be narrow. So one reason why this is a conjecture is that most of the parts of this are a theorem for food for our varieties. So there's a lot of people, a lot of work. I can tell my lap on the yellow. Which is that if X, and all my final varieties are going to be smooth for this talk, so if X is a final part variety, this is. And you can add something more, so you can say if this is a final Torque variety or a nice Variety or a nice sub-variety of your torque variety than if it's true. But what I mean by a nice sub-variety is a torque and the intersection. And so at least for torque varieties, if you're interested in just finding Laurent polynomial mirrors, somehow once you can obtain a Laurent polynomial mirror for a intersection by looking at the larger. Mirror for a tire intersection by looking at the round palm manual mirror but ambient space. And so when I think about breast mandium and subvarieties, I'm not just interested in them for their own sake, but also hopefully to understand your constructions for sub-varieties inside them where you want to generalize complete intersections to something of bisections of vector bundles. So that would be the more long-term goal, but I'm going to be talking about just the ambient spaces for now. I've just erased number two, which was the condition about the quantum cohomology rank. So I'm just going to tell you a little bit more, because it's going to guide or provide motivation for some of the other constructions, a bit more about the second condition in the case of a torque variety. So let's write vector identity as a GIT function. So GIT function to the vector space E, by substar C stars with R, V C to the capital N, and this T. So T is acting with some physical weight. D1 through dn. So then we need to define our GIT quotient, which is analogous to sympathetic reduction as we've heard about. So if we think about this character here, we can get coordinates on it using coordinates on this vector space. So coordinates on V give homogeneous homogeneous slash cross coordinates on x. And so why is that? Well, let's give ourselves some names. We need something x1 through xn. So if we take v cross c, and we just take the trivial vector angle over v, and V and we give it an action of t, so linearization using the weight di, then xi is an invariant or equivariant section for this line bundle with a weight. And so that means that when you take this whole picture and you quotient by the t-action, you get a section of a line bundle. So we get a line. So we get a lap of L L I over your torque variety of X I. That means that Xi is inside the cross string of your torque variety. And in fact, your torque varieties all of it is a polynomial ring generated by these capital N's actually. So the these X i's are on a weight basis? They're just coordinates on the N. Just coordinates on C to the end. Just coordinates. So if it's projected states, then it's just the usual coordinates. So if you're not familiar with the cut spring is, you can just think of it as all sections of all line bundles. I trust that that makes sense in the context of what I talked about. All right. So there's a natural map from the cost ring, which is the first polymer ring, to the cohomology of the current rank, which takes your variable xi and sends it to the same. xi and sends it to the thing which is point y dual to the divisor cut out by xi equals 0. And it's like the same thing emotion, which is i. And this is a surjective map, and you can get all of the relations. I mean, so it's a surjective map. And okay, and so you could also send these into the quantum homology of any problem. So as a first step towards building our Laurent polynomial here, let's take w to be x1 up to x capital N. So this is definitely not a Laurent polynomial here. I guess it is a Laurent polynomial. I guess this is a Moroccan polynomial, but it has the wrong number of variables, right? Because we're accepting something with n minus r variables, and this has just n variables. But one nice thing about it, which we'll see comes up later, is that if you take, if we call this map pi and we apply it to w, we get the anti-canonical class of the Tauric variety. And it's like the second description of the anti-canonical class that's the Any description of the anticommonc is the one coming from the Euler sequence of your tort variety. This is a nice description of it. So instead of counting the whole recipe for how you do a lot of funnel maple mirror, I'm now just going to switch to an easy example, but the recipe is so much harder. The recipe is so much harder. So let's take X to be the vector space. And so on that show the cost ring, just we want to send it to the quantum coherence ring of x as going to take, this is just going to be the quotient where we join a point. Adjoint quantum parameter cube, and then we have some relations. So, some are just the relations we get in the cohomology ring, just xi is equal to xj. And then you also get a deformation of the last correlation, it's a deformation of the utilization in color model. So, okay, so how Okay, so how you build your Laurent polynomial out of w as you look and you say, hey, I need to get rid of one variable and I have one equation here, so I'm just going to do that. So I'm going to take f x1 of xn minus 1 plus q plus n minus 1. And this is And this is our polynomial mirror x. And if you do this for a terminal smooth squared variety, you're going to get just enough relations that you can cut down enough equations to get something with the right number of variables. I think you're cooking things up using the quantum cohomology ring. You can check yourself, or you can probably take all the way checks. Check that you can see that Jacobi ring of F this gives you the quantum co-watching. So that's one quick picture for a quick picture, a quick description of the picture for toy varieties. So torque varieties are these V mod Ts, right? So a natural generalization is to go to V mod. is to go to V mod mod G, where G is the linear algebra regular group. And all of my G's are just either the product of GLRs. That makes it more comfortable. And so why is this a natural place to consider next? Well, first of all, clearly a easy generalization. But then secondly, let me just take this down. Natural generalization. And then, secondly, most plant varieties are expected to be nice, meaning generalization, the intersections, sub-varieties of these spaces. So if you're looking to understand your So if you're looking to understand neurosimetry for as many thanographies as possible without trying to tackle the whole thing all at once, this is a reasonable place to start. And so I think there's only one known counterexample to say that not all fanal varieties are this, which is in dimension 66, but certainly all three-dimensional Thano varieties and all no four-dimensional Thano varieties can be written as a subgroup in this space. So this includes gas magnets and zines. Okay, so I want to talk about three different constructions in a little bit. A little bit about how they relate to each other. Not all of them work for this whole class, some of them just work for grassmatiums or glyphies. So the first approach I'll talk about is the target generation approach. There's a little chart on target generation. The second I'll talk about is the abelian non-Abelian correspondence. And then the third one is looking the corona mirror. So these first two approaches really rely on just trying to reduce the targeting. And this one here is a much better construction, but it's a more specific construction. And it's harder to see how it might work with a little bit more lucky. Are there any questions? Can you please slow down? This doesn't either. How did they find the dimension 66 county thing? This is one of those uh this is one of the because everybody's doing the same thing. This is one of those things that Chris was talking about. Things that Chris was talking about. Okay, so first step to our determination. So part of the conjectures About mirrors for final varieties includes the idea that if F here is F somewhere else. So, sorry, perhaps you can just elaborate a second on that. In that case, the moduli space of the finals in question is the modularized space of curves, which for dimensional version equal to is not unirational. On the other hand, if something is the general But what the general look is on a rec quotient variety, then the moduli space will be rational, unirrational by construction. I think it's okay, we can discuss it on the later. No, no, sorry. But what's nice about this is that it proves the method theorem for oldness. Sorry, that's. Thank you for spiriting me trying to answer. So, um so part of the conjecture is that if X mirror mirrors the Laurent polynomial X. Here is the Laurent polynomial X, and I'll say P is the mutant polytope of X. Then there should be a toric degeneration from X to YP, where YP is the torrent variety below the static path. So this gives a way of trying to come up with a polynomial if you have the torque regeneration. So you can just try to reverse. So to find a candidate, so not one that you're going to have a mirror theorem for, but something that might work. Ask if you're given an Um, if you're given an x, you can first construct a torque generation, a nice amount of yes and for it writing yp. And then secondly, choose coefficient to tell F. And how you choose these coefficients has to do with what Lihata was talking about on Monday, which is to choose it compatible with as many mutations as possible. So the first such example of this Such example of this would have done with the rest man yet using the Gulf of Seth page. So, I'll first draw some features for the mathematian, and then I'll draw some features for the light writing. My graph noddings are graphs nodding with quotients. So, I'm going to figure that out. Quotients, so m is bigger than r. Sorry about that. So to get the Galvin-Tetland degeneration, I draw the ladder diagram for an R, which is just an R by n minus R boxes. So for example, if we have her Like we have our seven and three by four grid like this. Yeah, we'll want the smaller one as well. So for a figure two would be two by two. And so you can use this grit to cook up a quiver. If you add vertices and an orientation, you can go to a quiver. Once you have a quiver, if you add a dimension vector in a stability condition, you can get a quiver moduli space. And if you've chosen your dimensions To be one, you're going to get a torque variety, which is the torque generation of the Grassmannian. So, for example here, you should draw your vertices like this. And this is a quiver if you speak of moving that way and that way. But instead of giving you a careful construction about the quiver moduli space, About the quiver moduli space, I'm going to skip to telling you what the polytope is, or rather what the Laurent polynomial is, because that's what's most relevant. So you get P slash F, because in this case all your coefficients are just going to be 1. You draw a dual diagram. So for part two, you add You add a vertex on each square, and then you add arrows like this. Two arrows are sticking out. One here and a cube here, and then a variable for each of your internal vertices. And so P is just the new polytope. Where F is the sum over all the arrows in the dual equipper, where you take the head over tails constructions that you take for each arrow, you take the variable associated with the head, the arrow, over the variable associated to the tail, not the arrow, at the arrow. That is just what the Laura polynomial is that you get out of the PDA. So for I think we've got silly out of the action meat bike and five choppy plants and meat. Fadier, chopping on me, Kim and Last Drachen for play, which we'll talk about in a moment, is that there is a profit generation from your to historic writing. And the conjecture, if you take part, is that this is all the wrong mono here. This is over on the air. And ah, this you mean it satisfies like one? Yeah. Ilana, I have a very stupid question, but I'm always kind of confused when I read these theorems. These theorems, is it of LF or the dual of the new control of L? I take the spanning faction. So I take the spanning variety. So it's the same as taking the Turker ID as we expect it to. Okay, perfect, thanks. So what do these HPs look like? I'm guessing not, like, it doesn't have to contain zero and then just shift into zero. Yeah, it can look like that. They have only vertices. But then the. But then the p that you obtain, isn't it? It is? It is a backup. Just the killer. Okay. Any other questions? Two model is a we don't want to talk about it, but it's the variety of representations of a machajigma fur uh so it's um it's like the king's construction program for moduli space, but not the machajigma one. That's it. I said so. So, this is a different degeneration than the different one to the order of polypo of the promoter cross-polyphysiology. No, it's the order of polynomial. It is the order of polypoke. That's why I was asking about the dual. The dual would be the order. Okay. Yeah. But in this picture, so yeah. Paper so they what aspect of mirrors have to be because they do say something about it there. What do they say? So from my memory, what they say is so they so they do this for flights, which I'm about to talk about, and they say that this is, they conjecture that this is going to be a, like gonna have the right is gonna satisfy condition number one that I talked about with the quantum period. Although they were using slightly different language. They were using a slightly different language. So, how can you generalize this? So, the flag varieties. So, if we think about our flag varieties, which again I write backwards, so this is a descending list of integers. This is a tower of x minus buckles. Of X9 metals. So you start with Ger N R1. You have your topological quotient bundle on top of it. You take a relative residentian of this using R2. And you just, now you have another topological quotient bundle, which you pull for that one, two, R3, and you just go up like that. So you have a bunch of like little grass magnians here. Like little grass magnetians here. And you just build your new ladder diagram using the little diagrams for each of these. So if we have F L 421, we've got the 4, 2 part, and then we have the 2, 1 part, and then the fact that this is like a tower should mean that you just sort of glue the 2, 1 part onto there. I'm not having built your polyto, like that, but you drive the whole. How do you draw the whole background here? That powers for the slide riding. Not approved, but you do. And you can push it a little bit further. So you can generalize this to some quiver flag varieties. So quiver flag varieties are also towers of grass landing. Are also covered with grass onion bundles. So you start with the base grass onion, but now maybe you take several copies of your tautological bundle, and maybe you add some trivial bundles as well. And then now you've got, you know, Q1, you've got your Q2, so you can use your Q2 to something, plus we've got Q1, so copy this up. The trivial one, I can just keep building up. So that's what a footer flag write is, which is another generalization of the V mod loggy. So despite a long-standing wish, I have not been able to build 3D grids like this to accommodate all different types of quivers. But if your quiver is pretty simple, Types of quiveries, but if your quiver is pretty simple, something like this. So maybe that's not a helpful picture. So if we're just having depth of these and it's not too bad, then you can build ladder diagrams which look more or less like this. And I've shown that this is a start the generation of these simple types of coinverse ladder varieties and get kind of that one. And get candid when I'm not a lawyer. Now you say candidate in the sense that if we start adding in some sub-varieties here, I have lots of different four-dimensional examples to play with, so I can come up with about 99, exactly, I guess, 99. I guess 99 polynomials. I can't prove that they're mirrors satisfying one, but as it happens, you can compute both periods. So you can compute the power series for the Laurent polynomial, and you can compute terms of the power series from the Whitman brand. So you can compute 20 terms and check that they're the same. So it'd be really bizarre if they were not actually muted. They're like 10-digit numbers that you're checking, but in kind of theoretical. Yeah. Sorry, I missed. So for flags, Sorry, I missed. So for flag varieties, is it known that they're actually the mirrors, or is that also just a conjecture? So Connie and Reach prove it for Grassvanians and for flag varieties. Which is why I'm recording here, so great. The first real theorem outside the top context we get for these kinds of things. Okay. Okay, and so just because I want to start talking about quantum cohomology ring, I don't know any way, maybe someone in the audience does, how these target generation approaches should give you with comparing the quantum cohomology ring. So it seems to me that you need something like some map from the cost ring of your target generation to the cohort model, your quantum cohort ring of the thing you started with. And I don't know if there's any reason why that should have chosen. If any reason why that should have chosen. So the second approach is the union and male unit correspondence. So let's think about a general theme on hot G. So for the third variety, when we have coordinates on B, this gave coordinates This gave coordinates would be modified T. And so it's not true if you replace this T with G, sadly. However, if we take E with T here and we make this T to be sitting inside G, the maximal torrent, then this, so So we take, sorry, we have our VMAP on G, we choose a maximum torque sitting inside there, and we look at the GIT quotient with that group instead. We get a torque variety, and now we have, now we get coordinates on it. And so example, so if we take G1 black G. G1 block G to be R by N matrices quotiented by GLR. This is the Gravistadian QNR. Then its abelianization is our copies of TMI as well. So it's another, it's a Thanotoric writing that you're getting if you started with a Thanochant function. And so the abemian-non-abemia correspondence. The Abedian-non-Abedian correspondence is a series of results relating various properties of V mod1G and V mod1T. And not all the results are just for vector spaces either. So names here are Sean Martin and Rachel Webb, talking about name as a bias. They were first. First. So, but I don't want to talk about all of those. But one thing that does come up is that you can compute the quantum coordinate range of V mod marg from V mod R T when V mod bar G is a correct line, right? So Then, so what does that mean? You have a quantum chromology ring of your big torque, right? You have a lot more of the card group here, so you need to specialize in quantum parameters. So, I'm going to do that by drawing a bar. Then, you really want some more symmetry here, so you have a while group action on this. So, I'm going to take the while invariant part here. And then you need to quotient by something, and you quotient by the annihilator. Promotion by the annihilators of a special class. And you obtain that. An important part. So the Goo Sharp mirror proposal, which is a beginning and not a bealing corresponding approach, says adapt the mirror of B1 to get the mirror for B1G. And so if you have W, which I talked about at the beginning, sitting inside the cost ring of V mod 1 T, well, this, we can talk about how it maximum. Well, this, we can talk about how it maps into the quantum coherent ring of m mod 1t. We can add a bar, we can quotient, and then we can send it to the quantum co-modulate ring of m mod 1t. And if you start with the same w that you get from p mod t, do this map here, pi, you again obtain the anti-canonical class of your p mod t. Have you written on the file right now? No, no, no. This is evil. Oh, you can probably retain that territory now. Yeah, just right. Thank you. How long does that take off? So if we continue our example of the graphitolia, then Then our W is going to look Rv, it's R by N matrices, so I'll just use the usual matrix coordinates for that. So then you're going to get X11, X1N, R1, Rn. And so you can then adapt it, and you're going to get something. Something. I've adapted basically by specializing the quantum parameters. So I want to get to a figure coordinate here, so I can maybe just briefly say this, which is that for all the quantum module results, is that this sharp hair does compute. Compute the quantum login of a word like R. But somehow, when you start with this W and you are trying to cut it down to something which has the right number of variables, you can never cut it down to the right number of variables using just relations from V1. Using just relations from V mod 1 T. So you can score the right quantum cohomology, but you always end up with something with too many variables, same number of variables as V mod1 T. So it's not a Lawrence polynomial mirror in the sense that I started with. But it is a very general construction of worthwhile anymore. Okay. So now I've got 20 minutes, right? Probably 22 would be in the Okay. So I feel awkward giving this part in part on Patty, so she can correct me as I So unfortunately I've erased it, so I'll erase this just for completion and then try it again. So So the pay may not have been in correspondence here, had our W, which was written in the coordinates on V, which are not coordinates on V mod mod G. And somehow that is the whole problem with trying to cut down to the right number of variables. So one way of motivating. One way of motivating the supercoordinate mirror is to say, hey, let's write down a mirror that is written in the coordinates of the Grasspannon. So you can define W inside the cockstring of the Grasspanian, which is just a bigger quite different. So I'm going to index my... So I'm going to index my favorite coordinates by coefficients. So these are minor of this. And there's a one-to-one correspondence between partitions fitting inside an R by N minus R grid and choosing R column here. So that's the same thing. So I'm going to choose that index. So, I'm going to choose that index. So, we want to write down some of them in there. And we want, like for torque varieties, we want that pi, well, we want, so for torque varieties, we had to map pi from the cock screen to Coke Malt. Coca-Mall. And it turns out there's also one for the grass fanion. And this is due, I missed the spelling, the names, but it's something like this. Yeah. Sorry, FDNF. Sorry, how about that? I didn't mean to. So we do have a map like this, which then So we do have a map like this, which sends, just like for Twerk Fridays, which sends the fluberport to lambda to the Schubert class as lambda. And you can think of this as a share polynomial inside the churn rooms. Q, the topological potential cuts up. So the resulting set of this map is really fine. So we want As well, by me. So we want some map, some w such that pi of w is the axioms cost of the graph by the n. And so that is, to record that mirror is one example of that. So if we just do dirt for Q and we take W yes. Yes. Well, each of these terms here so maybe I should just remind you that this is n terms the hyperframe class, which is x box. Hyperframe class, which is x box. So each of these terms here is obtained by computing f box, quantum product, s something maximal rectangular. So if you take, let me do this one as an example, and then I look So X box, constant product, this is this. So S box, quantum homology rate is the ratio of that to that. And when you send this under pi to the quantum mode rate, you're going to get a S box. You're going to get four of them, so you're going to score the quantum homology. Sogacrogens are not algebraically dependent. And indeed, this has too many variables to be a Laurent quantum in here. But you can, in each cluster, Each cluster, you can expand in here into a Laurent polynomial in the right number of variables. But you don't get just get one romantic mirror, you get, well, you don't get just got one romant clinom yield, you get one for each cluster check. And so then the parent of Marsh I reach. I reach is that first of all, the climate homology ring of the draft sign is the Jacobi ring of the Fluger protein here, where the identification comes from that map high. So we can take a fluggle coordinates as Schuger passes. So if you take a partial derivative, that tells you how to understand the relationship here in terms of quantum relations. And then secondly, That in each plastic chart, the Laurent polynomial get is a Laurent polynomial in the sense of one. So it has the right power series. And so this proves the long-standing conjecture of the Gucci correction. Long-standing conjecture, which you show, which is that the HX conjecture, which is that the Galthan Setland Toric Degeneration Mirror is a mirror. A year. So that's true. That part is easy to show. The first part, because if you take one particular cluster chart, you end up getting something which is isomorphic to the Galvin salon charge regeneration here. So for error part two, You expand WP in the rectangle cluster chart, which is the one of all rectangles. And that's going to give you some Law polynomial. And the isomorphism between that and EHX mirror is given like this. This. So remember the EHX mirror with this head over tails where we had a variable for each square here. And so I can tell you what that variable maps to. And so it maps to this one here, this one here, this one here, and this one over here. So in general, these are going to look like p i plus j over p plus. J over P I minus R dot J it. Once they have this part, they show the color. And so in the last part of my talk, I want to talk about generalizing the two presentation. So for any either flag variety, in Taipei, or flipper flag variety, so anything built. So, anything built by taking this iterative tower, that's not a unique approach. You're going to be able to, you know, you've got this tower, verb, something, another verb, another type of something, another verb, and so forth. Each of these are going to bring up pausological backouts. And so we can think about the cohomology. So we can define S i lambda to be the Sher polynomial in the churn root of the IX chi vital quotient by all. So, and then So and then I'm sorry, what did you just say? I want to talk about not Schubert classes, I want to talk about Scherpolynomials in the comal algebra, clinical algebra, and flight variety, or clear flag variety. So I'm going to, all of these things are towered with graph-Stattenian symbols. So I want to think about Si lambda, where this is the sure polynomial associated with partition lambda. Polynomial associates the partition lambda in the churn roots of the ion topological bundle. But some of these are sugar classes. Yes, not all of them are, but I don't know what lambdas, but yeah, yeah, sorry. And so you're going to be able to come up with a map like for the Grassmannian from the cost bin to the cohomology bin. And your anti-canonical class, just like for the Grassmannian, is going to look like a sum of Like a sum of hyperplane classes where each of these hyperplane classes comes from one step in your classroom. And so you can just do exactly like Marshall and Rich do and take a sum over your steps and your tower and take a sum over lambda, which is maximal rectangular, just like they do, and get You and get an expression of your anti-canonical class in this game. And use that to cook up a cleavage coordinate error. So let me write what it looks like for the side variety at L41. So in this case, we can multiply by the NP set. So we're going to have our GRE42 part. So we have this plot here, this plot here, this plot here, and then we just multiply. Here, and then we just multiply by s by the box and see what we get. We're going to get this. Here we're going to get two terms. We're going to get a quantum parameter. And here we're going to get this. And we're going to be able to get some terms coming from the 21 step, which And you can compute these a number of different ways, but one way is to use that abelian abelian correspondence description of the clinical module of your flip, right? So this is what you get. Now we can just replace this law with P's, and we get something which looks like a huge coordinate here. But and you can do this, this recipe makes sense. Um makes sense for any tower brass magnet bundles. Or cover like any one. But it doesn't work, although it almost works. And so And so the problem seems to be these negative coefficients. So if you have a general code or flag variety, there's no clear way to fix these negative coefficients. But if you do have a flag gravity, there's the Schubert basis, which is positive. And so if you just rewrite all of this inside the Schubert basis. Inside the sugar basis. So now this is going to be and then now you'll be ready to flug a coordinate mirror, you get a network. So if you so So if you, so positivity makes this work. And so in what sense does this work? What I mean is that when I have A playwright, this approach gives a compactification. of the Galvan palette mirror. So by doing the quantum sugar calculus, you end up with something which agrees with another mirror, given by a completely different approach. And in examples Fixing the basis, the quantum co-moduling of your cooperative variety from maybe the more natural one to something else to make it more positive. And then running this recipe also gives verifiable, like you can check if there's a bunch of coefficients, but not provable for offering errors. So this suggests, I think, something interesting going on between positivity and coefficients, like positivity structure coefficient. Coefficients, like positive structure coefficients inside the quantum homology move and tree. And then my last minute, I'll just three minutes. Okay, my last three minutes. So Recently, with the chen, it took us a surprising amount of work compared to how simple the construction was, you showed that if WC is the expansion of thicker coordinates. Coordinate mirror in some cluster chart. Then there's some map a little curious and I'll tell you about sometime from the cocks ring of product or experiment to the quantum hologram ring of your plate variety. Of your plate variety, such that if you take this, you take a partial derivative of your Morent polynomial mirroring map cluster chart, and you send it to the quantum polymer G ring, it evaluates to zero just like you'd expect. But this map is weird. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? How weird is it?
