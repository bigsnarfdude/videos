I want to thank the organizers for inviting me and also people for inviting me to Edmonton for a couple of days before this. Right, so you can see the title. I changed it a bit to say exactly what would be the main topic. So initially the title was Vast Server Nature and R5. Now if you wanted a Vast Server Nature and RFI, I think after the book of the The book of the parallel group, we should write another book, but so I have to concentrate a bit, so I decided I would center on finite tails in this talk. So let me remind you of the definitions. So you have a field, KS parallel closure, the Gala group, a smooth projective geometric connective variety of the K. Connected variety of the k, the function field of x. X bar denotes the variety of the separable closure. L will always be a prime different from the characteristic. And for any j in z, you define q l by z l j as a direct limit at the u L n tensor j. The j for j positive, we'll only use j positive. So if fix i, you define the isentrified communist group of x. Isentrified community group of X in the following way. So, this is a notation, or this one. In fact, I use this one because it's shorter. By definition, what you take is you take the Galois commercial, the function field of X, whose coefficients in this module, and you look for each point of credential 1 on X, there's a resume map going to Hi minus 1 of Qn mod Z L I minus 1 of 2, I minus 2. And you take the kernel of this. And a fact which is not obvious on this definition is that these groups are k-parshun invariants as sins subjective properties. So I think everybody in the audience knows this. There are various ways to study this, but La Cogus plays a big role in proof that is parasitic ramps. And there are some conjectures behind this. Okay, so. Okay, so so first cases are H one N R X Q mod Z L Q L mod Z L well this is uh this one is simple, it's simply the detail homology of X Q L mod Z L and the second one H2LR is the L parallel part of the browser X. Now these groups interact with the Picard group. So for instance this one up to the twist has to do with uh the torsion in the Picard group. The torsion and the pick out. And there's this famous exact sequence which started being using, I think, by Schaeferich, Manin and Iskowski back in the 70s, PICX and also Eastern Barn. PICX goes to PICX bar enjoined by Galois. Then you ask whether a class which is enjoyed by Galois comes from PICX, and there is an obstruction in the power of K. And this goes on into the sequence where you have a kernel of the power of X goes to the kernel. Where you have a kernel of the bar of x goes to the bar of x longer, and then the next one is h1g pickx problem. And I don't say what comes after that. So the next group, H3 and I2, interacts with the chunk of co-dimension two cycles when there are isomer curves. So I'll start by giving such a relation, but the time range is still over an arbitrary field. So, in the statement here, I know k to options here. It's just I'm not going to use this sequence in the sequel, so you might as well say k extra characteristic zero to stop questions. So, we take x most projectives algebraic connected, we assume there's a rational point, and then we make the following assumptions that over the algebraic closure, the variety is unirational. That is, it's a dominant map from its projective space to x1. Light that the picard actually is just a matter of. That the picard actually is just a matrix. There's no continuous false. You assume that the product x-bar is zero, and you assume that t3 and r of x-bar tu mod is zero. And then, so, okay, this is far from asking that the variety is rational, but typically if you want the variety to be rational, these are conditions you would want to put. Then there's a long exact sequence, which to some extent is. Extent is the best you can do. Want to do an analog of this, which is you take the part of the char group which dies when you go over to the algebraic program. Here you have H1 and T with values in some object which to classical algebraic geometers is a monster, et x bar tensor k star, k bar star by a switch to k bar instead of k star. Of j's. And then there's this HTML file here. Then there's the co-current of the map and ch2 of x23x1 by g. And then there's a mapping to h2 g pick x bar tensor f bar. What is f? F is key. Ah, sorry. F is key. Yeah, I should have corrected everything last night, but F is key. Thank you. No, no, it's important. It's not a function filler, it's key. It's awesome. Filler, it's killing. It's awesome. So you see, if you want to, so the group which you have here, normally what we would have would be the kernel of the map of this group to what happens over Delgembert closure. Like put zero here. So that's all. And so you see, if you want to conf, I mean, if you think of the classical case of peak x, pick x bar and line by g, well, you see, well, you know, you have some obstruction. First of all, for peak, there was an injection. Picx goes to pick x bar and by. An injection, pKx go to px by nine by g. For CH2, you will stop having injection, so you might have an abstraction, you have some torsion there. And then the cool kernel here, which when you have a reson point, in the classical case, when you have a reson point, this map here is, well, this map is zero with bar of k to bravo x is injective. Here, it's not the case. So it's a bit hard to solve. There's a module sequence which you can write down without these assumptions. So what I wrote down is this sequence is proven by using algebraic K-series and subtle things in algebraic K-series. And because I put these assumptions, I managed to write it down in this file, which you don't see the word K-Series, K-Commology, but it's behind the spectrum. Behind this paper. So, the CRM has a long history. They started with a paper of Spencer Block in 81, then many people worked on this. Apolog in in particular, they did something very close to that, 93 and 96. And as I said, results in the case here are crucial to the proof. Now, even if you start with some variety of a C which is unirational and which satisfy H30X2 equals 0. Zero. I mean, a standard problem in complex algebraic geometry is: if a variety is universal, is it rational? Or is it stably irresolution? Is it retractable? Is there a decomposition of the diagonal? And so this is an obstruction to, if this was non-zero, this would be an obstruction to rationality. But because for projective space, this is just really zero. But if you want to disprove the rational C, even if this is zero, you may try to disprove the rationality by producing a big field containing C, such that this quotient here is non-zero. If x was parsing to Pn, you would have H3O5 of Pnk2, which would be reduced to H3K2. This group need not be zero, actually. If this quotient is not zero, then definitely. This quotient is not zero, then definitely xk is not parallel to pnk, and therefore x at the beginning was not parallel to the n of the c. And so, what happens in this case is that one encounters a question which has been raised in complex geometry, the existence of a universal convention two cycle. I come back to this slide. Here it happens. You started with cash very close, but then you you apply this over some big scale capital K. Some big field capital Q. Typically, I don't know, the interim Jacobian or something, the function field or the intermediate Jacobian, something like that. And then you have some natural classes here, and you wonder where they come from there. And this question is closely related to the non-vanishing, the possible non-vanishing of that quotient over capital K. So what calls this the universal conversion cycle? Connor cycle. Anyway, there's a connection between these two problems. So today I want to concentrate on the case of varieties of a finite field. So if you have a variety of finite field, all varieties regularly close field, there are natural maps. But if I, to start with, over any field, there are natural maps from the charger. map from the charger with several function I to H2I of X with question U and N tensor I. If you want to pick projective limits, if the ground field is bad, you run into problems with using, I mean you have to use continuous Ital Ka Maji Rajansen and this is more complicated here. We don't need that. We just take this group here. It's simply the projective limit of the H2I X U and Sorry. And so there are maps. And so there are maps induced by the from the finite level from CHILX tansor hat ZL to this. This tansor hat means that you take the you take the projected limit and the CHIX module L to the L. So let me come back. So we want to study this map over a final shape. If I is one and G is finite. And g is finite or algebraic tools. There's a short exact sequence coming from the cumulative exact sequence. It gives you this short exact sequence, peak x tensor zl, h2 eta x z l1, and then the projective limit of the problem x divided by l to dn. And there's a famous conjecture due to Tate that if the field is finite, for f is a finite field, and x over a smooth interjective, part of x should be finite. Should be finite and hence, and in fact, equivalently, this group on the right-hand side should be zero. So the take conjecture even with tells you peak x tensor ZL is isomic to each with XZL alone. And in fact, because this co-kernel is torsion free, so if you take a TL of something, it's always torsion free, having this conjecture with ZL coefficients or with QL coefficients is the same. Is the same. Can you? Can I repeat what? What TL means. TL is. Producing by Lord, so for cycles of connamation at this high. Connor mentioned at this eye, Tate, long back, mid-1960 and 62, something like that, made the conjecture that in the higher dimension, you should expect not that the co-connect of C Psi x plus ZL to be psi x Z L Y 0, in the case of I equals 1, but you should expect that this co-conno should be finite. So in fact, an equivalent way to state is that you can. An equivalent way to state is that you can inject it as a QL goes to H2L I XQL of I is rejected. Note that these groups here are said L modules of finite type. So for i bigger than 1, there are examples by Totaro, for which the coconut is not zero. So this conjecture here has a parallel in the complex world, which is the Hodge conjecture. World, which is the Hodge conjecture. And so the Hutch conjecture is a conjecture about homology with rational coefficients. And long back, actually, even Grotendik at some point believed that people had conjectured an integral version of the Hodge conjecture. But quite famously, Petia produced counter examples over the complex field. And then later, when people got interested. And then later, when people got interested in this topic, another just counterexamples of a finite field for this integral take conjecture were made. So for R arbitrary, there are counterexamples. But curiously, there is one case where the integral take conjecture is open. It is the case of cycles of tension one. So cotangent D minus one and a variety of tension. So the question is: is the map CH if? If the map, if you take any smooth projective variety of dimension d over a finite field, if you look at CHD minus 1x dash zl plus 2h2d minus 2xzl d minus 1, is this math point to that's a local question. Let me and so uh well we okay, ah, forgot. Of colour. We want to study this problem. Now, this theorem, which is due to Brudo-Kahn, and in the paper with Khan, we made a different proof. In any case, the proof uses blood-catal. And there's a discussion between Bruno-Kahn and me that Bruno-Khan says, well, it's enough to use bacroid susilin, whereas in the paper which we had written with Waza, which is mimicked in that paper here, we use K3, but never mind. Assume L different from P. Assume L different from P, phi equals 2 and x smooth and protective. Here are two groups, which are two finite groups, which are isomorphic. You take the cooker of the tape map, CH2x tensor ZLL, to H4XZL of 2. As I say, this is a ZN module of finite type. You take the torsion subgroup of this finite type of this ZN module of fine type. This is one group. And the other one is you take this rhythm X. One is you take HRA number xql dot zl of 2 and you divide it by its maximal divisible subgroup. It is less obvious that this group is finite, but it is. And the theorem is that in fact these two groups are isomorphic. This is so, in fact, the story I did behind this paper is that Before that, Claire Reda and I discussed the analog in the context of the integral pass conjecture for cycles of currents in 2 over the complex field. And we had a similar result over the complex field. And then Bruno Ken wrote a paper precisely Janssen's continuous copy that would cover all the possible things, and then here there's a different. things and then here there's a different more elementary proof using counting arguments like the arguments I like and 80s these two groups are isomorphic so if you want to understand so so so in one conjectured by tape the coconut should be final and the integral conjecture would require that the group to be zero so in particular if the interval take conjecture is true If the interrelative conjecture is true, H3NR X for any smooth projective right of fine field, this H3NR X2 should be divisible. So let me talk a bit more about H3NA X2. There's no NL part too. Yes, there is, because by convention, this is H3NL XQL with ZL of 2. I'm sorry, maybe I should write. I'm sorry, maybe I should write because it's not a standard. I wanted to make it short, but let me write it once and for I mean this h i is by definition h i n r x in the toka 2 L zero of zero. So, as far as 2 is concerned, is H3 and R, there are natural questions. First question is whether H3 and R, X2, is always finite. That would be another higher degree analog of the question for the problem X. Now, the comment about this question is that this is a complete question. You could ask whether for a smooth predictive writing of a finite field, For a smooth projective variety of a finite field, are all these groups finite? But I know the new counterexample is not. The second question, which is more bizarre, is whether this group the X3 and R X2 is zero. Well, that's what we hope, but that's a strange question because you look at the analysis question for the broad. Look at the analogous question for the bra of x, it's very easy to produce smooth projective surfaces of a finite field, but the bra of x is a non-zero finite group. And then the question three is if this group is non-zero, at least produce interesting classes of variety for which H3NR x2 is 0. So what is the situation? If the dimension of x dot was 2, we know that h3 and r x2 is 0. This goes back to 95. x2 is 0. This goes back to 1983, and people were discussing their higher classification. Like this statement here is vanishing, as an analog in a higher dimension, which is that hd plus 1xd is 0 for a d-dimensional variety. But if we come back to the topic of interest in this talk, which is h3 and rx2, for d at is 5, there exists x subtunction d with h3 and r x2 non-zero. Non-zero. So, and then I produce rather simple examples back in 2011, which were simply vibration of three-dimensional quadrics over P2 over a finite field. And then there exists, quite recently, Scavian Suzuki produced examples in action 4, which raised our X2 is non-zero. So the case that remains, which in fact is very interesting, Very interesting is Times and 3. And one reason why it's very interesting is that Tampenson 3 for the take conjecture is if you want to make an injection on dimension, this is the place where you bump it to where it resists. There are many results which you can reduce to the prominent dimensions 3 and what happens. In particular, it's a conjecture for one cycles. Conjecture for one cycle. Okay, some known cases. A case which is easy, I mean easy module, some things that come from KCRI and Mercury Associated and Plot Cato and everything, is the case of quadratic bundles over a church. So, of course, if you take a quadratic bundle over a church, if you take a quadratic bundle of relative dimension at least three, it's not interesting, because quadratic bundles over three over a church are finite field. So the total space is rational, and so all the possible invariants you can think of as integral zero. The case which is interesting is connect bundles over a row of a child and bundles of quadric surfaces over a church. And so in those two cases, if you compute a strain over file, if you look at the straight fiber, you have a quad rate over a field. And precisely, production one and two and all the. And one and two, and all except that quadrate, Cambras and Suchata proved that the H-Regul of Y comes from H3 of the bottom field. But H3 of the function field of the curve of phi field is zero. So this is a trivial consequence of the Kanroh sensitization. The case of Kunik bundles on a surface is due to Parmenin's erosion in 2016, and it's really quite a remarkable piece of work. It uses also some ideas coming from Bitcoin. Uses also some ideas coming from papers of salt map, also spread. And so they proved it. They proved this vanishing for connect bundles over a surface, any surface. And the consequence is that if the integral plate project for one cycle holds on the surface, for instance, if the surface is a curve cross P1, then it also holds for one cycle on the threefold X. And an amusing correlate of that result is the case of smooth cubic threefolds. Smooth cubic free folds. Take a smooth cubic free fold. People have studied smooth cubic three folds forever. And so they know that the variety of lines, they've studied the variety of lines, and the variety of lines is a smooth projective variety, which is geometrically integral. Geometric integral over a finite field, you always have a zero cycle of degree one. So you can find expansions of co-prime degree. Of your brown field over which this variety acquires a point. But that means that it acquires a line, that the cubic hypersurface acquires a line. Once you have the line, you can look at the P2s that go through the line and you transform your cubic three-fold into a conic bundle of a P2. And so you apply the result of parallel search. Okay, now some examples where we knew the vanishing of this group. So, now to study this, here is another exact sequence which looks similar to the long one I showed you earlier. But you may notice that here I didn't put all this condition which I had in the previous case, which was a one-armature field. In the previous case, I was assuming that the variety charge field was ignorational, that the peak x with the bar of the bar was zero, that the insurance file was zero, without your point border. Yeah, I assume nothing. And so, in general, for any of this perspective, And so, in general, for any simple specific variety, you can try to analyze, you can connect these groups, which appear are interesting: the kernel of CH2 of x equals CH2 of x bar, the co-kernel of the map on torson, of the invariance, and the underflight kamology here, so the part which dies over their regular. So, here in this long sequence, comes up this group here, H shape bar z out of two total. People who are People who are maniacs of the prague group will recognize that this thing here is the non-divisible part of the prague group of X bar. Prague of a right-of-way closure, let's ignore characteristic problems, is an extension of a finite group by a QL by ZL to some bar, I mean for the L primary part, and the L primary pot the the the torsion finite group is precisely this group here. Is precisely the GPA. Actually, not to a twist, but never mind. So, and then in fact, this sequence here admits a refinement, which I won't discuss in this talk, but in the paper of Scarjan Suzuki in 2023, when you look at cycles which are algebraically equivalent to zero. Here, and one should be careful with this group that will come up several times in the talk. The torsion is here. The torsion is here. If I dropped this torsion here, it would still be true that H1GX bar ZLO2 is finite. But it need not be the same group. So this PAP5N, so I mean three years back, Federico Scarville and I, we studied this, we were quite interested in this PAP5N, and the fact that The fact that if you want H3 and RX to be zero, you better have a five subjectives. So Scaria and I, we studied the subjectivity map. We managed to prove the subjectivity for people, when people try to find counter examples for cycles, they try to products of varieties. That's a configuration which is simple but still complicated enough. Complicated enough, but in any case, in that case, we managed to prove that if we take one arbitrary smooth consecutive surface and multiply it by an arbitrary product of curves, the map finally consective. So this looks quite tough. And this was part of, we use that in the result which you brought in that paper. But now Scavia and Suzuki have produced examples also in dampen four, but the MAT file is not onto. So, in particular, the key example of this group here is non-circle. So, the H3NR for varietal dimension 4 need not be 0. So, if we want to study the subjective this map, let's come back to this. So, I keep on going back and forth between codemption two and dunction one. And dimension one. So ultimately, we'd be interested in the variety of dimension three, so that's the same. But there are things which are true at the level of collection two, so for arbitrary varieties, so we can discuss them like this. And then ultimately, we say, okay, in the case of three volts, this is one cycle. So if we want to study this objective of the tape map for cyclotron production two, one can start by analyzing the group here. And there's a Horseshoe spectral sequence that gives you a short exact sequence. A short effect sequence. Here you have H4 eta x2. Here you have the situation where the rate loads are involved by Gala. And here you have H1 of F, this should be a finite field. F is the same as this F. H1 of F is H3X bar ZLF2. And now because of weights resulted by Deline, we know that this group, this H1F, H1F H3x bar ZLF2, is a finite group. And so, if you want to prove the substitute of this map, well, a nice thing is you try to start by looking at the map from CH2 of X2H4, XLR2, and you push it into here, and you try first, or first or second, to show that the classes here at least are reached by CH2 of X tan s. So it's a weaker version of the integral tip conjecture, but it's an interesting one. In fact, it has interesting applications. One, in fact, it has interesting applications when we were able to do that. And then, if you manage to do that, then you look at the classes here, which are homologically trivial, sorry, yeah, and you try to show that these classes cover this group here. We had a map here. So, for the rest of the talk, So, for the rest of the talk, I sketch recent and ongoing work by Scaria Suzuki, Kola Archan, and G.U. Chan. So, there's recent work in complex algebra barometry by Berba-Loten, which has attracted attention to the to various filtrations on the integral convolgi of varieties. So, Berbo-Rotem was this was always a complex field. This was always the complex field. So you can define the notion of divorce, conivo, on the common G. You look at the cong classes which die off some closed subset of the variety. So the first level of this kind of nutrition would be the classes which die on some variety opposite set. So of some single collection, because you can study what. Something of connection. Of course, you can study what happened with study off something of a very small dimension, but that's another story. So in code action one, you ask whether this defines this group, K1, HI, XZL. These are the classes with die and some non-antis are scattered set. But another question is whether so So, if you look at the logarithm sequence, you have HI, if F is a closed set, you'll have HI with support in F of XZL, goes to HI of XZL, goes to HI with UZL, where U is a complement. And you can be can demand more. You can try to get it with F smooth. And I'm cheating a little bit because you should use car responses also in this story, but but let's keep it like this. But let's keep it like this. So, you ask that you're interested in the classes which come from comergy with support in smooth sub-rietlex, smooth closed sub-variety of x. And that subgroup of n1 hi xl is denoted n tilde 1 h i x z l I'm not cheating too much. So, Scalia Suzuki proved the following surrender. Scalien Suduki proved the following theorem. Take hex over finite fields Musset projected. Assume that these two filtrations coincide. So the diffusion by collection of support and the refined filtration where you ask that the component is supported something smooth. Suppose they coincide. Then there is something called the advantage. There is something called the advantage of Copy Map on Omni-Colytrivial Cycles, which actually I actually explained on the previous slide. I look at the classes here, which have trivial image here, and then I can send them into this group. That's the Jacqueline map. So the LIDAN Jacqueline mark on the horse-degreased cycles with values H1F, H3. with values H1F, H3x bar ZF, induces an isomorphism between CH2X algebraic times ZL of two and H1 of F with N1, H3X bar ZL of two. So under this assumption. Now this half here, you have a notion of linear equivalence, rational equivalence and cycles, which you all know. So rational equivalence and cycles, you demand that your family is parametrized by P1. But then you get equivalence. Then you get the algebraic equivalence. You demand that there's a family of cycles parametrized by a curve, a smooth unitary integral curve, but not necessarily a T1. And you want two Rausson points on the curve, and the two fibers will be called Rascon equivalents. Algebraic equivalents. That's the algebraic equivalence. But that's a subgroup of the, and this subgroup, of course, is kind of Is contained in the cycles which are homologically trivial. So, the statement is that under the assumption that the refined filtration coincides with the natural filtration, then get an isomorphism CH2X algebraic tensor ZLF2 with this group H1F, N1, H3 plus ZLF2. So, remember now we're getting classes in here, but initially, But initially we're interested in classes in H1F history. Not N1, but H1F history exposed off to now. Color and Chan have a paper which is a very elaborate paper in deformation of curves and algebraic curves, where they prove the following theorem. We take X goes to C, a dominant morphism of smooth projective variety of F, where the curve at the bottom sees a curve, and the joint fiber is a smooth, judically, separably rationally connected variety of F of C. So if you don't know what rationally connected varieties are, always think of the case which is very interesting is that the geometric generic fiber is a geometry is rational. Coin generally, a variety with a field K and characteristic zero is called rationally connected. If when you go over to any atropic closed field containing the variety, any two points can be connected by a P1, by the image of a P1. And if you're in positive characteristics, you have to make a further condition, so you can see so Cola and Chen, they prove this actually remarkable CRM. And Chandler proved this very remarkable theorem that for such varieties, if you look at the map on this time, we're on one cycle, we're not on collash and two cycles, we're on one cycles. TH1 of X modular algebraic equals in this so-called full-time sense, that is, normally, I mean, people, each time I heard about algebraic equivalence in the past, it was always of an algebraic equals field. So the idea of using it of an arbitrary field is only recently that people started using this. Started using this. But anyway, you can define it. And so you look at C-sharp's module, this Azure Bike equals. Maybe I should write a check. Some gamma here. You have a band here. And you have two points A and B. And you have the same A, and you have segment. A and B R. And you take your name. And you take the relation, I mean, the equivalence relation generated by this. So they proved that the map from CH1 of A to module algebraic equivalence to what happens over algebraic closure of modular algebraic equivalence involved by Gala is an isomorphism. Which, you know, if you think of child groups, it looks very strange in connection to, but it's modular micrographs. And of course, and not, I mean, I should say, of course, we have. I should say, of course, we have that. And there is a strong assumption on the geometry of the variety x, that it admits a map to a curve where the generic fiber is very, very reasonable. So, that's a beautiful result and quite difficult to read. But of course, it goes a long way towards what we want because what Towards what we want, because uh what's interesting here from our point of view is the subjectivity. On the environment on the gallery. So, by a delicate combination of geometric service of this paper of Colar Chan, which I will archive, and of motiv tools, blogs, high HR rules, backwards, Sussex and Voilovsky, Chan in in a paper which is in progress, let's say. In progress, let's say, shows take C over ethical curve, take a three-fold now, equip with a morphism with Zurich Fiber as a geometric rational surface. Then in that case, checks that the Scabia Suzuki condition is satisfied. Pressure and the strong filtration coincide. So if you remember all I said, you The third thing is that we're interested in maps into each fourth bar set out of two, but results which were known before, which are basically 40 years old, which show that in this situation, this map here is an isomorphism. And also, there's an isomorphism here, where I think this uses macroeconomic sub point. And then also H3NR is about 2 is 0. So that's a rectal number. So you have all these properties. And when you put everything together, you get the final theorem. Archive. If you take a dominant morphism of smooth specific radar of fine field, the stuns of x equal to 3, C o curve, entering fine on a smooth geometry rational surface of reference C, then the map here is subjective. Is subjective. Bit conjecture is true, for cycle function two and such are such three false. And the error of that colours is zero. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this path actually is an endomorphism. So now this work of sorry, I didn't want to detail this, but there's work of SUG Saido in 89 and mine in 10 years later. So you take your function free in one parallel and you take X over C as in the serine, so family of rational surfaces over a ch, zero rational surfaces over child, and y is a juncture filter. Then this And this FFC is a global field. So you have a geometry rational surface of a global field. And there's something called the Brahmanian abstraction. So should I say something about the Brahman abstraction? I have time to say it. What do you think? Should I say something about the Brahmanian abstraction? Why already knows about it? No? No, I didn't. If you have k global field Kb computation, you can map, you can define pairings and say X, I'm going to be simple. So Y is okay. I'm going to do it in the case I'm discussing. Discussing what Kinskin's perspective or whatever the Kinskin's perspectives in which are connected. Then I can consider the charge group of zero cycles on X, on Y, map it to the product for these C0 on Y and T V. And then I can send that to And then I can send that to human to q multi. So how do we get this maps? The point is that already for a couple, if I had rational points, I could pair y of kv with the variable of y and then I added the variable qv, kv, which is q which is a subgroup of q malta. Q multi old the reals of QV. The reals of the combustion. So you can pair elements here with the Brau group and learn here. And the fact is that because of Plasma's theory, this tells you that there's a complex product K diagnosed T V plus Q minus N this is the complex this is a complex. The composite is zero. Now you can you can you verify this. You can you verify this with projected image. And if you have the reals and the context, you have to modify a little bit ideal here. And you still have this match for human rather y k meter. And the projection is And the conjecture is for any smooth projective variety of another field, this is exact. So in particular, if we take, if we have a family, say V zero cycles of degree one, which go to one here, this This conjecture implies that there exists a global zero cycle of degree. So you want a local global principle for the index, if you want. And there's a way to write down an abstraction with the Brown group. And the conjecture, which is open for the time being, is that for any specific write-up global field, this abstraction is the obstruction. Fill, this abstraction is the abstraction. So note that there is a strong version here, and there's a weak version here where we just look at zero cycles that you can. So the color red is that for indication we're looking at, that is, a geometrical rational surface over this global field of positive characteristic, the Brahmin obstruction to this zero cycle. To do this, that the zero cycle of degree prime to L is the abstraction, a consequence of the previous theorem we had and the T conjecture. And also the more precise conjecture, which I've now written here, holds over this function three new and variable. So a remark is that the first statement, one here, about zero cycle of the graph, only uses Only uses the color of channel zero because all it uses is a subjectivity of CH2X transfer ZL onto this group. And that follows from the colour, the colour change. So it's only if you want to get But it's only if you want to get all of this, that you have to combine this paper of Skavian Susan and this paper of China. So this is the final theorem. And so we have the color red, which I just mentioned. And so this result applies to smooth cubic surfaces of. To smooth cubic surfaces of a FFC, for which the analog of a number field is not known. For the other big class of geometric rational surfaces, namely Koenig model of P1 and K and number field, that statement was proved by Zerweger in 1988. For Koenig model of P1, K and F of C, as I said earlier, K equals F of C, the serum de colour follow from paramount service, solvent 16. But the case of cubic surfaces had remained. Cubic surfaces have remained mobile. So I'm glad that I have a quarter of another because I'm going to do something which I'm probably not allowed to do. I'm going to add a bonus and talk about something else after that. So anyway, these are references, if you want to have references. So at the LUMI conference in 2015, I gave a survey talk about completion of H3NR for the object of interest in this conference. The object of interest in this conference that is school's comparification for object spaces and classifying varieties. So, if you want to read about this, I refer you to this lectures. And in fact, there hasn't been that much progress on what was known in 2015 in this direction. The relationship with child groups and connection to complex varieties, so this work with Voisna and things around. And also, issue. And also H3NR has been used recently, or it started with work of Ari, Samueli and Sajara, to study the local global principle for homogeneous spaces of Torre, or something which will appear in the next lecture, function phi, one variable of a P and Excel. So there's actually this progress in this direction for multi-arguate algebraic rules by INT and his students. And for the Brahmin and aspect, I refer you to the other slides you can find on the I refer you to the other slides you can find on my replacement. Okay, so are there questions on this part? Are there questions on this part? Or comments? When the pole is done. Sorry, I'm gonna use the poll now. So this is going to be more informal because I integrate very carefully. I thought I would stick with the fine field during the whole lecture. It's also called the bonus in English. You know, when you watch a film and so this is something very recent. So the field S will be R. Be R. So, some time ago, Susanna Sinova asked me a question. She's a new professor at Orsay. She asked me the following question: You take X over P1R. We take X over P1R, a family of two-dimensional quadrics. And you assume that the set of real points is not empty and connected. Question is: Is X rational or not? That is partial, is X partial to be screwed? Does it make a difference if you take affine or projective? No, no, parasimal is just a function of the experience transcendental. No no, but actually I want x to be smooth and projective because for this property of connectedness, I don't want to take away something. But I don't know, x is smooth and x is smooth and projective. I didn't say x of r. But then when you say paracial, it could be paracial to end up instead of P and Pn. That would be good. It's just a question of whether the function field is period transmitted. So my ground is that if, fact, non-fact, if X over D1 are the family of conics. And XLR is not empty and connected. Then X is parasol. This thing will be parasol to be draw. Exercise of the problem. So in greater dimension one, we know the results. In relative dimension one, we know the result. The question is whether we can do it in higher dimension. Okay, so I took the first, I started studying the first example. So first example is this equals u u squared plus one. Oh. You said two-dimensional quadrix, but you can ask a question in a high-dimensional. So, if I had one more variable here on the left, I would mean business, because I could divide the sum of two squares by this u squared plus one, this one also, change the variables, and then I would get a parametrization. But I have just three variables. And why do I put this here? Because if I want Because if I want my family, if I decide I'm going to study already special case and put any parameter on the right-hand side, then the condition you want in general is you want to write u times a parameter f of u, where f of u is the sum of two squares. f of u is strictly positive on r. 'Cause if you have more than if you if you have more if you have like these four four real zeros, then uh you have at least two connected components. You have at least two connected components. So each time when the funny note changes, when the panel vanishes, the sign. So this one is very, very interesting. And I speak to this one for this more work. Okay, so it's easy to show. So here again, I take the smooth projective model. It's very easy to write down the smooth projective model. Bypassing. And so there are just two bad fibers with under fiber zero and infinity when something happens. So it's easy to show that the parameter of x divided by parameter of r is zero. And in fact, also that for any field capital K contained R, the problem of x k divided by k x k x k x k Of xq divided by 1 of q is 0. And also, something I should have noticed from the very beginning is that any object like this oversees rational. Because of the complex field, you have a section, so the total space is rational. So, we're looking at varieties of R, which is just one real. Of R, which is just one real connected component, and which over the complex are rational. So also easy to show that the obvious invariants are trivial. H1R, where they are, is equal to H1X without what they are. So, the next thing you try is H3NR. I'm back to the topic of the lecture. So, what about So, what about this random? X. And for simple reasons, you can stick to the coefficients and work to. So at that point, I should say that you could look at higher HI NR. But if I take any X over R, which is WCD, but of course it won't be. Let me put a y here. Y over R spoose projective action D. If this, if I is at least equal to D plus 1, then it is known by a certain experiment that I proved many years ago, again, Hi, this is this is true. For I bigger than D plus one, it is sorry, this is not true, but Sorry, this is not true, but this is isomorphic to send mod to the power the number of connected components of the real box. So if your variety has just one real connected component and has one, then the NFI complexity group. Group is the unified complexity group is reduced to the thing that cuts up the rails, so you cannot tell whether a fresh alternative method. So, in our situation where we have threefold, HINR for INR bigger than at least four won't give you any information. So, the only one where we try to find something is H3. So, now what you do is that you look at H X over P1 now and you look at the Z fiber. And you look at the zero file. So R of E1, Y of R. And so you start with a class with the underphi. Now by the process, you can browse with CRM. You know that if you take a class ψ in uh H3 and R, uh function field uh of x, sorry. Field of x, sorry, x2. If I push it, I can push it to in 3 and 9 of the zoo fiber with respect to the brown z. K is that multi. And what the candle also tells us is that the plus here comes from history of k is a multi. And but because you start But because you started, this is a standard computation with Brown, but you do the same thing for vitromosic, you look at what happens on the special fibers on P1R. So there's this joint point, there is a point here, and so you have this class here in H3K, but this class, you study the residue of this class at the close points of P1, knowing the abscess, the residue die. So you stop computing. Die. So you stop computing what happens to the residues and what happens up here. And so now I'm not going to detail. I'll say I'm quite close to the end. But well, anyway, the answer is, in this case, if you stop doing this work, you find that indeed Uh indeed uh H3R Z mod two is either of equal to H3R X Zen mod two. And this uses this uses this uses WIPS as a principle for quadrics over Over R of any curve. So if I have a quadratic form over R of P1 or R of a curve, if it has points in all the completions, and the quadratic form is ranked at least three, then it has a rational point. So that goes into the proof. Another version for VIT is that if you take C over R, a curve with no real point, point and problem of C is zero. It's also so that that uses this. And so if you now, what, for the next question is what if you take a bigger field, if you take what if I take k containing r and I try to compute this real x k Xk 10 mod 2 by the same method. You start the same way. Of course, at the joint fiber, you still have the corporate SUDFS ring. But in the end, you pump into the funny question, which I don't know how to solve. And which is essentially going to the question whether the group is trivial. So we take look at our variety here. We take F fill with content R and the question is the following let A and F be such that That c squared is a solution to the equation c squared minus e squared plus one that exists in f is this property is u plus a the sum of four squares in the function field of the variety x over x. Okay, thank you very much, John Meek, for your talk and your bonus time. Are there any questions or comments? Very strange. There there's a similar thing in b domino, but there are similar problems that fail of conics. Problem is that if I have conix, x square plus y square equals a curve of degree, of even degree in p2, the real points. And they compute in their way straight up. I could do it also this way, but I could send the computation straight up for all the reals, but it's their own money. I don't know. Thanks for training. The question is so simple. Is there any chance of attacking this type of problem, these irrational problems, with something like real itself? Something like real itself from only the problem. Well, this is I think this is basically what in that context the web bit we're doing this essentially whatever. But it's tickable with the problem field. So but it's thick with a round field, it's thick stick or r. Or you take equivalent chronology, but it's always CORR. Have they done good or bigger fields? Too huge field towards this question. They probably tried. I mean, I haven't took to them because I'm so afraid that if I tell what you give back something, they will solve the problem right away. About it, but but we're listening right now. We're listening right now. Why did you choose this mutation? I tell you a story. So at some point, Ivanyesh came to Rosse and gave a talk about the fact that there are infinitely primes of the shape x squared plus y4. So, you know, having primes represented by polynomials. Having primes represented by polynomials, I love that because I can put that into the machine submachine and get as a principle. But having just for one polynomial, so and I asked Ivanias to design, what about x squared plus three y four plus? Oh, that would be another 300 pages. So and then I told this story to Sunday. I said, John, the Riemann zeta function is just one function. But now I choose that one because it's the simplest one. And if I can do it on this one, And if I can do it on this one, I certainly would be able to do it for u. Well, it's not even awful. For u equals u. You know, it's a cubic surface, it's singular with a complex. What can you find simpler than that? But for this technique, the conditions are done here. We suddenly work with U times G of U, where G of U is an epositor for M. Any other questions can be? Any other questions can be asked to the coffee grade, after which we will assume that it's lurking. So let's thank Jean-Wigan for the question.
