Okay, thank you, Noah. It's my pleasure to speak about the role of theory in evolutionary biology, and I'm going to add anticology because much of what I'm going to be saying applies to both fields. So theory has an important role in general. If we didn't think so, we wouldn't be here. And it actually has many specific roles since theory consists of a set of techniques and that could be applied to different questions with different goals. We're really a very diverse community topically, but there are certainly Community topically. But there are certainly commonalities across theoretical studies that generate shared interest. And we also face common challenges, including professional challenges and challenges in conveying our work within biology, in which we're minority. I'm going to start by talking a bit about the diverse space that theoretical studies conclude, which is just part of what we're trying to capture under SMTPB. So I'm going to present several continua. The first is from the specific to the abstract. The specific to the abstract, and models can fall anywhere in the space. So, by specific, I really mean models that are tailored to a specific system. So, a nice example of this stems from an empirical paper by Savalain and et al. on sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island. And they pointed out that palms in the genus Howia seem to have speciated without any geographic separation or allopatry, at least into these two species, Fosteriana and Belmoreana. Bel Moriana. And Gavrilites and Vose, shortly afterwards, after this empirical paper came out, published a number of really interesting case studies of sympatric speciation. And one of them, as they describe in their abstract, applies to the Palm. So they say, here we describe and study a stochastic, individual-based, explicit genetic model tailored for this PALM system. And they went on to show that speciation in either sympatry or parapatry was feasible in this system, and they explored different System and they explore different conditions that would make it more or less likely. So you can contrast that sort of model with a very abstract model, which would be meant to apply broadly over many systems, but not actually apply to any one specific system and probably the way it's written. So a corresponding example in the speciation realm would be this model by Dickman and Dobley, which is an adaptive dynamic model of sympatric speciation. And what they showed is if you have a resource utilization curve in a species that Curve in a species that's narrower than the resource distribution, you end up underutilizing the edges of the resource distribution, and that can lead to a branching process. And so this is a very abstract, very general approach to a similar problem. A second kind of continuum we could think about is from the quantitative to the qualitative. And these, of course, are not mutually exclusive. Like the Gavrolitz and Bose paper, for example, is very specific, but it's not particularly quantitative, whereas the Dickman and Dobley one is both abstract. The Dickman and Dobbley one is both abstract and qualitative. A nice example of a quantitative model would be this paper by Maynard Smith and John Haig on the hitchhiking effect of a favorable gene. And among other goals of this paper, they estimate the effect of a single favorable substitution on a link to neutral polymorphism. And they come up with an expression for the aggregate effect of gene substitutions on neutral polymorphisms. And they ended up showing by plugging in some numbers that if you get a population size of about 10 to the 6th, A population size of about 10 to the 6th or higher, you're reducing neutral polymorphisms more effectively by hitchhiking than by drift. A similar question can be approached in a qualitative manner. So a nice example of this is in this excellent paper by Hermason and Pennings on soft sweeps. And this result I'm showing is really from the start of the paper. It's not even close to the main point yet. But they show the probability of fixation of a single mutation following Haldane in 1927 and compare it to the average probability of fixation. It to the average probability of fixation of a segregating allele from standing genetic variation. And they show that the latter can be much higher than the former, especially for weakly adaptive alleles. So similar topic, but very different type of question. This last comparison I'll show is from descriptive and proof of concept models. And this continuum, I think, is very thought-provoking, if vaguer. Some models can be classified as both. But what I mean by this is a descriptive model is really a model that paints a mathematical. Is really a model that paints a mathematical picture or uses math to paint a picture of a specific phenomena. And if it doesn't do this accurately, it's really kind of meaningless. So, I think a great example of this is this paper by Sally Otto and her colleagues, where they highlight the importance of considering variants of concern with the transmission advantage in fitting models of case numbers in the COVID-19 pandemic. So, they have data from different provinces in Canada, and this purple line shows an estimate forward without considering variants of concern. Without considering variants of concern, whereas the gray line considers a variant of concern appearing, I think it was a week before the actual reported date of that variant. And you can see that the case numbers, which are the dots, appear to match much more closely models that consider the variants of concern than ones that don't. So again, if you didn't get this accurately, it would be a little meaningless. So again, painting a mathematical picture. And as I'm going to get into later, proof of concept models are pretty different. So here you're trying not so much to paint a picture as to test. Much to paint a picture as to test the logic of a hypothesis or to develop logic to explain a phenomena. So, a corresponding SIR model that is, I think of more as proof of concept, is this paper by Liu et al. in 1986. And what they do is they test the hypothesis that changing the assumption that the incidence of a disease is proportional to the product of susceptible and infected will actually drastically change the behavior. So, you can see here they have I to the P, S to the Q, and if P and Q is the Q. The Q. And if P and Q, P and/or Q is bigger than one, so here they show an example on the right with P equals two, Q equals one, you can get qualitatively different dynamics. You can get Hop, saddle node, homoclinic loop bifurcations. So we can probably take our own studies and place a dot for each study on each of these lines as to where we would think it would fall. And as theoreticians, we have an appreciation for studies that are scattered throughout these continua. But I'm going to spend a little bit more time talking about this far right of the continua. Talking about this far right of the continuum because I found that studies that fall here are especially hard to communicate to empiricists, and this can be particularly true if you're talking to a broad-based biology department, which of course is going to happen during seminars and during promotion and job talks. So I'm going to illustrate the difficulties that I see here with the story of a model. And I chose for this one that I worked on early in my career. So this is going back to ancient history. So back when I was about a third year or so as an assistant professor, I was working a lot on the effects of learning. Working a lot on the effects of learning and sexual imprinting, which would be acquiring a mating preference based on observations of other individuals, on sexual selection and speciation. And I really wanted to understand what are the evolutionary forces acting on and generated by different types of sexual imprinting. So I presented a version of what I'm going to tell you about as a subsection of part of my tenure talk. And I'm telling the story since the experience of presenting it in that venue to broad-based biology department made an impression on me. Made an impression on me. So, the way I started to explore this question of how these models acted was I allowed three empirically supported types of imprinting to evolutionarily compete in a model. And I did this with an undergraduate researcher, Nora Tram, who is awesome. She ended up doing a PhD in biophysics at the University of Chicago, and she's in industry now. So, the three types of imprinting that we competed are first maternal imprinting. So, this is when the choosing sex, which I'm going to represent as a female, To represent as a female, which is typical, acquires their mating preference by imprinting on the phenotype of their mother. So, this is a trait that they then prefer in males. So, that could be color, it could be song, it could be any sort of trait. Paternal imprinting is pretty much the same thing, but they're imprinting on their father. And oblique imprinting, the juvenile would look at adults in the population at the time and just imprint on them in proportion to the phenotypes that they encounter. So, in order to explore these types of imprint. Explore these types of imprinting and learn more about their qualities. I created a haploid phenogenotypic model, and we competed two types of imprinting strategies at a time. So, we did this at a locus S. So, we had two imprinting alleles. One could be, say, for maternal imprinting. The other could be assigned for oblique imprinting, for example, in one comparison. I had a locus for a trait that was expressed in both sexes. And there was a phenotype tract also in the phenogenotype, which is an imprinted preference for an allele of the T locus, which would be either P1 preference for T1. Would be either P1, a preference for T1, or P2, a preference for T2. So I ended up with eight possible phenogenotypes that we tracked using a system of dynamical equations. And there were a number of other assumptions, and I'm going to touch a little bit more on these later, but these were things like whether viability of selection was occurring, whether imprinting strategies had costs, which the stuff I'm telling you about, I'm assuming they don't. The one on the bottom is important. I assume that females have equal mating success or strict polygyny, which is common in many. Polygyny, which is common in many empirical systems. So I competed first maternal and paternal in printing, then oblique and paternal, and then maternal and oblique. And what I found was whenever paternal is in one of these two comparisons, it fixes. Whereas the maternal and oblique strategies, if you compare them with one another, the result depends. If there's no viability selection, there's no evolution. So these strategies are completely neutral. But if there's viability selection favoring the more common trait maternal fixes, and if not, Maternal fixes and if not oblique fixes. So, the question I really wanted to ask was why. I didn't really care exactly what happened. Our goal wasn't really to show what happened, but to understand the evolutionary forces involved. And this is one thing I really love about theory is you can get at these why questions by digging in a little bit more. And I love doing that part. So, after doing a bunch of digging and a bunch of math, what we figured out was there are two properties that could help us understand these results. The first was this property of imprinting sets, which is a term. Of imprinting sets, which is a term that we coined for this paper. And you can define an imprinting set as a set of all individuals used as a template for imprinting given a particular imprinting strategy. So in other words, a set of individuals that are imprinted upon. So for the oblique imprinting set, for example, it would be all of the adults or all of the males, as I've shown here in the generation at the time. It's going to be the imprinting set. So if you look at all the adult phenotypes, say we have red and brown, there's going to be a one-to-one mapping with the oblique. There's going to be a one-to-one mapping with the oblique imprinting set. It's going to be all surviving members of the previous generation. Again, I assumed females and males had equal frequencies. The maternal imprinting set is actually going to be the exact same as an oblique set. And this is because I assume that all females have equal mating success. So females are just going to be all the females in the previous generation, and they're going to have the same frequencies of colors as everybody else. The paternal imprinting set, though, is a little bit different. It's more skewed. Different. It's more skewed. And this is because females don't imprint on all of the males in the previous generation. They only imprint on the fathers, and they have to be successfully mated. So the paternal set is impacted by sexual selection, and this actually causes a big difference. So it turns out that which imprinting strategy will evolve depends on the answer to the question, which strategy's imprinting set has a higher frequency of the more fit trait. So you can see red in the maternal and oblique sets is more common than brown, but it's even more common than brown. But it's even more common than brown in the paternal set. And this makes the paternal set have higher fitness. And this is because imprinting causes positive frequency-dependent sexual selection. And this is going to be stronger if there's more of a skew in the frequencies initially. So this generates a more common preference for the more successful trait if you're using the paternal set. So, I should say this also ultimately benefits the allele that causes a female to paternally imprint, then, right, when it's in competition. imprint then, right? When it's in competition with alleles with the other imprinting sets. So you can use this prediction about having a higher probability of or a higher, let's say, more success, being more successful at evolving an imprinting strategy if it has a more high higher fitness imprinting set to make predictions about imprinting sets that we didn't consider in our original comparison of three. So if your imprint on peers, for example, what I've drawn here is a peer imprinting set, you could predict that paternal imprinting should outcompete peer, but peer Should out-compete peer, but peer should out-compete maternal, and that's what we actually found if we tested it. So, this property of imprinting sets was pretty interesting, and it explained why paternal imprinting fixed, but it didn't explain why when you add viability selection in on the bottom, maternal should win, sorry, win over oblique, because they had the same imprinting sets. So, this told us that something else also had to be going on. So, if we did a bunch more digging, we figured out that it's what the other thing that was going on was the phenotype. What the other thing that was going on was the phenogenotypic disequilibria that were established in the system had important effects. So, phenogenotypic disequilibria are the same as linkage disequilibrium, except it's between a stored phenotypic information unit and trait frequencies. And this is generated anew each generation during imprinting. So, we calculated an internal pairwise phenogenotypic disequilibrium between the preference and the trait within each imprinting set. And if you do this, you see that. Said. And if you do this, you see that this is going to be positive when you have maternal imprinting. And this is because individuals will prefer their mother's phenotype, which they're likely to have inherited. But it's zero with oblique imprinting. And this is because individuals' traits have no relationship to the preference they acquire because they're imprinting on unrelated adults. And I'm not going to go into the details of what this does specifically because it gets a little complicated, the logic gets a little tangled, but this ends up giving an advantage to maternal imprinting in a way which we were able to track with the map. Printing in a way which we were able to track with the math. And it also accounts for exceptions to the rule. So, when viability selection favors the rarer trait, it turns out that thinking about phenogenotypic disequilibrium and understanding what that does explains why, in that case, oblique imprinting fixes. So, understanding what's going on with these imprinting sets and phenogenotypic disequilibrium, let me apply this knowledge to a bunch of other cases of the effects of imprinting on sexual selection and speciation that I was studying at that time. And speciation that I was studying at that time. And so I was pretty proud of myself. I'd set out to understand the forces involved in the evolution of these strategies, and now I did. So I gave this part of my tenure talk. And then the question I got from a Drosophila developmental biologist was, how would you test this model, for example, in Drosophila? So I did like a head smack. I'm making fun of this. And I've talked to this person about this. We're friends. All is good. But this showed a fundamental misunderstanding of what I was trying to do. What I was trying to do. What they thought I was trying to do was to paint a picture, maybe accurately describing the evolution of imprinting. You couldn't do that with this model. I would need to know the genetic variation for maternal versus paternal. I would need to know the opportunity individuals had to imprint on their mothers versus their fathers, neither of which are they going to have in Drosophila, by the way. I would need to know all sorts of things. I can't answer that question with this model, but I can, what I was actually trying to do is understand the forces involved in the evolution of imprinting, and that is what I. Evolution of imprinting, and that is what I could do. So, this was telling me that the purpose of this very abstract proof of concept model was just not clear. I had done a very bad job in explaining what I was trying to do. So, I'm not the only one that's run into this problem of empiricists mainly not really understanding what we're trying to do in models. So, this has been brought up as an issue in economics, in physics, and psychology, in molecular and cellular biology, and ecology and evolution. And with a bunch of dreams. And with a bunch of junior colleagues in 2014, we published this sort of full-throated defense of proof-of-concept models. And what we did in part of this paper was to compare empirical and proof-of-concept approaches as ways of applying the scientific method. And we pointed out that theory, these proof-of-concept models in theory, were really forms of a hypothesis test. And what they were doing was using math to test links in verbal chains of logic, going from an initial hypothesis. From an initial hypothesis to conclusions. Now, in order for proof of concept models to make sense, it's critical that there is an interface with data, of course, and this really comes in at the assumption stage. So we pointed out that some assumptions, of course, are essential to get right, but not all of them must be fully realistic, which I'm sure we all understand as theorists. So there are some assumptions. We classify them into three different groups. Critical assumptions are really integral to the question of verbal hyper. Are really integral to the question or verbal hypothesis, and you have to get this right, otherwise, you're not really addressing what you say you're addressing. Exploratory assumptions are interesting to test, but they're not necessarily at the core of the hypothesis. And logistical assumptions are necessary for tractability, but these don't always have to be realistic if you understand what it is they're doing and you understand what happens if you violate them and make them more realistic and how that differs from what you actually assumed. So to go back to the imprinting case, I had maternal versus paternal imprinting. I had maternal versus paternal imprinting, oblique imprinting. If I didn't make these assumptions for how these imprinting strategies worked in a realistic way, then I'm not really testing what I say I'm testing. So I would say the way that these different types of imprinting are fundamentally working are critical assumptions. I had to really get that right. But I'd thrown up some other assumptions before very briefly. Some of these assumptions are exploratory. For example, whether different imprinting strategies have different preference strengths. What that does is kind of interesting. You can reverse. That does is kind of interesting. You can reverse some of the patterns in ways that make sense if you understand the properties of imprinting sets and phenogenotypic disequilibria. But that's not like a critical assumption. That's like an exploratory thing that I can add on and look at a bit. Mutation. I didn't mention this, but I had unidirectional mutation on the trait. This was a logistical assumption. The reason I had it in there is if I didn't, I would run out of variation in the trait and all evolution of my strategies would grind to a halt. Now, I'd done a lot of work with sexual selection models already up in the Worked with sexual selection models already up at this point. I knew what unidirectional mutation would do. It didn't bother me to have it just on the trait and nowhere else. It was, I knew what I was doing with it. It was sort of in there to make things chug along properly. If I hadn't explained what I was doing, I kind of swept it under the rug in my tenure talk, but in a paper, for example, if an empiricist saw this and they didn't understand what I was doing or I didn't explain what I was doing, this would be a little weird. Other assumptions that we make commonly, which are a little weird to empiricists, are haploidy, infinite population sizes. Infinite population sizes. I'm sure you can think of tons of these in your own work. So it's our job, I think, to be clear about these because these can cause hang-ups in empiricists. So, this question of how would you test your model, I think there is a constructive way to ask it, which I don't think was necessarily what was being done in my tenure talk. But one way you could think of it is it really means how would you test your assumptions empirically? I think that that is kind of a way of saying how would you test your model, especially for critical assumptions. Especially for critical assumptions. Another thing is, you could test predictions of a model, but I'd like to put out there that if you test the predictions of a model and you did the math right and your predictions aren't met, what it really means is that there's some assumptions that you didn't make that aren't quite right. So assumptions that you made that aren't quite right. So I really think that testing predictions is, again, just really a test of the assumptions. So I think there's room for improvement in the role of theory in current biology. And this is both on the part of theoreticians. And this is both on the part of theoreticians and on the part of the broader community. So, theory literacy is really low. Theory is not taught to biology students in general. I'm at UNC. We have a huge biology major, largely pre-med. I teach three different math modeling classes. I have enrollments of like 15 to 20, sometimes 24. I had my first class today and it was 24, which is huge. But this is a tiny fraction of the biology students in the department. Most of them do not get mathematical modeling almost at all. Modeling almost at all, maybe a teeny mention in a basic ecology and evolution class. So theory literacy could be much stronger. And we can also improve communication as theorists. So I could have done a much better job explaining what I was trying to do in that tenure talk. I now start my talks with that figure of the scientific method and analogies between proof of concept models and empirical models. If I'm teaching to like a mixed empirical theory audience, just so they understand what it is I'm trying to do. Understand what it is I'm trying to do. We should also, of course, be aware of the fact that untrained biology audiences might glaze over if math is too heavy. Of course, there are times, like hopefully, in a lot of SMTPB occasions, where we can proudly throw the math around. But to some audiences, I think you've got to kind of read the room and know when it's actually going to be maybe a little counterproductive to present too much. I'm not the only one that has to argue, of course, we all agree that theory has to be accessible, I think, to be effective. So, Haldane. To be effective. So, Haldane, in his paper, a defense of beanbag genetics was talking about Mayer's issues with Wright's arguments about or against genetic, the idea of genetic cohesion. And he says that here, Wright perhaps is to blame. So far as I know, he's never given an exposition of his views, which did not require some mathematical knowledge to follow. And here's a little bit more evidence that we could do a better job communicating. So in 2020, I did a survey. I had small sample sizes, so it was a really quick survey. Eight ecologists and six Quick survey. Eight ecologists and 16 evolutionary biology theorists addressed this survey. And what I asked each person to do is take one of their papers and classify 10 citations as to whether they were incorrect, correct but general, like they just named the phenomena and threw the citation up there, but it wasn't actually anything specific about the paper, or correct and specific. And you can see the incorrect ones are sort of disappointing, right? The average is about 20% incorrect citations, but they could be up to 40. And if I remember correctly, anecdotally, I think the ones Remember correctly, anecdotally. I think the ones that were on the higher end were more abstract papers, and the ones that were cited more correctly were more quantitative. Yet, I think we can make the argument that theory is thriving. So, this table from Otto and Day in 2007 shows how common theory is in some of the top journals in the field. And this paper by Sam Scheiner, this is 10 years old already, but you can see theory has increased over time in terms of a proportion of articles in these different journals. And quantitative biology. Different journals. And quantitative biology is on the upswing. So I know at UNC we have both quantitative biology undergrad tracks and grad tracks now. And I've heard throughout the country that, you know, anecdotally, again, it seems like there's more and more of this. I also think that SMTPB can help theory and theoreticians to thrive. So this is going to be a community where we can appreciate each other's work, where we can advocate for other scientists who are using theoretical techniques, and where we can find ways to increase the appreciation, hopefully, that non-theoreticians have for theoretical work. Have for theoretical work. So, thank you very much. And I look forward to the next five months. And yeah, I hope we all engage. Thanks.
