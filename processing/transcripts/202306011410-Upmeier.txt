Okay, so for the final lightning talk of today, we have Marcus F. Meyer from Aberdeen. If you will tell us about instantons, calibrated manifolds, and speed. Yeah, thank you very much. And thanks for the organizers for putting together this wonderful conference. So I'll be discussing one aspect of an ongoing research project that I have. A research project that I have with Dominic Joyce, which I think relates nicely to the theme of the workshop. And one of the objectives of this talk is going to be to explain how the deformation theory of pits and tons and calibrated submanifolds fit together and to give one application based on an analytic result that I'll present. End. All right. It's not going so well. Oh, there we are. Okay, so to set the stage, let's recall that a G2 instanton on a principal G bundle P over a G2 metaphor X satisfies this condition that the curvature wedge with the four forms equal to zero. So if you've got a G2 encynthon, you might try to construct another one. Construct another one just by forming the one that you've got a little bit. And well, there's going to be, you're going to use a one form to do that, but immediately you notice there's an infinitesimal condition that you need to satisfy for the modified connection to the units and talk, which is that the one form needs to be in the kernel of this map here. All right. Okay, and this is part of what's coming. And this is part of what's called the deformation complex. And the other two terms are due to, well, the first one is due to gauge transformations, and the last one has to do with Yankee identity. Right. And roughly speaking, the deformation complex encodes what the tangent space of the moduli space of 22 tons looks like. And I can sort of combine this information. And I can sort of combine this information together neatly into a single operator by forming what's called the roll-up, which means you take all the even bits together and you take all the odd bits of your chain complex together. You use adjoints to put it all together. And the result is that the roll-up of this complex can be identified with a twisted Dirac operator, where we notice here that the odd forms, one, The odd forms one plus seven can be identified with the spinner bundle and simulated from even forms. And one comment here is that the roller, unlike the complex, makes sense for all connections. And that can be quite useful because certain aspects of the deformation theory can then be studied just by looking at any connection. And similarly for spin-setting connections. It's been seven connections. Okay, so let's talk about associatives. So, M is supposed to be an associative here, and I don't think I need to review the definition. We've seen it a couple of times this week. I just want to remind you of how the deformation theory goes, which is due to Mechlene. So, it can be described by choosing a spin structure on a Structure on the three fold that gives us a quadromagnetic line bundle. And immediately, because X is a G2 manifold, it's spin, there's a two out of three spin structure on the normal bundle, which we'll be told new during this talk. And that's given by two quaternic line bundles, and they're more or less determined by fitting into this isomorphism here between the spin bundle on X on the freefold and on the. X, on the free fold, and on the normal bundle. Right, so for an associative, something special happens. You can actually identify the positive spinner bundle, sigma plus, with spinner bundle on M. And that means that you can identify the normal bundle, mu with a twisted spinner bundle. And that's quite important because that explains. Because that explains how, in this theorem due to MacLean, you're supposed to interpret actually the elements in the domain as deformations. So a little deformation of the associative M can be thought of as a normal section. And the theorem says that the deformation complex, again it's a control that form is in fact just a twisted Dirac operator, twisted by sigma minus the normal direction. Sigma minus the normal direction. Okay, and again, it makes sense for all actually oriented embeddings. Spin structure is merely just auxiliary and a different one would give the same operator. And similarly for TLE case. All right, now I want to connect the two. And let me just remind you that if we have a complex vector bundle, then it carries a massive. Bundle, then it carries a natural spin C structure given simply by taking these complex exterior powers. Let's suppose the rank is even, I guess, and we can divide them into even and odd. And there's a Clifford multiplication going between the two, which is given by this usual combination of creation and annihilation. So V is a vector and V and psi is a one. Vector in V in size, the one spinner, it's the even political. All right, it's an important point that actually the complex structures give a little bit more. Namely, in this model, as you can see, there is a given vacuum. There's one vector that's kind of preferred in the positives in a bundle. And that will be used in a moment. And what I want to do now is, I want to explain how to construct a Want to explain how to construct a vector bundle on which this G2 instant function can live. All right, so using Clifford multiplication, we can see that there is a complex of vector bundles where I take the two spinner bundles and pull them back along the projection to V. Okay, so the elements are then these pairs of a vector and a spinner, and they can be multiplied obviously. Clifford multiplied by. By Clifford multiplication. And I suppose that the rank is 2 for simplicity. And also for simplicity, I'd like to assume that we have a spin structure on V, because that will mean we have a quaternionic structure actually on the spinner bundles, given by the spin structure. And therefore, the positive part is actually trivial, because we had a vector and it's now a quaternionic line bundle. Very good. Line model. Very good. In other words, this pullback bundle that I just, well, part of it, the sigma minus pulled back, is actually framed. That's what this means. This morphism of vector bundles is an isomorphism outside the zero section. The target is trivial. And I can think of this as defining a vector bundle, E, over the compactified sphere bundle. Compactified sphere bundle of this original vector bundle V. So in a moment, M is going to be the associative and V is going to be the normal bundle. And it makes sense in this context to assume that the normal bundle has a complex structure. Not really be able to explain that very much. Okay. Now I want to discuss the Now, I want to discuss the relation between the deformation theories. So, as I said, we take V to be the normal bundle. And the bundle that I just constructed, I can view this as a principal bundle as well, form the adjoint bundle, as we should in gauge theory, of course. And the only comment really I want to make here is that I get two copies here of sigma minus, and I distribute these two copies. These two copies. I put one into the fiber operator. So you can see this dagger operator. It's a Dirac operator twisted by one of my sigma minuses. And one of them I give to the fiber. So I will twist the Dirac operator on the fiber also by one of these guys. And that is actually something that you can identify with the familiar anti-self duality operator from Donaldson theory, signal on S6. And it is spin four equivariant. Is spin for equivariant, and I hope we remember that the McLean operator is this equivalent. Remember what X tilde was again? I forgot. Sorry, yeah, I didn't really say. X tilde is this sphere bundle thing on the previous slide. That is going to be X tilde. So it's a sphere bundle made out of the normal bundle of the SOCF. It's probably not some good notation. Supposed to be remind you of X. Remind you of X? Easy to think of. I think of it as a local version of X. Alright. Okay. And then that was going to be one of the punchlines. The following observation that if you take the tensor product of these two operators thought of as chain complexes, according to the Kunet theorem, you roll them back up again, you get one operator. This is, in fact, just This is, in fact, just the G2 instanton operator twisted by that bundle that I just constructed. And I, you know, I distributed the two copies accordingly. Any degrees? Can we go? Any degree? What do you mean degree? What is degree? These are chain complexes. So what's the degree? What's degree zero? What's degree one? Oh, the domain is degree zero. Yeah. All right, so that is the analytic theorem I'd like to mention. It works actually much more generally whenever you're in a fiber bundle situation and one of the operators equivariant, but applied to this special case on this force here bundle. I'm saying that, well, there's a way actually to relate the spectra of the G to Instantone operator. G2 instantone operator. Well, I can actually do that quite. I need to do what's called an adiabatic limit. So the fiber, the force here, they're being multiplied by some factor of epsilon, and they will eventually become very small, but finite, not zero. And there's a relation between the eigen space of the G2 instanton operators and the MacLean operators on the base. And, well, in generality, you would actually. You would actually consider the operator on the base and it's adjoint and twisted by connections which have to do with the solutions of the fiber operator. But in this case, it's really quite simple because I'm working with the scalar ASC operator. And I guess we know how to compute the kernel and the co-kernel, which is obviously the chain complex method. And they're actually just these two trivial representations. So we get these two operators. We get these two operators, and what the theorem is really saying is that there are kind of two regimes: there's the regime of small eigenvalues that I somehow have under control, and then there's the regime of big eigenvalues that I don't really understand. And a schematic picture of the situation is this. I have this scale parameter epsilon. And there's some more or less geometrically determined thresholds. Determined threshold from which, from where on I'll be speaking of small eigenvalues. And there they're actually going together very nicely according to multiplicity and all that. And then there's a large regime where I don't really know what's going on. Okay. And I have one application of this. It's combined other techniques that we have. And so for G2. So for G2, the application would read that actually to define an orientation on the moduli space of G2 instantons, that's actually the same thing as defining an orientation, moduli space of associated threefolds. That's something proven now in a different way that I've already proven a couple of years back, Dominic. More interesting, probably is this fully collarie, which answers a question. A question put to us by Richard Thomas on how to construct orientations in Donaldson-Thomas theory for Calabio fourfolds. And in this talk, we can see that the answer is you need an orientation for the moduli space Cayley sub-manifolds. And we have some other technology to explain what this is in more detail. That's beyond the scope of this talk, so. Beyond the scope of this talk, so thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Marcus. For this corollary, did you use that there is an orientation of the AST one meter for the ECMIs? Why this corollary reads? Which one? Corollary read for G two. For all you read for G2? Right, so what I didn't explain is how to go from the G2 manifold to the sphere bundle. So that uses a technique called excision, by which you can kind of concentrate the information near that normal bundle. I didn't explain how to do that. Also, you would need to have the. I mean, really. No, not really. No. And this was just the scalar ASD operator. So there was no bundle involved, and that's always very easy to orient. You just need to orient the cohomology groups, which is the standard thing to do. Does that answer your question? The is the ASV operator for line bundles? Yeah, the trivial line bundle are. Yeah, the trivial line model R. Other questions? Can you think of this idea of beginning maybe more geometrically as some relation between the two models like spirit of over this and also is it a fundamental reason why these two or any topological There is some topological theorem that I don't really have time to discuss, which says that the principal SUN bundles are essentially the same thing as codimension 4 sub-manifolds with a normal U2 structure. So that was kind of an inspiration for this. Unfortunately, this is all on the linear level. You're asking about the moduli spaces. I think there is some idea that there's a close connection between the two. But know the answer to that really. It has to do with bubbling. So I think what's important. So the idea is that these G2 incentons will bubble, and sort of at the boundary of the moduli space, far out, you would find the associative moduli space maybe to compactify. So that was kind of my question. So I get to in the bubbling, you'd also see these ASD asymptotons in the direction of the source. That's right. And see the later section of what's right. So you don't see any of that here? That's not part of the story. This is part of the story, actually. It is part of the story. I've swelled that out of the presentation because I didn't have time. It is part of the story here, and it has to do with my assumption of choosing a spin structure on B. It's not always possible. You can, in general, choose a framing of the positive parts in a function. Of the positive parts in a bundle that would correspond to a fair sensation. And so if you do this carefully, you find also an answer to a question that Thomas Valkowski asked during the January meeting at the Simons Collaboration on how the Fueta section influences the orientations. And the answer is somewhat surprisingly doesn't at all. So, yeah, yeah, no, for as I said, it's a very much part of this picture here. Okay, are there other questions? Well, if not, let's take Marcus.
