I mean, should I get started? Well, yeah, just a second. Let me introduce. Our next speaker is Ghulam H. Sheraz from University College London. He has done a lot of experimental work on cell cytoskeleton, etc. And today is going to talk about the link between The link between signaling and cell mechanics, which was roughly the first couple of slides that I introduced yesterday. How do you connect those two? So please go ahead. Okay, well, thank you very much, Hans, for the introduction. And, you know, thanks as well for the kind invitation. So my lab is generally interested in understanding the mechanics and the shape of cells and tissues. Issues and mostly I'll talk about experiments. It's going to be quite a different flavor from the previous talks. So one of the most fascinating phenomena in biology is how cells and tissues can change shape during morphogenesis, either during cell division here or during gastrulation in Drosophila here. And these shape changes are orchestrated by a patterning of signaling, which Of signaling, which will give rise to spatial temporal patterns of force generation and mechanical properties that together give rise to shape changes. And to make matters more complicated, these shape changes can then influence the mechanical force generation and the signaling through a variety of biochemical feedback processes. So, really, to understand morphogenesis, we need to figure out how patterning of signaling gives rise to heterogeneities in. Heterogeneities and mechanical properties and stress, and how these stress gradients or mechanical property gradients lead to shape change. And so on this topic today, I'll first talk to you about some work where we look at how cortical tension is controlled by signaling. And here I've primarily taken shape change during division as an example, but similar questions arise during migration, where the actin cortex dominates. Where the actin cortex dominates at the rear of the cell. And at the multicellular scale, I'll talk to you about how the shape of an aggregate arises from mechanical changes in some of the cells. And this is something that's maybe more applicable to some of the processes that would take place in collective phenomena like collective migration. So as Hans mentioned, most of the stresses that shape cells and tissues arise from the actin cytoskeleton and in particular the actin cortex. So this actin... Actin cortex. So, this actin cortex is a polymeric network of actin filaments, myosin motors, and binding proteins that is just below the cell membrane and acts a little bit like a wall in animal cells. It's the main determinant of cell mechanical properties and cell surface tension, and as a consequence, it plays a fundamental role in many phenomena that involve shape change, like cell migration. So, for example, you'll find So, for example, you'll find cortex at the rear of these migrating neutrophils, or in mitosis, where deformation of the cortex gives rise to this cleavage varrow, and more generally in tissue morphogenesis. So, during mitosis, the shape of cells is controlled by pattern signaling on the cortex. So, for example, in this anaphase cell, we've got some signaling proteins that act just at the equator and others that act at each equator. The equator and others that act just at the poles. So at the equator, the signaling controls the activity of rho GTPases, and these rho-GTPases are turned on by a category of proteins called rho-gephs, and they're turned off by a category of proteins called rho-gaps. And at the equator, during cleavage faro formation, we've got three rho gaps and three rho gaps that overlap spatially and temporally, which suggests. And temporarily, which suggests that we've got really complicated regulation of activity there. So, after activation of the Rho-GTPases, they will go and control actin polymerization and myosin activity, and that together will allow them to control cell mechanics. So, to understand morphogenesis, what we want to do is we want to link signaling to the mechanical changes, and then afterwards, in a second step, we will want The second step, we will want to link mechanical changes to shape changes. And I'd argue in general that this second step is much better understood than the first step here. So to understand morphogenesis and understand these questions, we used optogenetics to control cell signaling. We used imaging to look at what's happening to downstream effectors. And we use atomic force microscopy to characterize the mechanical changes. So I'll just tell you a So, I'll just tell you a tiny bit about the techniques. So, in atomic force microscopy, you have a microfabricated cantilever whose bending can be detected via reflection of a laser light beam and a photo detector. And if you scan it over a surface, you can reconstitute a 3D topography to get images such as this one. Except my yeah, okay, so images like this one. But what we tend to do is primarily use AFM as a means of mechanical measurements. And in this case, the cantilever is slowly brought into contact with the cell until it indents the surface, and that gives us a force indentation curve. So, in this region here, the cantilever is out of contact, it comes into contact. Of contact, it comes into contact around here, and then as we press it further down into the cell, the force increases. So, once we've got these types of curves, we can then fit them, fit the contact portion of the curve with an appropriate mechanical model to estimate the mechanical properties of the sample. And most models will take into account the geometry of the tip, but they mostly consider the cell as a homogenous isotropic material to give an apparent elasticity. Given apparent elasticity. And this apparent elasticity is actually sensitive to cortical tension, cortical elasticity, and also cytoplasmic elasticity. And currently, there's not really a very good way of deconvolving all of these effects. And so in general, when we do experiments, we try to minimize the influence of cytoplasmic elasticity by restricting ourselves to indentation depths that are small. That are small compared to the cortical thickness. And this cortical thickness is on the order of 200 to 250 nanometers. So, the first thing that we did was to ask if we could see these gradients in tension that I told you were generated by local differences in signaling. So, for that, what we did was we acquired force and intention curves at regular intervals along At regular intervals along the pole-to-pole axis of a mitrotic cell, and we extracted the apparent elasticity. So our cells express a variety of fluorescent markers. So during our experiments, we can actually acquire confocal data to match up with the AFM experiments. So here, for example, you can see the myosin distribution in a dividing cell. So you can see that it's more or less homogenous around the cortex. It's more or less homogenous around the cortex at this stage. Here and here are actually the spindle poles, and this dark region here is where the DNA is. And this shadow here in the background is the AFM cantilever. And so what you can see is that the cell divides perfectly normally, even though we're continuously measuring its cortical tension over time. So with these data, you can then visualize changes in cortical myosin. Changes in cortical myosin, for example, on chymographs. And in these chymographs, we've got the position along the cell contour that we plot in X, and then we plot time in Y. And so what you can see is that initially at metaphase, we've got a more or less homogeneous distribution of myosin. But once we reach anaphase, which is shown by this red line here, we can see that we've got a very clear enrichment in myosin at the equator that lasts throughout the whole of Lasts throughout the whole of cell division. For the apparent elasticity, we can see something similar again. The apparent elasticity is originally fairly homogeneous, and then you can see that we have a very localized stiffening that happens at the equator roughly after anaphase has started, and then it decreases over time. So, to have a slightly more quantitative view on this, what we can do On this, what we can do is average multiple cells and plot the temporal evolution of mice and intensity in green here and of apparent elasticity in blue. And this is at the equator and taken over time. And you can see that both of them start rising immediately after anaphase, which is indicated by this line. The elasticity reaches a peak about six to seven minutes after the beginning of anaphase, and that is significantly higher. That is significantly higher than the value of apparent elasticity in metaphase. Myosin, on the other hand, seems to continuously increase throughout the whole of the duration of cleavage. And this increase in myosin intensity could either be because we've got recruitment of myosin or because we concentrate the same amount of myosin over a smaller and smaller cleavage far. Cleavage furrow here. So, to distinguish between these two possibilities, we computed the total myosin, that is, the intensity of myosin multiplied by the furrow perimeter. And so what you can see in this graph here in blue here is the furrow radius. So we start with a rounded cell, and then at some stage, we get a cleavage furrow that forms, and this furrow radius decreases over time. This furrow radius decreases over time. And if we look at the total myosin intensity, what you can see is that it's constant up until anaphase, again indicated by this dashed line. It then increases over a period of about six to seven minutes, and then it stays constant during the rest of furrowing. If we look at actin in orange here, you can see that it stays more or less constant. And then once ingression starts, we get a decrease in the total actin. And that's something that. And that's something that's consistent with experiments where people have shown that you need to deplymerize some of the actin to allow for ingression to progress sufficiently. But one thing that was particularly intriguing was that the increase in apparent elasticity, which I'm showing you here, is many fold larger than the increase in myosin intensity. And given that we believe that this apparent elasticity is mostly reflected of Elasticity is mostly reflected of attention generated by myosins, this is a little bit puzzling. And so, one possibility is that, in addition to recruitment of myosins, we may also have some reorganization of the active network that could go from something that's more less isotropic to something that's much more aligned and much more efficient for generating tension. So, with this type of characterization in hand, we can try to link these changes. In hand, we can try to link these changes in molecular enrichment and mechanics to local changes to changes in cell shape. So, for this, our collaborators, Diana Kromskaya and Guillaume Salbreux at the University of Geneva, developed an axisymmetric model of the cell with the surface that's modeled as an active gel. So, what they do is they take experimental data that gives, for example, the fluorescence intensity of myosin and they Myosin, and they segment that to get the myosin fluorescence profile over time and the cell volume over time. And they use that as input force or input tension gradient in a model of the cell. So the model is parametrized with geometrical and material properties that come from experiments, and it outputs the cell shape dynamics, the velocities, and the cortical tension. So, on the other hand, the experimental data. On the other hand, the experimental data can also be segmented to get the shape evolution over time, and that can be compared to the experimental predictions. So at first, what Diana and Guillaume considered was that the tension at the equator was isotropic. And in this case, what you can see is that the simulated shape follows the experimental shape for maybe the first 10 minutes, but after that, they deviate significantly. So what we need to do is that the same thing is that the So, what we need to do is to now consider anisotropic tension. And one source could be the reorganization of the acting cortex to orient tension. So, for example, it could be alignment of mice and mini filaments along the equator. And so, if we look at this experimental data that comes from Delaney Burnett's lab, what you can see is that in this super-resolution image, they've labeled the motor domain of myosins in magenta and the rod domain. And the rod domain in green. And what you can see is that most of the myosin minifilaments seem to align along the equator, and therefore they might be providing anisotropic tension. So in the model, we can replicate this by making the tension along the equatorial curvature here in blue larger than along the pole-to-pole direction. And if you do that, this now allows to accurately reproduce the shape dynamics, and therefore it suggests that a nice. And therefore, it suggests that anisotropic tension is really essential to furrowing. So, one way in which we could get this type of pneumatic alignment of myosins is through an increase in actin filament density that would be caused by a flow of filaments towards the equator powered by myosin contractility. Another alternative would be that this could just be due to localized signaling at the equator. So, to test this, what we did was to To test this, what we did was to treat cells with increasing doses of the myosin inhibitor blebostatin. So, blebastatin reduces the motor activity and it reduces the flow velocities that one can observe in the actin cortex. So, if myosin drives the flows that lead to stiffening, then we would expect that the timing of the peak in elasticity should change with myosin inhibition. So, in our Inhibition. So, in our experiments, we found that micelle inhibition reduces the absolute value of elasticity. But when we plot the ratio of elasticity as a function of the maximum elasticity that we measure in our AFM experiments, what we find is that all of the curves that we acquire at different concentrations of inhibitor collapse for the first six minutes or so. Minutes or so. And the timing of this maximum in apparent elasticity is not affected by inhibition of myosin. So that suggests that the alignment of myosin in many filaments is not driven by myosin, but rather comes from signaling. However, one thing that you can see is that the duration of ingression increases when increasing myosin inhibition. So what we have is a process where So what we have is a process where the initial increase in elasticity, the initial increase in elasticity is due to myosin recruitment that is independent from myosin activity. But the furrowing rate is completely myosin dependent. So we have a formation phase in the furrow where myosin is recruited by signaling and then a shape change phase that happens later on that is dependent on myosin acid. That is dependent on myosin activity. Okay, so signaling appears important. And I told you that myosin recruitment at the equator was controlled by roguefs and rogaps. And to determine their contributions, we did what many biologists do. We depleted these proteins by siRNA. So if we deplete a roguef, myogef here in green, what you can see is that the apparent elasticity is decreased compared to controls, which are in blue. And that's likely because we've got less activation. And that's likely because we've got less activation. And in contrast, if we deplete a row gap, MP gap, then the apparent elasticity, which is in red here, that increases compared to control. And these changes in mechanics give rise to changes in furrowing onset and furrowing speed. And in particular, it looks like having a more tensed cortex, so in red here, delays the onset of furrowing and furrowing is slower. And that might be because we've got more tension that resists the... We've got more tension that resists the shape change. So these data indicate that localized signaling controls cortical tension gradients and the kinetics of morphogenesis. But ideally, we'd like to say something a bit more quantitative about the effect of signaling on mechanics rather than just an on-off experiment like here. So in an ideal world, we would be able to predict the state of every protein in the cell, and from that, we'd be able to predict the mechanics. But actually, you know, But actually, you know, signaling cascades are complicated. So, this one is what happens downstream of Rho A, and it probably doesn't include everything that we know. And what's more, even for what we know, we don't know the concentrations of all of the proteins in the cell, and we don't know what the reaction constants are for all of those potential interactions. So, in other words, what we really need to do is we need to coarse-grain things. So, we tried to do some experiments to ask. Trying to do some experiments to ask about this coarse braining. And one of the things that's lacking in siRNA experiments is that we don't really have a time zero for signaling. We're at the mercy of the cell, and if we perturb things too much, then the cell doesn't even furrow. So we turn to a different type of experiments where we can control and we can switch signaling on and off. And so for that, we use optogenetics. We use optogenetics and we use a heterodymerizer pair, CRI2 here and CIBN. So, in the dark, these two proteins don't interact, but if we shine blue light on them, then they bind to one another. And in our optogenetic system, we exploited that to be able to control signaling. So, the CIBN is fused to GFP and it's targeted to the membrane. And CRI2 is fused to an M cherry and the M-cherry and the catalytic domain of a ROGF or RhogAP. So when you shine blue light, then Crito and CIBN can bind to one another. And then this catalytic domain can come close to the rho-GTPases that are the membrane and it can interact with them. And so it can switch them on or switch them off, depending on the nature of the catalytic domain. And one thing that's really important is that the binding between CRI2 and CIBN is reversible. So if you don't read... Is reversible. So, if you don't re-stimulate with light, they will detach from one another over the course of about 10 minutes. So, in experiments, it looks like this. Before you activate, here we're imaging cry2 emittery. This portion here is cytoplasmic. And after you activate, you can see that most of it has relocalized to the membrane. And we can do segmentation to be much more quantitative with the data so that we can compute, for example. We can compute, for example, the proportion of this CRI2M cherry construct that has been relocalized to the membrane. So, to measure the mechanical response, we use AFM, and the principle of the measurements is simple. Here, we've just got a rounded cell and we squash it under an AFM cantilever. And when you do that, the force initially increases up to a peak and then it relaxes over time due to a number of viscoelastic processes. Number of viscoelastic processes like turnover of the actin cytoskeleton and potentially a number of other contributions from the cytoplasm. But you know, my main message here is that at some stage it reaches a plateau. And from the value of the restoring force at this plateau, the cell radius and the cell deformation, we can estimate the cortical tension. And really here I say estimate, and this is one of the formula that we've used, but after discussing with theorists, I realized. With theorists, I realized that actually, you know, there's a lot of approximations in these formula. And at the minute, we don't really have an extremely good way of estimating cortical tension. But be that as it may, you know, we use that as a first step to quantify experiments. So RAFM is interfaced to a confocal microscope so that we can activate the optogenetic system while we're measuring tension. So in this experiment here, for example, So, in this experiment here, for example, we're measuring the force. So, we come into contact with the cell, we let the cell relax, we reach the plateau, and then where this dashed line is, we shine blue light on the cell. And what you can see is that force increases for a time, and that's because Cry2 binds to CIBN, and then the Rhogef domain goes and activates RhoA. And then, since we haven't re-stimulated, over time Cry2 detaches from CIBN and the force decreases again. And the force decreases again. And we can repeat this several times, and it's very reproducible in terms of amplitude and duration. So, what's nice with the system is that with the CONFOCON, you can actually image the different steps of the signaling cascade. So, first, for example, you can look at the relocalization of the ROGF using the M cherry that's fused to the ROGF. So, here this is P115 ROGF. Then, you can look at the recruitment of myosins. So, here we have a myosin regulatory light chain. Have a myosin regulatory light chain, which is tagged with IRFP, actually. And then finally, we can measure the change in tension. And one thing that's really striking about these curves is that they've all got roughly the same shape and they've got roughly the same duration. And that would suggest that the steps that link the biological input, which is the relocalization of the ROGF to the cortex, that the steps that link this biological input to the biological input. Link this biological input to the biological input, like for example mice and recruitment, and then to the mechanical input, are all likely to be linear in these particular experimental conditions. But how you go from our experimental input, which is the light that we shine, to the biological input, and then these other inputs, that is not very well known. And that's something we try to clarify. So the first thing that we need to do. So the first thing that we need to do is to characterize the interaction between CRI2 and CLBN. And so to get a better understanding of this, we developed a model with Guillaume Salbreux and we can write a very simplified model of our optogenetic system. So essentially what we have is we've got Cry2 that's initially inactive in black here in the cytoplasm. We activate it with light and we convert it to active CRI2 in red. Cry2 in red. This active Cry2 can then diffuse and bind to CIBN at the membrane. And from QPCR data, we know that we've got a hundred-fold excess of CIBN over CRI2 and our cells. And so that allows us to make some simplifying assumptions. And then, as an extra assumption, what we assume is that when CRI2 inactivates, this is a first-order reaction. Inactivates, this is a first-order reaction process. And when it inactivates, it immediately unbinds from the CIBN. So we've got this type of reaction system. And then this can be solved explicitly. And that's what we did with our collaborators. And here, what we find is that the proportion of membrane-associated CRI2 follows a two-exponential process. So first, we get So first we get an increase up to a peak as more CRI2 is captured by CIBN. And then we have a decay as this binding is more than compensated by inactivation of CRI2 that was initially bound. And the yellow dots that you can see here are our experimental data. And what you can see is that we get a very good fit of our experimental data with this theoretical relationship. Okay, so. Okay, so because the temporal evolution, so essentially we've got loads and loads of steps in signaling. And so one approach to this some people have taken is to say, well, you know, we're not interested in all of the intermediate steps. What we really just want to know is how you go from an input to an output. And one way in which you could try to model this is just having a cascade where we've got A cascade where we've got which introduces a delaying and a rescaling. So, in this type of model, the output here we're writing it for tension, it depends on the input. So, this is the amount of CRI2 at the membrane, whose kinetics we have characterized separately, with a rescaling factor and then a delay to account for the kinetics of signaling. So, what we do with this approach is that first we fix the parameters of the double X. First, we fix the parameters of the double exponential by fitting the data, which shows the relocalization of Cry2 to the membrane as a function of time. And then for all of the different steps of the cascade, what we do is we take this curve and we just rescale it and introduce a delay. And so the fitting gives us the rescaling factor and the delay time. So for example, if we just look at the Roger F, we get a very short delay, as we might expect. If we look at myosins, we find that look at myosins we find that we get a good fit of our experimental data with this this approach um but and and the delay that's introduced is much more uh is much larger so here we're on the order of 50 seconds and then if we look at tension um we get a delay that's on the order of 55 seconds and what's very nice about all of this is it really gets gives us some intuition into the kinetics of a complex signaling cascade from the time of From the time of initially switching it off, switching it on. But one of the things that this approach doesn't tell us is how the proportionality factor here depends on the input stimulus. So for that, what we need to do is we need to be able to really vary the input very finely. So we did some experiments where we vary the duration of illumination. So here, for example, from one millisecond to a thousand milliseconds. From one millisecond to a thousand milliseconds, and we measure the proportion of CRI2 that's been relocalized to the membrane. And what you can see is that the amplitude of this curve increases with the duration of stimulation up to a point where we get saturation in our system. And instead of varying the duration of stimulation and keeping the laser power constant, we can do the inverse. We can vary the laser power and keep the duration of illumination constant. And keep the duration of illumination constant. And what you can see is we get the same type of results. So we can aggregate these two data sets. And now what you can see is that the proportion of CRI2 that goes to the membrane is proportional to the energy that we put into the system. So this is just for the optogenetic system, the CRI2 and CIBN part, but everything that's downstream, so the activation of Rho-GPAs is, and then anything. And then anything that happens downstream from the era GTPases, all of that doesn't necessarily have to be linear. So we repeated those experiments looking at other parts of the cascade. So first here, we just repeated the experiments where we have different durations of illumination and we look at the proportion of CRI2 at the membrane. Within these same cells, we now look at the recruitment of myosin as a result of these same durations. And what you can see is that myosin recruitment increases. Is that myosin recruitment increases with illumination time? And finally, we look at the tension in those cells. And what you can see here is that the tension does seem to be modulated by illumination time, but it's in a little bit more complicated form. And in particular, it looks like we have a plateau that seems to be extended after saturation. And that's something that we need to look into in more detail. But all of this does mean that it may be possible to represent the signaling. Possible to represent the signaling as, for example, a type of transfer function where the input would be the number of gifts that we put at the membrane, the output would be a change in cell mechanics, and the transfer function would essentially coarse grain all of the signaling in between that we don't really know so much about. And we're currently working on trying to extract transfer functions from the type of data that we have above. Okay, so you remember at the beginning, Okay, so you remember at the beginning, I told you that there are multiple rho gs, that they act simultaneously at the cortex. And if they all regulate the same rho GTPAs, this is a little bit surprising. Why not just use one of them? And so one possibility is that these GAFs differ in the mechanical response that they induce. And so we first looked at three different Rogefs. So P115 Rogef or Argaf1 in green. ROGAF or RGF1 in green, RGAF11, PDZ ROGF in orange, and EC2 in blue. And what you can see here is the percentage of Cry2 at the membrane as a function of time. Illumination happens at time zero, and you can see that the rise time is similar, and that makes sense because it's all dictated by the optogenetic system. But what you can see is that their decays differ, and this translates into Translates into more or less long-lasting increases in tension here. And because the optogenetic part of the system is the same, that implies that these differences that we have at longer time scales must be due to interactions between the DHPH domain, so the rho-gef domain, and the rho-GTPAs. So if we explicitly incorporate that into our model in the form of a characteristic time of interaction or a k-off, this allows us to fit all of the experimental curves. Of the experimental curves, and we're trying to understand what's the biology that underpins this effect essentially. Okay, so in conclusion to this part, the shape changes result from measurable tension gradients in the cortex. These tension gradients are controlled by pattern signaling. The initial setting up of the tension gradient seems to be something really that's completely signaling. Really, that's completely signaling due to signaling and not due to some emergent process and reorganization due to myosin flows, but the constriction rate is controlled by myosin contractility. Myosin intensity and cortical tension are proportional to the cortical GEF levels. Signaling, we think, can be coarse-grained by delay functions and transfer functions, and the mechanical response appears to be GEF-specific and it seems to depend on the And it seems to depend on the strength of interaction between rho A and the Rho F, the specific Rho F. Okay, so after talking about how signaling controls the mechanics of cells, I'll spend a little bit more time about thinking about how mechanics controls shape and in particular in aggregates of cells. So, for small aggregates of cells at steady state, a lot of what we know comes from the mechanics of foams with the surface. Foams with the surface tension that's mostly controlled by the acne cortex. So, when two cells interact, they adhere via coheren proteins and you have an interfacial tension that arises. And the contact angle at the interface between these two cells depends on the cortical tension in each cell and the tension at their junction. And we can predict this angle of contact with a young. This angle of contact with the Young-Dupre relationship. So, if the angle of contact changes, that means that there's a change in mechanics. So, for example, if it increases, it could be because the cortical tension increases or the junctional tension decreases, or it could be a combination of both. But without more information and without doing an experiment where we measure one of these quantities, we can't precisely know what's happening to drive this shape change. So, in more complicated aggregates, cells can in principle. Aggregates cells can, in principle, vary their cortical tension and junctional tensions independently to control the overall shape of the aggregate. So, for example, this cell here could increase its cortical tension to give rise to a shape change in the aggregate. And at a much larger scale, this repeats itself over thousands of cells and it will give rise to a tissue-wide gradient in attention that might give rise to a morphogenetic change. But actually, if we even look at very small cell aggregates, there is quite a lot of, there's a lot that we can learn and there are really complex changes that occur despite there being very few cells. So one of the things that we looked at was the C. elegans embryo at the four cell stage. So if we look at the embryo, we've first got an asymmetric division of P0 that gives rise to ABN P1. To AB and P1. Then AB divides, and during this division, there's a rotation of the cell. Later on, there's a second asymmetric division, so P1 divides into EMS and P2. And P2 comes into contact with ABP, and we think this is because of interactions with the eggshell in which the embryo is confined. And over time, ABA, ABP, and EMS compact. And so if you look at this image, you can Compact. And so, if you look at this image, you can see that they form a rather compact group of cells with P2 that sits a little bit apart. And it's even clearer if we remove the embryo from its eggshell. And so, here what you can see is that we've got P2 that's completely apart from this other group of cells. And over time, these cells seem to compact even more and pack tighter. And this arrangement likely stands. Arrangement likely stems from mechanical differences between the cells. And one of the consequences of this first asymmetric division and the second one, too, is that there is an asymmetric partitioning of actin and mycin motors between the different cells. So here, for example, we have an embryo which expresses mice and GFP. And what you can see is that the amount of micein that we have in ABA and ABP is clearly larger than what we have in EMS and P2. So because of that, we might. So, because of that, we might expect the mechanics of ABA, ABP to be very different from that of EMS and P2. And we might also expect dynamic mechanical differences between cells to guide the evolution of shape. So, to understand how differences in mechanics interplay with confinement to control aggregate arrangement, what we need to characterize: Aggregate arrangement, what we need to characterize is the cortical tension in each cell and interfacial tension in each of the cell cell contacts over time. So, as will the optogenetic parts, we use AFM to measure cortical tension. And using this, we can draw a panorama of the surface tensions in the cells of the embryo. And what we can see is that the surface tension is different in different lineages. So, with cells of the A-B lineage. With cells of the A-B lineage having a cortical tension that's roughly two-fold higher than the P lineage. The surface tension depends on the cell cycle. So, for example, if you block cells in mitosis, they've got a cortical tension that's about two-fold higher than for cells in interphase. And surface tension is dependent on myosins, as in mammalian cells. So, but all of these are static measurements. And, you know, when we image, we see lots of dynamic shape changes. We see lots of dynamic shape changes, and if you look at these measurements here, you can see that there's a lot of spread in our data. So, what we might expect is that the surface tensions vary over time. So, what we can do is leave our cantilever in position and just measure and monitor its deflection over time to get a dynamic view of the temporal evolution of tension in the cells. So, at the two-cell stage, in interphase, AB. In interphase, AB here in blue, you can see it increases its cortical tension about threefold up to nuclear envelope breakdown, which is shown here in green, whereas P1 comparatively changes its cortical tension far less. So this very large peak that you see here after nuclear environment breakdown is actually due to orientation of division perpendicular to the plane of our cover slip. So it pushes the AFM camera. Cover slip so it pushes the AFM counter lever upwards. But here it's a change in the geometry of the cell rather than a change in cortical tension that causes this peak. At the four-cell stage, the AB cells in red here behave roughly the same way as AB at the two-cell stage, in that their cortical tension increases roughly threefold over time. And EMS, which is Over time. And EMS, which is in orange, is very interesting. So it arises from P1, so its cortical tension is initially very low, but actually increases significantly over time to reach roughly the same cortical tensions in the AB cells. And that may be the reason why it forms this compact aggregate with the other, with the AB cells. But the surface tension, in contrast, the surface tension in P2 stays very low. And this is interesting because P2 is... And this is interesting because P2 is a type of stem cell, and many stem cell culture systems involve drugs that keep contractility low to maintain pluripotency. So to understand the changes in the shape of the aggregate, you remember that the other thing that we need to characterize is the interfacial tensions. And to estimate these, what we do is we image the cell membrane in embryos, and then we use segmentation to measure the evolution. To measure the evolution of the angle between cells over time. And with the knowledge of these angles and the knowledge of the dynamics of the cortical tensions, we can estimate the junctional tension with the Young-Dupre relationship. And as a test of consistency, what we did is that we estimated the tension in the junction between EMS and ABP, this junction here, which sits roughly in the center of the aggregate, and we can estimate tension. Aggregate, and we can estimate tension either from cells on the posterior side or for cells on the anterior side. And so that gives us two independent measurements. And what you can see is that these two estimates of tension stay very close to one another and they've got the same temporal dynamics. And so we've got something that may look promising. So we can then try to put everything together to ask how well we understand embryo shape from surface tension. And for that, we use a computational model that was developed by Avit. Computational model that was developed by Arvet Jolier at Collège de France in Paris. And in this model, we input the cortical tensions, the junctional tensions, and the cell sizes, and we predict aggregate shape. So we get a good agreement when we look at the embryo outside of the eggshell, and particularly towards the end of compaction. And so that suggests we've got a good description of embryo mechanics with the experimentally determined surface tensions. But when we add a confinement due to the eggshell, Due to the eggshell, you know, the shape of the embryo changes. P2 comes into contact with ABP, as we had hypothesized. But although the shape at the anterior part of the embryo might be okay, at the posterior part, it really doesn't look right. And so we're making a big error. And this might be because our surface tension measurements are outside of the eggshell, and this junction here doesn't exist. Junction here doesn't exist outside of the eggshell. So, this pushed us to ask if we can infer cortical tensions from molecular scale data. And based on our static measurements, an obvious candidate for inferring surface tension is cortical myosin. So, we asked how surface tension at free interfaces, like here, correlates with cortical myosin intensity. So, in our experiments, we use embryos in which the myosin is Embryos in which the myosin is homozygously fused to GFP, and then by segmenting the movie, we can measure the temporal evolution of myosin intensity in the cortex of each of the cells and at each of the cell junctions. So if we now normalize the myosin intensity in these cortical regions to that in the AB cell, and we plot it as a function of the tension that we measure by AFM, also normalized to the AB cell. Also normalized to the AB cell, you get something that looks like a fairly linear relationship between tension and mice and intensity that seems to be valid for all of the cells of the embryo. And the slope essentially gives you a rescaling factor to convert between fluorescence and surface tension. Okay, so for injunctional tensions, things are a little bit more complicated. And previous work has shown that the interfacial tension is the sum of a tension. Is the sum of attention that comes from myosins and attention that comes from intercellular adhesion? So, here E-cadherins. And these two contributions are antagonistic. And so, to estimate the contribution of E-caterin to junctional tension, we proceed in the same way as for myosin. We use embryos which homozygously express E-caterin with a GFP. We segment these embryos to get the fluorescence intensity of E-caterin at all of the intercellular junctions, and we can then. Junctions, and we can then try to estimate a pre-factor beta in this relationship. And then we can plot the tension that we measured, the junctional tension that we measure from cortical tensions and the angle of contact as a function of the one that we infer from mycelin intensity and ecodirian intensity. And again, we've got something that looks fairly promising, although it's not perfect. So, with this in hand, what we did is we tried to test our inference method and we determined it's inference method and we determine its ability to predict contact angles in embryos where we've depleted some proteins to essentially ask how robust this is to changes in signaling. So for each depleted embryo we image the distribution of myosin and the distribution of e-cadherin and you can really see that some of the depletions make a big difference. So for example if you look at the junctional myosin here you can see that in this depletion it's nearly gone and in that one too. So what we then do is we can generate tables where we've got the Generate tables where we've got the cortical myosin intensity relative to the wild type one for each of our knockdowns. We can do that for the junctional myosin and also for the junctional cadherin. And with that, we can predict angles of contact and compare them to the measured angles. So, for some conditions, like this one, that one, that one, it looks pretty good. But for others, it's really not so good. And one potential One potential reason is that some of the assumptions that underlie our approach may break down with protein depletion. So, for example, one of the assumptions I've told you about is that cortical tension is proportional to myosin intensity. But I've told you in the first part of my talk, actually, we also need to take into account the organization of the Actman scaffold. And so, one of my assumptions in telling you all of this is that the actin scaffold doesn't change, which we don't know. Or it could be Or it could be a much more prosaic region, which is a reason, which is just that our angle measurements are much less accurate for smaller angles. But in any case, digging deeper into why this breaks down should still be very informative. So overall, what I'm trying to say is that imaging myosin and ecodirin may be sufficient to grasp what the mechanics of the embryo are, and it would be particularly important for embryos where we can't use these contact-type techniques like AFM. So, in conclusion, we've got different lineages that have got distinct mechanics, and that gives rise to a really interesting embryo shape, even though we've got very few cells. The cortical tension seems to depend on myosin abundance, the junctional tension depends on mycin and nicoterem, and the aggregate shape can be inferred from the junctional, from the temporal evolution of molecular scale abundance of mycin and ecoterium cells. And before I finish, I'd like to thank the people who did the work. People who did the work. So, Kezunori Yamamoto, who is here, did all of the work on C. elegans. Pierre Boek and Mancy Kerka did all of the work on optogenetics. And Ryota Sakamoto, whose photo I don't have here, did the work on the cytokinetic cells. This was a collaboration with Hervé Cholier's lab at College of France, Guillaume Saint Brun's lab at the University of Geneva, and in other work we've collaborated with Marcel Ballon and Jochen Group. With Marcia Bannon and Johan Guk, but I haven't had a chance to show you that work. And I'd like to thank these various organizations for funding us, and I'd like to thank you for your attention. Well, thank you very much for a very informative talk. There's a huge amount of information here, and I certainly haven't absorbed it all, but there are some questions. Leah, go ahead. Hi, thank you. That was really absolutely fascinating. Let's see. What was I going to do? Oh, yeah. Can you apply the same ideas to the migration or migratory cells where you have a cell that is about to protrude and you measure the tension and the at the same time stimulate it? Yeah, so you should be able to do that. And I don't know that people. Do that, and I don't know that people have actually done it, but you know, one of the things that would be really interesting, for example, is when you get the initial symmetry breaking and the laminipodium that extends on the one hand, it would be really interesting to ask, do we have a change in cortical tension that comes from the fact that we're now effectively breaking the symmetry of the cortex? So as far as I know, no one has done that. Has done that. There are some, you know, as, and I think that's what you're alluding to. There are some optogenetic probes that were designed by Klaus Hahn, which allow you to switch on RAC. And those would be really interesting to trigger the formation of this lamini podium from rounded cells. Another, there are some, I think that there are some measurements of Of cortical tension in neutrophils in response to chemotractant stimulation. And those, I think, were done by Folkmar-Heinrich. But I could not summarize in an intelligent way that data for you right now. I don't remember it enough. Great, thank you. And can you also tell us where this stuff is? Tell us where this stuff is published? It isn't published yet. None of this is. We're hopefully getting ready to put a preprint online, and I can let you know once that's done. Thank you. Thank you. Other questions? So I have a couple. In the Levastatin-treated cells, you still didn't get You still didn't get a complete decrease in the cortical tension. Does that mean that once the myosin is bound with actin, that it's not affected by myosin? So yes, so that's something that I think that there is a certain amount of confusion in the literature, and I can't really get a very clear answer from that. So, in experiments. So, in experiments that I had done a long time ago, what I was looking at were cells that made blebs. And then underneath the membrane of a bleb, you reform an actin cortex, and that recruits myosin, etc. So what we'd done was to make blebs in cells that were in a medium with blebostatin. And in those conditions, what we saw was that you recruited myosin to the cortex. So that To the cortex. So that means the myosin is able to bind the actin cortex, but those blebs never retracted. And it's only when we inactivated the blebostaphin that they could retract. So my impression is, is that there are a certain number of circumstances under which even when the myosin is bound to blebostatin and its power stroke is inactivated, it can still bind actin and it can still play the role of a cross-link. Can still play the role of a cross-linker. Any other questions? Okay, I have a couple more. I've got one when you're I have one when you're done, Hans. No, go ahead. Go ahead. Thanks for that. It was really fantastic and obviously a huge amount of work. I was just wondering if you could give your perspective on then using vertex models for sheets of epithelial cells, right? Because they're Of epithelial cells, right? Because they're based on the simple assumption of just this balance between cortical tension and adhesion. And then we're using them for these enormous, you know, complex systems with many, many, many cells, not just a handful of cells. And so I'm wondering if you think that those are valid models or limited or just what you think about that. Thanks. Well, okay. So, I mean, Um, okay, so I mean, first of all, I'll preface all of this by saying that I'm not a computational modeler, and um, so whatever I may say, um, you know, I'll take it with a pinch of salt. But so my understanding of these models are that they are great to look at steady state, you know, steady state or quasi-steady state changes. Steady state changes in epithelia, and that means anything that happens at a rate where we're not going to get so many passive stresses, for example. But when you have passive stresses, then things are you really need probably a model where you've got some mechanical elements in there, like you know, springs and dashboards and whatever. I mean, not necessarily springs and dashboards, but some mechanical element. And I also. And I also get the impression, and again, this is based just on experiments we've done in my lab, that the inference methods seem to work very well at quasi-steady state. But when you've got a really transitory, a real transitory regime, like for example, we've done experiments where you suddenly stretch an epiphenyl sheet. And if you look at the shape of the cells, it just doesn't change during the whole of Doesn't change during the whole of the relaxation of the stresses. And so, based on an inference model, because it's primarily based on the shape of the cells, you'd say there's no change in stress. But actually, the absolute value of the stresses, and particularly at the tissue level, they do vary in time. And so I think so that may be a very, very long and very, very wandering answer. Very wondering answer, but I'd say I think for anything that's fairly slow and quasi-steady state, I think it looks as if they work very well. And for things that are much faster, like for example, let's say some of the stresses that occur during normal physiology. So, you know, anytime you move an articulation, you've got strains of roughly 50% in your skin. Then maybe for those, that doesn't work so well. Fantastic. That's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Other questions? Paul. That was a very nice application of AFM to a single cell. I'm wondering if you have neighboring cells that are undergoing morphogenesis and you're trying to measure the effect on your cell, what other method would you recommend to make a measurement that might be non-local? There's not so many options. I mean, so one of the things that people have used is micropipette aspiration. And so there you can, you know, you can just aspirate part of it. They're those techniques that were initially pioneered by Evan Evans, I think. And so they've been applied to embryos in particular. And people have looked, for example, at compact. Have looked, for example, at compaction within mouse embryos. That's work by Jean-Leon Maitre. And they found that you get these pulsatile tensions that develop in the cortex. Now, the only problem, so the advantage of AFM is that its sampling rate is super high. So you know you're easily at kilohertz. The disadvantage of AFM is that currently we lack a lot of the theoretical. A lot of the theoretical models that allow us to deconvolve the surface tension from whatever's inside or the impact of passive stresses compared to active stresses. With the micropipette aspirations, I think the models are better developed, but the sampling rate is essentially the sampling rate of your imaging system, and so it's much lower. And so it's much lower. So, I mean, I don't know. I think, so that would be one, I guess, the other techniques that you could use. I'm not sure there's so much. I think, you know, again, I think there were some methods that worked with flickering of the membrane, and that's purely optical. Or if you've got some beads attached to the membrane, then the fluctuations tell you something about the mechanics of the cortex. And you could easily, you know, if you can put a bead on one cell, you can put a bead on three or four different cells that are close by. And that might allow you to sample the mechanics. Thank you. I'm glad that there's not a simple answer. And actually, when you come to think of it for much, much larger tissues. For much much larger tissues, what people have done is to put these polyacrylamide beads within embryos or these fluorocarbon oil droplets that J. Campas has pioneered inside. But they're all, again, these are very discrete locations where you can sample. But yeah, no, there's not a simple answer. Anyone else have a question? Okay, I have one final one. I love this idea of a transfer function because you're able to collapse a relatively complex network into something usable. But I wonder, have you thought about the effect of feedback within them? Because the active can certainly feed back onto the signaling by helping localization. The signaling by helping localization and so forth. So I think you're absolutely right. That's something that may really nail in the coffin of that particular approach. But I would argue that by taking the simplest approach in the first state and in the first case and just pushing it as far as we can, it might actually allow us to figure out where these types of non-linearities or feedback. These types of non-linearities or feedbacks are taking place. And then, maybe, just if I can add one thing that may happen, and here I'm completely speculating, but you saw that in terms of kinetics, we've really got something like 40 or 50 seconds for us to go from activation of the road GTPAs to an effect on mechanics. And it may be that if we had feedback. And it may be that if we had feedback, it would have a similar time scale. And so by sampling sufficiently fast in our system, we might be able to distinguish when that feedback starts coming into play. And that could be a really interesting type of experiment to do. Well, I agree fully. And I wish that more people like yourself would think along those lines because they make life much easier for theoreticians. For theoreticians. I mean, you know, you had the picture of the signaling network, and there's no way we can deal with that at present. But if we ask what are the kind of important pathways from input to output, and how can we model them more simply, that would be enormously useful for the next higher level of modeling, of course. So convince your colleagues to think along those lines as well. Well, hopefully, we'll manage. Well, hopefully, we'll manage to. But I guess that they may want a first proof that this will actually work. So hopefully, we'll manage to publish something along those lines. It's a back and forth process, as John Bonner said long ago, by rocking back and forth between the dream world of theory and the reality of the lab, we can answer some important questions. So with that, thank you. So, with that, thank you very much for the talk.
