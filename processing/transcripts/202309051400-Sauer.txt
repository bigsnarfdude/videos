Yes, I will talk about some homology groups. So thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this wonderful place. It's really a pleasure. And I made a change on a short notice in my title, so I realized. In my title, so I realized that everybody's talking about groups, and somehow I felt my original title was a bit out of place, too geometric, although it had a cantor space. So now I'm talking about groups. And if I manage in time, there will be a control space at the very end, although not playing the central role. So I want to talk about the comology of groups, mainly lattices in Lie groups. Lattices in Lie groups with unitary coefficients. So the coefficients will be representation of the group, unitary representations of the group on a Hilbert space. So acting via isometries linearly. And I want to study this homology. And in my talk, G will be either a discrete group or will be a locally compact group, actually, mostly a Lie group. And for such groups, G, I want to Such groups G, I want to introduce two properties that look very much alike. There is only one slight difference, and it's kind of amazing that they play a role in very distinct somehow areas of group theory. So, let me introduce these two notions. So, we say that, so let me maybe put it one on that board and one on the other. G. G has property TN as an echo. If the following holds, if the homology of G with coefficients in such a unitary representation is zero for. For every degree from zero to n and for every unitary representation of my group The only requirement on the representation is that it has no invariant vectors. Okay, so V to the G just denotes the invariant vectors, so all the vectors in V such that if I act with any group element, it stays fixed. For all g and g. So, for any representation, unitary representation without invariant vectors, and for every cohomological degree up to n, I require that the cohomology vanishes. If g is discrete, this is just ordinary group cohomology. If G is a Lie group, locally compact group, I mean continuous cohomology. I mean, I could write C, I could always write C, even for this. I could always write C even for a discrete group, then it would just be the ordinary, but I would probably forget the C for continuous. So, if you define group cohomology via the standard resolution, so the co-cycles are maps from G to the something, G to some N to V, then I require that these maps are continuous. That's property Tn. And the parallel property, which looks very much alike, but is somehow very much different on the other end, is called, well, for historical reasons, it's not a good notation, I know, for historical reasons, I call it HTN. If basically the same thing holds. Basically, the same thing holds with one difference: namely, I take reduced cohomology. Okay, some redundancy, but let me write it. Okay, so this is reduced cohomology. And reduced cohomology, it just means that on these standard complexes defining these cohomology groups, there is a topology, and you just take Kernel of the differential divided by the closure of the image of the differential. So the image of the differential is not always closed, but you make it close, you take the closure, and the reduced commodity is potentially smaller than the ordinary chromology. The ordinary chromology subjects onto the reduced one. And in general, there is a difference between the two, but Between the two, but that's the only difference in the two definitions. So this is, I call it like that because Yuda Shalom introduced the notion some histories of Shalom around 2000, maybe a little, maybe a bit later. I'm not quite sure about the date. So let's forget about the date. Maybe it was a bit later. Let's forget about the date. Maybe it was a bit later than that. He introduced property HT, which is exactly this property, but just for the first homology. And he also considered the higher degree, but it didn't give it a name. So I decided to call it HTN. That's where this terminology comes from. And he introduced it in the study of quasi-isometry invariants of amenable groups. This property is something that, well, we introduced with Uribada recently. So, whatever concerns this site will be joint work with Uribana. And I will explain that this is a generalization of Cashnam property T. And so the plan for this talk is. And so, the plan for this talk is somehow illuminate a little bit the relations between the two, explain also why this is a generalization of property T, and then tell you some of the applications, provided you have groups that satisfy these properties. Also, tell you about the groups that satisfy these properties, but then also tell you about the applications, and they will be very different. So, this will be or I mean. Or, I mean, modern aspect of this story I give you is related to one of the last big unsolved problems in the quasi-sometry classification of lattices in Lie groups. And this will concern mostly lattices in semi-simple groups. So it's very different story somehow. Let's start illuminating somehow these notions a little bit. A little bit. So here we have this set of invariant vectors, and one can also to define Kashstan property T define what almost invariant vectors are. So, can you read this from there? Or should I? Yeah. Okay, so one says that G has almost invariant vectors. Has almost invariant vectors. And when I say almost invariant vectors, it's always understood that we're dealing with a whole sequence of vectors, not just with one vectors. If there is a sequence of unit vectors Oh, sorry. Not G, the G representation V has almost invariant vectors if there is a sequence of unit vectors such that they become more and more invariant if n goes to infinity. Okay, and if G is a local Okay, and if G is a locally compact group, you would say this should be a uniformly on compactor, but let's not care about these issues. So Kashstan property G makes a statement about representations with almost invariant vectors. So let me repeat this definition by Kashstan. By Kashtan, classic paper from 1967 that G has property T, or let's say cash dung property T. If every unitary G representation that has almost invariant vectors has an invariant unit vector, I mean, you have to say unit. I mean, you have to say unit vector. It should not be the zero vector, of course. It's zero vector is always invariant. So if every unitary G representation with almost invariant vectors. Has an element in Vg, so has an invariant uniform. Kind of a rigidity statement, if you want. Whenever you're close to invariance, you have invariance. And let me also contrast this with the definition of amenability, which is somehow, I mean, it's not the opposite in a logical sense, but it's kind of opposite of Cassian property T. So G is amenable, one of the many characterizations of this notion. If the regular representation Regular representation has almost invariant vectors. So, if you're not familiar with that kind of notion of manability, it's one of the characterizations of Always good to keep in mind if you have the case of the integers acting on the regular representation, which is just well square integrable formal linear sums over Z as a kind of Hilbert basis, then. Spaces, then the invariant vectors here, you could take this, where delta i is somehow the basis vector corresponding to the group element i in z. Okay, so this is a sequence of almost invariant vectors. Vectors. And if you have an invariant vector in the regular representation, I mean, remember, you can think of this as sequences indexed over the group elements, which are square integrable. And if you have such a sequence which is invariant, then it just Is invariant, and it just means that every element in the sequence is equal, but at the same time it's square integrable. That can only happen if the group is finite, or in the topological world, if the group is compact. So therefore, the remark, the intersection of amenable and cashdown property T groups are just the finite groups in discrete case. The finite groups in the discrete case, or the compact groups in the topological case. In that sense, it's a kind of opposite of the amenability is kind of an opposite of cushion property T. No, no, I think that's that's fine. Square root of what of uh maybe let me not get into it. Okay, so I told. Okay, so I told you this is a generalization of Kashmir property T. And let me not prove it, but let me give you at least somehow a few comments on why this is a generalization. Let's say, I think we can erase that because it's easy to remember, it's just reduced homology. Otherwise, it's a copy of that. Okay, so let's say little lemma that if you have T1, then this implies castron property t. Or equivalent. I mean, it's clear that this is stronger than T1. Is stronger than t1, right? Because this is a statement about all unitary representation. This is just about the ones that don't have invariant vectors. But now, supposing t1, we want to show that it has property t. So let v be any unitary representation, possibly also with invariant vectors. We can split this representation in the invariant. This representation in the invariant vectors and the rest. Now we want to show that it has property t, and what helps is a theorem by DeLorn and Guizard. Which says, which is almost what we need, it says that G has cutdown property T. If the first homology vanishes with respect to all representations, so for any unitary G representation W. Okay, so we have to show that H1 of G coefficients in V is what we want. Now we use this splitting. Now we use this splitting and immediately get that this is zero by property t1. This does not have any invariant vectors because this is what I'm splitting off. So what's left is this. Vg is just the trivial G module. So this is actually just homomorphisms. Is actually just homomorphisms from G to V G. This is just an abiding group. Now we want to show that this is zero. Suppose it's not zero. So if this is not zero, then we would have an epimorphism from G to some abelian group, which is either infinite in the discrete case or non-compact. Case or non-compact. Let's just talk about discrete now. So infinite abelian group. And okay, I'm very sketchy here, but what you do now is you look at a G representation, which comes from the regular representation of A. Regular representation of A. So A acts on L to A, G therefore also acts on L to A. If this is infinite, this does not have non-zero invariant vectors. Therefore, also as a G representation, it does not have non-zero invariant vectors. But yeah. Yeah. What do I want to say? I want to say, first of all, in that situation. There's something I don't want to show, but somehow in that situation, something you can read in the book of Becker Watt. Read in the book of Becca Vallette. From the fact that this has almost invariant vectors, one can conclude that this H1 homology is non-Hausdorff. So the reduced would vanish, but the non-reduced does not vanish. But this contradicts now property T1. Okay, this is an argument, I don't know. This is an argument, I don't know, see any book on property T, but this contradicts E1, and therefore this cannot be that this is non-zero. So this has to be zero from the start. And via De Lawme Guichard, this means that the group has property t. Okay, so T1 is just property T. T1 is just property T, and this generalizes. And this is therefore what we call higher property T. When you look at higher degrees, higher than one, then this makes a difference. So I just argued that in degree one, it doesn't make a difference whether I allow invariant vectors or not. In higher degrees, it makes a difference, and it's an important difference. And it's an important difference. All right. Now, what is the relation between this property Tn and this property what I call H Tn? So the following proposition, so this is in the paper with Uri explains this relation, and in short. And in short, if you have H Tn and cast down property T, then you have Tn. So Tn is the stronger property because again, I'm just recalling the reduced cohomology is always smaller. It's a homomorphic image of the non-reduced cohomology. But if you have property T. But if you have property t, there is actually no difference. So I'm a bit short. There are some conditions here. In the situations where I apply this, this is all satisfied. So the situation I'm thinking of are lattices and Lie groups. What I need is that if I'm dealing with discrete group, what I need is that the discrete group satisfies finiteness. Group satisfies finiteness conditions up to the relevant degree in homology. So, something like classifying space with finite skeleton up to this degree. If you're dealing with continuous groups, topological groups, then you have to assume something like it has a lattice that has finiteness conditions. So, there are some mild assumptions, but they are satisfied in our situation. So, why is that true? Give me a So, why is that true? Give me, okay, I'm not fully proving it, but let me give you a sketch of why this is correct. And let me sketch it for discrete groups. So, what you're looking at is a kind of trick with ultra powers. So, when you have a unitary G representation, let me call this ultra power trick. Let me call this ultra power trick. Then you can associate to it the ultra power, which is again a unitary gear representation. So, what is the ultra power? It's you take the product. Take the product of all the V's indexed over the natural numbers. Actually, you take the bounded product, which means you're only looking at sequences that have bounded norm. That's what I mean by this infinity. And then you divide out, that's not a Hilbert space in any sense, but if you divide out an equivalence relation, it becomes a Hilbert space. And the equivalence relation is that you want. Relation is that you want a sequence of vectors, which is a vector in this new space, to be zero if the sequence of its norms converges to zero. But what does converge mean? Because in general, it won't converge, but there is this notion of limit with respect to an ultra filter on the natural numbers. So there is this generalized limit that you always can take for bounded sequences. You always can take for bounded sequences. And if that is zero, then you declare this sequence to be zero. And then the ultra, sorry, the scalar product on this space will be basically a limit over this with respect to this ultra filter of the scalar products in V. And it turns out this is again a Hilbert space, and G acts diagonally on this. And G acts diagonally on this thing and it becomes a unitary G representation. If G is a continuous group, it's more difficult because then it's not a measurable action anymore. And that's why you have to play around a little bit if you're dealing with continuous G, but for discrete groups, this is what you're looking at. And so that's somehow an important thing that this unitary G representation. That these unitary g representations are closed under taking ultra powers because now we prove with a little functional analysis the following general fact that and here we need the finiteness condition by the way so it's kind of hidden in here so if the homology vanishes and does not vanish sorry does not vanish with respect to a unitary G representation it might still be that the reduced homology That the reduced homology vanishes of that thing because it's potentially smaller. But what you can show is that the reduced homology, not of V, but of the ultra power of V is at least non-zero. Okay. So after these preliminary remarks, let us show this implication now. So what we So, what we have to do is we have to pick a G representation V without invariant vectors and have to show that its cohomology up to degree n vanishes. Okay, so let's do that. Let's get into the real proof that B be unitary G representation without invariant vectors. I want to show the homology. Want to show the homology vanishes? Well, suppose by contradiction that in the corresponding range up to n, we have an index i so that the homology does not vanish. Well, then we know by this general fact that the reduced homology of the ultra power does not vanish. And this is in contradiction to the property that we assumed, namely H Tn since. Since, and that's the important thing, the ultra power does not have invariant vectors. So if you take the invariant vectors of the ultra power, remember the elements in there are equivalence classes of sequences. But the g-invariant vectors in here are basically the almost invariant vectors in V. It's still on the board. It's still on the board. Yeah, so almost invariant vectors always refer to a sequence. So, and if you look at how we defined this, it basically means something gets more and more invariant via this equivalence relation. It means that it's really invariant in the ultra product. But since we assumed also Cashdown property T and V does not have invariant vectors, it cannot have almost invariant vectors. Almost invariant vectors. Right, so and this is the sketch of this proof. So if you assume Kashston property T, then the two notions coincide. All right. So yeah. I suppose there should be a more elementary proof of this. There is ultra filter. Not sure. I don't have a. I mean, it's actually quite elementary. I mean, if you accept ultra powers as a thing that really exists, then for being used the powers are like a little like a heavy machinery. It's not heavy, but it's a little bit magic, right? But it's a little bit magic, right? Um, it's something you use something that, yeah, it's a bit, I agree, but it's not so that this fact is not hard, so it's not really hard. And I mean, I should also say this generalizes something in degree one by a Yuda Shalom. So basically, in degree one, this is a theorem by Yuda Shalom. And what you can do there, but it's somehow. But it somehow, we actually tried to generalize his proof, but we found it hard and we couldn't. And then we came up with this proof that I actually find easier, but somehow in degree one, you can use the fact that unitary representations are given by positive definite functions on a group. And then you can do the limit in a space of functions in a group. And then you have an ordinary limit. Or actually, you have like. Or actually, you have like a converging sub-sequence in some compactness argument, but you can circumvent the ultra limit or the ultra power. You have to align some limit. Yeah, but it's still a limit argument. Yeah. Okay, so maybe so much about the general relations of these properties. Now, the question is: which groups do satisfy this property, and maybe even more. Maybe even more urgent, why do we look at these properties? But let me postpone the motivation for a while and first tell you which groups do satisfy these properties. As you know, Cashian property T is a rare property. It's usually hard to show for a group that it has Cassian property T. So you should expect also for the higher Cassian. Also, for the higher Cashian property T, that it's a hard property to show. But here are my main examples. So the first is a theorem that you can find in a book by Bloe. No, not a book, a longer article on homology of law. Longer article on homology of locally compact groups. And it says that, well, in the case of Lie groups, simply connected Lie groups or also just finitely generated in the discrete world, finitely generated new potential groups. Satisfy the property hn for every n. So in all degrees, you have this property. And the second is a theorem that I proved with Uri, which I state it's a general theorem about. General theorem about it's more general than this, but let me just pick out this example. So SLNR and also SLNZ have property TN minus 2. So the general statement is that lattices in simple Lie groups and the simple Lie groups. And the simple Lee groups themselves do have higher property t below the rank of the group. That's the general statement. And the rank in this case is n minus one. So very, very different statement. There's something in the amenable world. And this is somehow in the semi-simple world. Let me indicate: this is basically a spectral sequence argument. You show something for, you show. You show it for abelian groups, and then there's a spectral sequence argument lifting it to the nilpotent case. Here I give you a sketch. So somehow this is not so hard based on what is already there. This is very hard. So here is a sketch of the proof. And so SLNR is kind of easy with what we are having now because there What we are having now because there is a well-studied homology of unitary, irreducible unitary representations of semi-simple Lie groups. And something that you find in the work of Vogen Zuckerman is that if V is a non-trivial Irreducible. So G, so G is SLNR representation. And non-trivial just means it's not the trivial representation if it's irreducible, then the cohomology vanishes. Or i less than n minus 2. So exactly what we want to prove t n minus 2 for sl and r, but we only have it for irreducible ones. Somehow they. Yeah, it's not something, it's really a restriction of the methods that you need irreducible in this kind of theory. But now, if you have an R. Now, if you have an arbitrary representation now, so let W be now an arbitrary unitary G representation. Then it does not necessarily decompose like for finite groups into a direct sum of irreducible representations, but there is a more complicated decomposition into irreducible ones, which is called a direct integral decomposition. Direct integral decomposition. And the fact is that comology behaves poorly with respect to this direct integral decomposition. But what you find, for example, also in this paper of Blanc, where there is a lot of general stuff about Is a lot of general stuff about homology of locally compact groups. Is that reduced homology behaves much better with respect to the direct integral decomposition? Now, if W is an, well, I should not say completely arbitrary, let's say it's a unitary representation without invariant vectors, right? And we want to show that the homology of G with respect to W vanishes up to this degree. Now, all the W axis that appear here will be non-trivial. Appear here will be non-trivial, irreducible representations, and their homology vanishes according to Vogen-Suckerman. And now, this general statement that you find in Blanc's paper, which is kind of well known, is that from that you can conclude that the reduced homology of G with coefficients in W vanishes. Okay, so kind of compatibility. Kind of compatibility of reduced cohomology with direct integral decompositions gives you that the reduced homology vanishes. So basically, what does it give us? It gives us that G has not yet Tn minus 2, but it has H T n minus 2. And now you use that G. And now you use that g has property t because if n is 2, it's an empty statement. t0 is an empty statement. So the only cases that are interesting are SL3 and higher. And there you have property T in the ordinary sense. And with our statement that we just proved, H Tn minus 2 plus Kashnon property T gives us Tn minus 2. Okay, so this is how you how you prove that. Oh, okay. Um yeah, yeah, yeah, it's optimal, okay. Um now I have to decide. I have a bit more than four because we started late, um, but But I want to say that, okay, so SLNC is a wholly different story. It's much, much harder. And it actually involves a good deal of geometric group theory to prove that. You use something about higher Dean functions, which is nice. So just a short advertisement. But let me not go into the case of lettuces now. Let me rather somehow talk about applications of these notions. Applications of this notion. So, and um, yeah, sure, is this just for linear? So, I think Robin and Sigma May have been with linearly groups, or can you also do linear Lie groups, uh, so they have finite center. Um, we can So I'm a bit cautious now. I mean, we actually, there is a certain application that we have in another paper where we're interested in these central extensions of the symplectic groups. And there we have a statement where we conclude basically from T2 of the simple. From T2 of the symplectic group, that the nonlinear extension of it has vanishing in H2 for any unitary representation, even with ones that have invariant vectors. And somehow it we haven't studied it, but it makes me believe that it should be okay for nonlinear groups. But let me think about it. I think it should be okay. I think it should be okay. Okay, so let me say something about applications. I mean, there is a theorem for Kashnam property T that tells you that these central extensions do have Kashnam property T. I mean, like. I mean, like, yeah, I mean, of course, not a product, but these central extensions that appear for the Lee groups, they do have Causion property. And I think it's also correct. Okay, so application is basically computation of homology. So um, this is a very important object to compute. Take trivial coefficients first, but you can also plug in here unitarium representation. This is an object you want to compute. This is an object you want to compute, and so if you have, let's look at a slightly easier situation, which is that if you look not at SLNZ, but you look at the whole compact letters. So first consider this. Then you are somehow in better shape because there is something called Shapiro lemma in chromology, which tells you that the chromology, well, actually, I could take here a gamma representation, can be more general, can be a gamma representation, and it tells you this can be computed as G cohomology of a certain region. Homology of a certain reduced representation. So, where this is the unitary induction, you can write it as this. So, these are gamma equivariant functions measurable from g to v that have a certain That have a certain L2 condition. I mean, if F is gamma equivariant, then this integral actually makes sense over G mod gamma. And somehow you still have a G action on that side on the domain, and that makes this into a unit. And that makes this into a unitary G representation. And something that, again, you can find in this paper by Blo is that you have this Shapiro lemma for co-compact lattices. Now, if you look at, let's say, the case here, the trivial representation. Then this induction is just L to G mod gamma. And the thing is that what we have to do to show the previous theorem for SLNZ, which I haven't done, or to conclude it, the higher property T for SLNZ from the higher property of SLNR, is basically to show, and that's the main work, to show a kind of Shapiro lambda. Main work to show a kind of Shapiro lemma for non-co-compact lattices that at least works in a range of degrees below the rank. It doesn't work in all degrees. This works in all degrees for co-compact lattices. For non-co-compact lattices, we have to show a Shapiro-Lemma, kind of a Shapiro-lemma, a bit cautious here, because it's not very specific, but it's a kind of substitute of that, that works in degrees below the rank. Now, Rank now, so that's somehow the main body of work or non-co-compact lattices. Oh, but if we believe that, and let's look at the trivial representation, then below the rank, we could now, well, let's call this gamma now. Well, I called it gamma, the co-compact letters. Let's call it, I don't know, let's call it lambda. So then, such a Shapiro lemma would say this is the continuous homology of SLNR with coefficients in. With coefficients in L2, this is G, G mod lambda. But this L to G mod lambda, these L2 functions, splits into the trivial constant functions and functions which have mean zero. And this part does not contain invariant vectors. Vectors and then knowing that we have property tn minus 2 for these groups, we know this does not contribute to the homology. So the only thing that contributes to the homology is the trivial one. So we're here below n minus 1. And it turns out that this sequence, the Shapiro isomorphism that V. Shapiro isomorphism that we prove in this sequence of isomorphisms is just the restriction mark. So the restriction from the continuous cohomology of SLNR to the ordinary cohomology of SLNZ is a isomorphism below the rank, below n minus one. And this object is very much computable. This is homology of the compact dual of the locally symmetric of the symmetric space. Of the symmetric space. So, this is an exterior algebra that you can explicitly write down. And therefore, you get this explicit calculation up to the rank. And this extends the classic result of Borel, who showed this for n minus one divided by four. For n minus one divided by four. And I should say that this, but just this for the trivial coefficients was proved by Die Zun and somehow private communication also by Harold Ubner like two years ago. But somehow, an outcome of our method is. Outcome of our method is that actually, not only for the trivial representation, this restriction isomorphism, this restriction map is an isomorphism, but for any unitary SLNR representation, the restriction map is an isomorphism below the rank. So in that sense, it gives you calculations of Of homology groups of these arithmetic lattices. Maybe what's also kind of nice is you can push this. I mean, this holds below the rank, but you can also look at situations that have infinite rank, so to speak. So infinite rank situation would mean, and let me state it. Would mean, and let me state it in maybe now more generality. So if you look at the cohomology of SLN of the Adels of Q to SLNQ. So this is a lattice, a huge group, but it's still a lattice in that group. A lattice in that group, and this is an isomorphism in every degree and for every unitary SLNA representation. And the funny thing is, if you specialize this to the trivial representation, then Then it turns out that somehow the finite adeques don't contribute to the cohomology. It's only SLNR that contributes to the cohomology. And what you get is that in all degrees, the map from the continuous cohomology of SLNR to the ordinary cohomology of SLNQ is an isomorphism. And that also is the theorem of Borel that has a certain history. Don't go into that now. But it can be generalized also. I mean, it doesn't have to be SLNR. It's again for all semi-simple groups, algebraic groups. Algebraic groups, simply connected algebraic groups. So let me end with an application of the other property. So this was all about H, sorry, about Tn. And what about the H Tn? And that's maybe let me see, let me erase that. Application of HTM. So remember, I told you that the potent groups satisfy this property in all degrees. And there is a very famous. Very famous open question in the quasi-isometry classification of lattices in D-groups. So, this classification is basically done, except for one major case, which is the case of nilpotent groups. So, every finitely generated nilpotent group is a lattice in what's called the Milsef completion, a simply connected. Maybe I have to assume torsion-free. Well, up to finite index, I can assume that. Up to finite index, I can assume that. It's a lattice in a simply connected milpotent Lie group. And somehow the big conjecture says that if you have two quasisometric Nilipoten groups, then they have the same Miles F completion. There are lattices in the same Nilipoten Lie group. If they are, they're certainly quasi-symmetric because these lattices are always co-compact. But the reverse is a conjecture. And somehow, this property H and T is. This property h and t is related to this conjecture because if you have two nilpotent groups which are quasi-symmetric, then, and let's assume, just for simplification, that there is a bijective quasi-sometimete, which is not necessarily the case, but let's say you have a bijective one. It's just to simplify things, then you can. Then you can define a kind of unitary induction like we looked at. I mean, okay, here it's somehow gone. This one here. There is a unitary induction for quasi-sometry. So how does this go? What you can do is you can form the space, and now we get a control set. So inside the space of maps from gamma to lambda with the pointwise convergence topology. Pointwise convergence topology. I can look at this f and gamma acts from the left and lambda x from the right. And I take the gamma times lambda orbit of this one little element in there and take the closure with respect to the topology. It's a certain locally compact, locally compact because it's a quasi-sometimy. So there is a Artella-Ascoli argument. It's a locally compact space, this omega, on which still you have commuting actions of gamma. You have commuting actions of gamma and lambda. Now, since this is bijective, it's very easy to give a fundamental domain of both the gamma and lambda actions. They have a common fundamental domain, and it's given by the quasi-isometries in omega. So all the elements in omega will be quasi-isometries, not just f. And if you look at the quasi-isometries that map one to one, this is a fundamental domain. Of both actions monomical. Now, there is now a kind of Shapiro lemma in this situation. So remember here, let's erase this. This was L2. This was L2GV gamma. And if you pick a gamma fundamental domain of G, you could write this as a space, forgetting about the group action for a moment, as a space of L2 functions from this fundamental domain to V. And if V is a trivial representation, this is really just L2x. Now, there is a situation, there is something like this in this situation. In in this situation, which gives you a map from the cohomology of gamma, and let's talk about trivial representations, to the comology of the other group, but now somehow with the unitary induction of the trivial representation, which is now just L to X. Is now just L to X, where X is this fundamental domain. So X is a fundamental domain, right? Which means X is just omega mod gamma. But you have these commuting actions of lambda and gamma on omega, so you still have an action of lambda on x, and that gives you an action of lambda on. action of lambda on L to X. And now you might ask, where is the measure? There was no measure. But amenability gives you invariant measures. So use amenability of these groups to define an actually can define an ergodic invariant measure on this space X. Now, these groups have property HDN. So if I split this into L2x0 plus the trivial constant. Constant functions. And I'm looking at reduced homology, which I might because this Shapiro isomorphism, not isomorphism, the Shapiro map actually works for reduced. Then I know by HTN that this is just this. And actually, the map is given by integrating. Given by integrating, I mean, the integration is somehow the projection on the invariant vector. So, somehow this map here is there. But with trivial coefficients, the reduced cohomology is just the ordinary cohomology. So, what you get is, as an application, is that the Betty numbers of Nilpotent groups are Qi invariants. And that was a theorem by Chalom. And then I generated. And then I generalize it. This is an older story. So, the theorem that I after Chalom proved is that this isomorphism that you get now is actually, let's call it phi. Phi is a cohomology algebra isomorphism. So it respects the somehow the cup product structure. The cup product structure. Now, you can even go further, and I will finish in two minutes. So, the conjecture says in that situation, gamma and lambda should be lattices in the same potential simply connected Lie group. So, we know they are lattices in some groups, G and H, in their so-called Malcif completions. We want to show that G and H are isomorphic. Now, to Now, it turns out that this cohomology is just the continuous cohomology of G. And this is the continuous cohomology of H. And you should not be surprised because this is the argument we did for SLNR and SLNZ. And we used Tn to prove this. Now we have H Tn, but since we're dealing with the constant coefficient, Constant coefficients, there is no difference between reduced and unreduced, so this still is there. Now you have a homology algebra isomorphism between the homology of these Lie groups. Now, these Lie groups can be computed via their Lie algebra. So there is a so-called standard Chevrolet-Inberg complex of the Lie algebra. And similar here. And now, a funny thing is, so these things here, these are DGAs, differential graded algebras. If a homolog of differential graded algebras from this Chevrolet-Iinberg complex to this Chevrolet-Inberg complex, which is a cohomology isomorphism, you could conclude by You could conclude by rational homotropic theory that G and H are isomorphic. We don't have that because we don't know that this map that we have between the cohomology is induced by a EDGA map on the chain complexes. We don't know that. We only know that on the cohomology, it's multiplicative. What we need now is a higher multiplicativity on the chain complexes, something called an A-infinity map between this chain. Called an A-infinity map between these chain complexes. And then you could show this conjecture. But it's kind of neat because it's like you're using nilpotency in this approach, which is not done. I mean, this is conjectural that this might work, but you use nilpotency in a very black boxed way, right? First, you only use property h tn for every n. You don't need nil potency at all. And only in a very Potency at all. And only in the very last step, you somehow use nilpotency to say that if you have somehow a map that respects all the higher multiplicativity structure, then it's actually coming from an isomorphism GNH. This is at the very last step. And okay. And I should stop here. Um you uh share them out here about arithmetic use. I mean, does it use that it's arithmetic or does it work well? It uses arithmeticity. How? Yeah, in a very hidden way. So what we use is that That so we are using Dean functions. So, what are Dean functions? In the geometric sense, you're looking at isoparametric problems, right? You're looking at somehow maybe in the symmetric space, you're looking at a D-sphere, D-dimensional sphere of a certain volume, and you try to fill it by a D plus one disk with somehow optimal volume. And somehow, if this volume of the D plus one, Somehow, if this volume of the D plus one disk depends just polynomially on the D volume of the sphere, you would say it has a polynomial isoparametric function. Now, the symmetric space is a ketzero space, and all the ketzero spaces have isoparimetric functions that are not worse than Euclidean space. So they're in particular polynomial. Now, if you have a co-compact lattice and you look somehow at its classifying space, which Classifying space, which, for example, is just the quotient of the symmetric space by this. Or actually, the E gamma would be the symmetric space then. And since it's co-compact, now okay, let me start again. So, if you want to say what is the isoparametric function of a lattice, you would take a classifying space of finite type and define this volume combinatorially in terms of you have a In terms of you have a, I don't know, you have a sphere which is kind of simplicial and you want to fill it by a simplicial disk, and then you're just counting somehow simplices. This is kind of the substitute of the volume. If it's a co-compact lettuce, then it is asymptotically the same as this geometric fitting function on the symmetric space. If it's not co-compact, it's absolutely not clear if you take a classifying space of finite type. Classifying space of finite type for this non-co-compact lattice, whether the isoparametric functions still compare with the geometric ones of the symmetric space. But Leutzinger and Young showed that for arithmetic lattices, this is the case below the degree. And if you go to the degree, it's not true. Then you have exponential filling functions, but it's polynomial below the degree. And so. And so, what we do is, so this is where we need arithmeticity, but we also need it, as I said, we need it not only there, we only need it at other places. So what we do is the following. So, you want to show something like this. Now, what we do is the following. There is something called polynomial homology, where you take co-chains whose value, whose norm somehow depends polynomially on the length of the functions of the elements here. And somehow, what is, and there's a comparison map like that. And so you use Leutzinger-Yang to get an isomorphism below the rank here. So compare the polynomial cohomology with the ordinary cohomology. This uses Leutzinger-Yang. This is always an isomorphism in all degrees, basically because G behaves like a cockopite lattice itself. G behaves like a coccotype lattice itself. It's like you have a ketzero structure. And now you want to show that this is an isomorphism to conclude that this is an isomorphism. But the thing is that, yeah, we show this as an isomorphism, but we use arithmeticity in a sense also here. Because what you need is that. You need is that you have somehow when you write this induction as L2 of a fundamental domain, you want very nice properties of the fundamental domain. So you want siegel sets, you want some reduction theory for this x. And somehow, so therefore, it's in the end, it's all very specific to this situation. It's not a general Shapiro lemma. Even if we know that the polynomial cohomology is an isomorphism here, this step Isomorphism here, this step again uses quite specific properties of the arithmetic situation. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really for arithmetic. But luckily, everything we need, we can package in things that is somewhere. So we don't have to dig somehow into too deep into how to construct this X. I mean, this is somehow, this is there. Yeah. T N does not involve finiteness properties, right? No, the finiteness properties go into the proof. Well, here they go into the, I mean, to talk about somehow isoparametric function on a group, higher isoparametric function doesn't make sense if you don't have a finite skeleton in this, but um. In this, but in the proof in the ultra-power argument, we use finiteness conditions because I was thinking whether Tn is an open property in the sense that if a sequence of groups converges to a given group which has Tn, whether at some point the sequence of groups will also have Tn and this will but if property T n would all just be defined Would all just be defined for groups within this properties. This would not make sense. No, it's not defined. I mean, it is defined, you can always define it. It's just in the argument, yeah, in this argument that if you have h tn plus Kashnam property t, that you have tn. In that argument, we need that gamma has finiteness conditions and The reason is, I mean, I can give you show you the proof why you need this. You can give a nice argument with the combinatorial Laplacian that somehow requires that they have a basically what you want is that the cohomology of your group with coefficients in the Hilbert space is computed by a Hilbert space chain complex. That's what we need. Because this ultra power functor is then a functor on chain complexes of Hilbert space. Functor on chain complexes or Philbert spaces. And you get this if you have a finite resolution or finite type resolution or something. But defined is it for every group? But you can now speculate, of course. So how does Tn relate to finiteness condition, right? There's kind of. Yeah, that's a very appealing question. That's a very appealing question because. Yeah, okay. It's a very appealing question. So, I mean, for those who don't know, so Kashmir property T for a countable group implies that the group is finitely generated. And you can do a little more. So using this, what I said, Euler Shalom proved for the first homology, used that to deduce that every finitely generated Cushion property T group is a homomorphic image of a Property T group is a homomorphic image of a finitely presented Captain property T group. So it's like next step. And you can, yeah. Yeah. It's a good question. Okay, so is there any further question? They seem to be the case, so let's take no again to go.
