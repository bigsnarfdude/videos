Here I'm going to going to talk about the three aspects I've done in the last four years. The first, we have borrowed the information survey. We have borrowed some quantities from information survey, which is previous, which is denoted as ITA. And also, based on the Also, based on descriptors, and we use linear regression to predict the response properties. And we have shown that this protocol can be used for many systems. Also, when we go to larger systems such as proteins and protein aggregates, maybe we should first divide the protein into fragments. Protein into fragments. Finally, we further improve the accuracy of the linear regression with deep learning of non-linear regression. We all know that science is questioned by the solar in this talk. My question is: Can we predict the response properties of biomolecules simultaneously? Because Because in the literature, we know that for large proteins, we can use fragment-based methods to predict the response properties. But here, we try to predict two properties at a time. And this is the this is the input. And we want to obtain the output of polarization. The output of polarizability at the molecular level and the chemical shadings at the atomic level. Question number two is: Can the model achieve the gold standard of yeast, which is proposed in this science paper? And from our work, we ask the question in the affirmative. To make that happen, we have to make some changes. First, we have to put this. This process is conventionally what we use in conventional calculations. We obtain the molecular orbitals and further we can obtain the molecular orbital derivatives for the CP hard fork or CP constraint equations, and finally we can get the response properties. But this But this process is very computationally demanding for larger systems, or sometimes even intractable. So in this talk, we'll try to go another way. First, we obtain the electron density from the molecular orbitals. Then when you mirror integrate all the electron density and the And its derivatives into information served quantities. We further obtain the regression equations based on the linear regression or deep learning of small systems. One can further predict the properties of larger systems. And in the right panel, we have shown some. Some definitions have shown some definitions of the information theoretical approach quantities. The first two are the famous shannon entropy and the information, which in the formulas we can see here is the electron density and this is the first order gradient. Here are the kinetic energy density and the Thomas Flamy kinetic energy density. Also, for the relative shannon entropy, this is the reference. Shannon entropy, this is the reference density. All these quantities have been summarized in our two reviews here. And up to now, we have only showed these quantities at the molecular level. To obtain the atomic contributions, we have to partition the whole density into Partition the whole density into its atomic contributions via the Hirschweld partition scheme. Up to now, we have shown that we have built a model, we have built a protocol, and next we try to demonstrate its wide applicability. In the left panel, we first In the left panel, we first in 2021 in this work, in this GFPC people, we just this publication will first correlate the G1 and G swift functions of relative facial information with the experimental polarizability. And we can see that the correlation coefficients are reasonably good. Good. And all this work, and from this work on, we... this work on we have we have published a series of work along this side along this line and and all the systems in the right panel we can see we have inorganic uh organic and uh and and other systems are not shown here and but we have shown that we this prototype can work for very cancel systems Rarely cancel systems of both localized and delocalized electronic structures. Next, we try to apply this protocol to more challenging systems. This hydrogen trains. This work is inspired by Rita who works spanning almost 20 years. Almost 20 years. In with publications, we have shown that this model system will be problematic for some density functionals, such as PBE, PVE, BLIP, and etc. And the hard fork is even better than PBE. And take the CCSD parentheses as a gold standard. As a gold standard, we want to understand why there is such a large overestimation. And Professor Vital has theoretically tried to understand why there is large gap. And in this slide, I'll try to show that we can use this protocol to bridge this gap. And how How we achieve that? Because we use this ITA based on this model system and after we establish the linear regressions, we can calibrate the predicted values to the CSSV parenthesis level. And the root mean square error deviation is about 2.2. Is about 2.2 atomic units. And the second, also for this system, we shall answer the question posed by Paul. He once asked that can the four-side energies or properties be predicted with harsh force or depth densities? And here in this model system, our answer is yes. We use four-side energies at the DM. Energies at the DMRG level, and we calculate all the attitude quantities at this hash for 63.G star level, and we can build linear regressions, and we can calculate the deviations, and the mean absolute area is three, two, four mini hatches. So, for this system, we have answered two questions. Now, we are going to We are going to take a look at the larger systems, but before that, before we dive into the problem, we have to introduce some techniques. This is a fragment-based method called GBF, which is devised proposed from a PhD supervisor. This method is based on the divide and counter philosophy. Philosophy proposed by Vital in 19, maybe 1989. Also, we used this principle of near-setting is proposed by Walcoin in PNS paper. Here, in this method, we take a hexa-peptide, I'll try to outline some key points of this method. This method. Take a hexa-peptide as an illustration. We have six amino acids, and each amino acid is considered as a fragment. And centered at each fragment, we are building some subsystems or some clusters with a threshold of distance. And for each And for each for this primitive subsystem, we have the coefficients CM, and they are all said to be one. But to cancel the overlap between, say, these two subsystems, we have to construct some derivative subsystems to guarantee that all the atoms in these subsystems only appear once. And the coefficients for these subsystems are automatic. Subsystems are automatically determined by the inclusion and exclusion principle. With all these subsystems constructed, we can calculate the atomic charges well natural popular analysis. And now we have all the coefficients, all the subsystem energies and the atomic charges. Then we can get the total energies of a large system while the cross-core. What are the corresponding quantities from this small electrostatically embedded subsystems? And with this equation, we can take the derivative of the total energy with some parameters such as coordinates or magnetic perturbations, etc., and we can finally obtain the response properties. The fragment-based method GBF has developed for almost two decades. And now we have come to a plateau according to my experiences. So in the last four years, I have proposed two alternative ways in predicting the response properties of complex systems with Paul Els and Professor Shugin. The philosophy is the two proteins have the same philosophy as GBF because we have a large systems. This is what we call the target system and we have subsystems. In the original GBF, we have to calculate all the subsystems and especially for the And especially for properties, we have their computationally demanding. So our aim is not to compute the computationally demanding CP hardware or CP constraint equations. Rather, we try to predict the properties rather than linear regression or deep learning. Finally, we obtain the target, the properties of the target system rather than linear combination. Was this linear combination? First, we apply this GBF linear regressionality protocol to some biomolecules, some proteins, and take the GBF values in the last column as reference. And we have achieved almost 95% of the accuracy of the GBF method. And next, we applied this protocol to condensed based systems on the periodic boundary conditions. And this is the original PVC-GBL method, which was devised in 2015, and I have also contributed in 2020. In the original PVCG. In the original PVCGBF, we have to calculate all the systems, all the subsystems of one, two, M-body, subsystem, one, two, m-body subsystems. And if you, this is okay for DFT level, but if we want to calculate them as MP2 or CC or or even higher, this is almost impossible. And in so based on this, based on PBCGBF, we have made some changes. First, we also calculate the sub systems only to 1, 2, minus 2, 1, or minus M minus 2, two body subsystems. And we build the linear regressions between IIT quantities and the response. And the response properties. Then we can predict the time-consuming subsystem, the environment subsystems, and finally we obtain the properties while this linear combination. Also, we have demonstrated that the density is not that important because we can use hard fork densities as an input. Input Now we have built such a model and we will demonstrate its accuracy and its applicability. We choose two forms of benzene crystals, hydrogen fluoride and sodium chloride, 10 asprysters and 3 aspirates. 10 aspirations and 3 aspirin crystals, and also the liquid water from AIMD simulations. And for these systems of small monomers, small monomers such as one, each water molecule is taken as a fragment. So it's here we used a a molecule-based frag strategy. A molecule-based flag strategy, but there are some crystals which have large monomers inside a unicell, and in this case, we have to further decompose the large monomers into fragments. And in this case, we have to use a fragment-based PBC-GBF method to fragment the whole system into small subsystems. And here we try to demonstrate. And here we try to demonstrate the transferability of this model. We use two polymorphs of written novel. And here is a we use the form one to build the relationships. And then based on these regressions, we can predict the probabilities of from two. Form two has four large molecules inside the unit cell, and from one has two. Units and from one has tubes. And from our results, we have demonstrated we have used ITA quantities at harsh fog level to predict the MP2 level polarizability. And also our statistical results show that the mean absolute percentage error is about 3%. So in this case, we have shown that this protocol has a good performance of transferability. Performance of transferability. Finally, now we have, I have shown that for the linear regression and the linear regression, I think this protocol and also GBF. Also, here we try to use deep learning to replace the linear regression. So, here's the deep learning architecture. Here, the aim. The input of this architecture is all the ITA quantities. If we use the molecular level ITA quantities, then we can output the polarizabilities. If we use atomic contributions, then here are the NMRK machines. And this code is available at this site, at this website. And also, And also we can see that for at the molecular level, we can obtain very, very good linear correlate, very, very good correlations between the calculated polarizability and the predicted polarizabilities. Also, at the atomic level, this is lesser accurate. Based on these correlations, we should predict the response properties of even larger systems. And in this slide, we should predict the properties of proteins more than 4,000 atoms. And here are the larger proteins. And these are the protein aggregates, tetramer, dimer, and tremor. And from the data in the in the And from the data in the table, we can see that still, we take the GBF GBF values as a reference. This is a linear regression GBFIT per token. The mean percentage error is about absolute percentage error is about 6%. And with this deep learning GBF IT protocol, we BFIT protocol we have reduced this division for almost an order of magnitude. Also, we have shown that this prototype faster is these two protocols are of the same efficiency and but And but it's faster, three times faster than the GBF. So together, we have shown that GBF deep learning method with IT equities as input, we have a good performance of scalability. Next, we try to understand because we use only 20 amino acids and the four hundred and four 400 dipeptides and 8 000 tripeptides and we don't have we don't have intermolecular interactions in this in this data in this training data set but how can we predict the response properties of protein aggregates and why we can have good such a good performance and to to make that happen we have To make that happen, we have plotted the divisions. The divisions of all the subsystems multiply the coefficients, and we can see that this is almost a Gaussian distribution. And we have negative divisions, and we also have positive divisions. And take the largest one here. Take the largest division. Largest division as an illustration, we can also trace back to the subsystems. Here we can see that the 15th and the 16th primitive subsystems, there are some obvious long-covalent interactions within these systems. Yes, it means that there are fragments from different amino acids and the intermolecular interaction. Intermolecular interactions are bores here in these four subsystems, which are the cost of the larger deviations. But in total, we have to sum all the deviations. So the error cancellation makes the total results very good. Also, this reminds us of the good inheritance of GBF because GPF has error cancellation. Has error cancellation with the total energies. To dig deeper with the help of POLS, we have to, we can also argue from a theoretical point of view. For this E2, one of the 11 active quantities, this definition, it has been shown that this quantity can be correlated with. Can be correlated with the isotropic polarizabilities. To verify its correlation with the alpha, we have our starting point is the local softness in conceptual density functional theory. With the LDA approximation, the local softness is expressed as a As an expression of the electron density in such a way, and this is the absolute value. And we can further use a reference model such as reference model local software, such as S0, S0, and we can choose S002. S O 0 to we can choose S O S 0 to below interacting atoms and the total isotropic pluralizability can be the exact sum of isolated atomic contributions. And finally, one can infer such a formula. Then if we insert, we insert. We insert here this formula and this this and the reference contributions into this and take a take take a take a look at the result. And finally, we can argue that there is indeed some correlations between the E2, E3, and the alpha. Further, we can use relative feature information, atomic decomposed relative feature information G3 to understand why G3 can correlate with pro-reliability. And our starting point is that atomic densities can be expressed here. Here is the effective nuclear charge. And if we assume that this quantity is almost around Almost around the take the log algorithm and we can further write down this this equation. This equation means that the duration of the atoms in the molecule, the effective charge, this equation means that we the atoms large difference large differences indicate that atoms in a molecule has been polarized, which Being polarized, which indicates that the atoms in your molecule is polarizable, which can help to explain why the large values of G3 can correlate with polarizability. Okay, I will try to summarize what we have done in the last four years. Last four years, we have combined, we have used IT quantities as molecular and atomic descriptors of response properties. Combined with machine learning and fragment-based GBF, we have built a model of high efficiency, accuracy, and also robustness. And along this drive, And along this direction, I'm also want to try to understand on we want to we want to also try to know what can we do next. And also we have shown that we can use this protocol for the database for about 90,000 molecules in a database level. And at the database level, we can also have strong linear correlations between the polarized. Between the polarizabilities and the IT communities. Finally, I try to thank all the guys on these slides also and the financial support from National Science Foundation Committee and the Union Province. This is my master's student, this is Yining, and Paul Els, and this is my supervisors, Shubin Liu. This is the PhD. This is the PhD word, or just my current boss. That's the end of my talk. Thank you.
