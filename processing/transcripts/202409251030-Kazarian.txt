So my talk is based on a series of joint works with my colleagues, Sasha Alexandrov, Boria, Bishkov, Peter Don Barkovsky, and Sergei Shaldjan. Sasha and Peter are here and Boria and Sergey are morally here also. We have written about around ten papers in the last few years. Few years, and actually, we arrived to a new understanding of what topological recursion is. And my talk will be a little guide to how to read our papers. But of course, I should start with the original definition of topological recursion, how it appeared in the In the papers of Chekhov in Ranten, when they applied it to matrix model, and then in Ranten formalized and axiomatized this procedure in modern situation. So I will give the first I will give the original definition of topological recursion. You can meet it in the introduction of almost every paper on topological recursion, but it Topological recursion, but if you are not familiar with the subject, this doesn't help. So, the way I will introduce the topological recursion is what I missed when I entered to this subject. So, now I will have a chance to share my understanding what they do. So, I will start with a kind of overview of the theory. I will give later Give later exact, precise definition, but for a moment, let me give just a kind of overview or a kind of motivation, what do we have, what we need to compute. So there are huge problems in mathematical physics and kimblatorics, where the answer is formulated in the collection of quantities called correlators labeled by partition and by a positive integer G. And by a positive integer G. And there are huge amounts of problems of this type, and even during these conferences, we have seen many of them. These are combinatories of Horwitz numbers with some variations of what we mean by Hurwitz numbers also. Enumeration of maps with different markings. And these And this the enumeration of maps appears in the topological expansion of matrix models and also in Grom-Witten theory, in intersection theory of modular spaces, Peel-Petersium volumes of modulus spaces, Mazarwich volumes of the modular spaces of Model spaces of abelian differentials and many, many, many other cases. It happens that nowadays it's a kind of belief that if you have a problem of this type, then most probably there is a topological recursion behind. If not, it means that you just that you should correct the way how you pack the quantities to a generated series. If you do it correctly, then most probably. Correctly, then most probably it should work. So we need to compute these numbers, and topological recursion provides a way to do that. First of all, we collect them to a generating series. So one of the ways is to produce the collected them to a single generating series. Sometimes it's called potential, sometimes it's called free energy. Called free energy. This is an infinite series in the collection of variables for which these quantities are just Taylor coefficients. And many integrable properties are formulated in terms of the potential, like some integrable hierarchies, Herodotus equations, Virasoro constraints, W algebra equations. So all these So all these properties depend on the particular problem, and sometimes they also provide a way to compute the Taylor coefficients. But the topological recursion is a different thing. So we collect the same numbers in a different generating series called endpoint function. So the difference is that we have here a single collection of variables for all G and N, but For all G and N, but here for different values of N, we have different corrections of independent variables. So here we put the indices Ki as the indices of the corresponding P variables, but here they participate as exponents of the W variables. And the topological recursion computes these endpoint functions in a These endpoint functions in a closed form. So, this topological recursion provides an algorithm how to compute this in a closed form. But what does it mean to compute in a closed form? It's just an infinite series. What does it mean that we would like to compute it in a closed form? Actually, the main idea that if we apply a suitable change of variables, that the function becomes The function becomes irrational. In many cases, it happens that after a suitable change of variables, the function becomes rational. And this change of variables is the same for all G and N. And if it is rational, it means that it's characterized by a finite number of its coefficients. So we can write explicitly all the coefficients of this rational function. Coefficients of this rational function, and this provides the answer. And this is the main sources of misunderstanding in topological recursion. Actually, we do not compute the correlators, the F correlators, one by one in the topological recursion. Instead, we compute the total generating series. And we And we cannot compute a single correlator until we identify all coefficients of this rational genetic series. And then you can, if you have a formula for endpoint functions, then you apply the inverse transformation in the corresponding inverse local change of coordinates, and you can recover the original. And you can recover the original expansion in the original coordinate W. And then the coefficients of these expansions are the corresponding correlators. Okay, so this rationality of on-point function could be reformulated in a more geometric way in the following as follows. So we consider projective line with global affine coordinate Z and the And the the fact that h is rational means that from the point of algebraic geometry means that h is a global meromorphic function on the nth Cartesian product of sigma of the spectral curve. So we have a global a global algebraic algebraic Algebraic manifold, the Anth-Cartesian product of CP1. The function is defined globally, but we are interested in the power expansion of this globally defined function at one specified point. And also we have we know the local coordinate at this point along to expansion local coordinate and this local coordinate. Local coordinate, and this local coordinate does not necessarily expand globally to the whole spectral curve. We have situations like that. So the topological recursion computes this global rational function. So rational function means that ratio of two polynomials. And we have numerator and denominator. The denominator is responsible for. The denominator is responsible for the poles of this function. And it happens that the poles have also a very specific form. It happens that the poles are situated at some number of specific points of the spectral curve. So there is a distinguished set. There is a distinguished set of allowed singularities and all poles are. And all poles are placed at these singularities with respect to each of a particular variable. It means that this function has this form. The pulse could be of high order, but the order is bounded by g and l, and one can derive from the recursion the bound for the order of poles. And in the enumerator, we have a polynomial. numerator we have a polynomial and the degree of this polynomial is bounded by the requirement that it is regular at infinity. The function should be regular at infinity. So this is what we're trying to compute by topological recursion and the idea that the recursion itself involves not the expansion at the origin where what we are interested in but the expansion Interested in, but the expansion near the poles. The topological recursion studies the behavior of these functions near the poles. And playing with this expansion, we just recover these polynomials. And technically the to be honest, the recursion itself involves not the endpoint functions actually, but what is called end point differentials. What is called endpoint differentials. Endpoint differential is just the object that is obtained by differentiating taking the derivative, the exterior derivative of this function with respect to each of the variables. So we have one differential with respect to each of the variables. And if you consider this as a function, is an object depending on Depending on one of the coordinates, is just one differential, and the other coordinates serve as parameters. So, formally speaking, this object is a section, global meromorphic section of the corresponding line bundle whose fibers are tensor product of cotangent lines to the factors of Cartesian product. And finally, the last The last small remark is that it makes sense to make a small change, small correction, and to modify slightly zero to differential by adding this singular term on the diagonal. Actually, it's a matter of convention, but it happens that with this correction, the formulas of topological recursion become more uniform. More uniform and actually simpler. Okay, so now let me formulate what now let me pass to the actual definition how the recursion works yeah before I do that let me just show an example it have it have not appeared in this conference so there was some discussion of numeration Discussion of enumeration of maps, of matrix integrals, but this is another source, computatorial source of many examples, so-called Hurwitz numbers. So Hurwis numbers in the ramified coverings of a Riemann sphere are the same as meromorphic functions with prescribed collection of uh critical values, or they could be defined purely cumbulatorily. Purely combinatorily, in terms of factorization in the permutation group into transpositions. So they actually solve the following problem: given a transposition, given a permutation, how many possibilities are there to represent this permutation as a product of a given number of transpositions? So, precisely, up to this combinatorial factor, we enumerate all possible. We enumerate all possible sequences of M transpositions in the permutation group such that the product of these transpositions have a prescribed cyclic type. So it is a product of independent cycles of lengths k1, k2, and kn in the corresponding permutation group S D, where D is the sum of Ki's. And also, And also, there is an extra condition, the connectness condition, which could be formulated in different ways. For instance, the group generated by this tau ice, by this transposition, should act transitively on the set of permuted elements. Or equivalently, this connectness condition means that we cannot split the points of the permuted elements. Of the permuted elements into two non-empty subgroups such that each permutation acts on either of these two subgroups. Anyway, so these are purely combinatorial numbers, and we collect them to corresponding endpoint differentials. Don't forget singular zero to correction. And then this is an infinite series because n here. Infinite series because n here is a number of cycles. So if we fix small l, say n equal to 3, we consider all possible factorization of permutations consisting of three cycles. But the lengths could be arbitrarily large, so this is an infinite series. And then a miracle happens. If you make such a strange substitution, this is inversible. This is inversible local substitution, z exponent of minus z, so-called equation of Lambert curve. So if you make such a strange substitution, that by some chance the corresponding differentials become rational. So this is the answer for small g and m. And you see these rational differentials and z-coordinates. So if you would Z coordinates, so if you would like to recover the original Hurwitz numbers, you should make the inverse change of variables, substitute, and expand in the W coordinates. And you can observe that the denominator has a very specific form, so they have a pulse only at the point z equal to one. So the set of distinguished allowed singularities can Allowed singularities consist of just a single point one. So we are interested in the power expansion of this differential origin. The origins they are regular, but they have when you consider an analytic extension to the whole spectral curve, they have poles at the points equal to one. So this behavior of the differential happens in the stable range, so for G n. The stable range for stable Gn, except for two exceptional cases, 0, 1 and 0, 2. So this is 0, 1 differential, which is still Meromorphic and global, but it has pole at infinity rather than at the point equal to 1. So it's an exceptional case. And it's convenient to represent it as the form y dx, when y is equal to z. y is equal to z and x is logarithm of w and 0 to differential is also given here and you see that actually this singular correction in this particular case makes things actually simpler. So after this singular correction the differential takes this simple form when written in z coordinate. Coordinate. So, this is what we get at the answer, and the topological recursion explains how to get this answer by playing with the poles of these differentials at the point z equal to 1. So, now let me give actually the definition. So, the topological recursion is a recursive procedure which produces a system of Which produces a system of endpoint differentials from the considerably small amount of initial data. So sigma is the spectral curve in our case is the projective line, but also there is a more general situation when sigma is just arbitrary algebraic curve, but But even for the in the case of sigma CP1, we have huge amount of very nice and important applications. So B is a so-called Bourbon kernel, is a symmetric B differential with a pole on the diagonal. In the case of CP1, as given by this formula, when Z is a global affine coordinate, and for more general cases. And for more general case, one consider, might consider a more general case, then B should be symmetric B differential with the same singularity, the same second order pole along the diagonal and no singularities outside the pole. There are some ways how can it can be fixed in the case when sigma is algebraic, but let me skip this detail. Skip this detail. Finally, dx and dy are two merimorphic differentials. In the original definition of Chechov Henara-Runten, they assume that X and Y are themselves meromorphic, but actually, as you have seen in the simplest case of Hurwitz numbers, X has logarithmic singularities, so it's better to So it's better to consider just that assume that dx is meromorphic. It's sufficient that assume that dx and dy are meromorphic. Actually, all the procedure works very well in this situation. And the constant term, adding a constant to x or to y doesn't change top topological recursion. So let me assume that dx and dy are meromorphic. And dy are meromorphic. And also, I fix some collection of simple zeros of dx, which are critical points of x. So I assume that all of them are simple. There is, of course, the situation when it consists of all critical points of X. And this is what is used. What is usually assumed. But the definition, again, the definition works very well if we consider just if we include only part of poles, a part of zeros of dx to the set of distinguished points. And we could assume that there are other zeros of dx where the behavior of x and y. Where the behavior of x and y could be arbitrary. And so to this initial data, we associate a sequence of differentials. So the initial differentials are given by an unstable differential y dx and the bourbon kernel. And all other differentials are given by recursive procedures that I describe now. The actual uh recursion consists of two steps. In the first step, we compute how to say the initial approximation of the desired differential that I denote by omega tilde. It has n arguments. The first one is distinguished, though, so I this So I denote this by Z without indices. And the other arguments are Z2, Z3, and so the N that I denote this way. Actually, this differential is not globally defined with respect to Z. The first argument is situated in a neighborhood of some of the special points of this. Special points of this one of the Qi's. In a neighborhood of Qi, X is locally represented as a degree two rimified covering, because Qi is a critical point, simple critical points of X. And this degree two covering has a deck transformation, so sigma of X is just second sheet of the passing to the second sheet of the. Passing to the second sheet of this degree two rimified covering. So this sigma is holomorphic involution which is defined locally in the neighborhood of the point Q and it does not extend globally. And so we have this explicit expression, quite not so simple, this combat expression which involves Expression which involves the differentials that we have already computed in the previous steps of the computation. So we have numerator, we have also denominator. You see, because of this denominator, the order of pole becomes higher. So this object is a meromorphic differential, which is defined in a neighborhood of the point Q only. And then we take this expression and then we just pick the polar part of this expression. We take the polar part and we ignore the holomorphic part. And then we try to glue these polar parts, the polar parts of these principal parts of the poles of this W to glue a globally global home. A globally global holomorphic form. So the actual differential WGN is defined as a differential which has the same principal part of the poles at the specified points and which extends globally as a global differential without other singularities. So this is differential in the case, for instance. Differential in the case, for instance, of a rational spectral curve is defined uniquely. And it is given by, if you wish, you can write an explicit residual expression. But essentially, this operator is sometimes called projection operator. This is what he does. He glues principal, prescribed collection of principal parts of the poles given by this closed. given by this closed expression to a globally defined Meromorphic differential. So from this expression of W tilde, what we actually need is only the polar part of this expression. So this is how the recursion works. It's really amazing that we are actually interested in the expansion We are interested in the expansion, in the Taylor coefficients of the expansion of this differential as origin. But the actual recursion involves the analytic expansion of these differentials to the whole spectral curve and the analysis of its poles beyond the convergence radius, at the poles of its analytic extension to the global spectral curve. So the rationality is a crucial. So the rationality is a crucial point of topological recursion. Without rationality, it even does not make sense. Yeah? So this looks terribly mysterious. And so I understand what you have on this first step. The formula to the right is just the generation of human cells. Yes, there is some pneumonia. Yes, there is some mnemonic rules there, yeah. But there should be some picture in mind. Yeah. So do you what do you show about this? This comes from particular problems. It depends on the enumerative problems you're using. So some uh usually it it does have a meaning, but but for a moment you can understand it just mnemonically. But you're right. So you're right. And in many cases, this corresponds. Cases, this corresponds to this summance corresponds to generations of points with mark points. So the components of boundary divisor in the corresponding boundary space. Yeah, but if the numerator is not mysterious for you, then you're lucky because even the fact that the numerator is of this form is also mysterious. So you are right that the fact that such a such a form of recursion Such a form of recursion governs dozens and dozens of particular enumerative problems, it's really looks like a miracle. And this miracle, one of the goals of my talk is some kinds to recover a little bit this miracle. But it's still a miracle. Yes, absolutely. And the community of topological recusion is trying to answer your answer for 20 years, but still the answer is unclear. Why such a procedure with exactly this form works in all particular cases? So I will try to explain wa uh to give one of the possible explanations. Possible explanation. So actually what happens that I mentioned a huge number a huge number of particular problems, but it happens that each time the proof that they govern by this polar And the proof are the proof are usually independent. For each new case, you have a new method to prove it. So it's really, really, there is no uniform understanding how it works. Because you turn one out of the setup to engage everything that's left over, right? You can say one gets stuck to something, and then you split it into. Recording stopped. Actually, you are right. So if you meet for the first time, if you meet for the first time the topological recursion, probably you will be more. Probably you will be more interested in these numerous applications because not all of them are volumes in all those bases. And there are even those cases which I have not written here: free probability, no theory, and many, many other situations. We will pick you duality and many, many other cases. So, actually, if you really meet for the first time, you probably would be interested in considering these examples and to see how, in different situations, the same kind Situations, the same kind of recursion appears. It's really a miracle. No, it's really indeed that for each particular cases, the proof is you should invent new tools to prove topological recursion for each of these two cases. It's really amazing. Yeah, but I will not discuss I will not discuss uh these applications, but I will I will be most concerned with the abstract uh topological recursion theory. Actually, what I would like also to mention that if you look at the actual definition of the topological recursion, that the expansion point and the local coordinate of expansion is not a Coordinate of expansion is not a part of the initial data. So the topological recursion produces these differentials, but in order to extract enumerative data, you also should add an expansion point, and the local coordinator is the expansion point. And this is a somehow an extra data with respect to topological recursion. Is like here you had between two points. You have 701 and 702. So initially the point is that one and two points. What about the three things that it puts in the search for the other one? Which one? If you had the W splits. It's already uh what? Well, it's already uh stable. Well we can have a drop log where you can say W split zero is current. Well, this is just how the things work again. So, this kind of question, this is what people are trying to understand for 20 years. And every time on every on every talk on topological recursions, there are questions of this sort. And the people cannot give a And the people cannot give a satisfactory answer. That's true. Okay. So I will be concerned with the topological recursion itself, an abstract topological recursion. And I would like to study the equation. What happens if the non-drudency condition fails? For instance, if assume that all. For instance, if assume that all critical points of X glue together, and X is given by just a monomial with all critical points glued together, and Y also degenerate at the critical point of X. And how the topological recursion could be defined in this case. And the specialist in topological recursion would have. Have probably wished to remind me about the existence of Bouchari in our recursion. Yeah? But actually, Boucharinar recursion is intended for this situation, but it has actually very restrictive application. So this is given by more complicated expression, but it works only for some specific value of R and S. Value of R and S. For instance, it doesn't completely work if both R and S are positive. And if, say, R is positive and S is negative, then the corresponding exponent should satisfy this divisibility condition. Otherwise, the corresponding recursion is not well defined. Instead, we would like to propose another. Propose another approach, what we call generalized topological recursion, and our version of the generate topological recursion works for any degeneracy of X and Y. This is what I said at the beginning: Sasha Alexandrov, Borybochkov, Duny Barkovsky, Peter, me, and Serge Andrian. So uh what kind of definition we ex what we what what we would like to expect from the definition of the topological recursion is that the wish that it should behave well if the initial data degenerate in the family, if several critical points of X glue together. Glued together, the good definition should be compatible with the limit. So let me discuss to see a problem, what is the problem, let me consider just an example. So I would like to suggest a challenge. I will write a family of topological recursion data, of spectral curve data, and you try to guess from And you try to guess from your experience what happens with the family when the parameter goes to the limit. So, the first example, we consider this equation. So, x is the squared and y is the same. So, we see here that x has a non-degenerate critical point, but y is degenerate at the origin. It's also a critical point of y. But for change. For chef of an Runtend record, dy should be non-zero, but here the critical points coincide. So, how to deform this? One of the natural possibilities is just to shift the argument of one of the functions, right? So, we just move apart the two critical points. Now, y still has a critical point at the point. Critical point at the origin, and X has a single critical point nearby. So now Y is non-degenerate, dy is non-zero at the critical point of X. And we can define, we can consider the standard check in our runtime recursion with one with a single critical point, with a single pool, and to see what happens when See what happens when the paramet goes to zero. Right? We can even modify it slightly. Instead of adding epsilon Z, we can add epsilon logarithm of Z. The logarithm is not meromorphic, but as I told that we mostly interested not in the not in the function x, but in its differential. X, but in its differential. So its differential is given by this one. So now we see two critical points of X, two zeros of the X gluing together. So we have a usual check of a Darren Ten record with two critical points gluing together in the limit. And we can continue. We can add a monomer. Add a monomial 1 over z with small, with small coefficients, then we have three critical points gluing together, and so on. So this here we have k critical points, k zeros of dx. dy is non-zero at the critical point, so the Chechen runtime recursion is well defined for this family. Recursion is well defined for this family and I wonder what I'm wondering what happens with the family as epsilon goes to zero. And the second example is probably more familiar for specialists in topological recursion. So here x is z to the power of 5, so we have four critical points of multiplicity 4. So we have four critical points glued together. Critical points glued together. And Z has a, and Y has a pole of order 3 at the origin. And we move a little bit X, so it becomes all these four critical points are a distinct positions. And we have several options for Y. Through y. So consider three examples. The first one, we don't touch y, so y is undeformed. So this is just the initial function y with a pole of order 3 at the origin. And the second example, we split this order 3 pole into three simple poles. So these poles of y are not critical point of x, so so that Critical point of X, so the topological recursion, the check of an R110 recursion, is well defined, is non-degenerate. And the last example, we also do almost the same, but we have considered deformation of special kind. As written here, we have a pole of order four simple poles and a simple zero at the origin. Still, at the critical points of x, the function y is not. Points of x, the function of y is non-degenerate, so it's the recursion is well defined. Yeah? What? There is a. No, there is two different points of view. One of the points of view is say that the spherical curves Say that the spectral curves lives in C2, it's given by some algebraic between X and Y. So instead, I consider the spectral curves as an abstract CP1 with a fine coordinate Z. And X and Y are just two meromorphic functions on the spectral curve. Yeah, it's it's totally fine. I just want to read it. So for me, the spectral curve is just a projective plane with a global affine coordinate. However, when you have these two functions, it resembles me integral system of which you have that link when you have a problem. This is among all those applications, yes, right? But the term spectral curve also comes from computer operators. This is what I'm not going to discuss. This is a part of applications of special examples of topological questions that I'm not going to discuss. So this is this is I'm very sorry that but this is a this is very interesting and deep question. There are many many applications. There are dozens of papers where the topological recursion appears and this is one of the possible situations. So this is what I'm not going This is what I'm not going to discuss. Yeah. So now I address, however, to those who consider themselves a specialist in topological recursions, what do you think, what happens with these families? So let me copy for the future reference x is equal to x is equal to z squared plus epsilon divided by z to the power of k plus minus two and y is equal to z squared and the second is x is equal to g to the power of 5 plus epsilon z and y is equal to y is equal to y is equal to 1 over z cube, b y is equal to z cube plus epsilon and cy is equal to z divided by z four plus epsilon. Just to put a question on it. Blow up? You mean that the spectral curve is modified to sigma y? For for which? For which case? Okay. Okay. So actually you your answer is your guess is partially correct. So it happens that so if k is if k is 1, 2, or 3, then there is no limit, you write. So the corresponding differentials have a pole Differentials have a pole with respect to epsilon. Epsilon goes to zero, it doesn't have a limit. And the same is here. Yeah, but surprisingly, if k is starting for 4, then we have a quite definite limit. And also for this case, we have a quite definite limit. And moreover, in the first example, this limit doesn't depend. First example, this limit doesn't depend on k and it is governed by what we what we are going to define, the generalized topological recursion. It's amazing. And this is surprising that the limit is also does exist. But it is different. The limit is different. So the limit does depend on the on the deformation. The deformation. And let us govern by the Boucher-Renaire recursion. And moreover, for both cases, for these green and blue cases, we have an explicit formula for the corresponding differentials. I will show this formula. So it it it proves out that the these recursions admit a quite closed expression, that you do not need to apply it step by step, but you can apply a closed formula. The formula looks like that it looks complicated, but I assure you that they will be much more worse formulas. So the formula should be So, the formula should be read from right to left. So, on the first step, we consider an expression which is n-differential which involves some additional parameters, v1, vn. And then at the last step, we turn the dependence of these monomials into partial d into partial derivatives with respect to x-coordinates. X coordinates. So it proves out that if you consider a term of particular genome, that the dependence of V variables is polynomial. So we just consider and replace every appearance of monomial in V variables by the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to X. So how this fat W check is defined? So on the right, actually our Actually, our original expression was slightly more complicated, but after a hint of Alexander Hock, we can write it in the following form. So, here we consider a kind of determinant of a matrix with components which are denoted Z hat I plus and Z hat J minus. So, Z hat is some deformation of the function. Some deformation of the function z, which is given as a series, z plus a series involving derivatives of y involving derivatives of y of different order and also v. And when I put index i, it means that I put z i instead of z and v i instead of v and also with different signs. So this is a matrix and this is a determinant. If you The determinant. If you remember how to compute the determinant, you sum up over all possible permutations the product of diagonal corresponding diagonal elements. So here we consider what's called connected determinants. So we use not all the permutations, but only only those permutations in sigm in sigma n which which um which are long cycles. Which are long cycles. Every long cycles uh so long cycle has a uh how it's called uh the the sign of a permutation. The sign of every long cycle equal to n minus one. So I put the common factor, the sign of permutation in front of the summation. So this is what we have here. And also we multiply by additional factor, which also some series in h bar whose coefficient In H bar, whose coefficients are polynomial combinations of x prime, y prime, and also depend on additional v variables. So the formula looks complicated, but actually it could be implemented on computer, and I made a lot of experiments with this formula. So this formula provides explicitly the Explicitly the answer for the result of topological recursion for check of NR10 recursion of epsilon is normally equal to zero, but the formula extends to epsilon to the degenerate case, and this is it gives the answer which we call the generalized topological recursion. And by the way, in the last case of Boucher-Renard recursion for this for this. For this family, there is a similar closed expression in terms of determinant, connected determinant. It has the same structure, but slightly more complicated. Probably, if I will have time, I probably tomorrow will present such a formula. Okay, so now probably probably I I tried to I hope that I assured you that there is a sense to consider the general topological recursion and so give me let me now give definition what we do mean by the uh generalized topological recursion uh and again I will start with overview. With overview. So let me compare once again what we have in the original check of inarantine recursion. We have an explicit formula for the preliminary version of the differential, and then we apply the projection operator. So what we have for the generalized topological recursion, we have the same structure, but with a different formula for the initial differential. The initial differential. Let me for a moment give just the simplest example of 0,3 correlator. So this is what people in topological recursion know very well, how to compute the 0,3 correlator. This is uh an expression for 0,3 correlator. It involves uh zero two correlators which are Berman kernels and Berman kernels and numerator, denominator, and so on. And sigma is a homomorphic involution, the vector formation near the critical points of X. But now let me show our replacement for this formula. It's as simple as that. So it happens that in the case of Cheha-Fernard-Rantan recursion, both formulas give the same. Formulas give the same answer. I don't know whether it was mentioned somewhere in the papers of Bouchard or somewhere else. This observation. Residue so you have three of them box B. So take a BZZ1, take a residue with ZX and Z1. Yes, yes, this is uh then I take this expression and then I apply the projection. This is omega tilde. So then this is it. Okay, okay. So so it looks simpler, but this um simplicity is uh apparent for bigger G. Is apparent for bigger G and N, the simplicity of formula of this formula grows very rapidly, much much faster than that one for the original Bucharen relation. But what is nice here is that it does not involve the topology of the ramification of x. There is no sigma here. So the first expression is defined only in a neighborhood of the simple critical point of x. Of x. So in the case of, say, Bouchard-Inar recursion, the expression is even worse. But this formula could be applied in any case, even if even independently of whether X has a pole or the critical point or the given point. So independently it could be applied in any situation. Situation. So we just take the second expression as a definition of our recursion. So in the for bigger G and N, our expression is similar. So the omega tilde extends globally. Yes, omega tilde extends globally and well defined on the whole spectral curve. So let me So let me uh now explain what uh what do we have, so overview. So consider some point of the spectral curve and locally x and y behave like monomials of degree r and s, where r and s could be both positive or negative. And also I would like to include the case when r and s are equal to zero, when the corresponding functions attain logarithmic singularities. Functions attain logarithmic singularity, so probably I switch to differentials. Now for R on S equal to zero, we have a pole of order one with non-trivial residue, and X and Y contain logarithmic singularities. And these two exponents could be assigned to any point of the spectral curve, and we say that the point is special if the sum of the two exponents R plus S S should be here. R plus S is positive. should be here. R plus S is positive, except that they do not equal to 1, 1. And otherwise, if the sum is negative for 1, 1, then it is non-special. So then special points are candidates for the poles of the differentials of topological recursion. This 1,1 corresponds to what we have at the generic. To what we have at a generic point. So, at generic point, we have dx non-zero, dy is holomorphic non-zero, and this corresponds to exponents 1, 1. So, at special points, so if for instance, both R and S are positive, we have critical points of X and Y, then this is a special point. If both are poles, then this is not a special point. The corresponding differentials will be holomorphic at these points. If one of them is possible, If one of them is possible, is positive, another is negative, then the order of pole is bigger than the order of critical point of another function that is non-special and otherwise is special. And these are candidates for the singularities. S. It should be S here, yeah. So we consider the whole set of special points and split into there is a finite number of special points because generic point is non-special by definition. There are finite number of special points, and we split it into subgroups, just in volume. Just in a voluntaryist way, just arbitrary way, split into subgroups. One of them is called special points and case special points, and another one, K-dual special points. They are called K-dual special points, or non-K-special points. And now the initial data of topological recursion is just this one: the spectral curve, the The spectral curve, the Berban kernel, is just the same as before. dx and dy are just two orbitary Meromorphic differentials. Now we impose no condition on the behavior of poles and zeros. And we just fix some subset of the set of special points, which are called case special points. And the differentials, as before, the initial As before, the initial differentials are given as before, and then there will be an explicit formula for the recursion step. And again, it's given by the same procedure. First of all, we write an explicit formula that I will present later. And then apply the projection operator which produces omega gm. And it will be global meromorphic, symmetric. Global meromorphic, symmetric, and the projection operator applied only to specified collection of special points. So this differential will have singularities only at the special points. And yeah, this is how recursion works. And uh before the break, let me formulate the the theorem. Let me formulate the theorem that the definition that I have not finished yet because I have not explained the formula. But actually, in the case of standard non-degenerate critical point, we have just the same as the standard recursion. Then Paul noticed that the same formula of Checho-Fernar Ranten. Of Cheho-Werner-Rantan recursion works if Y has a pole of first order. And this is what is called sometimes a regular recursion. And so, in the case of a regular critical points of X, the formula provides the same. And also our formula is compatible with the Boucher-Renard recursion if if Y is either holomorphic is and non-zero or h has a And non-zero, or h has a first-order pole. And also, recently, we observed in the relationship with x-y duality that it makes sense in certain cases to include to topological recursion logarithmic singularities of the y function and what we called log TR, logarithmic topological recursion. And also, it happens that these are. These are just special cases of our generalized topological recursion. The only case where the two recursions give the answer is the case of Bush-Reiner recursion. It's in some certain cases when it works, when Y has a more complicated behavior. So this is This is our version of recursion. So I still discuss the definition. I will discuss the definition of our generalized topological recursion and also some other nice properties.
