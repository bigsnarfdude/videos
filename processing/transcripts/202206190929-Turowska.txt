We'll start your talk with Milla in about two minutes. So we'll just hold it over. I have Matthew Doss, Junhe, Matthew Doss, put in the chat the link. All right, he acknowledges well, it really imagines us. Well, admille, you can imagine I'm very much looking forward to this talk. I'm sorry to interrupt, but do we have time to take the virtual photo by any chance? How many people are on? How many people are on there, Carlos? Carlos? Oh, hello. How many people are on the Zoom right now? There's quite a few. It's a beautiful group. I think if everyone just can do it, this might be the right tosh. Can I ask everybody on Zoom to open their camera, please? And Ludmilla, can I ask you to, for the moment, stop the screen sharing? Yeah, yes, yes. Yeah, yes, yes. All right, so everybody in Zoom land, make yourself visible to Carlos. He's going to take a virtual photo for the benefit of the camera. Amy Vasalter is unavailable. He apologizes. Perfect. So I'm going to do a countdown. Get ready, people. In three, two, one. Excellent. Take one. Take one more, real quick. Sorry about that, just to make sure that I don't have someone looking left. And again, in three, two, one. Beautiful. I have no idea where I'm looking right now. Thank you, Carlos. Thank you, Danly. With no, I guess you might turn to the screen. Thank you. All right, I think time is now progressing. We're still recording, Volker. You turned it back on. I turned it off and you turned it on. Oh, it's on. We're recording. Okay, just spinning. All right. Pardon the interruption. So without further ado, I'm also extremely pleased to introduce another of my best mathematical friends. In fact, one of my earliest collaborators has been Mila Tolowska from the Chalmers University of Technology at the University of Yeotoboy. She's going to tell us about. She's going to tell us about Berlin-Foyer algebras and complexification. Please, Nicole. Thank you very much, Nicar. Thank you, the organizers, for giving me the opportunity to talk and happy retirement for Tony. Yeah, so I will talk about Berlin-free algebra and complexification. And this is a joint work with my former PhD student, Olaf Yiserson. Yeah, so I will start with complexification of abelian groups. Of abelian groups. So I have a G, this is a abelian locally compact group. And G hat, this is my set of continuous homomorphism from G to the torus. So we know by the pentragon duality, if we take the continuous homomorphism on G hat on the dual to T, so we'll get our group G itself. And so to define abelian complexification, so Define abelian complexification. So I take now the set of continuous homomorphism not to the torus, but I will take homomorphism from g hat to the complex, non-zero complex numbers, to the group of non-zero complex numbers. And so the result I will get, for example, if I take the group R, so the complexification, I call it abelian complexification, this A is abelian. This a is of a billion, so I will get the complex, the group of complex numbers. If I take the complexification of the torus, so I will get the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers. If I take the integers, so discrete groups, I will get Z itself. And next is compact groups and the contextification of the compact groups. So it was introduced. Compact groups. So it was introduced by McCannon and then started later, but by Ketwright and McMullen. So and it goes in this way. So they introduce such abstract complexification of the group, compact group. So we have G now, this is the compact group. I will have the notation lambda x for the left regular representation of my group G, and I write Vn of G. And I write Vn of G for the phoneme algebra. So, G hat, so this is the unitary dual G, and we treat as a set of unitary irreducible representations, which are finite dimensional. And the left regular representation, so it's quasi equivalent to the sum of these irreducible representations pi. And Vn of G is an L-infinity sum of matrix algebra or linear algebra. Matrix algebra or linear operator in HP. So then it will be important the algebra of trigonometric polynomials on G. So this is just the span of matrix coefficients of elements in G hat. And I consider the Fourier transform of these elements. So these are coefficients which take values in matrices or linear operators on a representation A. On a representation hp. Then the linear dual of these trigonometric polynomials having this identification between trig G and the Fourier coefficients, so they can be identified with the product of this matrix algebra, or LHP, and the duality is given by this formula. So I just note so that this product of This product of a matrix algebra. This is a set of affiliated elements with Vn of G. So this will be important later. And yeah, so definition by McKennon. So it's the following. So a complexification of GC, GC of a compact group. So this is the set of characters of the trig G. So if we identify our characters, Characters or our dual with this product of LHP. So we have T in this product, which satisfy this condition of being a character. So if M, this is the usual multiplication of trig G, so just a usual multiplication of function, and if I denote, I denote by M dash, so this is the dual of M, so I will have that T is in the complex. That t is in the complexification if m dash of t is equal to t tensor d. And then we also will identify g with the image in the left regular representation, lambda g, and this is the coefficients. So we have the following theorem by that G C, so this will be a group, then intersection with the phonemen algebra of G. The phonemen algebra of G, so gives us the image of the group G, lambda G, which we identify with G. And then we also have that whenever we have T is in the complexification and then consider the polar decomposition, so the absolute value of T, so it will be also in the complexification and the unitary part of this polar in polar decomposition of this T, so it's necessarily an element. Necessarily an element of g which we identify with lambda g. So we have the following Cartan decomposition so that complexification GC, so it can be written as or each element in GC, so it can be written as a product of element in G times positive element in the complexification. Okay, so why this is a complexification? So we can also consider the set Consider the set of derivation, GC. So, all elements in this product, which are given by this formula, so they are derivation. So, meaning that m dash of x is equal to x tensor i identity plus identity tensor x. We can also consider self-skewer joint elements in GC. So then we will have the So then we will have that GC is a Lie algebra and G is a real Lie subalgebra. And we have the following. So X is in G C if and only if the exponent of Tx is in G in the complexification. And then X in G small, so if and only if the exponential of T of X is in G. So if G is a connected Lie group is the Lie algebra G, then Is the Lie algebra G, then GC is the Lie group with the corresponding Lie algebra G, small GC. And so we have examples, so like if we take SU and C, so that we will get S L and C, T C, so we will get C complex, non-zero complex numbers with respect to multiplication. If G is abelian, so it's easy also to check that this abelian complexification, it will be this McKennon complexification if the group is compact. If the group is compact. Okay, so general, general group. So we take locally compact group and we take lambda the left regular representation. So it will be convenient to use the language of quantum groups and use coproduct and antipod on the N of G. And it will be important that the coproduct is implemented by fundamental unitary. So there exists So there exists a unitary W, which is an element here, so which implements the coproduct. So having this, yeah, so we have the G again we identify with lambda g and this is the set of all elements, non-zero elements in the n of g, which satisfy this condition that gamma of x is equal to x tensor x. Then we could we need Then we go, we need affiliated elements. So I said that these elements in the dual of the trigonometric polynomials, so they were affiliated elements to VN of G. So close, densely defined unbounded operator T on H is affiliated with the von Neumann algebra M if it commutes with any unitary in the commutant or it satisfies this condition. Okay, so if Okay, so if gamma, since gamma x is implemented by this unitary w, so we can extend this gamma to the affiliated element v n of g in this way, just writing this formula and get a map from the affiliated from vn of g to the affiliated to the tensor product. And then we define the abstract complexification. So since we talk about the left regular presentation, Since we talk about the left regular representation, so we put this lambda, is defined as the set of affiliated elements x non-zero, which satisfy this condition gamma x is equal to x tensor x. So if g is compact, then it coincides with McCannon cartride and MacMullen abstract complexification of G C. Okay, so this is the complexification. So all affiliated elements and non-zero such Non-zero such which satisfy this condition. Yeah, so we can also define these derivations and define this set. And as in a compact set, so we have the similar relations. So for example, that complexification, so it's we have this Cartu composition. So any element in the complexification can be written as a product lambda s of s in G. And then have s in g and then exponent of i alpha where alpha is in this set lambda is the set of derivation and if g is a connected lie group with lie algebra g so we have this concrete concrete presentation here so this is an infinitesimal representation of the lie group okay so now what yeah so i talk about free algebra so and weighted free algebra so and i Weighted Fourier algebra, so and I want to make a connection with the complexification. So, first, Fourier algebra A of G, so we know that it can be written as a pre-dual of Vn of G, this is the multiplication given in this way. Or there exists a concrete realization as functions, and this is a convolution of f and g check, so the function in L2 of G. So we know that A of G is a Banach Algebra brass with respect to this norm. So the duality with Ug is given by this formula. So in particular, if I take T is equal to lambda x, so this variance gives me just the valuation of u of x. And we know the MR's results, so saying that the Gilfan spectrum of A of G, so it's homeomorphic to the group. Homeomorphic to the group G and the homeomorphism is given in this way. So lambda x maps to x. Okay, so x in the and so x is a character or x is in the spectrum. So it's an element, not zero element, which satisfy this condition. So we have that the elements, characters of A of G, so they come from bounded operators in V and of G, which satisfies n of g which satisfies this this condition okay so yeah so maybe i just say that free algebra of a of g when g is abelian so this is the just the fourier transform of l1 of g hat if g is compact so we have that trig g sits in a of g as a dense subalgebra and a of g also can be presented as a as a free transform of As a Fourier transform of L1 G hat, but now it will be a matrix valued L1 G hat taking values in matrices. Okay, yeah, so now what I want, I want to put a weight on my Fourier algebra. So what is weight? So a scalar weight function on G. So this is just the function from G to R plus. It satisfies this inequality. It satisfies this inequality so that WST less or equal WSWT. Okay, so if I will also assume that my W is bounded below, so I can write this omega, so inverse, so it will be an element in L infinity of G. Then this condition, so I can rewrite in terms of coproduct as omega tensor omega less or equal than gamma of omega. And yes, so these are exactly. And yes, so these are examples of weights on abelian R and Z. Okay, so if I have a weight, so I can define L1 G hat with respect to this weight, and this will be a Banach algebra with respect to convolution and weighted norm. And then what I do, I define A G W. So I take the Fourier transform of this L1G hat W. Or it's the same that I take. W. Or it's the same that I take the Fourier transform of L1 G hat multiplied with this omega, which is the inverse of W. Okay, so in case of compact groups, so I can define a weight function in the following ways. So I consider the dual G hat and consider W from G hat to R plus, which satisfy this condition instead. So here I have element. So here I have elements in G hat. So these are elements in unitary irreducible representations. So I have that w sigma, it should be less or equal w pi w rho, where sigma is a sub-representation of pw tensor rho. And then defining omega in this way, so this will be in V n of G. So we have L infinity, V n of G is L infinity of matrix. energy is L infinity of matrix matrix algebras. So I will get that omega tensor omega, so it will also be less or equal than gamma of omega. Okay, so this will be rate, scalar rate, and then also AG omega I will define in a similar way. So I can write in this way or I define it as a image. It's as an image on the acting omega onto A of G. So it will be all function from G to C so that Fourier coefficients satisfy this inequality. Here we put this weight W P inside. Okay, so general, so I don't need my weight to be positive. So in principle, I can define weight inverse on the Define weight inverse on the dual of g as omega on the n of g, which satisfy this condition. So omega omega star tensor omega omega star is less or equal than this one. And then I also want it to be injective so that omega and omega star has cannot equal to zero. And this condition is equivalent to having that there exists a unique omega big omega in dn of g times g such that we have the following connection. We have the following connection. And then I define Ag, weighted Ag omega as the product of this omega acting on A of G. So it will be a subalgebra of A of G and it will be closed, it will be subalgebra with respect to the usual multiplication, so with some simple calculation here, so and it will be also Banach algebra. It will be also a Banach algebra if I introduce this norm, and the dual of this it will be VN of G. And I call this a Berlin-free algebra. And we want to know the spectrum of this Ag omega. And yeah, there is a relation to the complexification of this spectrum. Okay, so this Berlin-free algebra were introduced simultaneously by Han He. By Han Hi and Ibrahim Samaiso, and also me together with Jean-Ludwig and Nico. Yeah, so spectrum, so how we can define the spectrum. So if G is a compact group, then we have the trigonometric polynomials, so they are sitting in A G omega, the dense subalgebra. And yes, so if sigma is in the spectrum, so which is an element in the V. So, which is an element in the VNL G, then it should satisfy this condition. So, and when we write it down, so it means that if I take this sigma omega inverse, so this will be element in the product of this matrix algebra, so it should be in the complexification of G C. So then identifying Vn of G with this set, so we will write that spectrum is in the complexification. Okay, so. Okay, so yeah, so the spectrum of weighted Berlin-Fourier algebra can be larger than the group itself, even in commutative case. So if I take the following weight inverse, so we will get the spectrum, it will be some analysis around the unit circle. If we take some polynomial weight, so then the spectrum it will remains the It will remain the T here. But it can be larger, so it can be really in the complexification. So spectrum in general, so yeah, so we have omega in the n of g, so weight inverse, and let this big omega, so be such elements which satisfy this condition. So we have always this. Then this omega. Then this omega, this would be not an arbitrary element, it will be a cost cycle, so it satisfies this condition. And if it identifies spectrum, these elements in Vn of G, so then one can show that the spectrum, so it's all elements in Vn of G, which satisfy this condition, the same condition that weight inverse satisfies. So gamma of sigma omega is equal to sigma tensor sigma. And this is some. And this is some sorry, yeah, some simple calculation. I'm not quite sure. So, what we want, we want to find the solution of this equation. So, what would be the solution of that? Yes, so in compact case, we seen that if we take element in the spectrum sigma and multiply with omega inverse, so then it was in the complexification. So, our guess also that. So, our guess also is that sigma should be like t sigma omega, where t sigma is some element in the complexification. And some formal calculation, it supports that this should be the case. Okay, so but here, so what is important is we work with unbounded operators, so we must have. Unbounded operator, so we must have make some meaning of this gamma of t sigma. So, and we can have it have it meaning if we know that this is an affiliated element to the von Neumann algebra and principle. So, what we have to know is that it is a closable operator. So, we have to know that this operator T sigma, which sends omega psi to sigma xi, is a closable operator. Then we can show that the closure, it will be necessary element. It will be a necessary element in this complexification. And then verification of when it's closable, it boils down to some other interesting identity, so which should hold for elements in the spectrum. So that this expression, S sigma, S is the antipode times sigma, so it should be unchanged and should be equal to the same expression when we take instead of sigma this weight inverse. Instead of sigma, this weight inverse omega. Yeah, and some formal calculation shows that it should be the case. So the aim was to prove this equality for any element sigma in the spectrum of H G omega. So now I show some calculus, some list. I'm not going to go through this, but yeah, so if we consider the fundamental unit. Consider the fundamental unitary and define some element in this way, then we make some major calculation with the antipodes and the fundamental unitary. So we come to the sum equality one tensor sigma m omega is equal to that one. And if sigma is injective, so we can so like omega, so we can write. Omega, so we can write that m omega is equal to s omega omega, and then from that we will get this equality which we need. But our problem so that this calculation only formal because s is not completely bounded in general. So we cannot write this, there is no meaning of that unless s is completely bounded. So, yeah, so one has to do more careful calculation. And when we try to do this more careful calculation, To do this more careful calculation, we got we have some technical problems, but we could avoid some of this. Uh, yeah, we could solve this problem only in special cases. So, first, G is virtual abelian when we have that S is completely bounded. This is due to a result by Brian and Wolcker. And we could do things when we have G is an in-group, so and some extra condition. We have We have G when G is a syn group, and we don't need this condition, it will automatically hold, and some other conditions, so on weight. So, in these cases, we will have the spectrum, it will be in the complexification. And this is for any omega, for any weight omega. We can do better if we know some more information about the weight. So, the typical weights we know, so lot example, we know, so we. Or lot example, we know when the group is abelian or the group is compact, we have some number of weights. So, those weights we can lift to the group G, if say H is a close subgroup of G, so we can, and WH is a weight inverse on the dual, so we can lift it to the weight on the n of G. And when we have such a weight and H say abelian or compact subgroup. Say abelian or compact subgroup, then we can prove that the spectrum will be in the complexification. So, whenever the weight inverse comes from a weight inverse of abelian or compact subgroup, so we can prove that the spectrum is in G C lambda. And yeah, we can even say more. So, in case we know that the spectrum in the complexification of A H omega H, H is a subgroup. omega h h is a subgroup omega h is a weight inverse there and the spectrum is in the complexification of a g omega g in the complexification of gc so for example yeah due to previous theorem h is abelian on compact then we can okay then we can say that the spectrum so we can even identify the spectrum so it will be lambda g of s and then Lambda G of S, and then this part, which is from positive part, so it comes from the spectrum of H omega H, and we lift it to the group to Vn of G by this mapping I from Vn of H to Vn of G. In particular, so if we have a connected Lie group and H is a closed connected subgroup of G, so we have that the spectrum of A G omega G, it will be given in this way. It will be given in this way. So it comes, X is necessarily coming from the sub-algebra H corresponding to the group H. And yes, and this element should come also from the spectrum. So we can completely describe this spectrum if we know the spectrum of this AH omega H. Okay, and this is the result of. Okay, and this result was proved in our joint work with Maya, Janhe, Jean-Loderic, and Nico for special groups like Heisenberg, reduced Heisenberg, Euclidean motion. And yes, but our method and our theorem, so it can do more than that. And it much simplified our proofs in this work. And because there, so it was quite So, it was quite substantial. Representation theory and existence of indirectors were involved. And yeah, so we don't use any of those to prove our theorem here. Okay, so I think I stop here. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so amongst the audience, have we any questions for Nigela? Hello, Elcham. Hello, Elchem's children. I have a question. So, you know, I trust you're keenly aware there's definitely some sort of dark waters here. Like if we take things like AX plus B group, do you have a sense as to whether there's some sort of core that allows this complexification to have a multiplication? No. No, I yes, we have here, so we don't have any good domain over all these operators are defined. So that there is, I don't know how we can multiply. So I don't know the group structure. Yeah, so it's an interesting question for which group we have that this complexification is a group. So we have for new potent, I think this should be okay. So we have these entire vectors and we can. We can likely do things there so we can multiply the operators that make some sense of the group operation there. But in general, I don't know. Yeah, it's a really curious thing, but it's still beautiful paper. Also, I guess people in Zoom land, other than Elchin's children, we have questions for Nymila. I think they have questions, but maybe we should let it go for now. Sadly, foolish people like me still have to visit the checkout office. Lydmilla, I really thank you for your talk and your participation. Let us thank you again. Thank you. Okay, everybody, we are going to have our next lecture in half an hour with Money Time. Hour with Mani Taniravin and
