Okay, so first thanks to those who come back today to listen to the talk. Yeah, so as in the first few lectures, then we have been looking at the definition of SLE via Leubner chains. And today we will be looking at another construction of SLE, which gives a very different perspective on SLE. And this imaginary geometry perspective on SLE has turned geometry perspective on SLE has turned out to be very powerful and it allows us to prove many properties of OSLE that are not accessible with the more classical Lord Newtchain methods. I can also mention that many of the figures you will see in the presentation today will be from papers of Jason Miller and Scott Sheffield. So one particular strength of the imaginary geometry point of view on SLE is that it allows to construct natural couplings of multiple SLE curves. Of multiple SLE curves. So the figure is showing one example. If you look at the middle curve in light blue, then that's an SLE with kappa equal to one-half, while the other curves are also SLE one-half type curves, but there are some variants of SLE which are known as SLE-kappa row curves, and which I will be coming back to a little bit later. So the idea of imaginary geometry is to construct SOE as the flow line of a certain field. The flow line of a certain field. And we will first be looking at the case where this field is smooth. So we assume that the h is some smooth function, for example the modulus of z squared. And then you can see the small arrows in the left figure, they are pointing in the direction of e to the power i times h. And then the flow line of this field, e to the power i times h, that's given by the solution of the differential phase. the solution of the differential equation that is which saying that the derivative of eta is given by e to the power ih. So in particular you can see as the figure that if you look at any point on this flow line then these small arrows are tangent to the flow line everywhere. In the right figure you can see flow lines of e to the power i times h plus theta where theta is taking 12 different values. 12 different values between 0 and 2π. So you see that if you add some small angle theta to h, then all the small arrows will be slightly rotated, which is one way to explain why the various flow lines are rotated versions of each other. So as I mentioned, the idea of imaginary geometry is to construct SLE as such flows. construct SLE as such a flow line. So now we assume that H is the random field known as the Gaussian free field, which I will be introducing a little bit later. And then we look at the solution of the shown differential equation. And I'm claiming that the solution eta of this differential equation, it has the law of an SLE with parameter kappa, where kappa where kappa and this parameter chi are related as shown on the slide. So this definition or this definition of the flow line eta doesn't make rigorous sense and the reason it doesn't make rigorous sense is because the field age is not a smooth function. It's not even defined as a function but it is rather a generalized function or distribution. So it means that it's not possible to evaluate So it means that it's not possible to evaluate the value of the Gaussian free field at any individual point, but it is possible to, for example, integrate it against some smooth test function, take the average in some open set, and so on. As I can also mention that couplings of the Gaussian free field and SLE, as we consider here, so they were first introduced by Julian Dubada, and then the theory was further developed by Jason. Was further developed by Jason Miller and Scott Sheffield. So, next, I will give a brief introduction to the Gaussian free field, and we'd start by the discrete Gaussian free field. We consider some rescaled version of Z2 restricted to the unit square, and then we assume that we have some function f defined on the vertices of this lattice. So then the Hamiltonian of F is defined by considering the sum of the squared differences. Considering the sum of the squared differences of adjacent function values. And it's possible to see that this Hamiltonian, if we fix the bandwidth of f, then Hamiltonian is minimized if f is discrete harmonic. The discrete Gaussian free field is defined to be a random function on this lattice such that the probability density relative to the product of the Beg measure is given by e to the power minus h. minus h. So in other words the Gaussian free field is a random function where we favor functions where adjacent function values are not too different. We also assume that the boundary data of the discrete Gaussian free field are fixed. It's possible to prove by using this definition that if we look at the value of the discrete Gaussian free field at any fixed point z, then the Gaussian free field Then the Gaussian free field will have the law of a normal random variable and a normal random variable which has expected value given by the discrete harmonic extension of the bander data and the variance which is of order log n. And there is also a logarithmic covariance between the value at different points. So one way to define the continuum Gaussian free field is to say that this is the limit of the discrete Gaussian free field. This is the limit of the discrete Gaussian free field when n goes to infinity. So, going back to the previous slide, it's possible to argue that when n is sent to infinity, then the expected value at any fixed point is converging. The covariance can also be shown to converge, but we see that the variance at any fixed point is blowing up, like log n. And for this reason, we see that the limit of hn, it can't exist in the space of function. In the space of functions. But it is possible to show that the limit of the discrete Gaussian free field can be taken in the space of distributions or generalized functions. So one property of the Gaussian free field is that it is conformally invariant. So a Gaussian free field composed with some conformal map phi still has to do with a Gaussian free field. It also satisfies a variant of the domain. Satisfies a variant of the domain marker property. So we assume that U is some open set in our domain. And then if we condition on the GFF in the complement of U, then the law of the GFF restricted to U can be written as the sum of a zero boundary GFF in U and the function, which is the harmonic extension of age from the boundary of U. So in this statement, there are several objects which In this statement there are several objects which it's not obvious how to define. For example it's not obvious how to define the harmonic extension of age from the boundary of u. It's not obvious how to condition on age restricted to the complement of u because u is just an arbitrary set. So for example the complement could be just a curve. But it turns out that it is possible to make sense of all the objects in this statement. So then we saw yesterday that We saw yesterday that the Sram-Lohnrevolution is uniquely characterized by conformal invariance and the domain marker property. And it turns out that the Gaussian free field is satisfying a similar characterization result. So this was recently proved by Berstewck and Powell, together with Bora Bray, who's an organizer of this summer school. And yeah, so as you can see from, so we had seen that both So, we had seen that both the GFF and SLE are uniquely characterized by conformal invariance and the domain marker property. So, therefore, it's maybe not so surprising that these two objects are closely related. Okay, so now we go back to our goal. So, that is to make sense of flow lines of e to the power i times the Gaussian free field. So, one natural approach to this problem is to let H sub epsilon be some regularized version of the Gaussian free field, then to solve our differential equation with H replaced by H sub epsilon, and then send epsilon to zero and try to argue that the curve eta is converging. So this approach would probably work in the sense that if we send epsilon to zero, then probably the curve would converge. and then probably the curve would converge and would converge to the curve that we want. But this is actually not the approach that we will be taking. So instead of taking this approach, we ask, inspired by the case where age is smooth, which properties it's natural to require that ADA is satisfying. So two examples of such property are written below. So one example is that is some sort of locality property which is that Property, which is that in order to determine whether eta is contained in some set, it is sufficient to observe age restricted to that set. Another property which it is natural to require is that age and eta are changing in a natural way when we do a change of coordinates. So, that's what I want to describe on the next slide. So, here we assume that age is smooth. We assume that h is smooth and we assume that eta is the flow line of e to the power ih divided by chi. Then we let eta tilde be the image of eta under the inverse of some conformal map phi. And then if we let age tilde and age be related as shown on the slide, then it turns out that eta tilde, it is the flow line of the field associated with age tilde. H tilde. So the proof of this fact is just an application of the chain rule and I will not be showing all the details of this computation. But what you can observe is that on the left side we have the time derivative of eta tilde and on the right side we have e to the power ih tilde divided by chi. So eta tilde is the flow line we want. Okay, so because of the result we have just seen, it is natural to say that the pairs d, h and d tilde, h tilde are equivalent, as where d and d tilde are the domains on which the two fields are defined. And it's natural to say that these are equivalent because these two fields are generating the same flow lines, a modulo coordinate change. And if we want to indicate this This conformal map phi, which is relating the two pairs, then we write phi over this equivalence symbol. So, what you can observe is that this equivalence relation is actually also making sense also when the field age is not smooth. And so, for this reason, it is natural to require that also when age is not smooth, then we require then then we require then if h and h tilde are related by by this equivalent if they are equivalent then the flow lines of the two fields are also the same in the sense that the flow lines of one field is the image of the flow line of the other field under under a conformal map under the conformal map relating the two fields okay so the theorem I will state next that's one of the first first theorems One of the first theorems in the theory of imaginary geometry. So here we are assuming that H is some Gaussian free field. It has banned data plus minus pi over root kappa on the positive and negative real lines. Then the theorem is saying that this Gaussian free field is determining a curve eta, which has the law of an SLE kappa in the upper half plane, such that two properties hold. such that two properties hold. The first property is that eta is locally determined by the Gaussian free field. And the second property is consistent with this coordinate change property that we were looking at on the previous slide. So to be precise, in this third rule point, we are considering some stopping time tau for the SOE. Then we are letting We are letting and then we are conditioning on the initial segment of the curve and we are mapping out using the centered mapping out function g sub tau. And then we are letting age tau be the field in the upper half plane, which is related to the field age in the left part of the figure, such that age and age tau are related by this coordinate change that we were discussing earlier. So, in particular, So in particular, by the property we were discussing earlier, it is natural to require that the flow lines generated by age on the left side, that they get mapped to the flow lines generated by age tau on the right side, if you apply a controllable map. So what we are requiring is that the conditional law of H tau given this initial segment of the SLE is equal to the law of equal to the law of the original field age. So it also has the law of a Gaussian free field and with boundary data plus minus pi over root kappa. And this is natural to require due to the domain marker property of the SLE curve. So the proof of this theorem is quite interesting. So the first step of the proof is to construct the particular coupling of the Gaussian free field and the SLE, which is satisfying some variance. The SLE, which is satisfying some variance of the properties two and three. And then there is a second step, which is that to prove that in this coupling, then age is determining eta. And I will say a few more words about the proof of this theorem a little bit later. But first, okay, yeah, so first I so one natural result to ask based on the previous theorem is what happens when we change the boundary data of the Gaussian free field. Of the Gaussian free field. And it turns out that the situation, when the boundary data are piecewise constant, is also very interesting. So what happens then is that instead of getting SLE curves, then we get the variance of SLE curves known as SLE kappa rho curves. So here rho is a function of, is a vector of real numbers. And there is also a vector. And there is also a vector of points. And these additional points, which we here assume to be on the real line, they either have a repulsive or an attractive force on the curve, depending on whether the associated raw value is positive or negative. So I can mention that these SLE Kappa-Row curves, they can also be defined easily by using Leubner chance. If we use a modified version of the driving function, where there is also Of the driving function, where there is also a drift term that varies in time. Okay, so next I want to show you a few simulations which can be found in the paper of Miller and Sheffield. So here we see flow lines of our field and here the value of capital. and here the value of kappa is very small and when kappa is very small then when kappa goes to zero then chi goes to infinity and for that reason we can see that the flow lines of our field should be approximately deterministic yeah because we consider h divided by chi yeah we did consider h divided by chi in the expression to consider A divided pi in the exponent of the exponential. Okay, so here we are considering the case when kappa is equal to 1 over 16. So yes, as I mentioned introductory, then the middle blue curve is an SLE kappa curve, while the other curves are some of these SLE kappa row curves that I was just introducing on the previous slide. Okay, so this next case is the case when kappa is equal to one-half. So I can mention that both this figure and all the other figures we're looking at, they have been generated by considering flow lines of some smooth approximation to a Gaussian free field. And it is conjectured, but not proved, that when this smooth approximation is getting gradually better, then these colour lines are converging to the actual SLE. To the actual SLE type flow lines. So, next we are considering the case when kappa is equal to 2. So, here we have the case where we're starting flow lines at the two different boundary points. So, what you can see in this setting is that flow lines Is that flow lines which have the same angle but different starting points are merging? For example, you can look at the leftmost red flow lines, you can see that those flow lines are merging together. So can you just say the relation between rho and theta here? So where is rho here on this picture? Rho, um You say theta is between minus pi over two and pi over two? Yeah. I can't. So this corresponds to some rows, some sequence of rows? Yeah, it does correspond to it does correspond to sequence of rows. I can't recall on top of my head what it is. Yeah, there is relationship. So what I can say is that Yeah, so yeah, at least what I didn't say earlier is that the force points are they are maybe yeah, Ewan is in the chat, so maybe he can, yeah, yeah, so I think Ewan is going to look it up in the paper. Yeah, yeah, so what I didn't mention earlier is that in the case in the simulations we're considering here, then these force points, they are immediately to the left. They are immediately to the left and right of the curve, of the starting point of the curve. And yeah, maybe it's obvious from the picture, but the row value for the, if we look at, for example, the red curve, then at least the row value is going to be negative because the curve is, it's going to be negative for the point, if you look at the first point to the left of the curve and it's going to be positive on the other side because it's being pushed in left direction. Being pushed in left direction. But yeah, I think Ewan is also going to look up the exact numerical relationship between theta and rho. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, maybe we can. Yeah, actually, I think we, yeah, no, we cannot. Yeah, I think we cannot see it from this. Yeah, I think we cannot see it from this picture. Okay, so here is again a simulation where I've chosen 20 evenly spaced points on the lower boundary of the square. And then there are flow lines of angle plus minus pi over 4. And again, we're seeing that the flow lines of the same angle but with different starting points are merging together so that we get two Together, so that we get two different trees corresponding to the two angles. So, yeah, so far we have considered flow lines which have been started from the boundary of the domain, but it's also possible to consider flow lines started from an interior point of the domain. And this is the topic of the fourth imaginary geometry paper. So, and I can say that the construction of And I can say that the construction of these fill lines is done in a rather similar sense as in the boundary case. And if we add some particular singularity to the field at the point at which the flow line starts, then the flow line will have the law of a halt line as a v. And here is the case where the flow lines have been started from two different interior points. In this figure, 100 uniform points have been chosen from the square and from each point there is one flow line of angle pi over 2 and another one of angle minus pi over 2. And what we can see is that the various blue flow lines of angle pi over 2, they are merging together to form a tree. And the same is case for the green. Same is case for the green flow lines. So here is the case where we consider flow lines of the field given by Gauss-Norfield field minus five times the logarithm of the modulus of Z. And you can see that in this case, the flow lines are spiraling through the initial point. And yes, roughly speaking, it is because the logarithm is increasing. Because the logarithm is increasing as we're going outwards, so that we get some slight change of the angle, or some slight decrease of the angle as we are going outwards. So here we are considering flow lines where theta is having value plus minus pi over 2. minus pi over 2 and we have SLE3 type curves and this is and this is the same simulation as in the previous slide except that now the flow line is varying that the angle of the flow line is varying in time. So the flow line is first running with angle pi over 2 then with minus pi over 2 then with plus pi over 2 and so on and then we've considered all possible ways to vary the flow lines and the union of The flow lines, and the union of all the flow lines we get is shown in the figure. And what is very interesting is that it turns out that the union of all these flow lines, they have the law of an SLE with parameter 16 over 3. And there is a similar relationship between SLE flow lines of SLE kappa type and an SLE 16 over kappa. So this is an instance of what is often called duplentia duality, where SLE duality. Duality or SLE duality. And I can also say that this construction of SLE16 over kappa is often called the light cone construction. Okay, so yeah, so now almost 30 minutes have passed. I think we can take a little break in case there are some more questions. Yeah, I guess we can take a two-minute break. Yeah. There are questions that will appear in the chat. Yeah. Yeah, so June has written an answer now. So theta. So the row value. So the rho value is plus minus theta chi divided by lambda, where lambda is this original lambda is pi divided by root kappa. Okay, so one question, if I know why it's called a light cone. I actually don't know exactly why they call it a light cone. Yeah, I'm not sure they gave an intuition for that in the papers. So I think the physical notion of a light cone, if you have some time-space manifold, so if you start at a point, then you can consider the set of all points that can be reached physically if you move at mostly the speed of light. Mostly the speed of light. So if you have space-time, then you get a cone. If you have a flat space-time, it's just a cone, yeah, a regular geometric cone. Yeah. And so this is a similar motivation that if you move in all possible directions, based in Florence, these are the set of points that can be reached. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, so this is close to what Yain said in the To what Emain said in the chat. So I so I guess I so the this development is So in this theory, when you say in part one, you say that the GFF determines a the settle. I assume you mean that there's a unique such determination which has these properties? Yeah, yeah. And is the uniqueness part easy to see or if the uniqueness part so I think it somehow follows from the proof. So Folows from the proof. So the proof is, so as I mentioned, the proof has two steps. The first one constructs, well, actually, yeah, at least I can explain how yeah, so the so the proof is going. So the proof is going. So if you look at the second, yeah, so one first constructs a coupling, and I guess this coupling is somehow, I guess the law of this coupling is unique. And then one proves in, to prove the second step, then one gradually, then one starts out with a coupling, then one samples, then one is sampling to a different flow line. Two different flow lines conditioned on the field, and one show that these two have to be the same. That's my strategy of the second step. So, Ross has an answer to your question, Omar. He's saying eta is measurable with respect to H in the group. Okay. Yeah, yeah, so in yeah, so in this um uh yeah so in uh yeah, so it's true that in this theorem, then there is a coupling such that h is determining eta. And then I guess Omar asked if there could be some sort of other way of coupling the two, which were satisfying the same property. Which were satisfying the same properties? I think that was a question. Yes. Yeah. And I think the answer to that is no. I think because, yeah. This, I think, in the first bullet point, and the strategy is just, yeah, so in the first bullet point, the strategy is to start out with With the SLE, and then constructing a Gaussian field field from the SLE, which is satisfying the properties. So that somehow gives uniqueness of that coupling. And then in step two, one starts out with a coupling from step one. And one shows that in that coupling, one has a determination that age determines eta. Okay, now there's some discussion about the discussion. Okay, I haven't followed. I don't quite follow. Could you explain a bit? So the question for Maul was how do you choose in the case of radial SLE? But you don't have you don't start at the boundary, so what does it mean to put different values to the level? What does it mean to put different values to the left and right of the starting point when the starting point is not on the boundary? If you have a radial SLE starts from a boundary, doesn't it? Ah, I see, yes, yes, right. You do have the radial SLE starting from the boundary. Yes, I think. Yes, so Nina was showing simulations of flow lines started at the center. There, but uh, assuming like the whole plane case, what you were uh, yes, I maybe that's yeah, so so at least in the whole plane case, then we are starting as if we have some uh whole plane Gaussian free field, then we can and we add some singularity at the starting point, then we get whole plane SLEs. We get whole plane SLEs. Whole plane SLE SLE curve. If we don't add the singularity at the starting point, then we get whole plane SLE with some force point. And the force point here, it will be at the starting point on the curve in some way, but one can always somehow imagine that when it's infinite decimally on one side or the other. Yeah, I guess maybe another thing to point out is that if you have a just like an ordinary whole plane GFF and you're doing its flow line started from the origin, then you'll have a SLE kappa with rho value equal to 2 minus kappa. And then you can get other kappas by putting, by like subtracting a multiple of like the argument function from the field. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so this is so this singularity I mentioned with it was this argument function. So it's possible to choose an appropriate multiple so that one gets an exact whole plane, regular whole plane without any raw values. Perhaps we continue and maybe questions on the chat afterwards. Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah, as I mentioned before, there are This proof that I present with the theorem I presented earlier, the proof has two steps. And I want to say a little bit more about the first of these two steps. So a precise way to state the result of the first of the two steps is that there exists a coupling of a Gaussian free field and an SLE such that some variants of the two properties on the previous slide are holding. So first of all, we have a locality property and then we have this coordinate. property and then we have this coordinate change property. The coordinate change property in this setting is actually exactly the same as on the previous slide and then and then but for the locality property there is a slight change. As you remember that in the setting of this proposition we don't know that H is determining eta. So therefore the variant of locality that is natural in this setting is to say that the probability That is to say that the probability that the curve does not intersect u for smallpox at u conditioned on h is the function of age in the complement of u. So this is somehow the natural analog of this locality property because we don't know that age determines eta. Okay, so yeah, so the starting point for proving this problem. Proving this proposition. So it is that we, for example an SLE and then we let age rec sub t denote the harmonic extension of age from the boundary of the hull at time t to the complement of this hull, assuming that the proposition holds. Because if we assume that the proposition is true, then the third condition of the proposition is telling us what these boundary data are. These boundary data are okay, so then there is a second step, which is to use the Lerner equation and eto calculus to say that for each fixed Z in the upper half line, then h for x sub t of z is actually a local continuous martingale, and it's also possible to be given explicit expression for the quadratic variation. Then the same statement is holding if we're taking the average. if we're taking the average or sum of this sum of this function age frac sub t of z over multiple points. So and what one can show in particular is that if we look at the pairing of h frac sub t with some function some smooth test function phi, then this martingale property is still holding. It's still local continuous martingale and with some And with some, again, with this excluded formula for the quadratic variation. At least as long as the SOE doesn't intersect the support of this test function. So then in the next step, we're choosing some domain V and then we're looking at V, at age restricted to V. Then we're also looking at age rec sub-tau restricted to V, and we're adding to that function. To that function, some zero-boundary GFF. And then I'm claiming that these two fields are equal in law. So this can be proved by an explicit computation by using the previous point, because since these fields are Gaussian, then the law of the field is characterized by the law of the field integrated against test functions. Against test functions. So, this fourth bullet point is some first step towards proving existence of the coupling because it's saying that there exists a coupling of age and of eta and of age tilde, which are consistent with this third bullet point. Okay, so then we can, this fourth bullet point is for some fixed domain v and some stopping time tau. But it's possible to extend this to the case of extend the coupling that we get from the fourth bullet point to the case of multiple stopping times and multiple domains. And then it's also possible to show that in this And then it's also possible to show that in this coupling, then this locality property is also satisfied. So this is a very rough outline of how one can prove such a proposition. Okay. So the next thing we will be looking at is that we will be looking at what are the values of the Gaussian free field. The values of the Gaussian free field along the SLE. And first, we will be again looking start by looking at the case of smooth fields. So we recall from earlier that e to the power ih is tangent to the curve at any point. And from this, it's possible to deduce that age is given by this constant chi times the winding of Of times the winding of the curve, at least modulo 2π. So then we ask about the case of the Gaussian free field and SLE. And we see that in the case of the Gaussian free field and SLE, we're seeing a somewhat different situation. So in the case where the field is smooth, then the field is well defined on the curve itself. But since the GFF is not a function, this does not hold in our setting. This does not hold in our setting. And it turns out that in the case of the GFF and SLE, then it turns out that we get different that the value of the GFF on the curve will be different depending on whether we approach the curve from the left side or the right side. If we approach the curve from the left side, then the boundary value will be minus alpha plus chi times the winding of the curve. Well, we will get plus alpha. While we will get plus alpha instead of minus alpha on the right side, so in particular, we have this what we call an angle gap of 2 alpha between the two sides. So, one small remark here is that this is actually not well defined in the setting of SLE because if you look at a typical point of an SLE, then the winding will be infinite on that point. But it is possible in some way. Possible in some way to make sense of the harmonic extension of the winding of the SOLE. So, this is what we are considering to make this statement precise. Another remark is that if we consider the case kappa equals 4, then we get the chi equals 0. So, in this case, we have minus alpha on one side and plus alpha on the other side. So, in this case, we see that these that the S. Is that the DSLE is actually a level line of the GFF because it marks the interface between positive and negative values. And this case has been studied in two papers by Schrum and Sheffield. Okay, so the next thing I want to do is that I want to explain, I want to explain why this angle gap is arising and also compute the exact value of the angle gap. Yeah, so then we, for simplicity, we just assume instead of considering the SLE, we consider some straight line L pointing straight upwards. And then we recall the domain marker property. So if we phrase this with L instead of eta, then it would mean that conditioned on L, then the field we get after mapping out is equal in law to the original field. Original field. So, in other words, the field in the right side of the figure has banned rada plus minus pi over root kappa. And then I denote this field by h since it's equal in law to h. So then we know that these two fields, they are related by this coordinate change formula that I presented earlier. So the field on the left side will be age minus chi times the argument of minus chi times the argument of the derivative of g. So it's possible to compute that on the left side of this line L, then the argument of the derivative of g is minus pi over 2. So we plug into the formula and we see that h is equal to minus alpha, where alpha is defined to be pi over root kappa minus pi over 2 times chi. Similarly, on the right side, the argument of the Similarly, on the right side, the argument of the derivative of g is plus pi over 2. And again, we plug into the coordinate change formula to get that h is equal to plus alpha. Yeah, so then we can repeat this with a more complicated curve, and then we will see the result that we were trying to prove, which is that on the left side, the boundary layers are minus alpha plus chi times the winding, and on the right side we have plus alpha plus chi times. alpha plus chi times the winding. And then we can simplify the definition of alpha which is given on this slide and we get the shown expression for alpha. Okay so in the remaining time I will present a few applications of imaginary geometry because as I mentioned before it has proven to obtain a number of properties about SLE which were not SLE, which were not, which people have not managed to prove with the more classical Lermotrain methods. So, one of the first examples of applications, so imaginary geometry, is that Miller and Sheffield proved reversibility of SLE kappa with kappa between four and eight. So, this was earlier proved by Daphne Muzan in the case when kappa is smaller than four. And Wilhelm Scheffel also proved. four and Wilhelm Scheffel also proved with imaginary geometry that for kappa bigger than eight then we don't have irreversibility. And yeah, it also came up in Tuesday's lecture that they also gave an explicit law for the time reversal of SLV kappa for kappa bigger than eight. So a second application is that imaginary geometry was used to give an alternative construction of a space-filling SLE. Of a space-filling SLE. So, the idea of this is illustrated in the left part of the figure. So, this is the same simulation as we looked at earlier. So, at each point of the domain, we have started what we call east-going and west-going flow lines. So, a schematic sketch of this picture is given in the right part of the figure. So, here we have six points, and we have started flow lines from these six points. and we have started flow lines from these six points and we see that these flow lines merge together to form a tree. Then we can go around this tree in the order indicated by the orange arrows and we see that when we do this we get an ordering of these six points. They're ordered by the order in which they are encountered when we go around the tree. So we see that we first get Z1, then Z2, then Z5. Z2, then Z5, Z4, and so on. Okay, so a space-filling SLE can be characterized by the order in which it hits the points of the domain. So, and one way to construct the space-filling SOE is to repeat the construction in the right part of the figure, not with six points, but with a countable dense set of points. And then start flow lines from all these points and then look at. From all these points, and then look at the ordering which is induced by the flow lines. And this turns out to give an ordering which is equal in law to that associated with the space filling SLE. So a third application is that imaginary geometry was also used to prove So, used to prove what the multifractal spectrum of SLE is. So, this was proved by Ewan, who is in the chat, together with Miller and Sun. So, to define what the multipractical spectrum of SLE is, then we consider an SLE eta in the unit disc between plus minus I and we let phi be a conformal map from the unit disc to the left part to the domain to the left of the curve. Domain to the left of the curve. And then the multifractal spectrum. Yeah, so since this curve A d is fractal, then the derivative of phi will blow up as we approach the boundary of the domain. And the multipractical spectrum is telling us in what sense this function phi is blowing up. So more precisely, it's given by one way to define the multipractical spectrum is to say that it is the function. Say that it is the function given at the bottom of the slide where dim sub age is denoting a half-stroke dimension. So, Gwyn-Miller and Son, they gave an explicit formula for this multifractal spectrum, which was matching earlier predictions by Bertrand Duplantia. So, this proof of the multifractal spectrum of SOE, it is a very long and technical work. So I will just be mentioning Just mentioning one particular part of the proof where an imaginary geometry is applied. So at one point in the proof, it's necessary to prove that if it proves some sort of independence property along the SLE. So we choose two points, X and Y, along the SLE, and we zoom in near these two points. And we want to argue that, roughly speaking, the local behavior of the SLE near Local behavior of the SOLIN near these two points is approximately independent. So, what they do to obtain this is that they run some flow lines of the Gaussian free field, which are shown in dark green on the slide, and they make such flow lines, which create pockets around the points. And then, by the result I presented earlier, then we know what the boundary data of the SLE are along these flow lines. These flow lines. And then, by combining this with the domain marker property of the Gaussian free field, then it's possible to deduce from this that the Gaussian free field is approximately independent in these two pockets, which again give us that the SOE segments are approximately independent. Okay, so another application is that it was used to compute. Is that it was used to compute the double and cut point dimension of SLV? So this was done by Miller and Wu. So this is related to imaginary geometry because it turns out to be almost equivalent to, or the double and cutbond dimension obviously can be obtained by understanding the half by computing the Hausdorff. By computing the Hausdorff dimension of the points of intersection between two imaginary geometry flow lines. Since it turns out that if we choose some typical cut point, for example of an SLE, and we zoom in and near this point, then the behavior of the SLE close to this point can be approximately described by two imaginary geometry flow lines. So, yes, in the right figure, we have two flow lines of two different angles. figure we have two flow lines of two different angles theta one and theta two and for certain values of of theta one minus theta two then these flow lines will will hit each other and and bounce off off each other yeah so just like the other works that I have presented on this slide this the proof of the dobeline checkpoint dimension of SOE is also a long point I mentioned by SOE is also a long and technical work but I want to mention one very very short lemma from this paper because it's it's saying one it's giving one typical application of imaginary geometry when we study SLE so we are considering an SLE between plus minus one in the unit disk and then we have some tube which is connecting plus minus i and then the lemma is saying that the probability that the SLE is staying inside the tube The SOE is staying inside the tube is strictly positive. So, this could probably also have been proved by more classical methods, but I want to give a very short outline for a very short proof using imaginary geometry. So the idea is that we assume that eta is also the flow line of a Gaussian free field in the unit disk. Then we let eta tilde be an SLE inside this tube, also from Also, from causal connecting plus minus one, and we assume that this is the flow line of the Gaussian free field, H, some Gaussian free field, H tilde. And then it's possible to argue that eta is absolutely continuous with respect to Eta tilde, because age restricted to the tube is absolutely continuous with respect to age tilde if we are away from the boundary. And of course, eta tilde stays inside the tube, so therefore. tilde stay inside the tube, so therefore eta also has to do this with positive probability. So one of the areas for which imaginary geometry has had the biggest influence is for the theory of leewal quantum gravity. So I will not be stating any precise results in this direction because the mini course is not about LQG and I haven't given an introduction to it. Given an introduction to it. But very roughly speaking, or what then Liebwill quantum gravity is a theory of random surfaces. And if we're given some domain D in the complex plane, then the theory of Liberal quantum gravity is giving us natural ways to sample random area measures and random boundary measures on this domain. So I will not go into the details. So I will not go into the details of exactly how these random measures are sampled. So for now just imagine that we're considering the unit disk with some random error measure and some random length measure along the boundary. We also assume that the total boundary length is equal to 10 and the red points have been chosen such that the distance between adjacent points is exactly equal. Adjacent points is exactly equal to one. So here we have three independent copies of LQG surfaces. So this just means we have three copies of the unit disk, which each have some random area measure and some random boundary length measure, such that the measures for the different disks are independent of each other. So then we are gluing together the Together these three disks according to the boundary length. So yes, we glue the right side of the left disk to the left side of the middle disk and so on. And since it's according to bander length, then the red points are identified as shown. So when we do this gluing, then we get a new disk, at least in a topological sense. sense and then in certain situations it's possible to argue that there exists a unique control map phi which is taking this topological disk to the standard unit disk such that phi is continuous and it is conformal restricted to each of the of the three disks yeah so this brings us to the figure on Brings us to the figure on the right side of the slide. Here you can see that we get two black curves in the disk, which are giving the interfaces between the original disks. And it's possible to show that for certain natural ways of sampling these Bander measures, then these two curves that we see in the disk in the right part of the figure, they are coupled together using this imaginary geometry coupling. Geometry coupling. And imaginary geometry has proven to be very useful for proving such conformal welding results that we see here. Because understanding what happens when we cut and glue these LQG surfaces is closely related to understanding how imaginary geometry flow lines interact with each other. Yeah, so I also want to mention that this is just a small selection of the applications Imaginary Geometry has said, and there are many, many important applications that I have left out. And yeah, that's all I wanted to say today. I see there are some questions which have been coming in in the chat. So I'm not sure if anything is still that, maybe we. But before that, maybe we should take a moment to thank Nina again, so the participants should be able to unmute themselves. I guess.
