So my talk will be very, very introductory. So for who among you that work in saturated solutions to the Ambax equation, this will be quite boring. I'm sorry about that. But it will be a secret introduction to I will start with basic definitions and examples. Then I will give you some computational results. And I will end up seeing how separated solutions to the unboxing equation are related to radical beads. And sweep places. So, this is more or less the plan for today. So, let's just get started. Why are we interested in conceptual solution to the unboxing equation? Well, the best thing that I can say in this direction is in a paper on 92, Drinkl said this interesting sentence that is, it would be interesting to start. That is, it would be interesting to study saturated solutions to the unbaxed equation. So here we are, and from when people started studying saturated solutions to the unbaxed equation, it appeared clear that these solutions are related with different topics in mathematics, in pure mathematics, mostly, like non-theory or, for instance, radical beams, as we will see later, or off-gladdies tension. Of the LIE stations and other flows. So, what's a saturated solution to the ambassador equation? So, I will write just S E or possibly nothing. When I will say solution, I will always mean saturated and of the unboxed equation. So, a saturated solution of the unboxed equation is a pair. Use a pair XR where X is a non-empty set and R is a map from X cross X to S cross X. Such that. Satisfies this condition. R times the identity, identity times r, r times the identity is equal to identity times r, r times the identity, identity times r, such that this guy was in x cross x plus x. So this is sometimes called the braid equation. The braid equation for clear reasons. And for me, a sectoratic solution is always a fair. Usually, we assume this map to be bijective, but in principle, there is no need to ask for that. A small convention. Since R is a map that maps a pair into a pair, I want to be able to I want to be able to refer to the single component of this pair. So if I have a solution, I will write the image of xy has lambda xy rho yx, where I'm just using a bunch of map lambda x and a bunch of map rho y to identify the elements. Okay. Um, so just to be sure that I mention all the terminology that I'm gonna use, since the solution is a pair, I will loosely say that the solution is bijective and I would mean that R is bijective. mean that I is projective or a solution is finite, I will mean that the set x is finite. And another terminology that I would use is this more definition. I have a separated solution, then I will say that this solution is non-degenerate. If this map, lambda x and rho y are operated. It might happen that I will say just left or right. Just left or right non-degenerate. This shouldn't happen in the talk, but just in case. Left non-degenerate means that just the lambda mark are projecting, not asking anything on the row, and right projective the other way around. So I said that this is called also the brain equation. And let me picture out why this is called a brain equation. If we represent our map R. If we represent our map R as a crossing and the identity as a straight line, then if we picture down this just stuck over the one over the other, and the identity, what we will get is we have the identity, then R and then the identity here that is equal to And so this is you can recognize that being a solution of the unboxing equation is just saying that you are satisfying the third Reicho alpha mean. And if we want to see in a picture was these two properties that I mentioned before about the solution mean. About the solution, mean my solution is so if I look at R, my solution is bijective, means that whenever I take a row here in this diagram, the other row is completed at a mine by the budget of unus. And being non-degenerate means that the same thing happens on the column. So if I had a column here, these other two elements are. These other two elements are completely different. So, being in a situation in which my solution is bijective and non-degenerate means that, well, I need just two elements here to say everything about this picture. But let me give you some examples so we can have a concrete idea about what we are working with. And the easy example that I can think of, because we can think of, is clearly if I look He's clearly, if I look here, it's clearly the identity will satisfy this wish. So boring, but working, this is a solution. And if we want to test the definition that we introduced before, this is clearly bijective as a solution, but it's clearly very much degenerate because if I look at lambda xy in my Lambda xy, in my case, this is the identity, so this will map to the constant map x. And the same thing for R. So this is an example of a bijective solution, what degenerates. If we want something that is non-degenerate, well, let's look a second at this picture. And well, there is a kind of a twist here. So if we take the map, the flip map. If we take the map, the flip map, the map that maps xy into yx, well, this is going to be a solution. And in this case, this is the easiest solution that is bijective but also non-degenerate, because in this case, if I go and look at what happened to my lambda x, well, this is the identity. This is the identity. So, this is an example of something that is bijective and non-degenerate, and this is the easiest one that we can think of. Now, if we look at how we brought the solution here, well, so what we did is, okay, if my lambda is the constant power, I get a solution. If my lambda is the identity always, I get a solution. I get a solution. What happens if I have two maps? Can I define a solution in this way? What do I need? And turns out that the only thing that I mean is that these two mouse commute one with the other, and then this would be a solution. And clearly, this is going to be non-degenerate if lambda and rho are terminations. And in this case, will be also bijective. It's not hard to prove that this is enough to be projective. But these are kind of But these are kind of in this in this case when we assume that the lambda and rho are bijective, this solution has a name and is called Yubiosenko solution or also a fermentational solution. To have in mind that this is defined using two permutations. And this is a good source of example of solution in general, or even you can cook up interesting contra examples just thinking about solutions like this. So now let me just say that I was just I was just starting with the set and tried to construct some solution. Of course, if I have a little bit more structure on my set, then I can construct something that is a little bit more sophisticated. So let me start with a group. Real group, then I can consider this map here over distance this map here y and these turn out to be a solution. To be a solution to the unboxing equation, and they are both non-degenerate and rejective. And in particular, this comes from this is due to VADA and was found in representation of break groups. And this solution here is part of a little family of solutions where we can consider. We can consider X with a binary operation. And if we ask when a map like this is a solution, turns out that this operation here needs to be set to distributed. Here needs to be set to distribute you. So it's not hard to prove this, but if we are in this situation, this is called, so if we are in this situation, then we have that this solution defined in this way is a solution in this way is a solution. The market running this way is a solution, and if the right multiplication is bijective, then this solution will be bijective. And structure like this with the right multiplication bijective are called RAX. At least give us an idea why we are still related with North Fu. So now I think that is, and in this case again, we get that our solution is simultaneously bijective and non-bigenary. So I think that is natural here to ask which is the relationship. Which is the relationship between these two concepts? Because we saw that the identity was bijective but not degenerate, but then all the other solutions that we encountered, assume we asked them to be non-degenerate, they were automatically bijective. And so we have this fact. This is a joint paper with ATS Arnevan Helfen and Harvard Berkin. And if we have a solution that is finite, That is finite, and well, all the lambda are bijective. Oh, please feel free to ask any question if it's not clear. If law rounds are bijective, then we have that our solution is bijective if and only if all the rows are bijective. Leaf, all the law are protected. So, if and the leaf is on the generate. So, the only case in which we could have something that was bijective and undegenerate was the example that was in the family of example that we saw were the identity that is. So, my solution to be bijective, but the generate needs to have both map, lambda, and rho to be. map lambda and rho to be non-piject because as soon as this is not true then I'm I'm followed here. Finiteness in this context is important. There is a counter example of an invertive solution, so a square identity of projective, which is left non-degenerate, so the lampar projective, but not right. So finite here is important. For this implication, For this implication, finite is not important. So you can prove this without the assumption of a finite. So from now on, when I would say solution, I mean bijective solution. There are a lot of things that can be said for solutions that are not bijective, but I don't want to That are not rejective, but I don't want to go into that details now. So, how many solutions do we have to some computational result? So, in the world of centuretic solution, usually when people refer to solution mean bijective, but also non-degenerate. But also non-degenerate. So we have a lot of results of solutions that are, and information about solutions that are both bijective and non-degenerate. And we do have a classification of involutive, I mean, hard-squared denominating solutions. So for, let me give you some numbers here. So Here, so this is the size, this is the cardinality of the set X, and then the number of solutions and the number of non-degenerate solutions. This is computed. All these computational results are not triggered at all. You need a little bit of trick to get these numbers with the computer. This is in a paper by Akmun, Merev and Menon. And they managed to classify knowledge generic solutions up to size 10. I would like to give you just the first numbers for let's do these. So non-degenerate, you have two, five, and Two, five, and then this grows really, really fast. Eighty, eight, and then are very huge numbers. And I can give you what happens if I just drop the assumption of non-degenerate and we get things really, really wild. Uh these start growing very very fast. Then uh I managed to compute with uh is it like exponential growth or? Like exponential growth? I don't know because the only thing that I managed to get is up to four. So I have a really hard time to imagine which kind of loss is. But to get to four, it was not so trivial. Not for involved. We have the same number for rejective in general, but it was not so trivial. If you just put plug in the condition to have a solution, this is not enough. To have a solution, this is not enough. We use a kind of backtracking algorithm to get there. This up to isomorphism? Aptoisomorphism. Well, the definition of isomorphism. Well, it's what you would expect. So, this is I wanted to mention this before. Sorry about that. This is important. So. So if I have X R Y S solutions and isomorphism is a map from X to Y such that if I go this is S, and this is so this is amorphous, which is what you would expect. Which is what you would expect. This is a morphism of solutions. I hope that I put this in the right side. Morph solution. And two solutions are isomorphic if there is a morphist that is projected. It's on the other way around. It is, no? Because I end up I end up And uh another question, it is easy to prove that some solutions are isomorphic, but how to prove that they are not? That is more difficult. Yeah, yeah. And did you go through this? You must pass to the group structure, maybe? You can go to we will see the group structure at the end. We will see the group structure at the end of this call. Yeah. Maybe you can use it. Yeah. And we have similar, maybe I will skip the numbers, but we have a similar table up to four for the solution in general and up to eight for non-involved in the non-involved case. Uh yes. Okay, so constructing the solution doesn't seem s so easy, so maybe we can rely on having a little bit more structure as we saw before with the solution constructed on a probe on the set X to see if we can find a bigger class of solutions. So now let's just uh we saw with these numbers and maybe the numbers that I didn't give on non-involved solution that the number of so if we allow solution to be also degenerated then the number glows really really fast and the behavior is kind of wild. So let's now focus on Let us now focus on non-degenerate solutions. Okay, there is a really interesting example of you to room that constructs a family of involuntary solutions, starting with something that is creeping on. With something that is pretty normal. So we start with a radical ring. Now, there are many equivalent definitions of radical ring. The one that I want to use here that might be, that I think is the easiest to give in this moment, if we have a ring, we can define the adjoint obligation in this way. Ratio in this way, and the ring is radical if R with respect is a joint cooperation as a group. So we can think about a radical ring like a set with two group structures that interact because. Because this operation is defined using the sum and the multiplication, so there will be some connection between these two operations. I don't want to say explicitly now. If we have a radical ring, so we have these two groups, we can define this map here in this way minus x and that. And then second component minus x minus where this prime here is the inverse in the adjoint group. And then if we consider this map here, then the pair are hard. R is involved and non-degenerate solution. And just let me give you a couple of observations here. We can see this is the multiplication in the adjoint. In the original group. So we can see that if we consider the pair xy and we consider the multiplication in the circle group here between xy, I get x equal to y. That's always easy. If I do the same to the image, I get again x equals y. And this is something that we could have noticed when I brought the other example, but I didn't. So the one constructed on the group was y comma y inverse x y. Again, we have this, and also on the other one, it was a little bit more complicated, but still, this cognition holds. And this is kind of not the case. This is pretty common. So this gave us a very big family of solution, of invertive solution of the unbaptized equation. Seems pretty interesting to look at solutions in this way. To look up solution in this way. So, well, it's not superwild to ask: can I do I really need a radical link to construct a solution in this way? So, what I could have is a set with two group operations that speak one to the other in a nice way to allow me to prove that this guy is a solution. This would be nice. This would be nice. And indeed, this is possible. So under the circle, the identity is zero. Yes, the identity of these two groups is 25. Does it have a multiplicative identity used in the pattern? No, no, you never have any. No, you can't. Because what you need is that the radical the the this operation is a group and This operation is a group, and the identity will not work. Okay, so the question that I want to address here is that do I really need to, you know, to come to play these very well-known To play these very well-known algebraic structures that are rather instead structures, or I can do something, I can work with something less. So, let me give you this definition, which is the thing that will solve my question. And this definition is due to Bernard 2017, if I'm not mistaken, and he is a And is a generalization of a definition of room, and I will say exactly where the two differs. So if I have a non-empty set with two operations such that B with respect to plus and B with respect to the circular groups. And I do know that this is annoying. I'm using the plus just to remind the additive structure of the radical ring. I'm not asking the plus to be a region in general. I know that this is confusing, but to bear with me. I just want these two. I want to be able to compare these with radical links, and it's a little bit easier if I have a sum there. So I have two groups, and then I have that for every. That for every A, B, and C in this group, in this set B, I want to see how the sea collaboration interacts with the sum. I cannot expect that this is distributed because the ring is not, but it's not so far from being distributed. So I have A circle B, I have A circle C, but then But then higher than x of factor minus a in between. If this is the case, the with respect to skew operation is for the skew brace. And the definition of Bernier and I mean is exactly this one. The definition of room is not exactly in these terms and assume the additive structure to be a region. A media and they were called places. So now it's a little bit more clear why the term Q appears here in the definition. And if we have this algebraic structure, well this is what will allow us to get a solution with these bone destructions. So this is exactly the mean. Exactly, the minimum assumption that we can ask to a structure like this to get a solution that looks like the one that we obtained for radical beans. So Ethereum, I have a square brace, then are we define exactly the same way? Then P with respect is now degenerative solution. And we can say a little bit more, we can control the inverse of this solution. So, in particular, let me go. Particular, let me go here. So now we see that the definition of the solution is exactly the same. So I can erase this side. So we can say a couple of things. So this is room. Ask where is the identity if and only if the additive structure is and let me just end here and hear this so we can control when this guy is opinion is moderate and then let me give you some example of this algebraic structure just to say that there are Structure just to say that they are. Of course, random rings. So if I have a random ring, then R plus with respect to the adjoint operation is a steep raised. Is actually one of the skew bases of Rome with the advent structure opinion. The other implication is not true, but we can control when looking at these I get a skew. If I have a skew race that looks like this, I can say when these erratic ring. For instance, you can define the same structure but with a distributive But with the distributivity on the other side, and this is, I have a skew place with a billion structure, with the structure of a billion. This is if it is the distributivity loads from both sides, then this is just a radical ring. So radical ring are there, very good. So we did generalize this. If I have any group, Then this has two natural skew phase structures. So if I take twice the same operation, it's a skew phase. But also if on the addition of the first operation I take the opposite operation, this is again a skew case, and clearly They not need to be isomorphic if the group is monomed. Something a little bit more interesting, if I have a group with an exact factorization, meaning that well, A and B are subgroups with 30%. Wait, trigger intersection. That, in other words, any element of g is written in a unique way, has a product of an element in A and an element in A. An element in A and an element in B. Then, what I can do, I can define a QBRI structure on this group G. So I can define x plus y just the product. Just the product and x equals y. I know that x is written in a unique way as this, in this way. Then g is a screen raise. And of course, if this exact factorization is a very good point, If this exact factorization is non-trivial, this is different from the one that they put here. And finally, if we have a skew base, we can always cook up another one in this way. Sometimes quite the opposite. If the additive structure is not abelian, in general, these are not isomorphic structures. And an interesting part of this cubes are called two nine or two thousand and three. Uh very first question. Is the second phrase non-isomorphic to the first? Here? If the additive structure is not abiding, in general they are not isomorphic. I have examples where they are not. Uh yeah. I I have a clear one in mind, but I don't want to go into details, but in general they are not as much. Details, but in general, they are not as much 2020. So if I have a screw base, well, we said that we have always a solution, and this is always projective. You believed me, but I can tell you who is inverse. So RB and R B and the solution, let me call the opposite be odd in this way, then the solution associated to R and the solution associated to R o are be o. So if I just bought the addition, they are one the inverse of the other. And this and now it's clear why if Why, if the additive structure is abelian, I get something that is important because it's inverse control. It's a nice way to see this. Okay, very nice. So up to now, I'm gonna finish. Up to now, we saw that if we have skew places, they always give up. Basis, they always give our solution to the unboxing equation, but this is in a way just half of the story. So, what I want, so we saw that, let me write this here. So, what we saw is that if I have a skew brace I end up to get a solution. But I would like to start with a solution, always with this assumption of non-degeneracy, and be able to find a skew brace nice enough to control, in a way, some of the properties of matrix. So the other So, the other way around, anyway. So, let me just give you a definition first. This is I think what I'm solo 99. So, if I have, they gave the definition for important. They gave the definition for involitive solution, but can be extended for non-involutive as well as bijective. R is bijective is fine. So the generalization to actually solution in general is due to solving hereafter. Okay, so if I have a solution, I can consider this group. This group. So it's the group generated by X with this relation. And the relation that I want to put are the relation that holds here. So that the product of X and Y and the product of the image of X and Y needs to be the same. So these are the relations that I'm going to put here. And this group here is called structure group. And there is a very nice theorem. Let me copy this because I'm gonna write this wrongly, fun of it. I hope this is correct. This is a set. I'm letting the mean, I think, that says that if I start with the solution to the unboxed equation, I can always give to this guy a structure of a skew brace. By a structure of a skew base, and this solution is related one to the other. So if I have an excellent solution, then let's go to the next slide. So, if I have a solution, I have received the unique structure On GXR. What I mean with a skew brace structure on GXR is that I can define an addition on GXR such that with respect to this addition and the multiplication here, I have a skew brace. Is what I mean. Such that If I consider the solution associated with these q trace, then this is. So, what I'm considering here is the embedding, well it's not embedded, the canonical map GXR, canonical map. So I'm mapping elements of the set text in the generators. Is this embedding? Is this embedding? No, generally not. Let me finish writing this here. So this is always the case. So the two solutions are related in this way. And in general, Yota is not an embedded. But if XR is involved, then this is an embedding, yoga is injective. But it's very easy to construct an example where this is not an embedding. And you remember that I said at the beginning that permutation. Said at the beginning that permutation solutions were a good instrument to find contradiction. And let's just consider X as a set with four elements and lambda one, the permutation that swap one and two and raw three, four. Of course, I can define a permutational solution with these definitions because they go here. But if I don't now look inside the structural group, what happens is that if I do, now I'm very sorry for this, but if I do one simple one, well, this needs to be lambda one on one, but lambda is swap one on with two, so this is two and rho will not do anything. Rho will not do anything. So we see that in GXR, one is equal to two. This construction, some kind of left adjoint of some. So the only thing that I can tell you about this construction is that in a way it has a universal property that I was gonna give later, but I don't know. So in this case, we see, since we are working in a group, in this case, one is equal to Working in a group, in this case, one is equal to two, and the same with the same computation, you will end up saying that three is equal to four. From the skew brace to the saturated constitution and back to skew brace. It's very much like the unit concept. So if you start with the skew brace, you go there, then this map is injective, this you can prove. But this, if you start with a finite skew brace, this skew brace is infinite. So maybe I didn't understand you. Yes, that's to be expected if that's if it's the Q braces. Okay. Uh yeah, I have two minutes to give the last things, and I have none. Uh so so you do have uh so the thing that I wanted to say here is that whenever this canonical map is injected, then what you can say is that you can find That you can find this solution has a sub-solution of the solution defined on a skew place. And indeed, we can do a little bit better. I don't want to go there, but we can find a finite quotient here that still works nicely. So if we restrict to finite solution, then we can still work with finite Q rates, which is nice. But there are solutions that are not sub-solutions. Well, I'm not subsolution or solution associated to spew cases. This is an example. And the last thing that I wanted to say. Uh we have uh a universal property. A universal property. So if I start with my solution and then I have this cube place on a map from X. From X to his replace such that this is comparable to the solutions ID make Uh morphism of skew races by obscure braces where for more freedom of securities, I just mean that this is a normal phrase with respect to two operations. Uh uh such that I use F and we have this phi. So if I have a map that maps my solution nicely in a skew brace, then I can extend the morph field to the structure. It's, I think, almost everything I wanted to see. Questions? In fact, it's not a question, I want to make a comment. Before 2019, I published a paper in advances which proves the prominence of racism and what is called brain groups with informative training cooperator and Operator, and from there, at least on that level, this follows when XR is involved. This is part of my theorem, that when XR is involved, then X is embedded in what is called structure group, brace, credit group, better. Yeah, so yeah, I should have mentioned these. Yeah, yeah, I should have mentioned this here just to make it clear. Yeah, yeah, sorry. This should have been mentioned here when I said nothing. And Ramin told me that I made this equivalence constructive and in fact they he with Buernieri had had built very similar map to what I suggested earlier for evolution. Thank you for the comment and sorry for lack of mix. Okay, since the opposite brace has appeared in recently some papers, I have some curiosities about the opposite basis and maybe also curious. Why to consider Why to consider opposite places? I mean, it is a relation between the original place and the opposite. You say that you write it the solution associated to the arguments. So, what about the group structure? Can you say something about the group relation between the group structure of operations? The group structure of a brace and the group structure associated with the opposite base and the solution associated to that. You have the brace RB, you have the opposite brace, R D of, and you have the group structure for R B, you have the good structure for R V O. What is the relation the structural relation between these structure groups? Uh I don't know on the top of my head. Because my my impression is just uh B up is just a different Be always just a different place. From archival point of view. They might be quite different. I can tell you a little bit. No, because Lambda map is very different. Yeah, in general they are quite different. If you have, for instance, if you look at very like if for instance, if you want to look at simple skew braces, you have an example of the simple skew base and the opposite is against. Race and the opposite is again simple, but they are not because they are completely, they don't talk to each other. The reason why I can tell you a little bit about the reason why opposites cube races were introduced, and this comes from the fact that there is a connection between skew races and off-vellar extensions. And in off-vellar extensions, natural to look at the opposite extension and the relation. Extension and the relation is exactly the one between cube bases and opposite cube base. So the people that introduced the opposite cube base come from that background, and this is how they then discovered the relation between skewers. For me, from the blue theory point of view, it's rather different. It's just maybe so they are giving away. So they are using align the whole parallel structures is naturalistic. Yeah, in this context, continuation, but maybe naive question. So starting from X, you build the corresponding brace, then and you did right, right? And then you take the opposite. Is is there any kind of uh new solution? Solution on the same settings for which this opposite phrase could be the structured book. Did I do some computation? I would say that the two solutions are one the opposite of the other stuff from the top of my head, but I'm not. So, because every phrase like this goes together with generating sets. Yes, yes. So, I would say that this. I would say that the DPT connection is opposite opposite. But on the additive structure, one needs to be a little bit more careful, but not a little bit. And also, I would like to have a comment. And then, because from my experience. And I think there is no mention that the definition of a place as we know. As we know, was also given in a paper of Cedot, Justice, and Oblinsky in 2014 in Communication Mathematical Physics. And then from this definition comes the extension. Yes. Because, I mean, grump definition, at least for me, is difficult to follow. Yeah, so just to I think we can. I think we have mentioned this paper because I think this paper is important. Yeah, it's a very nice paper, and every time that I look at that paper, I find something new. But yeah, just to... The definition, I mean, just to put everybody on the same page, group definition of a skew base was the natural generalization of additive being. So saying that looking at the multiplication without asking associativity and some extra. Associativity and some extra interaction between the two operations, but looking from the perspective of the operation in the radical beam. And then the relation between the adjoint group of the brace in this case and the addition was made very, very clear in favor of Elixir and Okinaw's fee. But yeah, thank you. That's all. Thank you very much. But if you if you go from groups instead to requisition inbound equation, you obtain a relevant solution so that it keeps representing a group? Yeah, I couldn't hear you. Sorry. It's because of the bell. So if you transform a group into a wando, in particular the retro solution in class relation, you know that solution is valid in the sense that it gives representations of good rate groups. So what I'm asking is if you transform asking is if you transform a skewed rays which should be imbalanced equation well I don't know I don't I think that we try to see it and it's not so clear that I did not yeah this sounds really like a good problem yes so maybe it's a good time to go ahead and start this thank you like So we have a rezone map at 10.
