with Matt Alexander, Matthew Faelici and Artem that you can find in archive. The idea is that we'll see that there is a nice way in which you can associate a convex polytope to any finite metric space. That relation somehow encodes the properties of the of the metric space. In particular we'll say what is the relation with the volume route of that volume. Of that polymer. So we'll denote by M a finite metric space with M plus 1 points, with some metric, but the way in which we are going to think on the metric space is as a graph. So you can think on the points of the metric space as nodes of your graph. This graph is going to be complete and the weights are going to be the the distances between the points. Between the points. But then you realize that we don't really need all the edges in order to encode the properties of the metric space. So for instance, we don't need this 7 here because 7 is indeed 2 plus 5. So we can remove that edge and still we have a graph such that if we endow the graph with the sorted path distance, we have the same metric space. And we can continue doing that. So for instance, this five is one plus three plus one. Is 1 plus 3 plus 1. So you can remove it and you continue, and at the end, you are going to arrive to a certain graph that is what we are going to call like the canonical graph of the metric space. So if I say that a metric space is a tree or that this is a cycle, what I mean is that this graph is a tree, a cycle, or whatever. It is easy to realize that indeed the edges that survive correspond precisely to the pair of points in the metric space such that all triangular inequalities are strictly. All triangular inequalities are strict. All triangular equalities involving that pair of points. This will be very useful in a moment. And I notice also that what we can do, thanks to the fact that we have a strict time or inequality here, is that we can replace one of the weights of the edges by something close and we'll still have some gravity. And we will still have some graph which corresponds to some metric space. And that would be useful. But notice that if, for instance, if we change these three by 2.9 or something like that, we are not just changing the distance between these two points, but also somewhere of the distances. Okay, we are changing this, the distance between these two points and the distance between this one and this one. Good. So this is the way in which you are going to think on metric spaces. So now, Spaces. So now, how can we associate to such a metric space point? What we will do is that we will consider functions on the metric space, which is a function. It's finite, so the function is lipid. By convenience, we take functions vanishing at the first point. Okay, this is a function in a finite set, so we can identify the function with a certain vector in Rn, including all the values of the function. Of the function. Then, what is the recital content of the function? It is the supremum of these quotients, all the points, pair of points on the matrix space. So, the functions we have, Lichet constant one, are precisely the ones in this set. So, that is why we denote this convex way, which is the ball of the space of Litzy functions, which is a vector space, and we dote that the space with the norm given by the. And we know that the space with the norm given by the best at least is constant, and then we get this set. Under this identification, the functions which are here are precisely the vectors in Rn such that the scalar prod with respect to this other vector is less than one. So you can see that this set is actually a finite intersection of hyperplane, so it is a polytroph. This point. So, in particular, we can compute also its polar, which is going to be important, since here we have this finite, the intersection of hyperplanes given by these vectors. The polar is going to be the convex half of the elements of this form. And this is what is called the ball of the Lichief space over M, which is denoted in this way. This is a space which receives many different names. Receives many different names. In particular, for finite metric spaces, it also corresponds to a transportation cost problem, if, as appeared in Siri's talk, in the case in which the cost function is actually a distance. But just let me say why x called feature free. It is because the following very nice property. Okay, so this is a construction which makes sense, even in Would make sense even in the case in which your metric space is an infinite metric space. But in that case, what you're going to obtain here is a certain infinite dimensional Manach space. And it has the following property. There is an isometric embedding from geometric space to this Vanach space, such that whenever you have a Lichi function from n to any other Vanach space, there is a unique boundary linear operator such that The linear operator such that this diagram commutes. And moreover, the norm of this operator coincides with the best Lichit constant of your function. So it is a way of linearizing Lichit functions. And this property was used by Jesus Gaude Fra and Nigel Calton to prove many nice theorems in the non-linear classification of Banach spaces. There is also a work by Naur and Shedman showing that if geometric spaces are true, then the legitimacy of the R2, then the Lichieff space does not invade into capital 1. So there is a lot of work also in the case for infinite metric spaces. But here I want to focus on the finite case. So let's give some intuition about what is this point. So let me consider a very, very easy example. Let's say that we have metric spaces with three. That we have metric spaces with three points, okay, and that they have this graph. And let's see how is the ball of the Lucifer free space. So remember that it is given it this way. So what do we have? So for instance, here we have E1 minus E2 divided by the distance between E1 and E2, which is 1. So we have the report E1 minus E2 and its opposite. And its opposite, we have also E1 minus E0, E0, we consider it 0. Divided by the instant, which is again 1, so we have E1 and we have minus E1, and we have also E2 and minus E2. So at the end, we get a polytope with six vertices. And now you're going to think on the following. Okay, let's say that we replace this one by something slightly larger. Then what are we doing? We are dividing here by something. We are dividing here by something larger than one. So we are pushing this point and this point in this direction. And you can continue doing that. You can continue increasing this distance until you arrive to two. Then you can not increase it anymore because that will break triangular inequality. And at that moment, your metric space becomes into this one and your polydog becomes into this one. So notice that at the same time that this edge At the same time that this edge disappears in the graph, this vertex disappears in the polytope. So there is a relation there. And indeed, Alian Girau proved, again, even in the case of an infinitimetric space, that this element is a vertex of the polytope if and only if all triangular inequalities involving the per point are extreme. So that means that there is that. That means that edges in this diagram correspond precisely to vertices of your polytope. So the number of vertices of the polytope is twice the number of edges in the graph diagram of the metric space. So you can see that there is a relation between geometric property of the polytope and the properties of the metric space that you are analyzing. Indeed, we have pushed this a little bit forward and we proved that our And we prove that um an element of this kind belongs to a phase of the mission k precisely if there are k different points such that the triangle inequality is an equality. So the case k equals 1 would be this result. Good. And there are more renditions. So for instance, there is a very nice paper of Golat where he proved that you obtain a tree precise. You obtain a tree precisely when your polytope is a linear image of little one. So that is precisely what is happening here. Here we have a tree and we get little one. And he also proved that geometric space embeds into a tree precisely when the polar of this polytope is a zoned. There are relations. In the infinite dimensional setting, you also have some relations. For instance, I have a paper with the process. I have a paper with Prochaska and Razoka, where we prove that in the case of a compact metric space, the metric space is geodesic if and only if the Litschiff space has the double edge property, which is a well-known and well-studied property of an X spaces. So, okay, so we have all the regressions, and in particular, what I would like to show you is that there is also a relation between the volume prod of Between the volume product of this polytube and the geometry of the metric space. So let me recall what the volume product is. In general, you have a convex polytope. We will assume that we are only in the symmetric case because this is the case which is very interesting for us. So we have a symmetric polytope and we define the volume product. The volume product is defined as the product of the volume of K and the volume of the polar. And the volume of the polar. This is a quantity which is invariant under affine transformations, which is continuous with respect to the house of distance. So it attains a maximum and a minimum. The maximum is well known. It's the Blaski-Central inequality. And it's attained at the Euclidean ball. And the Euclidean ball is the only maximizer, in a sense. And there are nice proof of this fact. Nice proof of this fact based on the steady symmetric on harmonic analysis and there are more works, stability results and functional versions of this. Okay, so this is for the maximum. For the minimum, it is an open problem. And the conjecture is that that is attained at the L1 ball, at the L infinity ball. This is a smaller conjecture. There is a lot of There is a lot of work on this problem, as you know. A lot of this work is made by people who are here, but let me recall it very quickly. So the result is true for N equals 2. For N equals 3, it was proved last year by Ridia and Civata, and there is a shorter proof by Fraici, who are major Rodland, Pesello, and Artem. And starting from the emission 4, it is open. It is open, but it is known that the result holds for convex sets satisfying particular which belong to some families. So for instance, it is not that it holds for unconditional bodies, or even if you are close enough to an unconditional body, or if you're it is not that you have a body with some positive curvature, then it cannot be a minimizer, it is not for zonoid. It is not for zonoids, for hyperplane sections of polytops or LP balls. Also, if your body has many hyperplane symmetries or it is a polytope with not too many vertices, then in all these cases the result is true. Let me highlight also a very important result, which is the full game minimum inequality, which says somehow that the inequality holds up to a constant independent dimension. Up to a constant independent dimensions, and there are also very interesting works improving the constant and finding a transitive proof. It is also known that it follows from apparently a related conjecture in symplectic geometry, which is Viterbo conjecture, and there are something else, yes, functional forms of the inequality. So, a lot of results on this. Okay, so now let's. Okay, so now let me come back to our setting. Okay, before that, before that. Among all the techniques that are useful for proving results for the Malay conjecture, let me highlight the one of SALDO systems, because we are going to take advantage of that. So let me recall what a SALDO system is. Essentially, you have a convex body here, and we will fix a direction, which is given. Direction, which is given by this theta, and we will move some of the points of our set, which are the ones in this base, in that direction. So in this picture, our base is just this point, and we're moving the point in this direction, which are certain velocity, which is given by this function. This is something which was introduced by Rogers and Sephard. By Projects and Sephard, which turns out to be extremely useful for studying several problems in convex symmetry. So, for instance, you can see steiner symmetrization as a particular case of SALDO system. And in particular, it's very useful for studying the volume protein. And the reason is this result of Campi and Granci, which was proved in this non-symmetric case by Major and Reisner, which is that the function given the That the function given the inverse of the volume of the polar of the solar system is complex. And this is very useful because in some cases the solar system that we construct is a volume affine. This function is affine. Which means that the volume prod is going to be the prod of an affine function and the inverse of a convex function. So it is going to be a quasi-concrete function. So in particular, for So, in particular, for any interval, the minimum is attained at the extremes of the interval. So, that's a very useful technique and provides very nice results. So, now let me come back to our setting with metric spaces. So, we define the volume product of a metric space as the product of the volume of the Liechtief space and its The Lichieff space and its polar, which is the ball of the space of Lichie functions. This is an isometric invariant of the metric space because any isometry of metric spaces corresponds to a linear isomorphism between the Lichieff spaces. So we have a well-defined quantity here. Um for instance, one of the questions that we would like to to solve is whether Mahler conjecture holds for this particular class of polytopes or not. Molytopes or not. We have direct proof of the three-dimensional case, corresponding species of four points, which do not use the proof of Eurigian Cibata. But starting from dimension 3, the combinatorics became more complicated. We can still take advantage of some of the things which are known for convex polytopes. So, for instance, in the case in which you So for instance, in the case in which geometric space embeds into a tree, you know that the whole of the space of Lichi functions is a zonoid, and then this holds, and so on. But in general, we don't know how to prove the inequality, but we can still say some things. What we can say is that if you assume, moreover, that at the minimum the ball is a simplicial polytope, then geometric Then geometric space has to be a tree. So the Lichief space is a cross-polytope. The polytope associated is a cross-polytope and you have the equality here. But you have to add this extra assumption. So the proof of this is particularly simple. So let me show that to you just to show how we are applying the SALDO system technique. So what we do. So, what we do is the following. We have our graph of our medical space, which may be something like this. We focus on one of the edges, which is this ij. And then remember that this corresponds to a vertex of the polypers. So, we denote m ij, the associated vertex. And now what we do is that And now, what we do is that we are going to replace the weight that we have here by something close, which is going to be the same but divided by 1 plus t. So we can do that, and if t is small enough, we still have something here which corresponds to a metric space. And we are not only changing, again, the distance between these two points, but maybe some other distances which maybe they are defined. Which maybe they are defined in terms of this one. So, this is important because at the beginning we were trying to do the same, just changing one of the tenses in the metric space, but that destroys the structure of the polytope that we have here. But the graph diagram turned out to be very useful for this. Okay, so we do that. And then what we have is another metric space whose diagram is exactly the same as the one that we had before with the same edges. Had before with the same edges, but we are changing one of the weights. So that means that the polytope associated to our new metric space is going to have exactly the same vertices as the one before, because we have the same edges, but one that we are moving a little bit. So we have the same vertices as before, but now in this one we will have this divided by 1 plus t. So we have 1 plus t. By 1 plus T, so we have 1 plus T times the vertex that we have. So we have a SALO system here. We have a SALO system based on the vertices of the polytope, where we are just moving one of them the opposite. And moreover, since we are assuming that our ball is a simplicity polytope, this other system is volume fine. And then we can use And then we can use a result by Faralici, Meyer, and Slavic, which is based on the properties of the solar systems that I mentioned before, and which tells you that your polytope has to be a double cone with that apex. But we are doing this for any edge in your graph. So we get that the polytope is a double hole relative to each one of the vertices, so it has to be a linear image of. Of U to the one, and that corresponds to a tree, which is what we want. Good. So then, as you know, one of the reasons why mallet conjecture is more complicated than Blastic Santa Monica is because you have several minimizers, you have higher polytopes. That is still the case for this particular setting. So we have studied for which metrics. Okay, so we have studied for which metric spaces the bulk uh of the Litchfield space is Hunter polytope. Okay, so let me recall here uh what is what a Hunter polytope is. Uh so a Hannibal polytope is the L1 or L infinity sum defined of this way of 100 polytopes of less dimension. So it is like L1 or L infinity sum of things which are like L1 or Sum of things which are like L1 or L infinity of small dimension. And these are the conjecture minimizers for the matter conjecture. So when is this polytope a higher polytope? So to show you when is the case, I need to introduce an operation between metric spaces, which is this sum. So given two metric spaces, Spaces, we can consider just their graph. We fix one of the points in each of the graph, and then we consider the metric space that we obtain if we just identify these two points. And then we obtain another graph here. So this is a particularly useful construction since the ball of the Lichief space is the L1 sum of the balls. Of the volts of each one of them. And we use this fact to prove that you have a higher polytop precisely when your metric space can be expressed in this way when each one of the polytopes which, sorry, each one of the metric spaces which appear here are of this form. So the idea to prove this result is that we characterize when a Lichfield space can be decomposed as an L1 sum and it is. Composed as an L1 sum, and it is precisely in this case. And we characterize when it can be decomposed as an L infinity sum, and it's precisely in this case. So, you mean everything we get, this characterization. And just let me say one more thing, which is that for in this setting, it's also interesting to know what happens with the maximum of the volume product. Because we have a certain family of polytopes, and the maximum is going to be something which is smaller than the Smaller than the inequality given by Blasque Santalo. For the case n equals 2, you can just do the computation directly and you obtain that the maximum is attained at a complete graph with equal weights. That makes sense because recall that the minimum somehow corresponds to a tree. So if you have a complete graph, then it makes sense that you have something which lager volume product. Something which lagger volume prod. Then you can wonder if the same happens for lagger dimension. It turns out that the answer is yes and no, because we proved that the maximum is attained at some metric space where all triangular inequalities are strict. So the graph is a complete graph. But however, we also prove that the maximum is attained at some metric space such that this polytop is implicit. And starting from dimension 3, the complete drug with equal weights does not correspond to as implicit quality. Indeed, in dimension 3, you get something like this. So you have here a face with four vertices, so this is not simplicity. So the maximum is attained at some other complete graph with different weights. To prove this, what we did was again to construct a What we did was again to construct a solo system. So, if you assume that you have equality here, that means that in your ponyto, you are going to have one of these points which is not a vertex. And then you can again change your distance a bit to push this forward and compute what is the volume of the polytope that you have and the volume of the polar, and you will get a contradiction. And to prove this, we use argument based on a paper by Alexander Freiliczi and A paper by Alexander Failici and Svavic, where they prove that the maximum of the volume prod among polytopes with the same number of vertices is attained as in Piscal polytope. And again, using that techniques and making sure that you are considered a polytope associated to matrix space, you can prove the result. And that's all. Thank you for your attention. Questions, please? Okay, no questions. Let's thank the speaker again. We'll resume in 35 minutes. Hopefully, I don't think this is time to have it.
