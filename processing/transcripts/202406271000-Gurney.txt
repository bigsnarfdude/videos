Prismatic stacky stuff kind of really took off. I got sort of interested in thinking about those things. One of my other interests is, let's say, vid vectors, kind of big vid vectors. And I wanted to sort of see whether the sort of the piadic sort of prismatic stuff of Bartler and Drundpal could sort of work over the integer. And it does. Um, and it does, and um, at the end of the day, it's sort of not really that kind of um hard. And so, yeah, I think that the main point of the talk today I want to give is somehow not really that sort of construction, but to sort of talk about the sort of the stacky kind of methods of building cohomology theories, because I really just think they're fantastic. They're so robust and. They're so robust and powerful, and I think that somehow they're really only going to do amazing things for us. So, yeah, so hopefully, I'll sort of convince you of that and sort of give you examples along the way. So, what's sort of the evaluation? Yeah, so we all sort of know the picture or more or less, right? So we take sort of the category of schemes, yeah, maybe a The category of schemes, yeah, maybe a reset. Yeah, there should be some, maybe some category of motives, you know, some linear thing. I'm not going to be specific about what this is. There should be, let's say, a functor here that sends some x over z to, well, it's modent. And somehow, this should be like a kind of universal sort of linearization of this category, sort of having some nice properties in the sense that. Yeah, in the sense that certain other kind of linear invariants associated to X kind of come from here like this. Here we'll go to H should mark X. Yeah, well question mark equals something like, you know, eladic, et al, ROM, crystalline. And various sort of other things. And where this notation says, okay, see question mark z. Yeah, this is some sort of category of coefficients, right? Yeah, some category that captures all of the structure that these invariants have. And actually, sort of the picture should be even better than this, right? We shouldn't just have sort of motives over Z. We should have sort of motives over anything. Motors ever or anything, and there should be a corresponding category of issues. Yeah. Okay. So I guess this original idea goes back to Grotendieg sort of years and years ago. And I think his original approach to kind of build this thing was to start with schemes and then somehow just force all of the things you want to be true to be true, right? He came up with this short list of things that needed to be checked. Of things that needed to be checked, whatever the standard conjectures, and it turned out that they were all sort of impossibly difficult. Right, so in the meantime, yeah, what happened? Basically, people sort of did their best to kind of understand sort of these things here, right, and how they're related. So, I guess I forgot to say that for different sort of things here, they're related. Um they're related, and those relations sort of come from the fact that they're really couple of states, yeah. So, okay, right, this is the idea. So, it's it's an old and maybe sort of also a new idea, let's say. Um, given that we don't know how to how to build these things here, um, maybe it's sort of better to really try to understand what's going on here. Uh, and I kind of was a bit vague about. And I kind of was a bit vague about what I wrote here because for some of these cohomology theories, it's kind of tricky to pin down exactly what these coefficients should be, right? I think, especially for crystalline cohomology, people were kind of really not sure what was going on for sort of quite some time. And the idea I want to talk about kind of solves that problem along with many others. Yeah. Yeah. And so this idea is basically to realize. There is basically to realize one of these funny things, you know, H should map over S as instead of functor like this, over S maps to the usual coherent cohomology of some stack like this. This the question mark where x where we have a functor from schemes over s into usually stacks over something question mark that sends x to question mark and I say sort of old and new idea I guess the the I mean, Berdig, when he was sort of thinking about Duram cohomology, more or less was doing this, except that sort of at that time, people didn't really know about, well, no, they didn't know about sex, but they didn't really use them very much. And so then also sort of Bert Lowe with crystalline cohomology. And then the new idea was really with Bart Lurie and Drunfold, where they applied this in the prismatic case to sort of spectacular. The prismatic case, the sort of spectacular success. It's also that's a sort of a placeholder symbol for maybe one of these, yeah? To somehow, the idea is to realize, you know, maybe Duram chromology as the quasi-current homology of some step. You know, Duram homology normally defined the Durham complex, right? Similarly, for crystalline or haladic or. Pistol or kaladic or prismatic, something like this. Yeah, I guess what the round is goes back to Simpson. Ah, sorry, yes. Exactly, yeah. So, so the first time something like this was used, yeah, was was definitely Simpson. He was the one who realized that some of, I mean, Gordon Deacon Bertolo was sort of working with kind of sort of simplicial teams, right? But they really just give rise to stacks, yeah, but nobody said that yet. Um, and then Simpson was the first one to say, let's just call this thing as. Was the first one to say, Let's just call this thing a step and use it like that. Okay, yeah, so I guess this was sort of actually the next bit in my notes. So yeah, so progression mark equals Durham, Mr. Simpson, and progression mark equals prismatic. Now I got syntomic, it's sort of bad lurry. Okay, right. So, how does this picture work? You need to, if you want to do this, you need to sort of understand what are functors from sort of schemes into stacks, right? How do they work and how do you construct them? Because it looks like it's going to be sort of hard work, right? I mean, associating sort of new schemes to old schemes in a way that gives their posse current chromology really interesting structures sounds like it should be. Sounds like it should be very difficult, but in practice, it's sort of not so hard, right? So you expect this tags to be different for each homology period as you for DRAM we have one, etc. etc. Or we are going towards the motivating. Yeah, I mean, I think that I think the goal in the end is that this thing here should be at this point, yeah, and then. And then all of these other stacks here, right? They should map to this one. And these things are just pullback functions. And yeah, this is not an idea, sort of, due to me. I mean, there's sort of this kind of like this plane of cohomology theories, right? I guess you'll give this ICM address. And sort of that's sort of where they all live. And the various loci in there kind of correspond to the different ones, right? The diagonal is the Durham. And so sort of restriction, I'll pull back to that if you sort of these. Gives you sort of these, yeah. Yeah, so I'll say a little bit more about that in about two minutes. Okay, so how does all this functorial stuff work? Okay, so and B here stands for a base, right? And those C's are coefficient. So say you have a functor from, let's say, just affine schemes into stack servers, something. I'm going to write. Stack server, something. I'm going to write sigma here. So, this is a notation Drundfeld used for a specific stack, but there's now multiple notations for this thing, and I would just like something that kind of corresponds to that. So, this is not Drinfeld sigma. This is just some random base scheme or stack. Right, so say I have a functor like this, but some my x over s to, again, here my some expression mach over sigma. Question mark ever sigma. Yeah, then I get my cohomology theory. Let me see. And I get my cohomology theory like this. And okay, yeah, it looks like this is kind of a hard thing to do, but in practice, if you make some assumptions on these functions here, you can kind of cut down exactly what you need to do, right? So if you assume that this functor here is limit preserving, right? And so we'll sort of strictly be careful here. You might want to put something here with stacks, right? So that this sort of really makes sense. Sense yeah, so if I assume that this thing is limit preserving, then inside here, right, I have this gadget GA over S, yeah. And what is this? Well, this is a B algebra scheme, right? So it's a ring scheme that. Scheme, right? So it's a ring scheme that has a B-algebra structure. If I have some functor which preserves limits, it's going to preserve that structure. So if I take my functor here and evaluate it on GA, what do I get? I'm going to get a B algebra object in stacks over C. And then the observation is that And the observation is that, in fact, this category here, right, affine schemes over S, is built out of GA using limits and sort of maps between GA that are built using the ring structure. So that, in fact, this functor here is an equivalent. So, okay, we're restricting to the affine case here, but it says, okay, to give a limit-preserving functor like this, all I need to do is give... All I need to do is give some B algebra stack over completely. So it's kind of cut down the amount of what you need to do sort of substantially. Okay. Right. Yeah, that was sort of the first point. The second one is that in many cases, or in some important cases, this whole kind of stack. This whole kind of stacky approach can be sort of recovered solely from the cohomology, right? So for R equals prismatic, like this, you can recover this factor just from the chromology. So for star is equal to, I think crystalline this is a result by Mundel and for star equals prismatic, this is not again but so you might think this is somehow like complicating the situation quite a bit but it turns out actually for a lot of these cohomology theories they already contain actually all of this stuff anyway so it's somehow you actually get it for free. Ah, you actually get it for free. Yeah? Okay. So there was the third point here that I guess was related to that question before. So say you had two of these functors like this, right? So maybe you have two cohomology theories over two different sigmas. So they're going to be one. So I have two cohomology theories, right? I have two B algebra stacks one lightning bulb. Yeah, and imagine I have a Cartesian square here, right? So when I pull this one back along this map, I get this lightning. If I pull this map here, see, right, what this tells me. Right, what this tells me is that I immediately get a comparison map on these two different cohomology theories, right? This question mark one and this and this sort of lightning mode one. Yeah, and this winds up just being sort of base change for cohomology. So I got some map, maybe see up a star. H. Question mark. Yeah. H. And generally, this will be an isomorphism. Yeah, if this square is Cartesian. So, this is sort of related to that question about, you know, do you expect different stacks for different cohomology theories, right? So, if these cohomology theories are related, then somehow the associated stacks and stuff should be as well. And actually, this is kind of the point I really want to emphasize: it's not just sort of comparison theorems that you can do here. So, if you start here and then sort of pull back, I get a comparison theorem. Actually, if you start here and try to extend this way, you can generalize your cohomology theories, right? So if I have one already and I kind of want to make it more interesting or something, all I need to do is somehow find some new sigma and some B algebra stack of it. Some B algebra stack over this that pulls back to this. Right. Okay, so that's kind of the sort of functorial picture that I wanted to talk about. It sort of looks a bit heavy, but I don't know. I just think it's somehow fantastic. I'm packing one. That's about like animation. Like animation, yeah, essentially, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's just yeah, this is this is essentially just animation, yeah. So, I think this fact here, so things like this, uh, yeah, this business here sort of says that your cohomology theory is sort of more or less going to be derived, right, in some sense, um, that that somehow the cohomology of anything is sort of going to be built out of the cohomology of the affine line, right? So, for cohomology theories with the affine line. Right, so for cohomology theories where the affine line has no cohomology, something like this can't really work. So, in particular, like a latter cohomology. That's not to say that there isn't an approach. It's, I think, more to do with the point that somehow analytic homology, the way it's set up, right, the C analatic here is the wrong one at the moment. Yeah, somehow there should be a kind of different category of things. Kind of different category of things in which they live, right? But it's not sort of that one. So maybe along these lines, Peter Schulze gave a talk at the IHS, I think, in January about sort of things kind of related to this, sort of an even kind of higher categorification kind of thing. So kind of instead of sort of looking for functors like this, you can kind of look for functors that sort of associate instead of snacks, right? Really, they're sheets or somehow the other. right really their sheaves or so somehow the assignment that sort of sends s to the category sorry x to the category of quasi-current sheaves on x question mark yeah I mean if if if this is going to be true right that if it's a limit preserving so I've been a bit vague here there should be So I've been a bit vague here. There should be like, I really should put something here. Right, so this would be a stack of animated rings, and here we look through. But I've tried not to be sort of too heavy on the categorical stuff, because I think the ideas when you get down to sort of actually using these things are pretty simple and actually concrete. That's kind of what I want to want to explain. Right, yeah, okay. And then. Yeah, so this is just for affine things. Yeah, so yeah. I mean, in some sense, you can. I mean, every scheme is sort of a co-limit of affine ones, right? I mean, everything is a co-limit of affine things. But sort of whether it's going to be well-behaved will depend on particular properties of these functions, right? So you kind of want them to sort of maybe send. You kind of want them to sort of maybe send whatever, however, you kind of want to, however, algebraic you want to make your stacks, right? So, you know, you want to glue along atal maps or smooth maps or flat maps or whatever, like this thing should sort of behave well with respect to those. Yeah. And then extending to stacks or non-affine things is pretty strict. Right, yeah, okay. And then, yeah, there was this fourth point that I kind of half said there. Again, yeah, this problem with sort of coefficients, again, is sort of just solved. I mean, you really don't have a choice. This C question mark X just has to be the direct category of Cosy current sheaves on X question. And then all the functorial LED and everything. Functorial LED and everything you want just sort of comes along for free. Okay, so I've been saying this word B algebra stack a lot, but I imagine many of you here haven't sort of heard that thing, or you sort of think, what on earth is this? Well, that's kind of what I want to explain here, because it's really not that difficult. And the idea is that, so what is a stack, right? This is just a function to groupoids, right? So a B. Functor into groupoids. So a B algebra stack is really a functor into B algebras in groupoids. So what are such things? And these group points, these are just the normal one group points, right? So categories. So this thing here, there's going to be a forgetful functor down to B modules here in group voids. And these things I think you all should provide. And these things I think you all should yeah, so this is just the pool subcategory of the derived category of B modules of complexes with homologies only in degree zero and one. So in some sense, they're just maps of B modules. Right, so the underlying group void here has objects M and Google and the maps. Okay, so using this, any B-algebra groupoid sort of has an underlying complex, yeah. So you have some gadget in here. All right. The underlying complex looks like this, where C is a B algebra. B algebra, I is a C module, D is a C linear map, and then it satisfies the one extra condition, which is that D X D Y is equal to DX Y. Okay, so this is the sort of quasi-ideal condition. So what does this thing look like? So it's H0 is just C mod, the image of. So it's H0 is just C mod the image of I, and then it's sort of H1 is the kernel of D. These sort of groupoids, well, algebra ring groupoids of B algebra groupoids, they sort of just look like B algebra's mod sort of an ideal that sort of is not injective. And so if you want sort of 25 different sort of points of view on these sorts of things, Drinfeld has a paper on this on archive called something like in Google. Yeah, and so a notation for this thing here, sort of I guess following here, is sometimes okay, so this is what the objects look like. Of course, this thing, I guess, is a two category, so it's a bit hard to kind of say what the maps are. But if you have an honest sort of map, If you have an honest sort of map between two of these things, right? So from a C prime to a C and an I prime to an I, you get a map of those things. And that's sort of an equivalence in this category, you know, if it's an isomorphism on H0 and H1, right? Or an equivalence of the underlying group points. Okay. Yeah, so what are the examples? So obviously. So obviously, if I have any algebra, then I can just take this one here. This is just C viewed as a discrete group point. If I have some element T in C, I can just consider multiplication by T. So another name for this would just be intenser the x multiplies total b put a B, sort of just the derived reduction of C modular T as a B algebra. And in particular, let's say if T is equal to zero, we have this one here, which is the sort of square zero extension of C by our C in degree. Pardon? No, I don't think so. I mean, it needs to be a B linear map. Sorry, this only needs to be a C linear map. Yeah, no, it doesn't need to be in B. Ah, sorry. Yeah, wait, wait, error. X goes to T, X goes to beta. Makes sense to me better. Next in. Okay. Yeah, so this is what these things look like. They're not that tricky. And maybe I'll just say very quickly what the maps are, right? So if I have such a functor like this, sort of how does the inverse work? Well, let's say it sort of. Well, let's say it's sort of if I have such a V algebra stack here and I have an affine scheme here, how do I get something over this? Well, I take my affine thing mapping to this. I evaluate it here to get some B algebra, and then I take those points of my corresponding affine B scheme. So in the end of the day, what we need to understand is sort of maps from honest P algebras into these sort of The algebra is into these sort of group points. And I'll just say that really quickly because it is not that hard, right? So yeah, so the group point of maps like this is just a collection of is a diagram. Yeah, where the top is an extension of rings, so is the algebra. This is a ring homomorphism. And E acts on I via this map. So there's a natural notion of map between these two things, and that gives you the group weight of maps between these two guys. Okay, maybe that's enough. Yeah, so that's the discrete case, and then you just sort of cheat. Right, so some the algorithm stack here. Yeah, it just means that for every affine scheme spec R mapping to sigma, I've got my And these things are built the same way as these, but somehow just sort of using sheep. So the usual way to build this is just by taking a cone, right? Yeah, where C is now some sheaf of B algebras, I is a sheaf of C modules, D is a map sort of satisfying the condition here. Condition here. Okay. So, what are the examples? It's a really stupid one. This is not even really a stack. You could just take the constant ring scheme associated to B. One example. Another one. All these things are determined by what you do when you build a company. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, this is um so you you need to understand this p of evaluation here, let's say. Uh let my little eraser go yeah so exactly uh given um my gadget in here, right, according to this equivalence I'm supposed to Right, according to this equivalence, I'm supposed to get some functor. Yeah, so what is what is what is the associated functor do? Yeah, so if I have some x in affine schemes this affine schemes over b, right? I'm supposed to get some stack over this sigma. So some, let me just write it like this for sigma. For sigma. So, yeah, how is this thing defined? Well, if for every affine scheme, let's say mapping to sigma, so given some spec R mapping to sigma, what are the, I can just tell you what the r points of this stack is. So this is given by R. Written by on B A bit more suggestive to it. Right, so the R points of spec AB are sort of the maps from A into B are maps of B algebra. Yeah, yeah, and so the point is this thing here can be understood as literally just. Understood as usually just given by something like this, and that's why it's a stack because this thing here is a Yeah, okay, right. Let's get to some actual examples then. I think we're a bit short on time now. I think I'm going to be short on time now. Yeah, so my goal is hopefully to sort of make this a bit more nice and explicit and sort of a classical example, which was like what's completed Durham cohomology, and then sort of show how sort of from that and this kind of plane with diagrams, you can cook up a version of sort of Nyga. A version of sort of Nygaard completed homology over the end. So Hodge. Yeah, so in this case, B doesn't really need to be anything special. It's instead, so we can sort of forget about this B algebra structure. What's the Hodge cohomology? What's the Hodge cohomology of some X? So this is, I guess, a graded complex over I and Z. Not just the homology. Ah, no. Okay. I'm going to assume. An i here. So that just means in degree i. And here, also, I'm going to assume that x is secure. Okay, so how do you cook up this thing here? Mike, what's the associated ring stack? So this thing here lives in the derived category of graded Z modules. modules which geometrically is the category of positron sheaves on BGM. Okay, so realize this thing via this picture, you just need a ring stack over BGM, and it's going to be built pretty soon. So if I write my GA just as Z adjoint X, I'm going to define, so despite the notation, this is not a ring scheme, this is just the divided power envelope of zero and G. loop of zero in GA so xz x adjoin x to the n on n factorial all in so this thing here is a is a group scheme right but it's also actually a GA module scheme and I can sort of scale all of these by elements of GA and there's there's also a forgetful map here right I can somehow sort of just map x to x but I'm not going to X to X. But I'm not going to do that for the time being. I'm just going to consider a sort of stupid thing. So first, I need something of a BGM. These things live with respect set, so I need to give them GM action. So GM elect trivially here and elect in the obvious way here. And so what this does is it just sends me a gadget here for BGM, and then I take a map here. And then I take a map here like this, which is just zero. We call this thing GM. So this is the ring stack over BGM. And maybe I should sort of put a general notation here. So GA minus one, this is sort of the universal line bundle. Bg. You know, I viewed as a one-dimensional. VG. Yeah, I view it as a one-dimensional group speaker. Okay. DeWa? Yes, I mean, essentially, it's a grading thing that you essentially, yes. Yeah. Well, I mean, if I don't put this here, I have a graded module, and then I just let GM act on this by acting via the i-th power of the obvious one on this factor. Okay. Right, alrighty. I sort of have to hurry up here, I think. So, right, so what happens here? I'll just say quickly: you have this gadget here, it cooks you up a functor. What is sort of the hodgeck of some at least smooth scheme? Yeah, so using sort of the equivalence between these two things here, you'll see that if you have a map of these algebra stacks, you get a map of these functions, right? Get a map of these functors, right? So, GA hodge, right? This thing maps to GA over BGM, right? So, in other words, it's going to map to whatever the cohortology functor is corresponding to just the stupid GA over BGM. And that one is just base change, right? So, XHodge, let's say, maps to this thing here. Map C and then this map here. And then this map here, it realizes XHodge as just the classifying stack of the tangent bundle of X. And a horrible notation, yeah, but the classifying stack of the tangent bundle of X, so pervert B G M P X divided power envelope, yeah, and here again, twisted by. And then it's kind of a sort of classical theorem that the cohomology of this map here is given by the direct sum of these guys. So that if I want to go all the way down to Vgm, and then just take local section. Yeah, and then, okay, what are the coefficients? Yeah, so these things are equivalent, let's say. Or equivalent, let's say, to modules over the completed cotangent complex. So this thing living over x times gm. In other words, these are what I usually call nilpotent degraded nilpotent. Right, so I said there was this Durham homology thing, so I kind of wanted to give this as an example. As an example, so DRAM cohomology, where does it live? Yeah, so if I view it as having a, together with this object filtration, this just lives in filtered Z modules, yeah. And this is equivalent to the right category of A1 modules. Okay, so to kind of do this picture, right? Somehow the fact that the sort of graded of Durham is odd to correspond to the fact that there's some ring stack over here who's pulled back to DGM, is this X hard. So, somehow, what's the special property of So, somehow, what's the special property of this stack? Well, it's that this line bundle here sort of comes with a universal map with some t. And then this thing here is just the inclusion of the t equals zero logos. So completely just take this from my G angle. I think I'm missing a sharp. Oh, yes. Sorry. Oh yes, sorry. There is a universal map there, but yeah, you restrict to GH. Yeah, so I wrote GA Duram here, but actually this theory is not super well behaved in sort of certain loci here. And so if you're familiar with Duram chromology, there's somehow at some point you need some power series to converge and for that you need to put some properties and You need to put some properties. And one way to fix that, not the only way, is to just restrict to the locus where this t is nilpur. Okay, and then that's why this is called Hodge-completed Duram. Somehow that corresponds to completing with respect to the Hodge filtration. Okay, so that's that example. Maybe I'll just say in words that, right, what are the coefficients here? So of course. Here, right? So the quasi-coherent shape on this is a filtered B module, which is complete with respect to its filtration. Yeah, so how does this night go? My god, complete it. So, for this, we need, let's say, the big vid vectors. So, this is just a fine ring scheme of big vectors. Yeah, so in some sense, it's just infinite sequences of sort of elements of your ring, right? When I evaluated a ring, such that n indexed sequences such that shifting by multiplying by p gives me a Frobenius. It is a lift of the Frobenius. Sort of just have to rush a little bit here and say there are two sort of important exact sequences. Important exact sequences. So it maps down to GA, and that's a ring homomorphism. And then, more importantly, what I want to do, there's a map from GA sharp into W. And in fact, it's a monomorphism. It's sort of the, let's say, the first ghost component. So W is, it's the universal scheme with a map to GM that has lists of Frobenia. As a list of Rubinias, as a Delta stuff. Yeah. I write it as a list of easier way. Yeah, okay. So W maps here anymore. Yeah, but index by N, this is multiplicative, right? So for Benius looks for all prime, yeah, and they can use right, it picks out the first one. Yeah, so you sort of have the shift map corresponding to multiple. The shift map corresponding to multiplying by p, and that induces a map here of fp. And here it lists the p. This map is in general not injective, but somehow this is enough to tell you what this guy is. Okay. So then there's this funny map here. And well, what is it? So this thing is, in fact, just the intersection of the kernels of all of these Habenius maps. Yeah, so somehow. Yeah, so somehow you would think about them as sort of things here, which somehow are zero everywhere except the component of one. Okay. How long do I have? Should be all right. Yeah, so what's the point? So we have this sort of a funny ring stack. Right, and I have this sort of map here, yeah, and I should say that the composition of this with the ghost map is the natural one, right? So in fact, I can let Gm act again on here and tribally on the W, and I'm actually gonna get then a map from GA. Then a map from GA of minus one into w. And if I just put the ghost map here, this diagram commutes. And in fact, you could take the current here and you will get some ring scheme, but it wouldn't be, let's say, super interesting. But the point is, if I take direct sum here, Direct sum here of this thing with this ideal, and map them in just by adding this diagram here turns out to be Cartesian. And so moreover, this map is surjective. So it says that the ring stack here is quasi-isomorphic or equivalent to this one here. So this gives somehow a presentation of this GA Duram in terms of sort of it. GA DIRAM in terms of sort of bit vector. And this is sort of one of the key things with, let's say, working with these ring stacks rather than something like sheaves of rings, is that if you somehow different presentations of these things often give you sort of novel ways of sort of generalizing them. You said this, but you're saying that a whole nother topic is different. Yeah, yeah. So exactly. Exactly, yeah. So I don't know. Maybe I should put an arrow here, but this is an equipment. Yeah. Yeah, and so this is sort of, I mean, most of this stuff was sort of all done for sort of p-typical vid vectors by Drundfeld and Baden Lubers and how much I spent a long time trying to do it for the big bit vectors. And I sort of, I found a way to kind of do it that was sort of tricky, but then it's sort of the more and more I thought about it. But then it sort of the more and more I thought about it, somehow the easier and more trivial it got. So I don't want to take a huge amount of credit yet. Yeah, so somehow this observation I think was due to Druinfeld. And then he was the one that sort of figured out how you sort of generalize these. I mean in the p-typical case, but P-typical case, but just take the same thing. So I have some scheme with thet, and right, then I can have, we can form wt. This is just the vid vectors are a ring m over t. Then a sheaf of wt modules m over t is called Is called admissible. Yeah, probably one of the one of those sort of illegal math words. If you can do the following, right? So if it fits into a sort of exact sequence like this, where what? Where PM is. Pm is, well, so they're all WT modules. And then I'll sort of explain really what they are, where Pm is locally isomorphic to W1. There was this thing here. And where M0, right, this thing is a, well, this thing is locally isomorphic to GA. So in other words, it's sort of, it's a line bundle. And so then this sharp just means take the divided power. this sharp just means take the divided power envelope like this and and w acts on that sort of w acts on that via sort of the way it acts so that's admissible it's a kind of totally random thing sort of looking let's say um but one of the points is that this this m0 and this pm they're functorial in m right so if such a sequence exists it's essentially unique uh so so So that's kind of a sort of really important property of these things. So the two examples, right, let's say, would be, it's the quotient of W by GH. So these, and they are all smooth. W1 is a smooth group scheme. Yeah, right. So, W is one of these, right? Because, yeah, here M, I just take W. This is W1, and this is the trivial example. Yeah, but then if I have sort of, I can also take like the split ones, let's say, right? So I can take some P and direct sum out with some V sharp zero. Okay, so it's kind of two cases: the sort of the split case and sort of the invertible case. Okay. So then the main definition, I guess, is this thing here. So the base for this sort of Nygot-completed homology. got completed homology is the stack we just now got hats whose t points is just the groupoid of maps like this where m is admissible yeah Yeah. And the induced map G0 goes from M zero into well the zero of this which is GA nil potenti. Yeah, so it's a kind of simple definition. I mean, these things maybe look, they definitely look a bit dry and sort of mean. Meaningless, I would sort of say. But yeah, that sort of this is a kind of sort of simple definition. And if you're familiar with sort of the sort of the nygat snacks of Bad and Luri, if I piatically complete this, I don't get their nygat stack, but you do get the nygat completion of it. Sorry, I'm a little confused here. If you need this, don't you get the steeple? Don't you get the usual prismatic homology, not the negro? Yeah, so okay, let me let me say, where do I want to put it? I think I didn't say here, is there what? How much time do I have? Any oh, great, okay. Yeah, so then I can sort of take the time to erase this. Yeah, so what are the loci in here, right? So if we want to think about, you know, so okay, so we have the Yes, okay, so we have the excuse me. I didn't say what the ring stack was. So, of course, then this thing here.hat, yeah, this is the ring stack associated to the universal gadget mapping to W. Okay. Yeah, so then you get this sort of nigh God completed theory. And so, yeah, what does it look like? So, let's sort of. Yeah, let me say something and then we'll see if it resolves it. If it doesn't, then let's say, yeah. So you can define, well, this is sort of something that I was thinking about sort of before. Well, we were. What we would call maybe PRISM. So, this is the locus where this module M is actually locally isomorphic to W, right? It's an invertible W module, right? So, this is where M is locally isomorphic to W. Meaning that this split stuff never happens. Yeah, so this is somehow the integral version of prismatic. Uh-huh. Right. Right. Well, I mean, it doesn't, I mean, prismatic homology is sort of over, I mean, over spoof ZP Prism, right? There's no. Yeah, actually, yeah, give me a second here. No, no, I mean, not nigga complete. I mean, when I pull back the nigga complete thing, I just get the usual cosmetic homology. Yeah. Okay. Losing my train of thought here a little bit. So, I also want to say it's been like a year since I've thought about this stuff. So, the only other thing, and maybe you guys sort of know the name for this that I want to say, and then maybe I'll end. So, yeah, so this map here gives you a map to A1 mod. Here gives you a map to A1 mod G and you can water. Yeah, that's C0. Yeah, and by definition, we also have a map like this, corresponding to sort of this thing here is admissible, so it gives me something over this A1 hat. Yeah, and so the pullback of this sort of Yeah, and so the pullback of this sort of Nygard completed thing to here is sort of the Hodge completed. Yeah, and this map here is the identity. So yeah, one thing I guess I'll say is that all of these maps here are isomorphisms over Q. Yeah, so somehow on the generic fiber, you just get Durham co-molecular. Somehow nothing special happens there. But I think something should, this is like, I've asked this question to lots. I've asked this question to lots of people. You know, there should be some real crystalline cohomology that there's something missing here. I mean, and probably this analytic stack stuff will either solve it or maybe has already solved. Okay, right. So I didn't diagram here. Yeah, so I can pull back here along this divisor, yeah, to get sort of. There, you know, to get sort of, I guess, whatever is the graded associated to nygard homology. I don't know what that is. Does this thing? Oh, no. It's not, it does not have a name, yeah. So exactly. Yeah, I don't so maybe, yeah, so let's sort of do a picture here. So, so So if I yeah, right, so I have this divisor here, and let me put this guy in here. Sorry, there's this thing. The intersection of this with this is this, right? So this is a divisor in this prismatization. It's this sort of prismatic divisor. And this thing, as in the peonic case, is isomorphic to BGM SHA. This thing here, yeah, is given by, I think also the one with taking, it's a funny kind of construction, yeah, so I take ga minus one, it is ga minus one mod ga minus one char. Yeah, so this is the gadget that lives over pga. And this is a certain locus in here. This map is not a finite type, but it's sort of weakly eta, sort of an infinite intersection of urban space. And I tried for a long time to kind of understand like what Cosico achieves on this thing were, because in the Piano phase, it has like a really simple description, right, in terms of these SEN operators. But if you work over Z, the Cartier dual of this thing is like much nastier, and so it's quite difficult. Here, and so it's quite difficult to describe. Yeah, so let me end on this. But the point is: this one here, positive shapes on this thing here are easy to describe. So please take quickly. So this is equivalent to, I think, the graded arrangement category. Essentially, of the vinyl algebra, where x has degree one and dx has degree minus one, but it's those objects which are sort of whose underlying sort of dx module is complete. So, this is the kind of nice description. And then, so I think it goes like this. So then this thing here just corresponds to those where x is invariable. Finally gave me extra yeah okay I think I'm sort of out of time. I'll just sort of end by saying that I kind of hope I convince you that this is like a really powerful and kind of fun thing to do sometimes. And kind of fun thing to do sometimes. And but yeah, somehow playing around with pullback squares and this sort of stuff doesn't really take much work. But yeah, I'll be able to do it. You can also let me just grab some water, but you can if you take X Nygard here, say the question again. Well, yeah, so I uh what is it? I mean, you would sort of so yeah, so so what's the point? So like what do you get? I don't have a I mean I never really found a nice description of this category. I mean I don't think it even has a super nice does it have a nice description in the yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean, so, so, yeah, I mean, you sort of, I mean, I would say it this way. Yeah, so if I, if I, if I go to Q, right, if I go to the generic fiber, this map is an isomorphism. So, so statements about stacks just become statements about homology, right? So, if I tensor with Q, I just get Hodge-completed Duram. If I take the P-adic completion, I will get Nygod-completed presentation. Uh, Nygard completed prismatic common. That's sort of what it's saying. Yeah, so it's somehow, I guess, it sort of glues them together. I mean, and yeah, maybe there is sort of a some fracture kind of square way of doing this sort of thing, but um, I'm not really sure. I mean, one thing I like is, I mean, these presentations are in some sense explicit. Yeah, I thought, I thought it covered but at least yeah, so exactly. I mean, that was why I started thinking about this because it was like, well. Was why I started thinking about this because it was like, what about a year or more ago? Where you sort of asked me, yeah, so if you take in the piadic case, whatever, you have sort of spook ZP, maybe we'll just put it nine, yeah, completed. So you can you can take sort of the nygat hat, so I can take the cohomology here. So, I can take the cohomology here and then push it forward. And then you get this sort of a, you get a filtered complex of gadgets, right? Which I think they call ill, my God, maybe of X lift here, yeah. These are these so-called sort of absolute, there should be a one here. These are these sort of absolute prismatic. Sort of absolute prismatic complexes, right? And then so they live over zp, but okay, you can do it for all primes p and then over q you can sort of look at sort of Durant cohomology and you can sort of you can form one of these fracture squares and sort of take a pullback. And then you get something that they define, the global absolute whatever, Naiga complete complexes. And yes, if you do the same thing here, that's what you get. As in us. I mean, let's say I take X nygod here. So I take its nygod cohomology. So I take the cohomology along here. This gives me a filtered complex of abelian groups. Whose piadic gives me some filtered complex of abelian groups. Some filter complex of abelian groups, which corresponds to one which was defined by R and Bar, I mean, is the same now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, so I didn't mention that sort of thing, but exactly. And that's one of the reasons you have to sort of restrict to this complete locus is because you don't need to. You can kind of cook up other versions of this, but maintaining sort of good cohortological Maintaining set of good cohortical properties is trickier when you're over the integers. Yeah, I mean, of course, like the Nygat stuff that they did is sort of not really the end of the story. I mean, it's the syntomic stuff, which is really like amazing. And you can sort of see that, I mean, if you sort of complete along this nygard thing, syntomic is sort of gotten by sort of gluing two open things. Of gotten by sort of gluing two open things together. Once you complete here, you just remove one of those open. So there's no gluing to be done. Yeah, you can kind of faff around by sort of like P-completing things and whatever, but it just doesn't feel natural. So, yeah. There is no kind of a I mean, I think you could try to do it, but I just don't think you will get something really interesting. I mean, for instance, like, what are you supposed to get over Q, right? To get over Q, right? So, if you get what I mean, so you know, you have sort of like all of these, like you have like syntomic homology groups, right? The pietic syntomic homology groups. What are the ones over Q? That's all it's supposed to be? I mean, what about this like this delink? I mean. No, it doesn't feel. I mean, okay, but what about like? No, it doesn't feel, I mean, okay, but what about like sort of this, like the balance, the delinquent? Like, where does that show up, right? Yeah, so that's what I mean. I mean, let's say my feeling is that if you stay in the land of algebra, right, algebraic stuff, you're not going to get that far, further than this. Do you have like an integral visual design operator? Yeah, it comes out of this, right? Like, uh, I mean, uh, yeah, so it's here, right? So, what is this thing? This is some graded module, right? The X has degree one, minus one. So, so it identifies all of the things. So, actually, you just have a module together with a collection of operators, right? Of operators, right? But the operators, but the sort of operators are different, right? So, somehow to do with the fact that x and dx don't commute. And then I think I worked this out at some point, that you, I think if you define theta to be equal to x. To x dx, let me do it like this: x dx, whatever. I'll just so keeping the graded thing, if I define a theta i to be this on the i graded part, then once I identify them all, these things sort of are all compatible, and then you get a theta. I think, like that's it's the formula similar to that. No other questions one more time. Let's take a five-minute break and start at
