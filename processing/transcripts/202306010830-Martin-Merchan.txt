Okay, so welcome everyone. Let's start today's session. So we have Nathia Malcolm at Tan. Telling us about possible properties of two-pack products and manifolds from compact protein safety groups. Have you heard? Thank you very much for the introduction and for the invitation here. For the invitation here. Today I'm gonna show or explain how compact quotient library groups can help us understand some topological properties of closed d2 manifolds. So the very broad question is how can we distinguish between closed d2 manifolds that admit a metric with holonomy V two from those that don't? That don't and well, that's a broad question, and a way of thinking about that is by comparison with other geometries, namely almost Keller ones, because there we have like a similar dichotomy, namely the distinction between Keller and syntactic manifolds. So I'm gonna like focus on small properties. First of all, Properties. First of all, I'm gonna discuss a little bit formality. I will introduce that notion later, but let me explain a little bit some results that we have there. So first of all, formality is a property that comes from rational automotive theory, and it was a little bit surprising that it was related. With surprising that it was related to geometry, and we have this theorem from the links, Liffitz, Morgan, and Sullivan that state that compact Keller manifolds are framed. The proof of this theorem uses the Delaware Leno, but although selected manifolds don't satisfy this, some people started thinking that People started thinking that compact symplectic manifolds should also have this property. But this was the so-called formalizing tendency of symplectic manifolds and it was shown to be false in dimension greater or equal than eight. And for lower dimension, that is somehow trivial and it's a consequence of the dimension and not. The dimension and not the existence of a syntactic structure. So now we go to the deto case. And if the answer is the last line of the question book, yes or no? Dimension is greater than 8. Okay, if the dimension is equal than 8, the answer is no. And yeah, in dimension real. In dimension reality called an 8, these two guys proved that conjecture, and for dimension at least of the proof of construction, yeah. So in the Alonomi G2 case, well, we still don't know if alonomi G2 manifolds are formal or not. There is what is formal? What do you mean by formal? I went it's a rational motob theory and yeah if you wait seven minutes I guess okay so it's still an open question and there is a theorem of Chankali Janis and Sun that prove like a weak property that I will also explain later and some people Some people have proved that certain jurisdiction manifolds are formal and also manifolds, the digital manifolds constructed with first and second very number vanishing are formal due to the necessary resources. So, in analogy with the so-called formalizing tendency of syntactic manifolds, we can pose the question if as simply connected If a simply connected compact with manifolds form, I don't expect that, but there is still any construction. So what I'm going to present is like a weaker result, namely if we replace simply connectedness by first very number equal one, this does equal two. And this will be a part of my talk. And in the second part, And in the second part, I will focus on very numbers. It's very well known that compact symplectic manifolds have even very non-vanishing even very numbers. And of course, compact manifolds with holonomy D2 have a non-vanishing feminine number because the free form is harmonic. In the compact case, In the combat case. So, but it's still not clear if the third body number of a closed-ditch manifold should vanish or not. And if a manifold admitted a closed-dit structure and a third vanishing very number, this structure should be a set. So, the question is: could a compact manifold meet an esodicity structure? So, So, well, an example that could make that question more interesting might be the case of the semi-sphere, because in that case, we could install the system. So, along these lines, I'm going to present theorem, which is a unit work between Alfino and Alberto Garfel. And we are proving the following. are proving the following if there is system such as such as structure the manifold well it cannot be on the following form the manifold can't be like a compact portion of a higher and the digital structure can't be left to environment so that's our first step but of course it's not going to to understand really that that question Good question. So, as I said, I'm gonna present these experience, but of course, I should do an introduction to tell you what formality is more precisely, and also to fix some notation on portions of lyrics. So, as I said, this notion of beauty will work. This notion appears when we want to study the torso three parts of higher homotopy groups. These are the so-called rational homotopy groups. And main ideas are the following. First of all, we have this foundational theorem of Sullivan that said that the well really implies that if you have a simply connected manifold, then the rational homotopy groups are determined by something algorithmic. mean by something algebraic, which is the rational minimal model of the manifold. And this depends on the RAM algebra, as we are going to see in a minute. But let me shift from rational to real numbers because for manifolds they are more convenient and also because we have the same particular train. So the real So the real minimal model consists of a differential complex that I call A for the algebra and B for the differential. That as I said before is constructed from the Ram algebra and together with an homomorphism from the differential complex the Ram algebra. That is it connects with the differential and it has some properties that I'm explaining. That I'm explaining on. Okay, the differential complex should be minimal, and that stands for two properties. The algebra should be like the free. That means that is the stereo algebra of a rabid vector space. And the differential should be decomposable, which means that there exist generators, an ordered set of An ordered set of generators ordered in terms of degree, such that the differential of each element lies on the subalgebra spanned by the previous generators. And the homomorphism rule should be aquasisomorphism, which stands for inducing isomorphisms in commodity. Because you know, if the homomorphism communicates with friends. Homomorphism communicate the differential, you can use a map, and so on. So, the idea of that rational minimal model is that it should be like the simplest differential algebra that includes the same hormonality as the random algebra. And here I present That's an easy example of that. Yeah. Let me construct the easiest example. So Etorus here you can do it as RN over C D with coordinates x1 to xn so one can define this the algebra as spanned by any By n elements of dv1, namely e1 to n, and the differential is zero. So that satisfies the condition figure, and then the homomorphism should be that that sense every element ek. Ek to the differential of xk and that's how we can see also so the notion of formality, maybe the definition is a little bit more obscure, but let me pause it. I have talked about the real minimum model of a manifold, and it's really a model for the round manager. And in the same way, you can find minimal models for every differential complex that you want. And if the degree COVID coincides with charge, these are unique up to isomorphism. So you can think also of the homology algebra as being like a differential complex with all the differential in function. So what we are asking is that the minimal model of the manifold coincides with the minimal model of the homology ID. Yeah. D equals zero on the bottom omega f. I don't want it. Yeah, that's always yeah, that so. Yeah. Are you claiming that after each collab is being claimed automatically the overall future is a quasi-service? I'm saying that a manifold is formal if there is a quasi-reason of the if there isn't, we call it formal, but Call it formal, but it doesn't have to. Later, we'll see some examples of non-formal markets. Yeah, so if I'm an importance of that notion is that normally the higher motor peak groups are determined by this algebraite object, which is the minimal model of X, which is determined by the Ramadan. Which is determined by the thermal algebra. And for manifolds, all the information is encoded in the homology algebra, which is way simpler than the grammar. Yeah, it's okay. And then there is this weaker notion of n almost formal, which is posed in a different way on the paper, but here we rewrite it. A manifold is almost formal if there exists a Gaussian isomorphism from the minimal model of the manifold to another differential complex that doesn't have all the differential punishing. Have all the differential punishing, but almost all of them. That's why they are called almost formal. And the degree that it's chosen there is degree 3. So all the differential vanishing is that, well, degree 3. So why degree 3? Is that just because you're doing 3 for something? It's because of the dimension of the one plane. The first seven ways. The first seven manifold statements. Yeah, in the paper, I think that I don't know, you can maybe explain that better than me, but we only introduced it for seven dimensions, but I imagine you can define something for it's probably always half the dimension, half the per column, quite a smaller. Um I checking formality sometimes is hard, but there are some well non-formality is hard but there are some obstructions for formality and these abstractions are the so-called triple mase products. So I'm gonna give the definition because we are using them later. So we start with three commodity classes. Start with three comology classes and the product of two sexic elements, namely psi1 with psi two and psi two with psi three should vanish in the morning. Representatives of the products are exact. And under these answer titans, we say the triple massive product of those classes is well defined. Here I'm introducing annotation that is you have Notation that is, you have a pure element of some degree, you just multiply the element by its degree and you underline. And well, and now to define a triple massive product, we have to first define a defining system for a triple massive product. And for them, You have to pick five elements. The first three, A1, 2, and 3, are close elements that represent the cohomology classes Psi1, Psi2, and Psi3. And then we have A1, 2 and A23, which are like the antiderivatives of the product of A1 and A2 up to a sign, and also Also H183 again as under that conditions we can hook up this formula and this class is a closed form. It's not difficult to see because like the differential of A1 times A23 is A1 times A2A3 and here it's always up to a certain Here is always up to a sign, and the same thing goes for the other. And the signs were defined in order for this form to value. So that's a closed form. So the triple-massive product is the set of all chromology classes that we can define using that formula when we take into account all the finances. Account all the file systems. And we say that the triple massive product vanishes whenever we can find the zero homology class in that set. And as I said before, those are obstruction to formality because every triple mass product vanishes on a formal manifold and they are Formal manifold, and they are also abstraction to almost formality because all of them vanish except perhaps those which satisfy the following condition. The sum of the degrees of psi 1 and psi 2 and also the sum of the degrees of psi 2 and psi 3 should be to be so formal implies that massive products vanish, but it's not. Vanish, but it's not the converse is not true, yeah. For almost formality, also, because when we define almost formality, that's what we define to be. So, your definition of almost formality is more like it implies this, but this way, yeah, they're not agreeing. Yeah, it's a set of homology classes, yeah. Yeah and I also forgot to say that of course the torus is formal because what they constructed from like the minimal model coincides with the homology and the value result. That's a steady form. Sorry? Are you just talking about steady formality? Well that's some general thing but the notion of remote formality was really Formos formality was really that you're still as a silly so the four would change, yeah, exactly. But that's kind of the i mean, if you if you define a mass or maybe taking degree three, then the triple mass equals should be of dimension. So maybe you're not sure that that's such a defining system always exists. I mean, so you have three cohomology classes, so you can take representatives of those cohomology classes. And I am assuming that this project and that one vanish. So I go ahead and this phrase that says, as you said, it's not an infinite number, but there is a statement that says that if all massive products vanish uniformly in that format. I mean, depends on the language. So some people talk more about answers, but say that if Spanish is the former, that the classical statement is that if a money for each is formal, people must say programme Spanish and also higher money must say promote, which I'm not gonna have the idea, but it's I know I know that it's like a solution. Okay, so we will go back to formality when I speak about your more. Now we're gonna review a more standard thing, namely compact portions of the group. So we are with key secret connected league group with Li Aderal in the Lib and we consider And we consider the generally complex, which is just the forms of the Lie algebra. And the differential in one forms is given by this formula and is basically the normal of the Lie bracket. And then you extend it to higher degrees. Here I put a minus sign, other people remove that. It's just a conventional. Just a convention. How do you extend to higher degree? As a derivation? Random derivation. Okay, in order to describe them, I will use the so-called Salamos notation that there I introduced with an example. If you have a three-dimensional algebra with a basis of false E1, E23, such that the differential of the Differential of the first two vanishes, and the differential of the second is the product of E1 and E2. Then I'm going to denote it by 0, 0, 1, 2. So on each slot, I just write the indices involved with the differential. If the differential of E12, sorry, of E3 was 2 times E12, then I will write 2 times. write two times one two it's not so miserious but you can see this notation and that's the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group that is three times three matrices that are upper triangular and have one solid diagonal Now the Charlie Lember complex is interesting because it gives us the information of left invariant form. You can, whenever you have one form on the Lie algebra, then using left translations, like in this picture, you can define it on every repo, your remote. And if you have a Larry's gamma, since the Since the form is left invariant, this form goes down to the quotient, so it determines a form of the question. Normally, I am taking the quotient such that the resulting space is compact. And so I will So I will restrict my attention to left invariant bit structures or left invariant geometric structures in general. And as I said, these are determined by something in the Chevalier Lemmer complex. So the PVEs of being close or co-close or exact or whatever are really equations, maybe non-linear equations on the form. Equation on the form involving the structure constants of the Lie algebra. And in this sense, well, we will say something like I'm using of the terminology that the Lie algebra admits a closed or an exact. And here, since I'm going to focus only manifolds and some manifolds, I made a table to explain some of the problems. Explain some of the problems. So near manifolds are compact quotients of near-autonomy groups, and solve manifolds are compact quotients of solvable groups. Recall that if a simply connected migroup is solvable, those are dithomorphic to RN. So the interesting geometry comes when we set all ions in the Take a line so now it's relevant for green computation with green manifolds that from the potency condition you can always extract a basis of forms such that the differential of each one is in the span, in the linear span of previous L E velocity. So that's kind of like half the condition for the. Kind of like half the condition for going to be longer. Yeah. Indeed, just void minus next. For solid manifolds, we don't have this property, but it's okay to leave minus not in them. And also in manifolds, some solid manifolds are nice because we can classify the algebras in a small dimension. So for the manifolds, there is a list of two dimensions six, seven. Apto dimension six, seven sorry, and for submanifolds it is at two dimensions six, but uh with the condition of the algebra being only modular. On immodular means that the joint action of each element is traceless and that's like a a necessary condition for a solvable group to admit allies. To admit allies. So, but I will go up to that later. How many? Like infinitely many? Up to eight? Well, in of what, sorry? Of these domino volts. Okay, it depends on the dimension, like on dimension six, like well if you classify them. Then there is like a finite list, but then for dimension 7, you have some parametric families that depend on a real parameter, so this breaks in dimension 7. And lattices on middle manifolds are easier to find because we have a condition that A theorem that states that if the differential of the elements is expressed in terms of rational coefficients on the generators, then you can find the lattice. But that's not true in for solve manifolds. Not all solve manifolds are unimodular, for instance. And here I wrote one example of unimodular solar. Modular solvable V group or V algebra, so this can never admit a larger. But as I said, there is like a stronger condition that I will explain later. Why does it not, okay, let's say it doesn't have the letters? Because a necessary condition is the algebra being minimogram. And then if you look at the lingua. Look at the bracket of the first element. You can see that it is not phrasiness. Okay, the point is that when you don't have unimodularity, you have, for instance, that the volume form is exact. So you can have that reputation. But maybe we can do the population still. Okay, so for nil manifolds are also nice in terms of homology because we have the Nomiksooth theorem that says that the inclusion from left-in variant forms through the random algebra is a quasi-somorphism. So as experienced So as Espiro also said before, here I have half of the condition for minimality. The other one is that the algebra is free. So this is the minimal model for the mean manifold, so we can really handle computations of the homology quite easily. And they have the property that the first very number is greater or equal than two. So Equal than two. So the example I mentioned is not a new manifold, of course. And about cohomological properties, so manifolds are under nice because you only have that the inclusion is injective in homology. And under some conditions, I don't want to mention because it's irrelevant for the talk, you do have an example. An exomorphic C. And this sole manifold, so we have first the number, we the reproductive. And finally, about formality, mean manifolds are not a million, except for this case, and there are like non-abelian formal solved manifolds. So manifolds are quite different. Are quite different in terms of formality. So that's the introduction. So I will start with your M1 about this non-formal exam. Okay, first of all, I wanted to mention about compact manifolds with a closed digital structure that don't admit holonomy determinics or personal holonomy. Or personally, not anonymy because they have first-bed number with the band ones, so they cannot be full onomic E2, butlonomy contain on this. So, first of all, well, we have the first example of Marisa Safergland a long time ago. Later, she constructed, together with the Obonti, a classification of all and importantly algebraic. And importantly, algebras admitting a closed digest structure. So, this gives a lot of examples with first ready number greater equivalent tool that are non-formal. And later on, Manero constructed a formula soft manifold with first-degree number one. So, this was like the new manifolds and sub-manifolds work. So, later we constructed Later, we constructed some examples via orif resolution. So, the first example was due to Fernande, Fino, Povale Famuno, and I constructed as a formal manifold with first number equal one. And I constructed the non-formal example. So, as I said, we started from From an innumerable manifold on that list in both cases, and we took like an involution preserving the metric and the git structure. And then we considered the quotient. This involution has a set of fixed points, so the quotient is an orbital, but since it has a digital structure, it's close to orbital. And the singular loss. And the singular locus is the fixed locus of this symbol issue. Okay, so we are not interested in arbifles. What we want is, as Danielle explained at the very beginning of this conference, is constructive resolution. So a resolution is just a closed determination. A closed digital manifold now and a projection from the manifold to the order fold, such that out of the exceptional divisor, which is the calculimage of the singular locus, it's a rigeomorphism. And we also can ask the resolution to preserve the geostructure out of a neighborhood of the simula groups. So, in order to construct resolutions, Jerry Sandkarillanis developed a method that I simplified in order to be able to find resolutions of loss it were defaults. And the statement is quite similar because it's a simplification. So, whenever the fixed logo So whenever the fixed locus admits an overwhelming closed one form, then you can do the resolution. And so about this theorem, I will just recall you a little bit, what Daniel also explained maybe better, but I will do it very quickly. First of all, it's a simplification of So it's a simplificational choice and very generic because it's not only closed and they need it from. Sorry? How is that a simplification? Yeah, because they needed harmonic because they want to make it also close and I didn't need that assumption at all. So whenever you have an evolution, it's like a linear algebra computation to show that the fixed locus of that Show that the fixed locus of that evolution is a three-dimensional vector space. And on the orthogonal complement, you act EA minus derivative. Also, it's easy to show that this fixed locus is an associative and also you can find an SUT structure on the orthogonal complement. Here I wrote the standard. Here I wrote the standard form. And a local model for the G2 structure has these forms in terms of the basis of R3 and the SUT structure of the normal continuity. And so I split the quotient accordingly with what I explained. Okay. So, in order to resolve that, you have to build a resolution of the singularity on the complex plane and also a resolution on the SU2 structure. And that's well known. For the topological space, you just have to construct the co-op. And for the SU2 structure, which is an hibernated structure, you have to pick the which is. Have to pick the Wichi Hanson metric and then consider the UTS. So you can use all of them with minus, but you can put two plus and a minus. That is easy with each other. Every day we can discuss the same usual experiences. Why? Simple? Why did you choose that? I don't know. Maybe that's how I remember it. Nobody has done that one too. Okay. Because what? Somebody has used this convention as well. Yeah, maybe I read you and then. Oh, I didn't let him put it back in the paper. I think it's very much oh I forgot so from this local model we we get something that in this theorem in particular the singular relief is three-dimensional. Three-dimensional and in order to get the resolution, we remove one of the neighborhoods of the singularity, which is a singular bundle whose local model is the booket's plane of L2, and then we change this neighborhood by the resolution. So, that's in fact a CB1 band. A CB1 bundle over the simulan locus because here the fiber is and indeed one can show that the bundle is the CP1 bundle is triggered. Now Okay. So since the fixed locus is three-dimensional at which an overvanishing clause was formed, there is a theorem of Titchler that says that it has to be a mapping torus over a suffix. I denoted there the genus by GI, but I'm not gonna mention it very much. Very much. So, what you can prove first, and using like a standard Major Legis sequence, is that there is a short exact sequence that injects the homology of the orbifer into the cohomology of the resolution with co-kernel the sum of the homologies of each connected. Of the homologies of each connected component of the singular locus, but you have the tensor with an element of degree two that I call xi. And that represents the tone class of the exceptional divisor on every connected component. So this tone class allows you to construct a splitting of the short exact sequence. So you can oh. So you can write the commonly of the resolution that here I denoted by M prime, but here you have a typo. This should be M prime also. The cohomology of the so you can cook up the cohomology of the resolution as this direct sum, but of course we are interested in the formality. We are interested in formality, and I hope to convince you that it's a property of the algebra and not a property of the commodity groups and aspect of spaces. So one has to cook up formulas for the products that I drop there, but I won't even use them. I just want to show you two conclusions that we draw. The first one is that The first one is that the resolution procedure preserves the first value number because this component has the variable two. And the second thing is that those formulas I wrote up there allows us to compute like the minimal model of the resolution starting from the minimal model of the Earth. So that's why they are used. That's why they are useful. So, now I will show the example. So, as I mentioned you before, we start from a Nilpoten Lie algebra on the list. This is one of the Nilpoten Lie algebras that comes in a parametric family. And these structured equations are in terms of a basis E1, 2, E7. And in order to write the And in order to write the G2 structure, you have to do a complicated change of basis that involves square root. But the important thing of that is that the new vectors after the change of basis V one, V two, V five and B seven line the span of E one, E two, E five and seven, and the same for the other orthogenetic. Same for the other alternative. And as I said before, this is the Lie algebra. The simply connected Blie loop is diffeomorphic to R7 and one can reconstruct the productor using Baker-Campbell-Hauser formula. And then in manifolds, you can easily work out a large, so you pick one of those and define your manifold. And define your manifold, your compact manifold. Then we define an invariant set of action. This involution is the one that preserves E3, E4 and E7 and reverse design of the other ones. And you can check from the structural equations that this commutes with the differential. Commutes with the differential and therefore with the product that we could compute. And then we consider the closed-door orbit vault M over Z2. So for the isotropic locus, we have 16 is doing sub manifolds, and to visualize one of those, you can just You can just check the fixed locus of the involution, which is E3, 4, and 7. And this is Espana Savagebra, who is isomorphic to a compact portion of the Heisenberg group, 0, 0, 1, 2. Then you have minus 2, but it is, I know, you have a 2 because the differential is minus 2. because the differential is minus the okay that that's fine so the disotropy locus at those I found that quite interesting because in the other example the singular locus were torus and it was a time where I was convinced that this thing could not happen so I found it particularly interesting and then To check that this orbifold is non-formal, you can argue by constructing a triple massey product on the manifold that is preset under the set to action. You can see that the product of E3 by these two form is the differential of E56. And there you have. There you have the equations, and you can view that computing the minimal model that this defines a non-vanishing massive product. And then the first one, every number equals one, because if you take real coefficients, then the cohomology either of the orbital is the set of is the set of set to invariant hormonality classes and I am killing E1 and E2 with and I am preserving it three and the other elements are not filled. So that's how you pick very number equal one from the orbit flow and since the isotropy locals is good in the sense that it has an overvalishing closed one form you can You can do the resolution and then from the characterization of the homology algorithm, we get two things. The first one is very important, and the second is that you can lift the non-vanishing mass equipment on the orbital to the resolution. So that's orbital issues. And that's how I proved that. And now And now I'm moving to a subject structure so multiple hard questions of it. So the story of the non-existence of exact left-invariant detail structures on compact questions of linguist is somehow brief. I think it's that examples which you should have. Sorry? Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's it's not sorry, it's it's not maybe I I went too quickly to that part. Yeah, sorry. You have an unvanishing triple massive product, so it's non-formal. But if you adapt these degrees, these degrees, and these ones, you have three, so it's different from four. So it's not almost formal. So in particular, also it doesn't have. Particular. Also, it doesn't admit a torsion-free digital structure. And other thing I want to mention is that I don't know how to construct a compact closed-digit manifold that is simply connected but doesn't admit all onomine. That's great. Can you take a second function? Paul number seven. Yeah, I have tried that thing. I have tried that thing, but somehow when I tried this, I end up with simply connecting similar logos. So I don't know how to have a solution when you can't find an organization who is wonderful. But that was a way that I explored for somehow half a year and then I gave up. Yeah, so I'm not sure. There aren't any examples yet, right, of compounds that are simply connected. Sorry? And you said you can't get rid of B1, you can't put B10. Yeah, you can't. I'm also like I go like this something, but then I don't know. I don't know if it's show it doesn't have to be then I move back here and yeah in the story of that problem I was saying that in twenty twenty Fernandez Final Basero Fernandez Fina and Rafero restricted their attention to Lie groups whose Lie algebra is a semi-direct product of R with an E-manifold, that is a tension of an L manifold, having second and third vanishing many numbers, and then to be generally eigenver complex. And then a fiber and salamon. Then fiber and salamon removed that conditions and then we leave the general case. I will show the proof, like well not show the proof, I'm showing how we understand that proof, which is quite not satisfying because for me, maybe because with tackle things. Because we talk of things like face by face, so there is like a little bit of understanding that we are mixing although we have the secretions. So it's a good sort of sort of passing operating. Those are not exactly the students are also. So we distinguish between solvable and non-solvable cases and what we did is testing all the algebras like good forms. So for non-syllable groups it was quite easier because Final Laferro has done a classification of non-syllability groups and admitting a closed structure and there were only four. Structure, and there were only four. Those had Levitic composition with non-solvable part SL to C and the radical is a solvable algebra, which is centerless, unimodal, and four-dimensional. And here I then use the Selma notation, just I put the differential for the other places, and those are then. And those are them. So what we first thought about is if one could find exact freeforms that are stable. So for that, we picked all the exact free forms and computed this bilinear form, just fixing a random volume form. And we And we tested if that was positive definite or negative definite. And no, no. And it was the generating of the cases. So, well, in the first three cases, sorry, we went as the fourth one. So those three don't have any exact structure at all. So no, no, no, sorry. They don't have a user structure like they have. Like they have a closed data structure because but not exact. Yeah, yeah, of course. I don't know, like, I still tried with non-left demands. And for the other one, we easily saw that That it doesn't admit a lattice, so we even check the algebraic condition. That's for the non-solvable part. For the solvable Lie groups, I should introduce some condition on the Lie algebra, which is being strongly on immodular. And that's a necessary condition for a solvable Lie group to adminal lines. And for that, to define that, we To define that, we pick n, the mean radical of E. Yeah, five minutes, yeah. Okay, and we consider the distinct central series, and what we are asking for in that condition is the adjoint map of each element being traceless when unrestricted. When restricted to the quotient of two subsets of elements in both the central series, and this implies that the group is immodular and so the setup is the following. Whenever we have a unimodular solvable Lie algebra and go with a metric, we can always pick a co-dimension one. A co-dimension one unimodular ideal that I am calling S, and to pick a vector which is orthogonal to this coordination one ideal. And we can view the total Lie algebra as an extension of the solvable ideal with the vector x by the age of action. Here I introduce some Here I introduce some notations in order to decompose the Chevalier lember forms of G with respect to that orthogonal decomposition. So I just denoted by D bar the differential on D by normal D to the differential on S and The adjoining action of t determines an action on forms, which this is like minus the diamonds, and one can write the differential d bar in terms of linear d and big d. And a nice fact that is a consequence of this solvable property is that the differential of ega, which is the dual with respect to x, varies. With respect to x vanishes. So I will go very quickly. So we have that metric was induced by an exact structure. We can decompose the 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the orthogonal splitting in order to build an SU3 structure on S. On S that denoted by omega and psi, psi is the real part of the complex volume form. And if we have a primitive of that three form with respect to d bar, then we can do the same thing and impose that condition. And what we have is that okay, colors here doesn't work very well. That the That the three form is exact, and that's a condition that only depends on S, and that omega should have this formula, that's a condition involving little D to be P. So what with the strategy is how many minutes do we have? Okay, so What we have to do is consider all solvable six-dimensional unimolarity algebras and to check if we can admit an exact util structure, sorry, an SU3 structure satisfying this condition. So we conveniently design a good order. Design a good order in which we would check those conditions in order to discard them all. So here you have them, it's like non-difficult, it's like can the Lie algebra admit an exact stable free form? In this case, take all the derivations uh of this solvable Lie algebra and define omega. Is omega uh non-degenerate? Is it Uh, non-degenerate? Is it a one-one-form? Uh, is it compatible with the y provided with the other? And it was painful, but in the end, uh, we obtained that multiple size sobable algebra. So the constitution follows, and yeah, that's it.
