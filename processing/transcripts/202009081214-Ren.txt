   Okay, welcome back to the last talk of today's session. Our speaker is Jim Berren and he will talk about mathematical logic and its applications in arithmetics of algebraic groups. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. All right, thank you very much. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about a very powerful tool from mathematical logic, which have many applications in algebraic groups and some other algebraic varieties. Okay, so our starting point will be a very classical question asked by Sir John. So in the 1960s. So let's see the formulation of this question. Let's see the formulation of this question. So, we consider a two-variable polynomial over complex numbers. Well, I want this polynomial to be irreducible. And suppose this polynomial have infinitely many roots, zeta, theta, such that both zeta and theta are roots of unity. Then, we want to know what is the shape of this polynomial. So, for this question, we want first observation: is that has infinitely many such rules of unity, which is a rather strong requirement. So, why is that? Because let's see, first, you know, it's a rules of unity. First, we have to make it length equals to one. An argument of this must be a rational multiple of two pi. So, that's a rather strong requirement. So, if that's some. So, if that's some strong requirement, that means rules of unity, which is rather rare on complex numbers. So, if it has infinitely many such rules, that means this F must have a very special shape. So, then our answer, so this was shortly answered by three mathematicians separately, which is Ihara, Seth, and Tate. So, the answer was quite simple. It's quite simple. So, which is f is one of these following shape. The first one is x to the m y to the n minus eta times a non-zero constants, or a times x to the n minus eta y to the n. So where m and n are co-prime, natural numbers, and eta is also a root of unity. We want m n co-prime because we want this polynomial to be. Prime because I want this polynomial to be irreducible. So you can verify very easily that these are desired polynomials. So let's take the first one, for example. I mean, now for any integer n, so you can just pick some pair of complex numbers like this, and then you can verify very easily that there are solutions of this polynomial. And of course, this guy is a root of unity. And if you take some roots of a root of unity, which is again a root of unity, so which means there are infinite many such roots. And you can verify this in a similar way. So the non-trivial part is that, so this exhausts all possibilities. That means if a polynomial doesn't have this shape, then this polynomial only have at most a finite many roots. At most, a finite many roots, such as both coordinates, are roots of unity. So, this is rather non-trivial. All right, so what is the relation of this guy with algebraic groups? So we need a little abstraction of this shape. So, now let's see a slightly more abstract version of this result. So, So, what is the torsion point? So, torsion point, if you consider the G of M, so what is the rules of unity? So, rules of unity, which is exactly the torsion points of this torus, which is Gm of C. And of course, if both coordinates are rules of unity, then this pair is just a torsion point of this Gm2C. And of course, if F is an irreducible polynomial, If f is an irreducible polynomial, then the zero locus is an irreducible algebraic curve in this variety. And so which is equal to this, right? And basically, we just we still use the first example to see what's the shape. The zero locus, which is zero of f, we substitute, and a plays no role, and we just put it here, and then which is nothing but a translator. And then, which is nothing but a translate of this point to something, which is x to the n, y to the n minus one. And we can see that this guy is a torsion point. And this guy is indeed an irreducible algebraic subgroup. So that means this curve is indeed a translate of an irreducible algebraic subgroup by a torsion point. So, in short, which is a torsion coset. Tortion cosets. So, and if you analyze the second example, second case, we will get a torsion coset as well. So, then this last question can be formulated in this abstract way. So, which says that if V inside GMC, which is a torus, which is an irreducible algebraic curve containing infinitely many torsion points, then V is a torsion coset. So, which is a translate of an irreducible. Translate of an irreducible algebraic subgroup by a torsion point. And so later, Lohan and Sarnak proved that the similar results holds. If I replace this Gm2 by an N copy of Gm, which is Gmn, and V to be an algebraic sub-variety, which is not necessarily a curve, and then if this sub-variety contains a Zariski dense subset of torture. A Darisi-bent subset of torsion points, then this guy is a torsion coset. So this will be our, I would say, the baby case of this kind of applications. All right, but let's stop talking about the Taurus case. We want to consider something more technical, which is called a modular analog for this Launce question. So let's see what is that. So, in the CM theory, right, so we are interested in which elliptic curve has endomorphism ring, which is strictly larger than z. So, now let's see our setting. So, we consider the classical J invariance on the point upper half plane. And we see this Z is a C M point if this is the value of a quadratic point on the upper half plane. So, in other words, a CM point means that. In other words, Cm points means that, you know, if you realize this C as a moduli space of elliptic curves up to isomorphism, then Cm point means that this elliptic curve has complex modiplication, which means the endomorphism is strictly larger than z. Okay, so then again, we say, I mean, so this is a sufficient and necessary condition to have Cm, and you see, which is a quadratic, right? And again, quadratic point. Right, and again, quadratic points, which is very rare on the upper half plane because first it has to be algebraic, right? So, this excludes most complex numbers. And for algebraic, and in general, algebraic numbers has degree larger than two. So, that means if that sky is quadratic, this is very rare. So, that means if a curve, let's say, if a polynomial has infinitely many CM points as roots, then this polynomial must be. As roots, then this polynomial must be very special. So now we have a modular analog of Lance question. So the starting point is the same. We have an irreducible complex polynomial of two variables, such that infinite men is loose, tau1, tau2, which is a CM points. That means tau1 and tau2 are both j invariants of quadratic points on the upper half plane. So then the natural question is: so, what can be said about this? So, what can be said about this polynomial? So, again, for similar reasons, this F, you know, we expect this F to have a very, let's say, particular shape. And this was eventually, you know, give an affirmative answer by Yvonne He. So let's see. So his response is that, so F is one of the following, three. So this is X minus tau, where tau is a CM point. Where tau is a Cm point. So that's obvious because you just let y varies. So this gives an infinite many Cm rules. And for y minus tau, it's a similar reasons. The third one is slightly non-trivial. So this guy is the nth modular polynomial. And why this guy is also a desired polynomial? The reason is simple because this polynomial just satisfies that for any s in the upper half plane, you know, this You know, this relation holds. And now, for each s, which is a quadratic point, this, you know, j n of s, you know, this will become a root of this phi of n. So when this s varies through all the, let's say, all the quadratic points, then we get infinitely many such rules. So this is basically a standard material in a CM theory. A CM theory. Again, the non-trivial part is that there are no other examples. And unface proof use some very, I would say, deeper investigation of class field theory, so which does not generalize. So let's mention something, so which does generalize. So it will be useful to see something more general. All right, so general picture, so which is called the anti-order conjecture. Is called the onto-order conjecture. So, this is basically the basic baby case of the ontology order conjecture. And let's see the more general case. All right, but before we go further, before we go further, we still need some abstraction. So the abstraction is that, you know, for the zero locus of this modular polynomial, so we can see that this is also a modular curve. I mean, of course, this guy, this guy is just the usual modular curve, y1. The usual modular curve y1. This one is the modular curve y0n. So which is equal to the upper half-plane modulo, this congruent subgroup. And so which gives an abstract version of Andre's theorem. Basically, it says that if a irreducible algebraic curve in C2 contains infinitely many Cm points, then this V must be a modular curve. V must be a modular curve. And which is a classical theory that says that these two, these three cases just exhaust all possible modular curves included in C2. So that means if a curve in C2 contains infinite many Cm points, then V is a modular curve. All right, so then with this spirit in our mind, we can formulate the general conjecture. All right, which is called the anti-war conjecture. So the model. The modular curve, so C2 is a product of two modular curves, so which is basically the simplest schmurral, the easy, simplest Schmoo varieties. And we want to see if similar results hold for general Schmoil varieties. And the good news is that, so for CM points, this notion can be extended for arbitrary Shimura varieties by using the Shimura data. And so, for example, for the ziggo modular varieties, so the CM points correspond to principally polarized abelian varieties with Cm. So, I mean, even though the variety is not AG or something, so we can still define Cm point. And okay, so now this, the previous on-phase theorem can be just an analog to this conjecture, which says that suppose S is a Which says that suppose S is a connected Schmurran variety and we have an irreducible algebraic curve with infinitely many CM points, then this V must be a zero, a one-dimensional Schmurran variety, so which is a modular curve or a compact Oschimura curve. So this is version one. And so if this B is not necessarily a curve, so we want to, if we want to say when this V contains a lot of V contains a lot of CM points, then we have the following version. So, which says that if this sub-variety contains a Zariski-dense subset of CM points, then this V is a connected Shimona variety. So, this is a rather strong conjecture. And this conjecture is still open for this moment, but it was verified when S is equal to the modular. Then s is equal to the modular single modular variety, and if s is a general Shimola variety, it was verified under the assumption of generalized Riemann hypothesis. All right, so now let me spend a little time talk about something even beyond the onto-war conjecture. All right, so we see no matter which version we are talking about, version one, version two, we're talking about the Version 2, we're talking about the behavior of how the CM points are distributed. But CM points, what is that? These are exactly zero-dimensional Shimura sub-varieties. But we are not satisfied of only understanding the distribution of zero-dimensional Shimura sub-varieties. We also want to understand higher-dimensional Shimura sub-varieties. Yeah, this is what I'm saying here. And how to start? So, we need a little notation. So, basically, the ongoing word conjecture says that we want to study the union of all the zero-dimensional Shmura sub-varieties, which is the union of the set of OCM points. So, now let's use Sd for any integer by the union of all Shmurla sub-varieties of dimension at most D. Most D. So for example, S0 is the set of all CM points. Okay, so now let's just go beyond the first step of going beyond of anti-Ord conjecture. So we want to say, for example, we want to intersect all Schumann sub-varieties of dimensional at most one. So what does that mean? That means, so we let S to be a connection. So we let S to be a connected Schmuer variety and V be an arbitrary sub-variety. And now we consider the intersection of V with all the possible Schmidt varieties of dimension, at most one. And we suppose this intersection is directly dense in V. And then a natural question is: what can be said for this V? If V necessarily have a special shape, Have a special shape. So, what's the relation of with on-hill orbs? So, you know, this condition, I mean, of course, this guy will be larger than the S0 intercept D. So that means if, oh, sorry, if this guy is equals to V, that means it's weaker than this condition. So that means this is not exactly on the word, right? Because we have a weaker condition. But I mean, this is not an empty condition, right? So, we cannot expect that V is already a Shmura variety, but this V should be more or less not too far from a Shimura variety. And so, what's the meaning of not too far? So, we need something to measure how far something is from a Shimura variety. So, we want to define data. So, we let for any sub-variety V, we let this V bracket to be the smallest Schmurler sub-variety of S. Subvariety of S containing B. So basically, this difference will be measures how far this guy is from a Schmuer variety. For example, if this guy is equal to zero, that means V is a Schmois variety. Okay, so this leads to the, how to say, the more general conjecture, which is the zero-pink conjecture, version one. So that means if let's S and V as above, and suppose the S1 intersect V. The S1 intersect V is dense in V. Then this V is either a Shmura sub-variety, or if you enlarge V by something of dimension one, this guy becomes a Shmura variety. So this will be zero-pink conjecture. Okay, so then one may ask, so what's something even weaker happens? For example, you have to add all the two-dimensional Schmuer sub-varieties to get something dense. What can we expect? Something dense, what can we expect? For example, this guy, that means maybe this is not one, so we expect this guy is equal at most two. And similar, if you replace two by three by four, etc. So this enables us to guess the most general version of the zero pink conjecture. So which says that, so for d, which is arbitrary, which is an arbitrary, you know, natural non-negative integer, and suppose that integer and suppose that v intersects with all the shmura sub varieties of dimension at most d is dense in d then this v and it's a smaller shmura variety containing it so the so the dimension difference is at most d and for this conjecture uh so this is a far-reaching conjecture so we don't know many cases uh for this moment but i would like to mention a little bit uh some of my work with crystal Of my work with Chris Dahl, so towards this conjecture. All right, so that's my work with Daw. Okay, so in order to attack this conjecture, so Bomberi, Master, Danier, so they find an auxiliary tool, which is a very large, much larger family of Shimara sub-varieties, so which is called the weekly special sub-varieties. So, weekly special sub-varieties, so this, roughly speaking, Roughly speaking, they are just the translates of Shimura subvarieties. So, what does that mean? That means if this sub-variety Z in a Shimura variety is called weakly special, that means there exists a Shimura variety which can be decomposed as a product of Shimura varieties, such that this z is equal to T1 times a constant. So, this will be an analog of cosets for algebraic rules. For algebraic rules. And so it turns out to be that in order to understand Schmroker sub-varieties, it's useful to understanding the distribution of weakly special sub-varieties. And of course, there are some relations because weakly special, you know, so all the Shimara sub-varieties are weakly special. And if a weakly special sub-variety contains a CN point, then this is a Shimara sub-variety. Just like if a code Just like if a coset contains a torsion point, then this becomes a torsion coset. It's just an analog. But Bomberi Masazander didn't work on Shimrana varieties. They work on tolerance and abelian varieties. For Shimrana varieties, this was done by Crystal and myself. So we have a distribution theorem, a structure theorem of weakly special sub-varieties. So which basically says that if we consider, you know, Consider the sub-varieties such as which is not far from weakly special, then basically we just say that this kind of sub-variety comes from a finite family. That means if y is a such variety which is not far from weakly special, then you have a finite many strong varieties with this kind of a splitting, such that this y, this risk equal, which is the smallest weakly sub-variety. Which is the smallest weekly sub-variety containing y, which is the translate of this shape. So that means weekly special sub-variety. So somehow they come from a finite family. So this result itself gives us some understanding of weakly special. How about the original zero-pink conjecture? So we have the following thing. So this conjecture will be a little bit far-reaching, but for modular curves, this will be... But for modular curves, this will be promising. So we give the conjecture which is considered the Gallo orbit of the so-called optimal point, which is a distinguished point, which is, I would say, related to CM, but not precisely CM. So it gives a lower bound. It gives a lower bound of somehow. Of the somehow the Galois group, not Galois group, but somehow the automorphic group on P, the size of the orbit, has some lower bound. And so with this and some other minor, you know, with some other minor conditions, so we are able to give a conditional proof of the zero pink. So what is the conditional proof of zero pink? What is the conditional proof of zero pink? That means we just reduce the zero pink by some more plausible conjecture, which is called the point counting problem. So basically, if we just consider the union of y, which is all the y, not far from weakly special, so as in the previous theorem, if you just exclude this v and then intersect this st, if this guy is I st, if this guy is finite, then the zero-pain conjecture holds. And so, what is our conditional proof? Our conditional proof says that, so this is basically a consequence of the Large Galois orbit conjecture in a previous slide, and with a minor hypothesis on heights and some reduction theory of algebraic groups. If we assume this, then the Dubertain conjecture is true. During conjecture is true. And of course, if the situation is C of n, then so most minor hypothesis can be verified, except for this large-scale orbit conjecture. So hopefully some, you know, you know, some more strategy can be applied to attack this conjecture. All right. Okay. So that's all I want to say and happy birthday to Andre. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jenbo. Are there any questions? Feel free to speak up if there are questions. Just press your spacebar, and that will unmute you while you're talking. While you're talking, what is the model theory in the title? Oh, I see. So, the model theory will be used, which is called the o-minimality. So, in o-minimality, so Peter and Wilkie proved a counting theorem. So, this plays a crucial role in a proof of anti-ord and a partial proof of the European conjecture, which is all minimality. Which is all minimality. You mean this Timmermann, the work of Timmerman and oh yes. I mean Timmerman is the one who observed that the average the Coleman's conjecture can be proved for the Gao orbit conjecture. So then he established the proof of the anti-order conjecture for the Ziegler modular variety. Variety. Thank you. Okay, no problem. Any other questions? If there are no other questions, let's thank the speaker again. Okay, thank you. And we'll meet again at 10 o'clock mountain time tomorrow. Sometime tomorrow. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
