Which together form a left-free bimodule. And its two cells are these linear maps, which are actually bimodule homomorphisms of these left-free bimodules. So now we come to our main definition, which is a Frobenius monad. And a monad in a two category is said to be a Frobenius monad if there exists this co-monad structure with the same object. Structure with the same object part and endomorphism part, such that this Frobenius law is satisfied. So, this is just involving the multiplication and co-multiplication of the monad and co-mad structure. And so, as an example, a Frobenius monad in sigma of vect over some field is just the usual motion of a Frobenius algebra that some of you may be familiar with. So, it's just a K-algebra equipped with this non- Just a K-algebra equipped with this non-degenerate bilinear form, which satisfies this more familiar Frobenius identity. So, what makes Frobenius monads interesting really are the following results. So, if we have two one cells in our category that form an adjunction in which F is both the left and the right adjoints of U. So that's called an ambidextrous adjunction, then the monads generated by that adjunct. Monads generated by that adjunction is in fact a Frobenius monad. And next, it may be that the two category K does not have Einenberg-Moore objects for a given monad, but of course, EM of K is guaranteed to have them. And so if we start with a Frobenius monad, then this left adjoint, this canonical free one cell, will be left adjoint to be Be left adjoint to the forgetful one cell, but it will in fact be also right adjoint to it. And so that forbenious monad is going to be generated by an ambidextrous adjunction in EM of K. So these results can be used to give a characterization of Frobenius objects in monoidal categories. So these will be those objects which arise from ambidexual subjunctions in EM of sigma of In Em of sigma of that monoidal category. And so, if we apply this to the case of vector vector spaces, then what we find is that every Frobenius algebra in that category arises as a amp dexterous junction from in that two-category U that we previously just described. And finally, since Atia actually proved that these Frobenius algebras are equivalent to Benius algebras are equivalent to two-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Each of those arise from an ambidexual junction in that category that we recently just described. So actually, the main line of inquiry of this work was actually the following question. Can we more directly characterize Frobenius objects in a monoidal category? So that is not via these ambidexious junctions, but rather. Be dexterous junctions, but rather directly by construction. So, in other words, given a Frobenius monad, can we define an appropriate notion of a Frobenius Einberg-Moore object? Can we describe FEM objects as some kind of limits, as well as the completion of a two category under such femme objects, like we did for the EM construction? And is there an explicit description of this FEM completion which is similar to the EM completion? The EM completion. So the hope is that we can give an explicit description such that its zero cells are now not just going to be formal monads in the base two category, like it was for the EM construction, but rather formal Frobenius monads, and whose one cells are not just morphisms of monads, but rather morphisms of Frobenius monads. So the answer to all these questions is actually going to be yes, but provided we work with dagger two categories. Did we work with dagger two categories instead of just general two categories? So, there are two reasons why we might like to do this. Firstly, we have several constructions and other constructions in category theory, which allow us to axiomatize certain theories. So, for example, we have this inductive completion construction, which of course has a universal property. And a category is accessible if it is equivalent to the inductive completion of some category. Completion of some category, and we have a similar thing for this co-product completion, this fan fun term. So, we might think that there is a theory for Benius categories, which would be those categories equivalent to the FEM completion of some other category. The other direction comes from objects called reads, which are essentially generalized distributive laws. They are these objects of EM of K, and they include things such as. Of k. And they include things such as cross products of algebras and factorization systems. And so we'd like to consider dagger-frobenius reads, so objects of femme of femme of k, and what those objects look like in familiar dagger categories. But yeah, I think I'm probably going to be running a bit short on time, so I'm just going to skip this part and you guys can maybe check that out on the slides a little bit later. So for anyone still not Anyone still not familiar with dagger category theory, we'll just quickly go over the basics. A dagger category is an involutive functor, which is the identity on objects. Then a dagger functor between dagger categories is one which is going to preserve those daggers. A monoidal dagger category is a dagger category that is also a monoidal category where the tensor product respects the dagger and those coherent. And those coherence morphisms and unitaries. So I think probably these examples are any groupoids, the category of Hilbert spaces. Yeah, there are quite a few interesting examples. But we're going to be talking about these DAGA2 categories. And what they are are two categories which are enriched in Dagger categories. So the home category. And dagger categories. So their home categories are not only categories, but dagger categories. And the horizontal and vertical composition operators commute well with daggers. Best example will probably be dagg cat of dagger categories, dagger functors, and natural transformations. And then a two-functor is a dagger functor functor when each of its components functors are themselves dagger functors. We have a notion of We have a notion of so this is these dagger Frobenius monads, which were defined first by Chris and Marty, and a monad will be a dagger Frobenius monad when it just satisfies its Frobenius law. So these are all Frobenius monads in the previous sense, since mu of dagger or the dagger of mu is a co-multiplication for a co-monad structure. Co-multiplication for a co-monad structure. Then we also have morphisms of digaphrobenous monads, which are morphisms of the underlying monads, but they have an additional coherence property. And so these kind of are similar to a preservation of the co-multiplication structure, but they're not exactly, they don't quite correspond to that. We need a To that, we need an additional property to follow for that to happen. And we also have dagger-friendly monads morphism transformations. These are monad morphism transformations of the underlying monads. They have, as well, an additional coherence property. And so, once again, as this diagram indicates, these three elements determine a two-category called df of monad. DF of monad, which is indeed a dagger two category. So, as examples, we could define dagophrobinous monoids as dagerfrobenous monads in the strictification of a monoidal dagger category. In the dagger category of finite dimensional QB spaces, dager-frobenous monoids are precisely these C-star algebras which have this form. So, they are constructed from the group. So they are constructed from the group algebra over some finite group point with their unit and multiplication given by these equations. And then in our paper, we define the notion of a dagger-lax functor, which is a Lax functor satisfying an additional Frobenius axiom. And so what happens is that df of monad of d actually becomes Actually, it becomes this category of dagger-lax functions from the terminal dagger category to D. We also define these dagger-lax natural transformations, modifications, and lax limits, which capture the notion of a Frobenius-Ainemog-Moore object, which we'll just briefly describe in a moment. It also turns out that the appropriate notion of algebra for a dagophobenius monad is what's called. Dager Frobenius-Monad is what's called a Frobenius-Einenberg-Moore algebra. So these are Einenberg-Moore algebras which satisfy an additional commutative diagram. Furthermore, the full subcategory of the Einenberg-Moore category of such objects turns out itself to be a dagger category, which we denote by femm of dt. And in fact, we have that for the free algebras for a dagger-friendly univers monads. For a dagophobenus monad, these are all FEMA algebras. But there are, of course, examples of EM algebras which are not FEMA algebras. So now we can turn to our FEM objects. Similar to EM objects for each dagger-Frobenius monad, there is this dagger2 functor whose object part sends each object to this FEM category of the dagger from Benius monad induced. The dagger-frobenius monad induced by the dagger-frobenius monad we started with. And if this dagger 2 functory is representable, then f is the representing object, and it is called the Frobenius-Eisenberg-Moore object of that monad. And in particular, we're going to have an isomorphism of dagger categories, which is going to be too natural. The example that we have is that Is that the dagger category of femme algebras for a dagger Frobenius monad is itself a FEM object in DAG cat. We also have a universal property, a dagger analog of a really well-known universal property. So suppose that the dagger Frobenius monad generated by an adjunction has a Has a FEM object in some dagger two category, then there is going to exist this right comparison one cell, which makes this diagram commute. So this is quite a familiar property from the formal theory of monads. And then dually we have Frobenius-Kleisli objects. They're defined to be FEMA objects for that dagger Frobenius monad in its opposite two category. They're denoted by FK of They're denoted by FK of DT, and they satisfy an isomorphism of dagger categories, dual to the one for the FEM objects. And again, it turns out that for a dagger Frobenius Monad, its Kleisli category has a canonical dagger structure. And moreover, it is a Frobenius Kleisli object for that monad. For that monad. So, there is a very general theory of co-completions or closure under certain classes of co-limits. Marty, in his PhD thesis, has developed some of the theory of dagger limits, but extending these two weights of collimits may not be possible in general. However, we construct the closure of a two-category k via this trans-finite process of first. Process of first starting with the representables in the pre-sheaf2 category and at each stage adding all collimates of objects of the previous stage. And so thinking of Fripp EMS classy objects as collimates that we want, we're going to imitate this process and prove a similar result for the EM completion. So in fact, what we show is that this trans-finite process we just described actually ends after a single step. After a single step. So, starting with this representable and a dagger Frobenius monad on that representable, we consider its Frobenius Kleisley object F. And then with F, we consider another dagger Frobenius monad on that and take its Frobenius Kleisley object and we call that G. And then there are, of course, these three forgetful adjunctions for both objects. And taking the composite adjunction, we get Taking the composite adjunction, we get, of course, another adjunction, which determines a third dager Frobenius monad. And so we can consider its Frobenius-Classy object, which we'll call H. But H being a Frobenius-Classy object, there is this dual universal property to the one we just saw earlier. And so there is this unique morphism from H to G. However, this diagram is in the pre-sheaf dagger 2 category. And so everything is calculated point. And so everything is calculated pointwise. And so pointwise, this unique morphism is fully faithful. But pointwise, these left joints F and F prime and F double prime are bijective on objects. And since this is a commutative diagram, we have that pointwise, this unique morphism is also bijective on objects. So in fact, we have that pointwise, we've actually shown that H is isomorphic to G and would have been included. And it would have been included in the first step of that transfinite process. So we can take Fk to be, FK of D to be that the object resulting from that single step, that first single step. And then each representable is a Frobenius classic object for a Dagger Frobenius monad on a representable. And every object of this Dagger 2 category is a Frobenius classic object for a Dagger Frobenius monad on a representable. Monad on a representable. And so now what we do is we take FEM of D to be the opposite of this FK of DOP. And after some quite involved calculations, it turns out that the zero cells are these dagophrobenius monads. Its one cells are the morphisms of dagophrobenius monads. And its two cells are the same as the two cells in EMOF in the Aderberg-Moore completion. Add a bit more completion. Yeah, so I think I've probably gone over, but the final point is just to say that there is this universal property for the fan construction. And it is a two-category which has all Frobenius either more objects. And then composition with that inclusion, that embedding two-functor, dagger two-functor, induces an equation. Dagger two-functor induces an equivalence of categories between the category of femme object preserving two functors and the category of dagger two-functors here on the left. On the right. So I think, yeah, I'll stop at that point. There's other things I could talk about, but I think I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much. Let's thank the speaker.
