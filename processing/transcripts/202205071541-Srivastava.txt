You're meeting all of you in person after such a long time on Zoom. So I thought I'd start with a funny kangaroo anecdote before we actually get into the graphics to kind of lighten the mood. And so I'll share it with you on the screen so you can see it. I received this email back in 2019. Maybe Rositza remembers. And I think we receive a lot of phishing emails a lot in our careers and so we usually delete them. And so we usually delete them. But this one, if I can find, was very interesting in the wording. And so this student, the student contacted me very innocently, I thought at first that I actually thought it was Lisette. Can you read that? Let me just double-click it so we can see that better. Is that legible? So, anyways, I got this is kind of comical, I guess. I received this email 2018. I think the date's on there, May 10th, 2018. I'm nine years old. I'm in primary school in Kosovo, blah, blah, blah. Recently, I took part in a kangaroo math competition where I received a score of 36%. The reason I'm writing to you is because you were a director of Kangaroo Conference in Canada, and I'm inspired by you. For shit in Canada, and I'm inspired by you. Blah blah blah. I thought it was a really great email from a student. And so there's pictures attached of the girl, the little girl with you know, winning awards and doing ballet and stuff. And so I even forwarded it to Rizita outside and I asked her, did you receive this email? And she said, no, it seems kind of scammy to me. I'm somewhat naive with this stuff, and I just thought that this was an okay email. A student wanted some help with math kangaroo and stuff, so that was great. And so. That was great, and so it didn't take long to cut to the chase. I think the next email I had sent some emails back and forth just thanking her for emailing me and stuff. And then she sends this one, basically looking for like an invitation, like a letter from me for her to enter Canada. And so this was a few days later, this was May 15th, that I received this. And so, you know, I wasn't comfortable writing. So, you know, I wasn't comfortable writing the letter, so I never did. And then kind of the conversation ended. But I don't know. I thought it was kind of funny because who's going to find me on a math kangaroo website and try to send me a scammy email? But anyway, funny thing to sort of. Has anyone received anything like that before? Any of the other directors? We do sometimes. Not that nice. I mean, the English was so perfect. Like, it was such a gold. How do you know that Irina is not a 60-year-old man? I don't. Open it. I don't. That's the problem. Right? And so once I write a letter inviting them to Canada, I don't know if they're like how they're going to use it. Anyways, funny thing to start. I think we received one of those too. From her? Not this person. Similar? But something similar where they're like, oh, Houston is an invited to go to Flanders. I don't think so. Yeah. Anyways, call me a quote at the time. I mean, I felt guilty at first not responding to. Like at first, not responding to her right away when I thought about it because then this little nine-year-old girl is reaching out, but, anyways, funny thing to start things off. So, graphics, I mean, there's lots of options for graphics as far as adding them to your problems. I think for Math Kangaroo and dealing with younger students, I think graphics are a big part of a lot of the questions. I think we need to understand that as learners, students can learn in a variety of Students can learn in a variety of different ways. Some people will read the words and they will make sense to them and they'll be able to understand the problem. Some need those visual aids to kind of help them fully understand the problems. And so a nice graphics, as Patrick showed in some of the questions that you showed in your presentation earlier, can make all the difference for the students. And some of the questions actually depend on the graphics, where you're using the graphics to actually decipher the question. Patrick showed a question where there was a bunch of Patrick showed a question where there was a bunch of teeter-totters and things were weighing different amounts. And you're basically using the graphics to try to find out which is the heaviest item. And so I think it's very important to make nice graphics and have them in our problem sets. Now, then the problem becomes problem sets are written all in LaTeX. Is that we do it all in LaTeX, Rizitsa, for Canada, right? No, yes. Yeah, we used Microsoft Word. We used Microsoft World, now we use LaTeX last year and this year. Yeah, so embedding something in LaTeX, although the results, if done properly, can be a lot better, if done improperly they can be terrible and they can cause problems. Microsoft Word, I find myself, I can't use it because it's too finicky. But getting graphics to work and look the way you want them to sometimes is a little bit easier. So I'm just going to show you a bunch of different tools. Tools both in LaTeX and things that you can use in Word if you're using Word for your problem sets. So some of the stuff is transferable to both. So in LaTeX, obviously you would have to have some knowledge of LaTeX to start, but one of the packages that's often used for graphics in LaTeX is the TIX package, T-I-K-Z. And so if you're using LaTeX and you want to do So if you're using LaTeX and you want to do a ticks graphic, you have to include the package. And so you would put that up in your preamble before you start your document. Now what you can do in the ticks package can be quite beautiful. Let me just show you something that, and obviously the better you get at it, the more experience you'll have. But I'll just show you some of the really nice stuff that you can do once you have some experience. Can do let's go some experiments that I could do. Let's see here. Take this out. So this is something after a decent amount of experience, something that you can put together in TIX package. And something like this, once you have some experience, can take you not very long to do. Not very long to do. I'd make that much bigger, but something like that. So you have a bunch of nodes that kind of feed a flow chart, that kind of meet that. Now, something like this obviously wouldn't be something we would use for math kangaroo, but you can kind of get to the depth of the intricate details that you can put into diagrams once you know what you're doing. Now, for math kangaroo type stuff, we've obviously. We obviously want stuff a lot simpler, and simpler is good in ticks package because you can do it quite quickly. So, like, for example, everything in ticks is based off the origin, so like 0, 0. And so, if you want to draw something, you're basically Draw something, you're basically working on a coordinate system from 0, 0. Yeah, it is really long. I mean, it seems longer than it is because it's a lot of copy-pasting the same thing and moving the coordinate of it. The coordinate of it. So that's somewhat advanced, and I wouldn't expect any newcomer to be able to do something like that. Okay, so drawing a ticks package. When you're creating a ticks drawing, you need to put something within the ticks picture environment. So you would always kind of start with a ticks picture and then end with a ticks picture. And so everything that you actually want in your picture would go in the middle here. So right now we're kind of working with a blank slate, nothing's up on the screen on the right. The screen on the right. So, with LaTeX, if you haven't used it before, this is kind of your coding environment, and this is kind of what's going to show up on your image, right? And so, it takes a picture as you go. The nice thing about Overleaf, which is the program that I'm using right now, so this is Overleaf. The nice thing about Overleaf, if you haven't used it before, you can share the project with others. And so, multiple people can work on the problem set at the same time. And so, I think that's what we do. I think that's what we do. You guys use Overleaf for no, we use NickTech install Oclay and so this is how we worked on that. Okay. But for graphics, only Overleaf probably can be used. Like once we have a problem set and it's set up in LaTeX and we want to add graphics to it, it might be useful for us to share it on Overleaf and have people try to add the graphics. That worked uh on the translation and uh had lib tech installed with uh Had MiGTech installed with the same editor, and we were compiling in the same way. So, many people here probably are familiar with MIGTEC and maybe have LaTeX on their local computer, not necessarily. This is cloud-based. This is cloud-web-based that you can share. Compiling, you have to be able to do first. The editor, yeah. The environment. This is, I mean, researchers that I collaborate with that don't know how to use LaTeX, this is preferred for them because a lot of it's done for you. Like, you don't have to have any packages, everything's there. It's overly you don't need to install, but when you install MikTech, you can specify that everything can be installed as needed. So, yeah, no problem with tips. All this. Yeah, anyway. Okay. So. Anyway, okay, so Overleaf is a nice environment if you're collaborating on a single document. So you would just go, I mean, if I was, say, collaborating with Patrick on this, I would go share it, I'd type in his email, he would have access to edit this if I decide to give it to him. Okay, and then so we could both work on this at the same time. So, drawing it in a text picture is quite easy. Like I said, everything's based off the origin. And so, if I just wanted to do something simple like Something simple like draw a line from say 00 to 40. So that's x coordinate, y coordinate to x coordinate, y coordinate. So this is basically a horizontal line of length 4, you would think, something like that. So then now the line is added. Now, here, now, based on Now, based on that, I can kind of, if I wanted to move towards like drawing a square starting with this, so this is kind of the bottom of the square. Well, now I can kind of move up and go to four would be top and then back over to zero four and then back down. And then back down to 0, 0. And then every line within a text picture, you should finish with a semicolon. It just kind of separates the lines from each other. If I was using my own text editor and I didn't have it blown up so big, this would probably all just fit on one line, but since the text is so big, it doesn't. And so this should give me a square. And so that would kind of give me the basis of doing that. Now I could also. The basis of doing that. Now, I could also do this in one command and say draw a rectangle and give it dimensions, which I'll kind of do next. Have a question? Yeah, so specifically for the Math Kangaroo, I mean, that's actually exactly what I'm looking for, but someone who doesn't use LateLake a lot. But for the Math Kangaroo with the pictures, as far as I can remember, those have to be supplied separately. So can you export? Maybe I'm getting ahead of you here. Yeah, I'm going to get to that. Yeah, I'm going to get to that. So that's next. Yeah, I know the pictures have to be separate. So this is just if you're more if you're looking to add graphics to something that you didn't need separate images for. Also, you know, in the camera we have a button to come to jump here. I'll get to that. Yeah, I'll get to that. Yeah, how do we show things? How do we add things? And you know, what's about adding graphics? About adding graphics to images or to documents, the bad thing is there's not one best solution. There's a bunch of solutions that are just, you have to put them together to get what you're actually looking for. So yeah, for adding graphics to a latex file, TixPicture is great, but what you can't do with this is export it into its own file. And so for Kangaroo, just for the problem. And so, for kangaroo, just for the problem sets, maybe this isn't the best solution. So, I'm going to show a couple other things that we can do. Another program that's quite popular is called GeoGibra. They have a web-based kind of platform here that I'm on right now. And so, if you go, when you load geography.org, you kind of come here. You can go to the app downloads, and they have a bunch of different. Downloads, and they have a bunch of different things depending on what you want to do. The best one for me, or that I've found, is GeoGibra Classic 5 or 6. You can either, so the nice thing about GeoGibra that I like is two things. Number one is if you're on a computer that you don't have it installed or you're not allowed to install software and you want to use it, they have a web-based application that you can use. That you can use. So that's a really nice thing about it. The platform-based application is quite nice as well. And so this is the same program, but installed it and downloaded on my machine. And so I was just playing around earlier and I kind of made this little circle with an angle in there. And I was going to add angles in there. So GeoGibra is nice for problems, probably for the older grades, where we want to show them mathematical properties or Properties or any sort of like you know triangles with angles or you know radiuses on circles. GeoGibra is really good for that. Yeah, so I'll get to that. So you can see here, you know, we can draw circles, we can draw angles. Once you get more familiar with what you're trying to do, it actually gets a lot easier. So, you know, this, I drew a circle and I want to add an angle. Okay, I can do that. An angle. Okay, I can do that. I can move this line around, make this angle bigger if I want to. There's all sorts of stuff you can do. The nice thing about technology these days, if you don't know anything, you can find a YouTube tutorial on how to use this stuff and get really good at it really quickly. GeoGebra has nothing to do with LaTeX. GeoGebra has nothing to do with latex, but we can export what we do in GeoGebra directly to LaTeX, okay? So once you have Once you have a drawing, a couple of things that I wanted to show you. Number one is, I don't think we'll always want the grid in the background or the x-axis and y-axis. And so we can always get rid of that quite easily. Where is it here? I was just looking at it like two seconds ago. Easy plate. Oh, it's got something selected. That's oh. Sorry. There we go. So you can get rid of the grid by basically clicking on the grid and choosing what kind of grid you want. If we didn't want the grid, it's gone. If we don't want the axes, we can get rid of them just by. We can get rid of them just by enabling and dislabling it. So now we have this picture. Okay, so here's kind of where you've watched a bunch of tutorials, you've come up with an image that you kind of like, and you kind of want to get it into your document. Now, what do you do? You have a bunch of different options. So I'll show you a couple things that you can do. For starters, sorry, let me close that. Close that you're gonna want to, once you have an image, if it's an image that you think you're gonna want to use again, you're probably gonna want to save it, and you're probably gonna want to save it on your machine. And so they want you to use some sort of cloud-based to do that. But you can also go without signing in and you can export it as a GGB file. The GGB file you can The GGB file you can save on your machine and you can go back and edit it later on. So let's just say you've created an image, you want to save it, you can save it, then you can open it up again later and edit it if you want. If it's a one-time thing and you're kind of happy with the result, there's different things that you can do. So here are my options for exporting this image. Okay? And so there's a whole bunch of stuff there. If it's something that I want to embed. If it's something that I want to embed in a latex document and I don't need it as a separate file, I'm going to select this one: pgf slash text. That'll create a text picture of this thing. And so what I'll just show you what that looks like. So once I export it, it's just going to give me the text. I export. I'm just going to save it on my desktop for now. Okay. And then so what that'll look like. That'll be the latex code that I need for this diagram, and so I can literally just cut this into that overleaf document that I had before, and I'm just going to get rid of everything. Okay, so we're kind of back to here. Okay, and so then I compile okay, and so I have that diagram there. Depending on placement, you can move it around. Depending on placement, you can move it around. I can right center it, left center it. I can give exact coordinates where I want to put it. That sort of stuff you can figure out later. That sort of stuff would probably, the best place to put that stuff is kind of within the ticks picture itself. Here, in the preamble, you can kind of specify exactly where you want that picture once you have it created. Now, here, I've only exported the code. I've only exported the code for it, so I still don't have like a workable image that I want to use. So for that, I'd want to pick something else. For me, I usually go with either a PDF, so you can have a PDF of the image, or I really like myself a PNG. It's a really compact, high-definition version of the image. So let me just extract this as a PNG just to show. Extract this as a PNG just to show you what that would look like. So I'm just going to call it example one.phg. I'm going to save it for starters on my desktop, but to actually get it into my overleaf, I have to upload it to the cloud. And so if I just go to upload and I upload that image, which was example1.png. Example1.png, now it's going to show up here in my uploaded images. So these other images were things that I was playing around with before. Now that the image is there, I can add it really easily without using a text picture. And what I use there is I use something called the figure environment. And in Overleaf, the figure environment gives you all the preamble code that you're going to need to include in the image. Include in the image. All I need to do is inside of include graphics, I need to mention the name of the picture. And so this picture was called example1.pg, which is this one. Okay, and so now if I do this, so remember this picture is already there from before. So I'm going to take that out just so we're not seeing it. You can't use the two to compare. To compare. Okay, sure, let's leave it. One is okay, so the top one is going to be the one that we used the code for. The bottom one is going to be the one that we exported to a file, and now we're adding it. And so if I recompile, I'm going to see both. Now, there could be a size difference, so it's put it on the next page, okay? And that's basically because there's some size differentials that we need to fix here. We need to fix here. So, if we open up this PNG, what you might see is that it's actually a lot bigger than what we wanted. I'm just going to open it up in a basic environment here, just to see how big it is. So, this is just paint. I just want to see how big this image is. So, you can see that the actual image is a lot smaller than what I actually wanted. I can fix that really easily, even for I can fix that really easily, even from within paint. I can just crop it down to a nice size. I can also specify in the image. Oh, but this is the cropping, correct? I cropped it. The reason I cropped it instead of doing that is just to save time for this thing, but you can trim it. So there's a trim command that you can add to a figure and trim it down if you want to as well. That kind of goes in the preamble here. So you can add square. Here. So you can add square roots. So I skipped that here and I just cropped it just to save some time, but you can also trim it. I need to re-upload that file because we're working in a cloud environment. So I'll put the new version on. All right. And then if I recompile, I think things will be a little bit better. Okay. So now it's too big, right? So now I can scale it down if I want to, just using the scale command. Scale equals, let's say, Let's say 30% of what it was before, and I kind of get a better centered image of it. If I didn't want it centered, I can remove this and it'll be left justified and so on. And so that's kind of the easiest way to get a GeoGibra image into LaTeX if you want to. PDF would work too, because you could use PDF to do that as well. And let's not data fly stance. PDF? PDF, yeah. PDF, yeah. EPS, yeah. So PDF then would work as well. And the process would be exactly the same, but we'd probably want to trim it. Well, does one give a better resolution than the other? Like if you use the text package versus the PNG file? I mean, at the end of the day, no, not really. It's pretty close. I like PNGs because they're compact, especially when you're sharing files back and forth. The ticks pictures you saw we did very little. Very little, and the code was fairly significant, and so your files can get quite big quite quickly. They're really nice for the more experienced user, but exporting it as a PNG gives it a nice compact version that you can use and pass around your ECQ as well. It's much easier doing the PNG file. I'm just wondering: is there like a certain resolution that is appropriate? I don't know for the I don't know for the yeah I talked about this in the morning at least 300 by how do we see that there is minimum requirement for resolution so and really PNG is not recommended at all okay so so then PDF so we can try that too how do you see the reason is PDF can be edited in a way and so we are editing actually when we translate in French When we translate in French, some images contain text in English and this goes needs to be translated in French and we work directly with either whatever if we use text environment, we directly can translate there and produce the French version, or the P D F, we translate the P D F. If I get the image as P and G, I have to translate the P D F and sometimes it's not so easy to edit It's not so easy to edit uh after that, right? I mean it is sometimes to edit during each other. So yeah, PDF. I'm curious. You could export from GeoGebra. Yeah, so I exported from GeoGebra as a PDF. That's this. You can see we're probably going to have to trim it significantly to get it to work properly. And so now it's a PDF. So now I do. It's a PDF. So now I do the same thing. I can upload it to the cloud if I want to. Now, using Overleaf is probably only helpful if you're working with other people. If you're not, you can do everything locally on Tech Center or whatever. Whatever you use. I use Tech Studio usually on the Windows. Text Studio is the environment, the editor. Yeah, Tech Studio. Is there an easy way to actually send? Like, compare the resolutions of the images and see what, because you had given a number before of what the faces was. Like, is there a way to see, like, okay, this image has a certain resolution? Well, let's see. Yeah, but I think so. I mean, they don't want us to use this, so this would be... So this is 600 by close to 600. I think that's what the size is. But that's a six-fold size. Oh, you need this adopt per DPI. I don't think you can get that easily. I don't think you can get that easily from some other time. What about a PDF? Because a PIDMAP image you can print at different resolutions. Right. Yeah, how do you check for the DPI? The size of the proposed file? Well, the PNG you said, right? We're talking about the PNG you said. About the PNG because the PNG, you can print, like you said, you can print at different resolutions with as well. Can you? Well, you have to be if you mean it has different resolution, right? I'm just curious. I don't actually know the answer to that. You need to... Yeah, PUG pixel-based, right? So you have those sizes there, don't you? You didn't want to use PG. What is the size? I don't see very well in PDF. Oh, it's about 600 by 600. So the results are not. DPI is dots per square inch, right? But you had said that PNG is not desirable, though, right? So I was wondering on the PDF... Could you convert it to a PNG and then PDF? No, you don't want to do that. You don't want to do that. So how would we know the resolution for the PDF? Who is checking the resolution curious? Well, the premium can be resized and it's not. Be resized and it's not a problem. The PNG is the one that, if you resize, may distort the quality, right? So that's the one you need the pixels. Oh, the resolution. So if I understand correctly, if you're using the PNG, they want you to size it appropriately so that if it takes up this much space on your... You almost have to do the calculation by hand to figure out how big the individual is on the paper. I don't do the trimming for this, I just specify the width and the height of the image. Yeah, you have ways to do it. Instead of scale and trim, I just write my phone. Oh, I've scaled it too. Well, let me try taking that out and see. I mean, you have to play with these constantly. That's a little bit better, but I haven't. No, but you can say exactly how big you want to be in the picture. So with the exact size of the of the let's put it in the square bracket. The square breadth. Like what? What size would you want? 0.3 centimeters or stuff like that. Oh, okay, so like exactly like width. Oh, like 3 centimeters. That'll skew it, though. I don't know if it'll... I see what you're saying. I mean, let's just say that any properties you want to add to it, you can add within the square brackets. So this is PDF. This is PDF. Yeah. Looks fine to me. You don't need to worry about the particular resolution, it's for the bitmap like PNG or JPEG or but I do dreaming if I produce graphics with latest, for example, and then uh uh the PDF I go and crop like whatever I need for Crop like whatever I need for we didn't need to crop the PDF though, it turned out quite nice. Yeah. Even though it didn't show. Yeah, if you specify to inside the size of the well, you could do something like width is equal to like text length or something. Like it'll it'll scale to the as wide as the text is. As wide as the text is something like that, that could work. So, or is it page length? Maybe up. Oh. There was an error, but I can't remember if it's page width or page. There's a whole bunch of different ones that you can look up. I can't remember what they are at the top of my head. Is it text width is an option I guess? Text width, that's what it is. Do you have to do something? No, I did text length. Oh, I think. Oops, I made a mistake. Sorry. So that's going to scale to the width of the text in the document. And it'll scale that accordingly. So you can go bigger, like you could do like 1.5 text width. It'll make the image bigger based on that. You can go smaller. You can go smaller? You see, the problem is, of course, if you work on a single document that you're going to be producing as PDF, then you can incorporate the graphics inside and use it. But when we submit programs for Kangaroo, we need the graphics separately. We have to separately. And then the image must not have white areas around, so it must be only where the like the lines are. Buying cell. The PDF did that for us. And then you included. Then I included it. Yeah. Okay, so that's. How do you know that PDF saved you? I mean, there's no really way to look other than when you add it and it doesn't take up a whole huge portion of space. I can check, I think I may have some code for that if I'll check, but now my laptop. I think I'll check, but now my laptop is down. So I'll check and share. So, okay. Exactly. No, I know. When you create in LaTeX, so just to give the size that is required, not extra. I'll check. I think I have. Okay, so the last tool I wanted to show you, which I really like, is and I kind of started this one. And I kind of started this one based on what Patrick showed us this morning: draw.io. And the reason I like this is you can do a lot of what I would consider more child-appropriate drawings in draw.io. And so it works very similar to GeoGibra, it's just a little bit more, less, I guess, mathematical where we're not looking to make like circles or graphs. We're making drawings based on what we want to do. So you talk about rectangles. Based on what we want to do, so you talked about kangaroo jumping. We could probably do that in here. Most of your tools that you want to use for draw.io are on the right here. So you can look up things that are already in the system. So there's probably a bunch of different images based on different types of animals. If they're not there, you can add your own images to the system as well. Yeah, that's nice. They have kangaroos. Oh, you found the kangaroo? You found the kangaroo, so yeah, kangaroo is already in their system, and so this is draw.io, and so uh it's also good for flow charts, like if there's problems with flow charts or there's some sort of charts that you want to draw, there's a lots of like you can put in circles and then really quickly like have an arrow attached to the to there and then kind of like draw out like that. Like you can do it really quickly. Like you can do it really quickly, and if you make mistakes, they're really easy to fix because everything is kind of its own object. Kind of like what we see in Adobe Photoshop and Curl Draw, where things are their own objects and we can kind of move them around. If we want to, we could have angled arrows as well. If we wanted to make flowcharts, if we wanted to copy things that were the same, we could do that. And then we can like connect them here like that, right? And so they connect really easily. You can have arrows coming off in different directions on the Arrows coming off in different directions on objects. I can select things and delete them quite quickly. And so for a lot of my drawing, I really like using draw.io. I would say this is very similar to the draw tool, drawing tool. Visio. Microsoft Work has drawing. Maybe simpler, not so simple. The nice thing about this that I like is you can use it anywhere. It's web-based. Exactly. And so you don't have to have a license for something to use it. To use it. And then, even with things like the kangaroo, like you can have arrows coming off the kangaroo. You can add freehand drawing as well if you're good at that, which I'm not. And so there's all sorts of stuff that you can do with that. Once you have a drawing that you like, there's a few different options that you can kind of use to export. And so if it's something that you're going to use against. Something that you're going to use again and you're going to want to edit. You can save it as a.draw.io file. And that is kind of like a working version of it if you want to make changes to it later. Another thing that's nice about draw.io that I should have mentioned, if you want to add text inside of an object, it's really easy to do using stuff on the right side here. Stuff on the right side here. So if I wanted to add text to this, I kind of just double-click inside of it and say, okay, no, one. It's kind of done. I can pick my font for it. I can pick my style. I can pick if I want to make it old or not. And I can always go back and change it later on if I want to as well. And so that's a nice added feature of it as well. So again, since we're for kangaroo, we're kind of limited to what we want to export as. We have some export options here. There's PNG, JPEG, PDF sounds like what would make most sense. And so we can export this as a PDF. We can crop if we want to. To we don't necessarily want the grid, so we can do that, and so we'll just call this Okay, so I mean this is the PDF. Can you edit do you have a professional uh to to try to edit if we can edit Look if we can edit. Yeah, so if okay, so if you want to edit, you should save this file as a draw.io file and then edit it later on. No, no, I meant I understand that using this application in its internal format, you can get the kind of drawing and manipulate further. Like the PDF itself is in picture-based, so this? Yeah. Oh, oh, it's like from within like Adobe? Sometimes we we don't Sometimes we don't do very complicated changes in PDF, but something simple sometimes may be needed. So like Adobe Professional would be expected. So here's Adobe Acrobat Pro. Like what would you want to do to it? Can you change the text? Yeah, for example, we change the text in French. In French or something yes or sometimes when we write solution I save the image and then maybe circle students, children that hold hands, how many hold their right hands or left right and whatever question like that we had. And we want to kind of indicate where the hands are correct as we want to be and we Want to be, and we what I'm saying is we kind of edit this image, so yeah, add dioso, circles, effects. Well, what I mean, before I heard that you didn't want PNGs, one nice thing about draw.io is if you export it as a PNG, you can go back and edit it as many times as you want. Right. So that's that's one nice feature of it. But if you're not allowed to want, like uh I mean, we are advised not to. We are advised not to. So if we use, then it should be good resolution. But the advice is not to, in case there is a need of modifications. Especially JPEG alias. Yeah. Yeah, you can change text, you can delete objects here, like if I didn't want this angry like new. So everything's kind of their own object and you can go. Is kind of their own object, and you can go and delete them if you want to. So, yeah, I really like this one. You can move images around. So, like, what kind of stuff are you using now for the movie's book? Like, that you can open. It's got a nice selection of 3D objects, too. I really like that draw, actually. Draws handy, like, you can all sorts of stuff. I tried Geogeva. I mean, yeah, probably it's good for some reason. Probably it's good for some maybe. Geogebra for me is for problems where you're trying to indicate things that have mathematical properties. Coordinates, angles, stuff like that. For drawings that for like little kids, I don't think it's maybe quite helpful for them. This I like for that sort of thing, just because they have lots of childish-looking images, you can import your own. You can import your own. There's all sorts of stuff you can do. Is there a license? No, it's all included in the software. I've never had anything. It's like that. Is this free software? I don't think so. Yeah, it's free. Is that free? Can you install or do you? No, you go to the website. I had these going before, so if you want to try, just go draw. Try, just go draw.io and you can try for yourself and so right now and what is my favorite. So is it everything else for free or there are entirely because sometimes they simple version free and then no everything is included. Yeah. I mean less you can be quite tricky if it's it's included. But if you use it for commercial purposes and you use At least you're supposed to mention the name of the company device. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, pretty much all of my research papers which would be considered commercial because the publisher sells it. No, it's a commercial. No, no, no. So, okay, that's different. But we're s uh selling the solution. I mean, we can check with them. I've never had any, I've never heard of that, but. I've never heard of that, but it's possible. I should mention the images are made. We don't use all the solutions. Directly edited PDFs or latest solutions are trying to. So when you're using TICSAT currently, what are you doing? How are you using TICSAT? My battery died, and I can't. But you're not writing the code. Code? We are reading codes. Okay, so then I thought you had to export it as a separate image. Well, for the solutions, do you do it? Oh, for the solutions? You don't for the question paper. For submitting problems for sub proposals, then we have to separate the image. With the solutions, we don't need to do that. Everything is inside. We're submitting the problems for the KSC. For submitting the problems for the KSF meeting, the images need to be submitted. That makes sense. There are mindly changes that they made. Are you talking about the questions that you receive after the conference is over and you have? No, no, no, that was before I see. After all, we still read it. What file formats do they set? They set uh EPS, uh encapsulated PostScript. Uh I mentioned at the beginning, I kind of like maybe I can go and check uh PDF and there was one more vector graphic like uh yeah, EPS you'll probably use like Photoshop or something like that. To make something like that. Those are like vector images. Exactly. Yeah. So this Exactly. So this but you can export as PDFs and or PDF and this usually we almost always have the PDFs for occasionally we have like PNG or JPEG that we use and this could be because they are not among the selected problems because we sometimes use not. Oh, so one of the selected different problems? So they usually prepare everything in PDF, so all the images come for the selected. But Luis, maybe you can say more about this. Not really. You are not good at this. Our secretary is. I know that Alex is dealing with this and I usually have with him back and forth. Sometimes he doesn't like some of my kind of graphics and oh, can you redo this this way? So we go back and forth. So he's the only. Back and forth, and so he's the only, but we are getting in the end they may redo some uh throwings, okay? Uh, and if they don't like, then uh, the boy and the end. Yeah, but I think that the best solution for you is just to ask Alex exactly what he wants, and you have an expert here who will do exactly what is needed. So I think you have a treasurer here who can help you with the question submission. Yeah, I mean, I think. I do this all this. I know how to do this. I mean, of course. What we are trying to say is: if somebody wants to help with proposals for problems, if they want to prepare the graphics well, if they don't, we can go with them and others do it. But each member proposes how many. Each member proposes how many problems for the meeting? At least six. Six? At least. At least six. Then we have countries that propose 100. Six per age group or six total? Six. Total. That's the minimum. So six times 100 members, you have 600 problems to kind of roughly. No, but we have members who submit 100 questions. Oh, 100. So we have, I think at the end, we have like 2,000 questions. Wow, okay. That's where they have to come in with a little maximum, because some countries would would submit a lot of questions, but they are not necessarily the highest qualities. So we are more encouraging people to look at the quality, not the quality. And when you go to the newsletter, to the website I showed you, there are two articles, I think the second newsletter and the third newsletter, of two experienced people who share experience how. People who share experience how they choose the questions. They only submit maybe up to 20, but there is a high percentage of these questions that are chosen because they have a pool of, let's say, 30, 40 questions. And they don't just say, okay, we have 40 questions, let's submit all of them. No. They have a committee, they meet, they discuss what is good, what's not good, what to change, and then they submit best Change and then they submit the best 12, let's say. So I think that's a wonderful thing to do. So you have a question that how from those 2,000 we select the papers. Yes. How do we pair it down? What we do is that there is a chair of each group that in advance, like two months or one month in advance, do a press election because we can write in the system, all the members can write in the system. All the members can write in the system the best questions, the questions they like the most. So this chair do a press election and then
