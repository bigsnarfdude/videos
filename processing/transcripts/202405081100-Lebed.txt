Offline, online organizers for making this happen, and I'm very happy to be here. So, this talk will be a mixture of a panoramic talk, but sorry, without panoramic pictures, and an ongoing project. So, I hope the mixture of two will be adapted to the audience. So, let's start. Meet 16 and a half of the title of my talk being structure groups. So here. So here I will talk about structural panels, which were not mildly discussed today, just to remove those of you who are not very used to SF piece and the linear operation, which is this nice atoms to decorate. The operation is either potent that when you see the right multiplication by C is bijective and the most important condition is the sub-distributivity. The two of them together just say that right multiplications are isomorphism of quantum. They preserve the quantum version. As these structures appeared independently in different areas, so here I will mention only two modulations. Two motivations because they will be relevant to what follows. First, they are used to construct note invariants. So you can look at diagrams of notes of inks and then trying to colour them by the elements of a set and saying that. I'm saying that if a strand goes under another strand, it changes its colour. So this should remind you of the vertical representation of the fundamental group of the complement of the node. And if you want the number of such color points to be invariant, you can throw in three moves, look at the color points, and they will get precisely the three conditions corresponding to these three corrections. Conditions corresponding to this three-direct attribute. And second, these structures can be examples of solutions in the unpact equation. And moreover, these are a very important solution because of the structure. I will see structured bundles. In the calculation stage, just structurated structures. This is starting from any is a theoretic solution you can construct such an object and they are related to what many people here call correct solutions. Direct solutions. And there are certainly many more. One of the main example which you consider here, starting from a group. You can construct a quantum called the conjugation quantum of the group as a set on the dictator and as the triangle iteration is saying the conjugation. And this is the main example for those of you who like free structures. Well, like three structures, the free model subset will be the subset, a sub-model of the transportation model of the pre-group. Something which is very easy to describe. Another way of looking at this is saying that if in your group you forget the product and the product structure and the unit element, but you do serve on education and you would like to And you would like to uh uh uh to list all the properties which education in any group should satisfy, this will do precisely these three properties. That's it. And you can go in the opposite direction, starting from a model you can construct. Alrighty, so a lot of times here, which is called the associated group, or the structure group, or the enveloping group, or the joint group. I hope I didn't forget their name. This makes actually reading literature very complicated. So this is on the same end. We have seen the presentation of both tense. We take one generator per element of the quantum and one relation of the electron. Or any couple. Usually, people just write A and not EA, but for me it's important to keep this distinction between an element of X and the associated an element of Q and the associated numerator of the associated group. You will see later why this is open. And the very elementary remark it you can rewrite this uh Please uh can you use it just conjugation? I mean conjugation in the associative group of the important data. So there are different ways of looking at these groups. They are invariants, obviously. They are invariants of the solution. On the other hand, this is like in Tatiana's approach. It's a way of constructing groups in altogether with nice properties. But the point is, these things are usually very hard to describe. The only family of bundles for which I know explicit descriptions and a complete understanding of the features are is what is called Alexander panels. So for any other panelists So for any other panelists uh you just have this presentation. Yes. I suppose it's quite a simple calculation that this uh associated group and the patient control are from a joint pair. So this is what you were supposed uh I was going to write down. Okay. So if for uh in general and other people like in categories, you can consider the category of models and the category of groups and these associated These, the associated construction and the contribution construction will make a pair of conjures matches. Right, beautiful. And my aim is to understand the associated groups of contribution points. So, this is the object I'm interested in. Is it fair to say that the fact that you have an adjunction absorb is actually quite a simple calculation? Just one thing? It's pretty obvious if you write what it means. It doesn't go beyond definitions. The proof does not go beyond definitions. Yeah, so this is my. Describe the associated group of contribution points. Yeah, this will follow in a couple of minutes, Gerald. We don't need a minute. I know your question, but I want. So what first elementary theme, but which will play a role? Which will play a role afterwards. Since this theme will be mentioned very often, I will call this just any conjugate, the associated group of the contribution part. So one thing extremely easy to describe is the idealization of this gamete. First, from I will call it star. I will call it star from the defining relation. You see that in a debalonization of this thing you have E of A equals E of B by times B. So you should identify all the So you should identify all elements coming from the same object and then this becomes just the condition. So the organization of this guy is the pre-evilian group and that is the dominant of conjugation of conjugation classes. And this is conjugation classes. You can think of it as a grading by z power n, and this is actually true for any for any associated groups of solutions or the power. Another elementary thing. One more thing you that Gerald would like to do, but this is saying that if you have the joint boxes, you have a metric like this. So how does it work? Here you have generators which are indexed by a remote of a group. You can send it to your group. A group and this defined in a relation. If you send that new group, it means A times B is A B times A conjugated by the clock. This is true. And of course, this is subjective because you have an E of E A for any E. So you can consider the kernel and it's pretty easy. And it's pretty easy to prove that it will be central AOG. So what it actually means, we say that the group we are interested in is a central extension of the original group. Just one remark so you can see this thing is so by definition it's if you call this method phi it's the greenish point that you say it's central you might wonder whether it's interface not really Not really, but not so far. Because the center, the whole center, you can prove that it's 5 minus 1 of the center of G. If your group has a trivial center, then this will be the whole set. Not only a central subgroup, but the whole set. Okay. And another remark. Another remark I can provide a similar construction for Alexander and co-wantels for those who know what these are. It means that if I have the associated group, I can send it back to the structure. To the set, uh, to the structure from which I started. And I have no idea of what the general setting of this uh central extension thing are. This is a cyber map for people who know about such things. Let's look more precisely at this map. It has an obvious Set theoretical section, take a nomad A and look at the E of A. But it's not a group map, because if you take your product, it's just E A B, which is not E A times E B. You can look at it at the The product of two elements here, one element should be true. It is never actually true. And as usual, in this kind of situation, you can look at what I call the hypomorphicity defect, the defect of this map, the difference between this map and a group map, which is which I construct like this, which is You just measure to what extent the satirical section is not a good. And I normalize it by this element. The special element you often see here is the of g because it's sent by this map to one. That's a kind of anomalization. kind of anomalization. And if you consider the math pi, you send this to a, b, a, b minus 1, 1 minus 1. The whole thing is Ï€. So it goes to 3G. And you can write down the properties of this, which will say that it's a symmetric equivalent root to casecope. In general, in general addition, what is it that you have a sample extension by this group cosyps? What does it mean? In principle, if you know the second cohomology of this group, it can be helpful. Why don't we can put examples where this is featured? As for us, it's just a side remark. I need a little one bit of place to finish this. One nice proposition is that since it's settled, it's a billion group. And in a billion group, it is generated by the image of this manner. And the element, the one element. You understand this cosine? You also understand how the question which I cannot answer in general: what can it do quite this? Is it really language? Does it have to ocean in general? I have some information about this, right? But very simple question. So I think mentioned there are two black boxes here, that KFG is central, and that the image of the co-cycle generates entire KFG. Are these simple calculations? I cannot I'm not able to do complicated calculations with So now one more thing which I mean has not been mentioned yet. For this I will this is pretty general. I need a finite quantal and if I have a finite quantal or any element from it, I can pick. I can pick depending on index, which which I will call I will call D C such that if I die by multiplication these times, I get identity. It's easier to say that for any element if you want to draw it by C. If you have to plan by C tant, you always get 3. Multiplication is just a permutation of the finite set, so that in power of it should be 3. Just a number. Pretty easy. In this calculation, you can check that if you take the corresponding generator and p And peak this power of the generator, it will be central in my associated even more if I take two elements from the same orbit orbit. With respect to these massive apps, then they will have this in decrease even more. These special elements coincide. The coincident generators might be different, but they are nice powers, should coincide. And it means that Inside of the associated group, of the associated group, you can consider the cell configurated by these guys. It is the following. Here is sent arrow like this. So our orbit n is the number of orbits u cubed and so to any generator you pick an orbit representative from this orbit. You take the grape point a power, this will be a fragile salt. And the important thing is that the quotient will be finite. Finite. This is what this theorem says. So your groups will be virtually ready and with all the consequences it has on the structure of the group. So if you have to ask number two over here, N. Oh, M could be NFI. Oh, here. Not here, but like four. We got the four. This all works in the internet set uh finite assumption here. Uh so uh it's time to uh to move to the And if you move to the second half in the title, I'll talk now about education groups. And the whole point is that at the end of the level I'm going to give you things about these groups, or the uh these associated associated groups, or the particular uh sort of education groups. Podcast. So, what the definition is very elementary I will call it symbol group. I will explain why this notation. It's a group which has a particular type of presentation. It's a group which has a presentation. It's a group which has a presentation, finite to infinite, where all the relations are of two types. It can be a co-education relation, hence the C in the C book, and it can be a And it can be a uh what they call power relation. I impose that certain powers of certain generators vanish and the mass transforms is positive. You say the contribution is when you you contribute is another generation? Yeah. You'll see it in examples. And just a small technical assumption, I want only one question like this, per contribution class. First things. And you have a notion of cgroup without the bar. That means in a presentation which has only conjugation functions. The first work I know about it is the work of Kurikov. Of Pudico get the definition in 93 and in 1994 he will be an interesting thing. All the works are about cgroup. Why I added this notion because I will add it later. So if you prove that c groups are pretty So to prove that the C groups are precisely the fundamental groups of the complements. By this I mean n-dimensional compact oriented manifold, manifold without a boundary living here. Well and uh this is not as surprising as I might s as I might seem. If you remember the little picture I drew about knots, you can draw similar pictures for n-dimensional subspaces of n plus two-dimensional sphere. And if two for n starting from two starting dimension four, you have enough space to In dimension 4, you have enough space to glue the sphere in a way you need, so that the collection of relations are precisely the collection you start with. So that would mean some other criteria you put things like you have a CPU if only if it's a code. If only it's happened, co-homologies narrated by quantum products, so homological characteristics of this. There is some more examples of the colours. So the easiest relation which you can write as conjugation is just the commutation, for example, creative books on cojugation books. If you go further, you can look about look at the brain relation. look at the rate relation what does it mean it means that if you conjugate a by b and then by a you get you should just introduce a new generation a generator for this guy so more generally I'm gonna use an RC group it would be a C group and it coexiter group This is the point where Eric should ask me for examples. And I hope to have enough time at the end to do the complete computations of Eric's favorite example, which is SN. Uh I know you know welded groups, uh valid breakgroups, budget breakgroups and other generators, uh other generalizations of breakgroups, very often they are how the relations can be reduced to conjugation and powers. Uh for those of you who who will be here tomorrow during my Yeah, so already during my colleagues' talks there are also cactus groups and cricket groups, which you will see, which are examples of those. And now the example is Thompson's F or Thompson group F, it did miss the presentation having only education relations. Those of you have no certainly fundamental group of the complement of the link. It's got in your presentation as only conjugations. The most important example here that when I give you the definition of the association Definition of the associated group of a model by engineering this relations. I pointed out that the relations are actually contribution relations. And define the quotients, we quotient by subpowers, and of course, see by powers. Well, you can take your favorite, it is very likely to be. After half those money time, I can't do it. Now that you understood the title, I can give you an extract from this talk. So, what can I tell you about the object that I'm interested in? So, first So it's we notice that the associated groups of quadelsa C groups, it actually goes also the other way around. I will show you how to realize every C group and the associate group of a particular quad. Things can look very similar. What is the fundamental difference? Here, you have a presentation where you have Where you have some generators and contribution relations only for some generators. Here you have conjugation relations for all generators. This is the fundamental difference between these guys. To give you a reference, it was a decoupled oh that it was the theorem was. Then the theorem was also read something about the the language but some young mathematicians. I will not dare pronounce it. And the converse to the uh to this stigma is also true, but in a more restrictive setting. Setting if you consider only final groups without the students. For these groups, it's the same thing as being those types of pioneer functions of some parts. And the example I promised you is demonstrate a particular case of this. All statements, statements of all, and those if you take a C group then plus this one you have actually got a I showed you that in general it will this is uh several extensions, but Cycle extensions, but encoded by some to cycle. Here I'm saying that, in particular, in case of C groups, this is very true. So you understand, you understand this object pretty well. And my conjecture coming from the thesis from Alf Ryder, which was not published and therefore a very uh Not very well known. She conjectures actually that the subtle extension is trivial even on the if GC group. That should give some arguments, but I have no idea how really to put it. I have no idea how really to put. One more statement. Now, if I have a C button loop, then I can consider the balls of P. Now to go from this to the original group of an aperture called Pi, and you have the You have the organization app, which runs in the prevailing. And if I put them together, I get something injective. Why is it nice? For example, it allows you to solve the web problem. If you know how to solve the web problem for G and how to compute for GPS classes in your group. What is classes in your room? What program what is that? But it also corollary what what can this uh central subgroup look like? Of by definition it's a turnoff of P planet. If you take the kernel of fire, that this kernel will sit inside here, which means that you have a sample of the free algorithm group, the particular I don't know how to get the small at the end, but I don't know how to compute it precisely in the general. I don't only I can do only one thing about it. I don't know if that's a terrible, but I can show that it's at least n minus number of contributor classes of When I say in the generators of G, I mean the following G. We said that G was a C bar group, so consider a special C BA representation which has only educational issues and the power relations. I'm looking at this one and consider only those of each unit rank. Only those only those for whom I didn't I didn't I need the integral point in powers in the case where u group is finite uh n i equals n z cover i equals m and g s five Situations I know what is this. Have any questions? I will not give the proof of all these statements, but I will show to you the meaning with that. In particular, I will show you one group. Any group group of the pieces of the pressure. Let's go back to our web pie. This is definitely to be. It seems definitely too big. I suppose that I have a C if I want to present G as an associated group of something, it will definitely not be the conjugation of one group because it's going to make. But I have something smaller, which I will make. Yeah. Nice A C R G I mean the presentation which has only presentation conditions. And out of this I can construct a quantum which is just the union The union of masses are the generators from this particular presentation. I consider the OGBC classes, and this will actually be a subcontroller. A self-portal of the conjugation button of buttons much much smaller. And then the FP is just thick the associated book of this. This index bundle and it's easy to go from here to here. You are just sending the corresponding generators to the themselves. And you can consider the uh position here. I can call theta. And my theorem says that C to E1 to 1 This is it will actually be metadata. It's also something very simple. We just look at writ what's rewriting. Just look at what to write means here and here. Essentially, the same thing. And you present G as the associated group of this quantum, which is a sub quantum of the V. It means that. It has actually a group section, not only a theoretical section, but a group section. So from here to here, just like the other one. Well, here to here, you just compose theta minus one, build this back here and here gives you a group presentation, a group section. How does it work in practice? You take an element from here, you uh recall this uh this presentation of this you get. There you go, and if you you uh write this down, huh? When you uh write this element using your generators like this then to this you associate Associate corresponding thing, but in the generators here. You don't uh pick the the generator. You don't pick P, but you pick only the expressions in the generator. And of course, because of these sections, you get that heavy error product. If you recall what I explained at the beginning, for general G, it is an extension which is indexed by certain Tucca cycle phi. And here you can actually show precisely that your Tucca cycle will be about a boundary for a map which you can very explicitly calculate. You can go for You can go from G to KG by sending A to a corresponding generator and that you name sigma for this map. Sigma minus 1 and this normalization. Just measure the difference between your obvious set theoretic set theoretical section and the That's the theoretical section and the uh more smart the smarter section of the tier. Rachel Lewis will do the sounding practices. Are there any questions? What happens if k and g k of g is one? If g never is one, or can be one? Because uh oh because of this. So K uh KOG is pre-group and uh but that would be okay. Smaller one. If you're looking at this, it's always smaller more than one, especially for example this guy is definitely much bigger. This can be fine and this can never be. So, we will move to this example of this group. Let's start with the break rule because it's a sequel, so it's easier. So to make it this zero, we need to add some writers which group which are simply by drawing pictures. I draw pictures I and I plus one. Okay. Permutation. Okay. If you conjugate sigma y by sigma y plus 1, you get this intermediate function. And when you conjugate at least one by sigma y, you get sigma y plus. These two? Yes, I give you the usual break relation. Just two parts. This theorem, which allows you to represent it as the associated group of some condo, actually tells you that you can change the set of generators. You can take all the quantities the generators. This is an infinite set of generators and This occupational relations, but now for all this is what this A of P looks like this. So it's curious to say that there is a representation which is somehow between the two, where you take only certain quadrates of the generators and which comes from the George Breakgroups. Somehow your break groups are indefinite. Is the action on both sides the same? Same here, you are indexed by the I can find here. It is in the context. So now to move on to Cn, we need to add only one relation, one squared plus one. The other relations are conjugates of it, so you don't need it. At least you get a single group. Here d equals d for all the elements, and they're actually all generators are attributes. So It's a very nice thing. You have an onset teacher music and bigger than two for this. The theorem I said you showed it'll be the final. So, this will be the finite quotient of this one. In both cases, you just model by the squares. This is not complicated. But the interesting thing is that now the A of the A of this group, so the associate group of the uh contribution model. Contribution model. It will see that inside of the project of Risan, here you need to put the number of projugacy classes here. I don't know what the standard notation of the number of petitions is. You can do more computations, but you need you can let's see, look at It's pretty easy to compute. And it will be almost even It's a test. There was a sign on the door saying there was a test at 2 DM, which is not. They have to bring the fire. The sign on the door said that we can definitely step it's good. This is my cost. This is a test of the national public alerting system by the government. So, for more information, please visit the Alarm Friday website. The process will be just the even part of this electron group. It means in particular that control what happens to C group, the original group will never sit inside this group. Because here there is no, the option is to. Here there is no the notion is just too small, there is no place for a sensitivity. I can also describe this thing. So I'm not looking at the whole group, I'm looking only at the operators. So this this means that I'm looking only at the contribution classes of generators, which means I'm looking only on the transpositions. It will be an expression of SN. an an expression of Sn by Z by a cosycle, which is rather curious and which you can write out very implicitly, given two transpositions. It will tell you one that they are both what and zero otherwise. And the last thing All this has a nice application for those who know it. You can compute H2, the second parameter, the other SN using this. Uh I'll just give you the uh uh one classical sequence in my uh Plus, it's got zero and three bytes out from here. Nice everyone. I used almost all the wipe shots available. This is another way to make this do matter. So I don't explain to you what the homology of the quantum is, uh but I'm saying that you can compute it, if you can compute in the associative group. So it will be the direct sum over all the points. Oh, a deformity, you think. A stabilizer of this group which is a group bundle of some element VI is just a representative of this orbit intersected with the kernel of E. Of episode 1, which is all generated 1 and you generate it. So you need to compute some stabilizers. Stabilizers are very easy to compute here. You have a commutative device. You have a commutative part, so you need stabilization symmetry groups. This you know. You know how to have a length, so uh simple work in the symmetry group allows you to uh describe this completely in this case. Thank you.
