So, Peter said that I went to the hiking yesterday, so I got a picture like this. Okay, so the first speaker of today's session is Professor Shimojo Masashiko Shimojo from Oklahoma University of Science. Title of his talk is Convergence to Traveling Wave for the Logarithmic Diffusion. For the logarithmic diffusion equation with reaction task, please. Thank you for the introduction. Hello, everyone. My name is Masashi Koshimojo from Okayama University of Science. Before I start my presentation, I'd like to express my thanks to organizers, Professor Hiroshima and Professor Hirokazu Ninomiya, and Professor Pita Takachi and Professor Rossi for giving me a chance to speak today. To speak today, my talk will be focused on one of the three thema of this workshop. The second thema, which is the diffusion quantum geometry. I will start with talking about the background and the overview of logarithmic diffusion, then focus point on the program. Then focus point on the problem with reaction terms. Finally, I will explain the idea of the proof of our main theorems. Let me first explain what the logarithmic diffusion equation is. Logarismic diffusion is a heat equation with non-linear diffusion of the following form. W sub t is equal to Laplacian log of w. This This heat equation appears in the context of rich flow on 2D plane in differential geometry, which was first considered by Angenent and in 1993. And it's also appeared in the plasma physics, which is called Longman-Hirosse model, which is a coupled model of Laplace equation and the Maxwell distribution. Equation and the Maxwell distribution and Ohm's law. And another application of rawism equidifusion appears, this is one-dimensional problem, appear in the Carleman model, which is a simplified Boltzmann equation. And the Carleman model is the hyperbolic coupled equation, but by taking a singular limit, we take the logarithmic. We take the logarithmic diffusion equation as of one-dimensional reflection. And Litero was considered by Richard Hamilton and Charles and Kavaris Suzuki, especially on S2, and they also by Xu and Dascaroporos and El Piran Seam on R2, which uh they consider the asymptotic behavior of literal on R2. Behavior of each row on R2. For logarithmic diffusion equation, the space is generalized to n-dimensional Euclidean space and Xu and Hui Kim and John Shengu considered a radio symmetric solution of low-end diffusion higher dimension. And for today, we consider one-dimensional problem. We consider one-dimensional problem, and the one-dimensional problem was considered by Peter Takachi, and Zhang, and Chaiye Osha, and Ralston. They considered the stability of a monotone traveling wave on the line. Now, let me explain one result about rolarism liquid diffusion of our result. Roderick and the Basque. Roderick and Vasquez considered logarithmic diffusion on a line. W sub t is second derivative, and they have found that the exist verpositeness hold under the flux boundary condition at space infinity, which is the equation on the second line. The boundary this boundary condition, first boundary condition means w decays to e to the minus beta x at plus infinity. theta x at plus infinity and decays e to decays the order e to the power alpha times x at x minus infinity. This condition is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the solution. And we can easily see that all I should mention that I consider only positive solution. So W's initial data is positive. And it is easy to show that all solutions extinct in a finite Solution extinct in a finite time, which can be easily checked by integrating the Robeson liquid diffusion equation on a space and using a flux boundary condition. We can prove that time derivative of the mass, which is the integral of w xt on space, is equal to minus alpha plus beta. If we use the flux boundary condition and fundamental formula of calculus, Fundamental formula of calculus, we can prove if we can check this formula easily. And integrating on space, we can prove that the mass of the solution becomes zero in a finite time. And this time, capital T is equal to the maximal existence time of the solution of Roderick and Basque. And Fita Takachi, Yanagida, and myself get the detailed asymptotic behavior. Detailed asymptotic behavior of this extinction. The result is summarized like this: that we scale the equation W according to the self-similar structure of the logarithmic diffusion equation. Then, capital U of X tau is here, capital U of X tau is defined by dividing. is defined by dividing the w by capital T minus T. So the mass of the function u which this has a restoration on a mass. So for all capital time t, the mass is preserved. And in order to know the asymptotic behavior of that the time t converged to capital T, we rescale also the time and introduce a new time variable tab. New time variable tau. Tau is defined by log of 1 over capital T minus T, then we can transform the equation to the autonomous system of capital U equation. And we can prove that the solution capital U converge to some traveling parts. So traveling parts are one which exists uniquely up to shift. So the asymptotic behavior. So, the asymptotic behavior of the extinction can be described by scaling, and that after scaling, the shape converges to some universal shape, and that propagates with a constant speed to one direction. This is a known result of logarithmic diffusion equation. These are the results. And today, I'm trying to I'm planning to talk about low-listen liquid diffusion with reaction terms. And that work is a joint work with Eiji Yanagida, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Hiroshima of Kanagawa University, and Arnold Monobe, who is the third speaker of today's session, and myself. Now let me start my today's pro topic. Today's pro topic. Is there any questions or comments? Or no, nothing? Okay. Anyway, let us start today's topic. I'm now we consider the following monostable reaction, the lobarismic diffusion with monostable. With monostable reaction term. The equation is u sub t is equal to log of u second derivative plus u 1 minus u. And we assume the flux boundary condition at space infinity. That means limit x go to plus infinity log of u sub x is equal to minus beta, and the limit x minus infinity of u of xt is equal to 1. So the solution decays with the rate e to the minus beta x at x plus infinity and converge to 1 at x minus infinity. This equation was considered by Lord Rosenov and he proved that the existence of traveling waves. In fact, the profile In fact, the profile equation of this logistic logarithmic diffusion equation can be solved explicitly by separation of variables. So all the solution, all the traveling wave profile can be written explicitly by this function y of z is equal to 1 over 1 plus e to the beta of z, where z is equal to x minus xi t. And she Ct and C can be determined uniquely from beta. This is a, I should mention that this, so the structure of traveling wave is different from that of semi-linear problem. So we don't have a minimal speed and thus propagation speed can be determined uniquely from the equation. And what we proved is the following. If U0 satisfies the same boundary condition. Satisfy the same boundary condition, flux boundary condition and boundary condition at space infinity, then that converges to a traveling wave. So there exists some real value x star that u of x t minus phi x minus c t plus x star converges to zero uniformly on space as t goes t diverges to infinity. This is the first The first is one of the main results of our work. And we solve the open problem that Rosenau the paper explains now. Now I shall explain the idea of the proof briefly. First, in order to prove the convergence, we'd like to prove the omega limit function on the moving coordinate converged to the shape of the traveling wave. This is the strategy. This is the strategy. So, in order to prove that the omega limiting function is non-trivial, first we need to trap the function solution horizontally by two traveling fronts. In order to do that, we construct two sub-band super solutions. As a step one, we trap the UXT by the following function of the form. This is the sub-band super solution. And in fact, for this problem, this sub-wand super solution is also exact solution. So we can easily check that by substituting this green function. function substituting into this equation, we get exact solution of the logarithmic, this logarithmic diffusion equation with logistic reaction term. Anyway, we can construct sub-band super solution. And by the comparison principle, U of X T is trapped horizontally by two sub-band super solution. And this Super solution and this these seven super solution converges to a traveling wave as t goes to infinity. So u of xt is trapped, but is bound on the moving coordinate, the u of xt is bounded. And in order to prove the in order to prove that only a limiting function In order to prove that omega limiting function is equivalent to the shape of a traveling wave, we need to consider the structure of all stationary solutions on the moving frame. Here, log of phi, the traveling wave profile satisfies the second deviative of log of phi minus c phi plus phi 1 minus phi is equal to zero. Is equal to zero and satisfy the two corresponding flux boundary condition and boundary condition at minus infinity. So this is the I draw the curve by purple curve that corresponds to the traveling front. And if we look at this traveling front on the phase plane, that here Here, the left figure is the phase plane. The horizontal line is a phi coordinate, and the vertical line is psi, is defined by the first derivative of log of phi. Then, the traveling front is a straight line connecting the point 2.10 and 0 minus beta. This straight line segment corresponds to the traveling front. From and we consider all trajectory in the phase plane. That means we consider all the solution of the same equation as above satisfying the different flux boundary condition. And by simple shooting argument, if we change beta slightly small, then the Then the solution phi of solution curve of phi of that beta tilde in the phase plane is a curve of this blue curve. And also, if beta tilde is a little small, the solution curve is something like this. It can be in fact the same thing. In fact, every curve can be written explicitly since it has a fast integral. And let me define the omega limiting function. Omega limiting function on the moving coordinate is a limiting limit function of the u of z dc plus plus c t plus c t j, t plus t j. The convergence limit is the The convergence limit is the omega limiting function u sub omega z comma t. Here, I should mention that omega limit function can be defined on all time. t can take from minus infinity to plus infinity. So omega limiting function is an entire solution. And the key lemma to prove our theorem is the following one. Our theorem is the following one. Let beta and beta tilde be different, and u sub omega minus phi of the beta tilde has a degenerate zero point, then they are equivalent. If we shift the phi, they become the same function. I mean, the shape is this equivalent means the shape is the same. I have to shift. Oh, no, no, we don't need to say they are equipped, they are the same function. And this is very strong lemma because since only the information at one point decide all the behavior of the function everywhere. If we check one point, then we know the Hand, we know the omega entire solution. So, this is some type of Lubidu type theory. And this kind of lemma was first introduced by the paper of Yhon Du and Matano, and later developed by Porachik in the series of work. And we generalize this lemma to singular diffusion problem. singular diffusion problem and here the assumption beta is not equal to beta tilde to ensure the intersection number between two solutions is finite. This is needed for this lemma, to prove this lemma. In order to prove this lemma, we use the sterum polia and anginent to mata no zero number. And angular matter node, zero number theory, and some omega property of omega limiting function. Now let me explain how do we use this lemma to prove our main theorem. Now let us recall the behavior, let us recall the curve of traveling waves. waves and we'd like to prove omega limiting function is equivalent to phi of z beta up to shift so on the contrary we suppose that omega limiting function is not cannot equal to equivalent to phi of z beta by any shift by any space shift that uh in That in other words, the solution the shape of omega limiting function is different from that of the shape of phi. So this contradicting assumption implies that the red curve here, red curve represents the omega limiting function. Omega limiting function is the shape is different with phi. Since we have already proved that the function phi is trapped horizontally on the moving coordinate, so omega-limiting function is not one or zero, not trivial. So if we look at the omega-limiting curve on the phase plane, then it is a curve connecting one, zero and minus, zero, minus beta, and it is not strike. And it is not a straight line. Then we shall consider different parameter beta child and look at the solution curve on the phase plane. Then it's at some intersection point, this green point, somewhere there should be some intersection point. If we choose beta. Intersection point. If we choose beta tilde sufficiently close, anyway, there is some beta tilde that red curve and blue curve have some intersection, one intersection phase plane, at least one intersection. What does this mean? This means if we shift the phi of zeta beta tilde by some constant z star, then there is a tangential point. I mean, I mean in this graph, blue curve and red curve have some tangential intersection point. But this is strange because from the key lemma of the previous slide, only by this condition we can conclude that the omega limiting function u of omega zt is completely equal. Completely equivalent, but this is a contradiction from the boundary condition at the space infinity. So the omega limiting function must be equivalent to phi of z beta as a shape. This is the idea of the proof. And the idea also works to buy stable case. Maybe it's a time to close. Cross. Anyway, the same argument also works by stable problems and some phase plane analysis and by using the same similar type of trapping and zero number argument, we can prove that a similar result to the bi-stable equation. So, this concludes my talk. Thank you for so much for your attention. Attention. Thank you very much for a very interesting talk. Are there any questions or comments? Yes, at least. Yes, I have one question. So, in the end, if I understand well, you prove that the omega limit set is composed by trans. Set is composed by translation of phi. So then to prove the convergence, you shouldn't prove that you converge to a single, to the same translation? Ah, yeah, yeah. I didn't explain, but it's for it's trapped by to some under solution, and that converts to some traveling. Okay. So it is impossible to transit to. It is impossible to transit to traveling wave. So, only just through convergence, if we converge to plus infinity, it's converged to only one front. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any question? Yeah, Peter, please. Yeah. Hi, Masaiko. Oh, I have a question about this condition that the difference of the initial. That the difference of the initial condition and the traveling wave profile must be in L1. Ah, L1. If you realize this condition just require that the question. In fact, this one, this one, U0 minus Pi 01. This condition? Yes, this condition is. Yes, this condition is only needed for the existence theorem. So, I think we don't need this condition at the space minus infinity. But since the proof of the existence theorem is the solution can be existence can be proved from the perturbation from the traveling wave. First, there is a compact support difference on the traveling wave. Photo difference on the traveling wave and some do cut cutoff argument. So we need some condition about u0 minus phi. But I think it should be possible to remove at least left condition because it's uh not a singular at all. But uh I I don't know how to prove how to remove that condition. Through how to remove that condition. For the convergence, we don't need this at all. Thank you. Are there any questions or comments? So I have one question. So can you extend this kind of result to replace the logarithmic function to concave function? Concave. I'm not so sure. So, can you extend this is that only for the localism? Yeah, it is possible to extend some negative power nonlinearity to the power minus m and m is some. But if m equals 1 is some critical. M equals 1 is some critical exponent, but if m is between 0 and 1, the verpos can verifyness hold. And I think the yeah, it should be possible because we don't use the structure of special form of the equation so much in the proof. Okay, it's time, so thank you very much again. Thanks.
