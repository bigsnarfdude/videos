And I is my recent work on the fast and stable framework for the local kinetic energy density functional and reconstruction in web damp calculations. It is a joint work with my friends. And my name is Yung Shuo. As the many experts have shown before, the kinetic energy density function also is the crucial for in OFDFT and the total energy can express here. And the TS is the kinetic energy density functionals. And over the years, many approaches have been developed. have been developed to accurately and efficiently to approach to approximate for many for specific systems. First, we have local functionals which depend on the local densities and then we have semi-local functionals. These functionals add the derivative. The derived gradient. And finally, we have no local function also, which introduce the local kernel. And our terms works a lot on this framework. And this framework is more accurate and can reduce the shell structures. More specifically, one class. Specifically, one class of the local KDF is the KEDF with density independent kernel. The main characteristic of this kind of KDF is that the kernel depend only on the average of charge density. So, for the systems like simple metal box systems, it works really It works really good because those systems tend to have uniform charge density, but in the systems like strongly varying electron densities and clusters and less isolated systems, it works only in medium quality. But one of these form is The one is that the computational cost is created linear scaling. You can see the WT functionals not crease so that much. And another class is that the kernel depends on the densities or depends on its gradient. It works really good in Really good in semi-simple metals and the volume systems that also works really good in semiconductors clusters and isolated systems. But the main shade of in terms of computational cost, it at least two orders of magnitude increased, like you can see there. can see there uh you can see there the the war time is 2000 seconds but uh here f plus vw just just 10 seconds so we introduced the tight binding framework to decrease the calculation uh the main the main idea of tight binding approximation is that the total child scan Is that the total charts can be written into this superposition of a reference and the small fluctuations that delta row? But nature tries to reference charge densities is the overlap the atomic charge. You can see in the system, in the silicon systems and the lithium systems, the different. Systems, the data row is small. So we can expand the local kinetic energy density functionals around the overlap atomic charge densities. We expand it to the first order here. And you can see the The local PEDFs and its potential is fixed. And we implement this framework in Review C and LDK MGPA. You can see Review C is accurate for semiconductors and LDKMGPA is accurate for finite systems. So we first tested the voltage. You can see tight bending framework decreased. See tight bending framework decreased at least two orders of magnitude than the original one. You can see here the reverse CT 2000 watt times, second watt times, but the tight banding one only takes about 30. Another benefit is that it can boost the convergence, and you can see. And you can see in the in the test this test suite, a rule is needed 47 steps to converge, but only 10 steps in the tightbanding framework. It's because you just init the local part in the beginning once and during the energy minimization step. The energy minimization step, you just only update the VF and VW is linear scaling cost. But the important question is that is this efficiency achievable without trade-offs? So we test it in many systems. First, we compare the electron densities. You can see the left is review C, the right is. Review C right is LDCAM GTA. You can see the tightbanding framework keeps the same ground electron densities as the origin no one. Here, here, here, they share the same densities. And then we compare the UIs in many systems. The left one, we perform them. They are we performed in single element US. The first picture is energy RSM. The slashed one is the original KDF and the black square is the tight binding framework. And the red one is RevC, the blue one is RDK, MEGKA. GPA, they just keep the same precision as the original KDF here, here, here, here. The result is the same in volume SM APE and bulk modulus. Then we perform it, then we can see the performance in semiconductors. They just close. They just closely match the star here. Then we compare the total energy in the clusters. You can see in the we generated those clusters by our Calypso software. And you can see in the MG50 clusters, the blue one is The blue one is telebending LDKM GPA and the right under the blank square there is the original one. The red one is telebending review C. In this test, the review C does not converge, but the tight binding one framework is converged. And the same result in silicon. Result in silicon clusters. So, so the tidal binding of our simulations introduced the swift linear scaling computational cost and it can perform very good. It performs very good both in simple metal box system and semiconductors and cluster and isolated systems. and isolated systems, these people are writing all. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge all my friends here. Thank you.
