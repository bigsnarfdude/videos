Let me start by thanking the organizers for this wonderful meeting. It's a pity that we can't all meet in person, but anyway, you see, here is my blackboard and possibly you have your blackboard in front of you and perhaps we can convince ourselves that we are all together. So, anyway. Anyway, anything research results and insight will come from my joint work with Sam Pushevsky and Klaus Gulek. We wrote two papers together on this kind of topics. And Marona, Klaus and I also wrote a survey paper about the topology of compactifications of AG. So if you wish, you can have a look at that and you will have many things which I will not discuss at all in this. Discussion at all in this talk. So let me start with some background. So I'm an algebraic geometer, so when I look at an algebraic group, I prefer to look at some kind of geometric incarnation of this. And this is why I care about AG, the modular space of principal. The modulus base of please buy polarized the medium writers. So in a billion variety, well, there is a G here, so I'll dimension G. So in a Belarus variety, it's a projective variety which has the structure of a group. And now we need to fix a polarization to make this kind of problem well-defined. But this will fix the kind of embedding the projective array has in projectives. In geographic space. But Ag can also be constructed as a locally symmetric domain by taking zero space and quotienting it by the action of the symplectic group. So I think this melody charm already called this. Already recalled this, but bigger space is just a space of symmetric matrices with positive imaginary parts. So, every time we have an element over here, we can look for each of these columns over. So, how do we construct an abelian variety out of this? Well, throughout this talk, everything that we discussed in the complex case, so what we need to construct first is a complex tourist. So, the idea is that we can associate people, they are vitalized. The abelian array of dimension G, which is constructed quotiently C to the power G by the lattice generated by the first G standard coordinate vectors and then all integral multiples of the columns of two. The restriction to macrosis with the which are symmetric part comes from the requirement that we want to have a principally polarized albedian varieties because not every possible form, every possible complex stars will allow the existence of such a polarization. And then, if we consider this quotient, for instance, in orbifon, we obtain a time-modified space for principally polarized abelian varieties in the sense that two abelian varieties constructed in this way are isomorphic, if and only if. If and only if the two values of top state belong to the same product for the action of the sigma, moreover, this is a fine modular space. At least, if we consider it as an article or as a stack, we have a universal family. So, the one to have larger space, such that the fiber or tool is isomorphic to this abelian variety associated to that parameter, the constellation. So, the idea is that we need the data of the parameter in z space, but then we need to fix a point of linear variety. So we take the product with C to the power G, and then we have to divide by the action not just of the synthetic group, but also of the action of the torus itself by translation. So we should be able to translate elements of this lattice and so on. In addition, z to the power 2g. Now we denote this the total space of the universal kind of by script x. Of course, if one just looks at the OS topological spaces, this is not going to be a universal family because. Because then climate will not be at all, but it's quotient by all automatic. So we will have to quotient by destabilizing the system in a way in Lusion, for instance, given by multiplying by minus one. The fibrin will not be isomorphic to this, but if we construct everything as the linear mantras factor as an order, we have this. Then the next step is to introduce the stabilization.  We already know every time we have a symplectic matrix, we can just start a larger symplectic matrix algorithm. Just by adding a trivial block to it, and this has a counterpart in the construction of the modular space, which arises by considering all that from the side by choosing. By choosing an abelian variety of dimension G, if we make this product by a fixed abedian variety of dimension one, we automatically obtain a physically polarized ability variety. So, in this way, we have a sequence of maps and then. Maps and then either we view things in this way or in that way, which are equivalent from our point of view. So, in this topic, we just work with homology with pup coefficients. So, in this sense, for instance, the homology of AG with rational coefficients. With rational coefficients should space the same if we think of it as an odd before the underlying topological space, for instance. And then if you can zoom in here that the chromology of Hg, since Hg is contracted, it will be the same as the chromology of the situation. So in this case, the existence of stable The existence of stable chromology is a by now classical that by Borel, which I let me recall it, so I can fix the notation.  As I said, as is well known, any of these maps use isomorphism. If homology is happening, right, isn't it? Which for the symplatic loop is just case on ever G and it one looks at the scale cohomology that one can obtain as an inverse limit of the sipping sound, then its generators have a rather straightforward interpretation. Potential because they are given by the line classes, the old line classes, since we want them to be independent, which are simply the channel classes of the old value. So if we denote by pi in the universal, this is just the push forward under the projection from the universal curve A of the shield of first or relative differentials of the highway are just the basis of the space of differentials. So, in particular, there are all classes of even degree and they are all algebraic classes. So, they can realize in some ways the fundamental classes, or maybe a combination of fundamental classes of sub-variety of energy, at least in the range, yeah, okay, stable energy. Actually, this is the chromology, the stabilization of the chromology by EG with constant coefficients. But actually, Boret ruled that the cohomology stabilizes also if we take a non-constant system of coefficients, only that if we take a non-constant system of coefficients, equivalent, a non-trivial. A non-trivial inducible representation of the symmetric group, then the cohomology in this range will be trivial. So geometrically, a straightforward application of the results of the other system of coefficients, which is the fact that the stable cohomology is zero in this small range, is this actually also the cohomology of the unique. Of the universal family of AG and all of its private thoughts stabilizes. Since this is something like a baby case for the result I'm going to discuss later, then let me state this result. The only question is, is it going to fit in this button? And we will see. If you can't see everything, please. If you can't see everything, please complain. I think I should hear you just fine. So if you are unhappy, please complain and with us. Roger something I thought together with class Sam now the first paper. So if we take the universal So if we take the universal family, it actually we take the n hyper product of the universal family, so that this is hydro Hd and then hydrogen. The product of the ability principle taken n times will be stabilized the same range as when we have stabilization of When we have stabilization of AG. And the stable formula of this case, let me put a figure here, is isomorphic to the tensor product. Is isomorphic to the tensor product of the stable cold Ag with the polynomial ring with n choose two generators which I will develop by T one to Pm and then T one to P. And then p one should p one three and so on should be n minus one n and then I include the border explain the notation  So, these generators are in fact rather nature because there's a group of generators, symmetric one, can be obtained just by taking the pullback of the theta divisor on the device alphabet. And the end classes, and then you have the music classes. And this can be obtained as the product of the class of the Point Rebundle on the second product of X. And then to make everything uniquely defined, there are some one should normalize these line buttons to make everything unique. That's a technical point. Well, the perhaps there are more questions, perhaps they can give a hint about how one puts this kind of result. Something one can do on a much larger scale in more complicated situations.  So, the basic idea behind this proof is rather easy. So, if we are considering this. This fiber product of the universal family definition, if we have a point on a G corresponding with a variety A in the fiber will be A power n. Well, clearly this is vibration, so we can look at the Les Pectar sequence, but it's also a projective vibration. So we know by the reasons that the La Respect flash will degenerate at each hoop. With the generator at each forgetful map by Python. So, if you want to compute the homology of the universe, of this multiple universal family in the UK, then the generation we just have to take a direct sample on P and Q that are to end of the homology with P of A G. P of AJ with coefficients used by the trivial system of confusions by Pi N, so you can take the highly field images of this, but then by Morel's design. By one of this, we know that in the k is more than g only the three summons inside here will contribute. So, in practice, what we have to do is to determine that maybe we need to have. We need to find how many trigger assignments we have here. And to do this, we need to look at the homology of the fibers in degree Q and then look for the pattern, which is SP2G invariant. Now, this is a self-cannibal variety of. We have to take the cubex zero product of the h1 or h to the power n, which is just the same as the cohomology of a, and then we take the n complex of this, and then we have to take the invariance. So, despite, if you look at the action of the selected group, this is just a standard representation. So, somehow this is just an invariant theory problem, which one can just solve explicitly, some kind of exercise.  So the idea is that what should have the triple representations and anyway something of should be something of even degree. So one needs to take two different classes in H1 and we have n copies of H1. n copies of h1 so we should label where they precisely lie anyway so if the degree q is odd you don't get anything and if the degree q is even then you also pay a condon of degree to have In the symmetric product of two. So somehow they will depend on two indices. So we can identify these generators exactly with our T1 of Tn for the And this is a little Eij and the other identifiers in the masses. And this is the way in which one close the theorem, but actually the only crucial step is the fact that one only needs to work with the invariant part under the action of the symmetric group. So with the trivial representation. The symbolic group, so with the trivial representation, the symplectic group provides in the stable range k smaller than g. Are there any questions far? Then, yeah, I will try to move on to the contractification.   So Moderate space AG is not compact. The easiest way to see this is just to look at zero space. We just have positive definite matrices. And then if there is some, if a family of positive definite matrices, they generate such one in which the image and path is just positive, semi-definite, we get a limit object which lies outside. Lies outside actually. It's not so clear. I mean, there are many ways to construct compactifications of aging, and actually, depending on the problem one is studying, there is a different compactification that may be the most dangerous. Yeah, the second point from a geometric point of view is that the data that one needs to keep track of to study the generating source of a billion private is so complicated. Complicated. For instance, one of the fastest changes is semi-stable reduction. It says that if we look at abelian varieties as varieties with a group structure, then the natural objects to consider at sea. Objects to consider as seen a bit of brightness. And I think there's two schemes, but by this, I simply need a I simply mean a thing of a variety with the compatible with the group structure given by algebraic non-zero. Then the national structure is to consider so of course the limit object let's go. Object, let's call it S, the dimension will be the same, so it was something dimension G. And as a group, the same ambiguity variety is the extension of the Labelian variety of smaller dimensions, let's say g minus k by So, somehow, if we generation of abelian varieties, in principle, one should keep track of an arbitrary variety of an arbitrary abelian variety of smaller dimensions, and then of the data of the substantial varietals. But the additional abelian variety was also conjectured variety. So, of course, when we study the generations, we would have all of we would also like to have some data that allowed to work constructive. Have some data that allows to reconstruct a boundary for this. So the problem becomes extremely complicated, especially if one wants to have a compactification, which is itself a model space of the generators of a VD environment. So which compactification are in use and are algebraic varieties? Well, for the x, one can look at the minimal compactivity. That's why you look at the minimal compactification, the basic or isotaki compactification. And then also with AGS, where can start? Or can construct it in several ways, for instance, it's the project that we have modular farms. Anyway, this is a projective variety, but it's very singular, so it's not a nice space to work with. And if one loses handiness, if we only encode the data of the abiding variety one obtain, one of which one is taken in exchange, so this basically has. So the spaces, as Merodiac already explained, can be simplified by locally closed SATA, which have multiple spaces of principally polarized ambient varieties of smaller dimensions. This also sort of explains that makes intuitive the fact that there are singularities because the boundary has codimension G because the dimensions are here. So it's bounded higher per dimension of almost two synchronizers now, one will have to blow this up. I can't understand how much time I still have left.  Anyway, the map from AG to Ag plus one, which comes by taking products, fixed a little curve, extends to this compactive. Expense to this complication and indeed the charging that we put with the distabilization. So again, one of the lambda classes, the generators of the stable cohomology of AG. And then one has some additional classes, again of even degree. Not that they are of even degree, may give the impression that may also be something like the trend classes of some vector bundles, but not like that because it's melody said that these are not ultimate. And these are not algebraic classes on the H structure, these are classes of algebraic zero. So for the projective algebraic variety, classes of always zero would just be in degree zero. So the existence of so many such classes displayed all over the place offer something that shows how to see. Also, something that shows how singular, so how bad the singularities of these panic are. So, in some sense, if we look at concaridiality, since everything is backed, and we want to look at the cohomology in preparatory degree, we would find the concaridual of the lambda classes and all these alpha guidelines. Simply appear, so there are some kind of something which is very specific of the range of degrees in which they are, and they are here before. Pair everything with the fundamental character and I should look at what happens at the other end of the range of Greeks in cohort. So as I said, clearly from the point of view of corpological stabilization, the syntactical quantification is very good, but as a moderate space, it's missing a lot of information. This is why. Of information, this is why it's actually more popular to work with toroidal classifications. We allow chapter star modification agency from Chako Jack and then. And then, but with sigma, some kind of combinatorial gadget, and depending on which one makes, one can, for instance, construct something which is two-day space, which parametrizes the degenerations of a bio-validus, but if one takes the so-called second boundary compactification, or one can have something like the perfect compactification, which is very nice from the which is nice from the combinatorial point of view and nice also if we're studying the variation. Nice also for studying the variational geometry of some spaces. And even if one defines the construction enough, one point construction which is smooth, but which is extremely inconvenient because the smooth are very complicated from a combinatorial point of view. So, what should I say? The problem is sure. said the problem is to consider what happens when positive definite forms become positive semi-definite so this sigma comes from the path of the story that we fix sigma if we fix a dimension g then sigma g should be iradmissible decomposition I need to resist some kind of technical attention of the space of positive simulated forms of the RG with the ration of Adika. So the angle of the form should be defined by that. The rational map. So the elements of this decomposition should be rational polymedral columns. And so there are the user conditions. And so there are the user conditions on faces, but another condition that is important, which is important is that there is an action of the general group here, and that the number of obvious should be finite, so that's something which is always. And then, yes, of course, it depends on G, but we can choose a collection of sigma G, translate variables in G, which are compatible with each other in the sense that if we intersect a sigma, if we If we extend the sigma g by embedding r to the power g into r to the power g plus one, we obtain a column to sigma g plus one. And I will call this webinar and then of course. And then, of course, we want to be able to define the stability map, but the stability map is only defined if there is an additivity condition which says that if we have sigma one and sigma two positive different decomposition Calls of different decompositions, then if we take the dial sun, this is now a code, and this should belong to sigma t1 plus g2. If this is satisfied, then we get the pelvic. Once we have a product market, we can define the stability. And even better, this product market I mean does have issues with automaticness, but if we pass to five covers, this is actually it comes as embedded. It comes as embedded. And just likely it stands worse, but of course it's just actual, some finite group action. So the question is, of course, that if one looks at this, is to figure out which kind of conditions should be satisfied. Conditions should be satisfied to expect to have some kind of stabilization. And the way we approach this is to use the classification of the columns in the context composition to produce a stratification of this compactification. Compactification and then computing the cohomology of each step, and then putting all of them together. So, ideally, if Ag sigma is moved, and this would also apply to partial conductifications to construction of this kind. To construction of this kind, in which we are just constructing an open subset of that total, so this is perhaps more reasonable. And for that, sigma in the second sigma g, we have the real sigma. Is larger than the rank of sigma, which is the smallest dimension of RB to be able to find a copy of sigma compared there. And we have this condition. Condition: We don't need it for rice, at least for all signals that have at least two generators. Then the chromology of A G sigma stabilizes In the Greek K is more functional. And as I said, this kind of assumption will never be satisfied if we work with a smoother projective compactification because simply the compactorics does not allow for this. But this is useful if we work with the path of compactification. Like looking at the smooth novel of such a compactification for a different sigma, then throwing away all columns which define which give a singularity, something which is singular. And then we also have an expert. And then we also have an expert switcher on the pairs. Because what I have stabilizes in this degree is well in any way a model of the stable cohomology of Ag in any case. You know, it has and then it will have a bunch of generators of even degree which come from the vector space V sigma. This is a this is a great purple spice. Is a great vertical space to be zero even degree, to be zero, an even degree is given just by the sum representative of a cone in the decomposition, which is irreducible with respect to direct sums and then what And then one needs to take the space of all polynomials in degree k minus the dimension of sigma span or spin and then paint the half content which is environment and not the action of the other. This is just a version of the CNM for a small compact. CNM for small complications. If one has something which is not smooth, then we don't know what happens to the homology, but one of the descriptions for the homology includes your top degree. So in general, the top degree will be G times G plus 1 because that's the real dimension of aging. That's the real dimension of Ag so one gets a similar description, but now I mean if we work in top degree we no longer have the ring structure we had for cohomology with something different the description is exactly the same so I'm sorry to be too so late so I don't have time for the overview of the open questions but The overview of the open questions, but nevertheless, thank you for remaining with me till the end. And I'm sorry for the technical issues of the beginning. Let's thank our speaker.
