So what about bacteria? So mostly population genetics for clonal haploids is applied to describe the population genetics of bacteria. However, many bacterial species carry multicopy plasmids as we just heard, or they are polyploid, for example several species of cyanobacteria. And even bacterial species that are normally monoploid can have an increased copy number during rapid growth, for example, coli. Growth, for example, could I? So, why does it matter? So, first limitation input is higher. If you have just having more copies of the stains, there are more replication events, and that makes it more likely that mutations happen. But then, if a mutation happens on a multi-copy replicant, and I mean, for the remainder of the talk, I will always refer to classmates, but most of what I say might also apply to actually polyployed Artemia. Deployed actually there. So it only appears on one of these copies here. But then at Cell DeWisch, we can get daughter cells that have a genetic composition that's different from that of another cell. You can see this here. So this daughter cell doesn't get any copy that carries specific mutation here, while this one has now two plasma and on. So we are getting this heterogeneous cell population, as Rafael has also already explained. Has also already explained, leading to this segregation drift. Now, if this mutation has a fitness effect, that also means that these different cell types might have different fitnesses. So, here you can see on the x-axis the fraction of mutant plasmids in a cell, and then the y-axis is the growth rate. And that would be an example for a dominant beneficial mutation. So, if just one of these copies is mutated, the Of these copies is mutated, the cell has already the maximum possible fitness, but the mutation could also be recessive, in which case all of these copies would need to carry the mutation such that we have a fit cell. Okay, so now how does this affect bacterial adaptation? And through my PhD student Mario, he looked at sort of three key questions in adaptation. One is the early phase of One is the early phase of spread of beneficial alleles, gestochasticity is strong and mutation is still prone to stochastic loss. Then, second, the probability of evolutionary rescue, where we are combining the ecological dynamics of population decline, for example, due to strong antibiotic pressure, then together with the evolutionary dynamics, where beneficial mutations might appear and rescues the population from extinction. And last, we looked at the full fixation process of beneficial. The full fixation process of beneficial alleles, where it starts from a low frequency and finally fixes in the population, such that all period plasmids in the population pair that mutation. Okay, so here's our model. Little n is the plasmid copy number, so in this case it would be n equals 3. This little i is a number of the plasmid in a given cell. In this example, that would be. So first we look at the So, first, we look at the cell dynamics, which we describe by a birth-death process. So, we have a birth rate that can depend on the plasmid copy number n and on the number of plasmid copies that are mutated and the death rate mu. Now, we need to incorporate into the model. So, this was dominance function. So, how does a growth rate of So how does the growth rate of bacteria, so this parameter S depend on the fraction of mucumplasmids in a cell? And so we assume that this effects, this S is on the birth rate, enters into the birth rate, and the death rate is constant, equal to one. So this is just the dynamics at the level of the like cell population. Cell population, but then we also need to model plasmid replication and segregation. So we assume that prior to cell division, each plasmid is replicated exactly once. We call this a regular replication. So mathematically, now the cell carries this new cell prior to cell division, there's 2i mutant copies and 2n mean minus 2i biotype copies. mean minus two i biotype copies and then we have the segregation process where here i mean that's different from what uh rafael had in his model we assume that each daughter cell receives exactly n copies so this plus cannot get lost but which kind of whether it gets mutant or white copies I mean this distribution is random. So mathematically that leads to a hypergeometric distribution for the number of mutant plasmids in the daughter cells. Not all our cells. So, the first question we asked: How likely is it that a new beneficial mutation that's just appearing in one hobby and one cell escapes stochastic loss and establishes in the population? So, here's a picture, there's a number of mutants on the y-axis, time on the x-axis. So, mutations appear, but most of the times, even if they are beneficial, they are getting lost again due to stochasticity. Again, due to stochasticity. However, they might escape stochastic loss and establish, and we are interested in this establishment probability. And so, what we are encountering here is a multi-type branching process where a type is characterized by how many of those plasmids in a cell are mutated. And we can then calculate the extinction probabilities of this branching, algae type branching process. And from this, get the establishment probability as one minus the extinction. One minus the extinction probability of a process where we just start with one mutant plus metadata cell. Okay, so what does it now look like if you're looking at different dominance functions? So here's again this dominant mutation or a recessive mutation. And we see that here now the establishment probability drops as a function of the plasmid copy number. And that's also quite intuitive because if you think like if you have more plasmid Like, if you have more plasmid copies in a cell, you need many more cell divisions until we arrive finally at a mutant homozygous cell where sort of the segregation and drift cannot occur anymore. And this takes much longer with a higher plasmid copy number, which means there's much more time that maybe just by mad lag cells die and this rotation gets lost. So this is dominant. Sorry, top row is dominant? The top row is dominant, and this one is recessive, yes. In both cases, Yes. In both cases establishment uh drops. If it's dominant as soon as it occurs in one of the plasmids you already have the maximum fitness, yes, but you can still have you still have this process where that's the cell, I mean the plasmid copies get replicated and divide. And any this you can just use again the plasmid. Okay, so what we see here is that the existence of Here is that the existence of multiple plasmid copies per cell reduces the establishment probability of rare beneficial alleles. There's one caveat to here, this can or this changes if or can be different when we have clean dosage effects. So what I was looking at here was really like the fraction of mutant plasmid in the cell matters, but not the absolute number of mutant um plasmids, which um what corresponding dosage effects. In that case, actually the establishment probability can also increase with the plasmid probability. Increases the plasmid copy number. Okay, but now, as I said at the beginning, also the mutational input is higher if you're having a higher plasmid copy number. So, even if each mutation that appears has a lower establishment probability with a higher plasmid copy number, there are many more mutations that are happening. And so, we can ask, like, does this actually outweigh this decreased establishment probability? So, for example, here with plasmid copy number of two, we only have two. Of two, we would only have two replication events with three replication events, which means like here mutations are more likely to happen. So, what we are looking here at now is then a scenario of evolutionary rescue. So, we don't just have this stochastic establishment process, but what we are looking at is a population first of where all these cells can be just a Y-type plasmid, population size is stable, but then an environment. Is stable, but then an environmental change occurs and the population size drops, and it would go extinct unless, in time, a mutation appears on this multicopy plasmid and escaped loss establishes the rescue population. So, we're having this recurrent mutation process during population decline. So, now how can we calculate this probability of evolutionary rescue? It now depends on two factors. The mutant has to arise by mutation and escapes. By mutation and escape stochastic loss. This is a part that we've already looked at. For the mutation in input, we are just assuming here or modeling it as a deterministic decline of the wild type population size here. So what the mutation in input is, is U is mutation probability times the plasmid copy number times the birth rate of this photypex cell that only carries this blue plasmid and the population size, which, as I said, is just describing. I said, is just describing exponential decline. And so, what's important here is proportional to n. Now, we still need to put these two factors together to obtain the probability of evolutionary rescue. So, this exponential function here, this would be the zeroth probability of a Poisson distribution. That gives us the probability that no successor mutation that establishes occurs during population decline, and then the probability of a regional rescue. The probability of equational rescue is a complementary probability. So, what's important here in this exponent we are having the factor of the mutational input and the establishment probability. Yeah. So, here you say it's initially called Yes, I mean initially we don't have it in the standing genetic variation. If this is what you yeah, yes. I mean we also looked at standing genetic variation, but I don't show it in this talk for reasons of time. Okay, so this is a picture from before with establishment probability. So if you add here the mutational input, so the rate of appearance basically of this mutant plasmid, as you saw on the previous slide, that increases linearly the plasmid copy number. And to obtain the probability of evolutionary rescue, more or less we need to multiply these two lines with each other. So let's do that first for this dominant mutation. This dominant mutation. If we do that, we see that the rescue probability indeed increases to the plus vet copy number. So this decreased establishment probability is outweighed by the increased mutation and input. That's different down here for the recessive mutation because here this drop in the establishment probability was so drastic that it could be outweighed. So the rescue probability decreases as we look at the number. So we see that the existence of So we see that the existence of multiple plasmid copies per cell decreases or increases the rescue probability depending on the lease dominance. So far this was all just about probability. So does adaptation occur or not? But then the question is also what does actually the trajectory to needle fixation look like if you just start with a low number of frequencies of population, what it looks like until you reach a frequency of one. For this, we changed the model. We didn't look at the birth-death process, but at the Moran model, which is a classical model from population genetics. So cells still divide with this rate lambda, but every time a cell divides, a random cell is chosen to be replaced such that you have a constant population size. Otherwise, the model is the same. We look at that mostly deterministically, so I just put down here. Deterministically, so I just put down here the ODE system, which describes here with xj the frequency of types in the population where j of the copies are mutated. And you see, I mean, it's a quite compact expression. We start with 1% of the cells carrying one mutant plasmid. And since we now have this deterministic ODE model, there is no true sort of fixation, so we need to look at some stress route. Look at some stress route, you're looking at fixation at two levels of the phenotype and of the genotype. So, phenotypic fixation would be the time where 99% of cells are mutant cells, they carry at least one plus one muted copy. And so we are looking here at dominant mutations, which means, as Dan pointed out, they already have maximal possible fitness, so they're already adapted. Fixation and genotypic level is when 99% of Phenotypic level is when 99% of the cells are mutant or cycles. Now, let's look at what this looks like. So, here what you now see is the frequency of cell types as a function of time. And we are distinguishing here in blue the mutant homozygous cells, then heterocygous cells that carry the red and the blue plasmid, and mutant cells, which is the sum of both, or the ones that carry at least one mutated copy. You can see here in this first example here that this heterozygous. Example here, that these heterozygous cells just increase very, very little and then disappear again. And that means basically the homozygous mutant cells appear early and sleep to fixation. And we don't keep, so like the phenotypic and genotypic fixation time are the same. This changes now if we go here to a stronger selection coefficient. In that case, here opens up a window between the sphenotypic and genotypic fixation changes. And genotypic fixation time. So these heterocycate cells first rise and then drop again. So we call this window the heterozygosity window. And why is it important? I mean, this is now a time period in which our population is already fully adapted because more or less all of the cells carry less one mutant plasmid. However, genetic variation is still preserved in the population because it does not get fixed at the genotypic level. For example, it means if this is an antibiotic resistance, I mean antibiotic resistance would be possible. Possible during this time window, still, because the wiretaper plasmid is still present. Such a window also opens up here if instead of the selection coefficient, we are increasing the plasmid copy number. And well, I mean, it gets larger if both of these parameters are larger. Okay, so as I said, within this window, the population is fully adapted, but genetic variation is maintained. Mario also derived. Mario also derived a condition of when a substantial window exists. It's roughly actually, if one looks at large copy numbers, it means like s times n is larger than 1. And also for the size of the window in the limit, where we let this threshold go to 1, so we don't look at 99% as in this numerical example, but let this go to 1. And again, this gives a quite compact expression for the size of this window. To very briefly give the idea. To very briefly give the idea of how this is derived, the idea is a substantial window exists if these heterozygous cells first increase in frequency temporarily before they vanish from the population. And so we can then look at this initial phase to see whether they're rising in frequency. We're then neglecting productive terms in the Newton frequencies. We can determine the largest eigenvalue of P, which is magically known. And so if this largest eigenvalue And so, if this largest eigenvalue is larger than zero, then this heterocycus growing frequency gives exactly these conditions. And then, for the full trajectory, we can assume that the relative frequencies of this heterocycous cells just stay the same given by the eigenvalue of eigenvector by this matrix, and then by some calculations, ultimately arrive at this expression. Okay. So, we see that the existence of multiple copies periods. Of multiple copies per cell leads to this heterocytosity window and also to longer fixation times. Now, all of this was just nice theories that how does it compare to experiments. For this, we collaborated with a group of Chandagan in Kiev. So the experiments were performed by her former PhD student, Anna, who recently graduated. And so she set up a really nice experimental system. Experimental system. So she had a plasmid with a copy number of 15. And so the angestro allele is an NPT2 gene, that's a gene that gives resistance to panamycin, which is interrupted by this gene coding for a green fluorescent protein. So sort of the resistance gene is dysfunctional. And the novel anneal is obtained by recombining out this gene gene. And for comparison, they also looked at adaptation on a monoclide chromosome where the ancestral at least TED A genes are giving resistance to tetracycline in the novel against this NPT2 gene, giving resistance to catamycin. So what does it basically mean? We are having here with a plasmid copy, with a plasmid, we are having this sort of wire-type cells which are green fluorescent, but they're not resistant to kanamycin. To kanamycin. The heterozygous cells, they're green fluorescent and resistant to kanamycin. And the sweet homozygous cells, they're not green, but they're resistance. So this means one can distinguish these three cell types from each other experimentally. And also selection for this mutant idea can be applied by applying kanamycin here on the plasmid or also on this chromosome. Yeah, I mean, with resistance and non-resistance, I'm referring you to kanamycin. And initially, like a fraction F of cells carries this novel ideal in just one point. So, with this, I mean, I did a classical abolution experiment for 30 days with this daily transfer as bottlenecks. So, we needed to adapt our model to match the population dynamics of the experiment. So, we have a start with a new allele and a small fraction of cell. Then, there's deterministic, locustic growth, and then there's random sampling. Growth, and then there's random sampling of cells here to model this for the next step of the serial transfer. What we did first, we're actually looking at the replication of plasmid copies. Now, here in the absence of selection, what you can see here is the heterozygote frequency as a number of transfers, and these gray lines here are the experiments. So, what we looked at in our model, as I said before, Looked at in our model, as I said before, is this regular replication of plasmid copy where each copy is replicated exactly once. But here now, we also looked at a different model of plasmid replication, which we call random replication. So here now, at every step, a randomly, like a plasmid randomly chosen from the pool of existing plasmids. So for example, this one here first. Then again one is chosen. Again, one is chosen. Here, this would be the mutant one. Then, also, like a copy can be chosen again. So, this one is now chosen for replication, and then this one is chosen a second time, as an example. So, I now compare sort of this dynamics of the heterogeneous frequency for these two modes of plasmid replication. In blue is a regular replication, in this orange is a random replication, and one can see that this regular replication matches. That this regular replication matches the data much better. And this is, of course, by no means proof that a replication of this plasmids is regular, but we can at least speculate that it's maybe more, well, it's maybe closer to regular replication than replication, but that's a speculation. Anyway, since it worked better, we went ahead with this regular replication of plasma problems. Okay, now what you now can see here is on the x-axis the number Is on the x-axis the number of transfers, and here what is called here survival of the novel allele. So, they did for a very experimental condition, they had six replicate populations, and so every transfer they were looking whether this novel allele is still present in the population or not. So, this is what this survivor of the novel allele is. And we then also simulated this, and I'll show you a comparison here. So, first, for the chromosome, what you can see in the dot, that's the experimental data in the lines, based on. Data and the lines, as you see here, are our simulation results. And one can see here: if we start with like 10 to the minus 6 cells, it carries this mutant plasmid, it's maintained over these 20 transfers. Yeah, I mean, throughout. And if it's on a chromosome, if you start with a lower frequency of 10 to the minus cells, it's only maintained in a little more than 40% of the cells. Of the cells. Now, on the left side, it's now for the plasmid, and from everything I told you about establishment probabilities at the beginning, you can probably already guess what's happening. So, this survival probability is much lower on the plasmid than it is on the chromosome. And here, with this low initial frequency, it experimentally gets lost in all of the decades. Those dots is six replicates in the resulting? No, I mean, like, look at how many of the signatures. I mean they look how many of the six I mean they look at the six replicates and then how many of them is it still present? So it's a percentage of yeah. So I mean this this I mean here would mean like it's still present and I don't know what it what it is a little bit better than 20%. I think that it's like half of them leaves it immediately. Oh no, on some lungs at the bottom right. Yeah, is that like flatline surprising? That it they all leave them immediately and then nothing when there's no further damage startup. Yeah, I guess it's I mean probably I mean I'm I'm not totally sure but I guess I can imagine that either they got get lost quickly or they get maintained. I think that makes sense. Let's see one transfer is a day so that's ma are you thinking like oh I don't know how many generations it is. Okay, ten ten maybe. If it's a one in if it's a one in ten to the minus three bottleneck. And then the selection coefficient you think is I think it was around 0.1. Yeah, okay, so that makes sense then. You can also look at the frequency of mutant cells as a function of transfers. So, again, this gray dots, this is now the mutant cells for the currents line are the theory. And I mean, one can And I mean, one can, and I mean, there's also the green ones that are the heterocycous cells. Also, here this one are the experiments. And here's the theory. And I mean, one can see it doesn't really, quantitatively doesn't match so well. But I mean, the qualitative behavior is the same in the model and the experiments. And especially, we can see that the spinotropic fixation is slower on the multicopy plasmids than on a monopoly chromosome, both in the experiments and in the Both in the experiments and in the model. And I mean, we can also see here that also in the experiments, we can't see it very well, but this heterocycle cell first increases in frequency. Okay, what we see is also that a simple mathematical model captures well the experimentally observed dynamics. So, very quickly now, what I looked at here in this talk was always at the most. At here in this talk, was always that the more mutant plasmids you have in a cell, the better. But of course, there could be also a situation where actually one needs both of these alleles present in a cell to have a fit cell. So my student Ian looked at that and also derived a condition for how large this fitness benefit then actually needs to be, that such a population can actually grow because, I mean, as we've seen at the beginning, there's always this loss on these heterocycous cells, of mutant cells, that kind of needs to be made up. That kind of needs to be made up for by growth of cell division. So they need to be sufficiently fit to make up for this loss. And so when can also then wonder, I mean, would it maybe actually better if these two plasmids would fuse together to form such a point array? I mean, that happens, but normally, I mean, they then resolve very quickly again. But if there's selection for it, that could be maintained. And the question is, when is it beneficial? I mean, this could be having a higher cost. This could be having a higher cost, so it depends. Does it have the same copy number as before, or maybe it's just half the copy number? It depends on specific plasmids. Also, like, I mean, is the selection pressure maintained constantly, or is this fluctuation, I mean, is the selection pressure, then maybe it could be better to really keep both of those plasmids separate. So, this is the question we are currently interested in. And, yeah, I mean, before I come to an end, I would like to draw your attention to two upcoming workshops. To two upcoming workshops at our institute. The first one is in April on modeling resistance evolution and
