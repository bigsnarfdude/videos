About everywhere there's instantaneous flow of parabolic stochastic thinking. Okay, thank you very much, the organizers, for this invitation. So I'm going to talk about a joint work with Davar that gave the talk this morning and Mohamed von Dun who is in Scotland. So before entering into the explaining the result on everywhere and instantaneous blow-up. On everywhere and stentaneous blow-up of parabolic SPDs. I'm going to start with a bit of introduction of how we got into the problem. So let's start with the Osgot condition that I put it also here in the whiteboard, on the green board. And the condition on the drift will be the same during all my talk. Okay, so the drift is a non-negative local ellipsis and non-decreasing function. Okay, so if you consider an ODE. So, if you consider an ODE, simple like that, with this drift, then since it's locally Lipschitz, we know that it takes a local solution up to its blow-up time, which is exactly equal to the integral of one divided by the drift. And A is the initial point. Okay, and then we say that the solution blows up in finite time if T is finite. Okay, so this is the exact blow-up time for all. The exact blow-up time for ODEs. Now, Jorge Leon, which is here in the audience, and Vila extended this result for a differential equation that has plus a continuous function g, and they gave a sufficient condition for the Osgot condition, which is that this integral is finite. And they show. And they show that under assumption one, which is B non-negative, non-decreasing local ellipsis, and assumption two is that the Limpsoup of the inflammable over H's of G T plus H equals to infinity. Okay, so this means that the function will going to push the solution at infinity when t goes to infinity. Okay, so they show that under these assumptions, the solution of this equation blows up in finite time even only if the Else Gold conditions. Even only if the Else Gold condition holds. Okay, let me give you an idea of the proof. So, first, the sufficient condition. So, assume that the solution blows up in finite time. Since G is continuous, the supremum on a finite interval is bounded. So, you can bound X by M plus the integral. Okay, and now you consider this ODE, okay? And since X. Okay, and since X blows up, by assumption, Y will blow up, and then by the initial statement, B satisfies the Oscar condition. So this is the sufficiency. Okay, so the sufficiency doesn't use assumption two on G, okay, only uses that G is continuous. Okay, and the necessary can be proved by contradiction. Suppose that the solution does not blow up in finite time. Take a sequence Tn that Take a sequence tn that converges to infinity, change t between 0 and 1. Okay, using the fact that b is non-decreasing, we have that xt plus tn can be lower bounded by this. Okay, this means that x t plus tn is lower bounded by the solution of this differential equation, okay? But x does not blow up by assumption, so z will not blow up in the interval 0, 1. So this means that the blowout time, which is equal to this, is bigger than 1. By assumption, Than one. By assumption two, there is a sequence tn that pushes this infimum of g to infinity. So this plus this contradicts the Osgot condition. So this integral cannot be finite. So this proves the necessary of the Osgot condition to blow up. Okay? Okay, so this is the extension for the LDE plaza continuous function. And in the same paper by Folke and Villa, they extended it when instead They extended it when instead of G, now you put a bifractional Brownian motion. A bifractional Brownian motion is a central Gaussian process that has a covariance given like this with two parameters, h and k. So when k is one, it's usual fractional Bernier motion. When k is between zero and one is an extension of Bernier motion called bifraction Bernier motion, okay, which was introduced by Udre and Vila in 2003. Okay, so they extended their result and they proved Extended their result and they prove that for this equation it will blow up in finite time almost surely. Now we have a random process, even only if the Osgot condition. Okay, the idea of the proof is to show that the fractional rundown motion has this property that there exists a sequence that the limit of the infimum of this converges to infinity. So again, it's this random process that will push the solution to infinity. How do we prove? How do they prove that? They take the infimum of bifractional Bernie-motion t plus h and the lower bound, adding and subtracting bt. Okay. And then we divide by psi, which is this function t h k square root of 2 log log t. By the law of iterated logarithm of the fraction of Brownian motion, this guy converges to infinity. Okay? And now we need to handle this guy. This guy has the increment. This guy has the increments of bifractional Brony-Motion, so one can use the continuity properties of bifractional Brony-Motion and show that this supremo converges to zero as n goes to infinity. So this proves that this converges to infinity, and by the preceding result, the theorem is true. Okay, so this is a bit of the introduction. And now, what we wanted to do is to extend these results to stochastic heat equation. So this is So, this is the stochastic heat equations with spacetime y node. So, this is exactly the equation that Davar presented this morning, except that he had a sigma of u. For the moment here, sigma is just a positive constant. Later, there will be a sigma of u. And here, we have a drift, which is the same drift, non-negative, non-decreasing, and local ellipsoids. And x is in R. And the initial condition for the moment is in non-negative and continuous function. So, we can apply the theory by Wald, and we call a random field solution of this SPDE as a predictable random field on T and X that satisfies this integrated integrated integral equation. So, P is the heat kernel, so it's the Gaussian kernel, and here is the drift term, this is the initial condition, and this is the Gaussian term, which is Gaussian in this case. Which is Gaussian in this case because sigma is positive. Okay. Right. So here B is local in Lipsheets only. Okay. So when B is locally Lipsheets, the existence of the solution is a complicated problem because, well, if B is Lipsheets continuous, then we know that SPD is well posed, there exists a unique solution. But when it's only locally Lipschitz. Only locally Lipschitz continues. The existence of local solution is a delicate issue because the solution is unbounded almost surely. That is, for any t, the supremum of u tx is infinity almost surely. So the stopping argument that works for SPDEs in compact space interval does not extend in this case. Okay, so here we proving that it's a local solution is a complicated thing, that there exists A complicated thing that there exists a local solution is a complicated thing. Okay, but for the moment, so we are interested in the blow-up of the solution. And so, this is the first theorem that we proved two years ago with Mohammed. So, we assume that the condition on the drift, B, and we prove that B is a sufficient condition for blow up, almost surely. Okay, so Right, so it's uh so this is a remark that it's interesting to compare this to the case of P D's when sigma is zero. Because this theorem shows that if, for example, B of U is U1 plus eta, eta bigger than of zero, so this satisfies the Osgot condition for any eta. So our theorem says that there is no global solution, right? However, when sigma is zero, Fujita proved that if Fujita proved that if you take, for example, an initial condition with Gaussian decay with a constant in front sufficiently small, then you can produce bounded solutions that exist for all time. Okay. And if you are in Rd, then the condition is eta bigger than 2 divided by d, and we call this the Fujita exponent. So our theorem proves that for a stochastic heat equation, there is no Fujita exponent in this case. Okay, so let me give you an idea. Okay, so let me give you an idea of the proof of this theorem. Well, the proof is really based on the observation that the Gaussian part of the mild formulation is a bipartisan of Brownian motion. Okay, this was observed by this paper by Leia and David Neweller in 2009. So it's a reflection of Bronel motion with H and K equal to one half. Okay, so this you compute the covariance and you see that you get a bifraction of Bernard motion. So So, the difference with what Jorge did with Villa is that here we have a space and time. So, we need to control this infimum also on a space. So we need to prove this and then using the same approach as Leon and Villa, then we get the result. So, in order to prove this, we follow a similar approach, but we need to handle this dependent on. handle this dependent on x. Okay, so here we did the same trick. You take gt plus h and you add and subtract gt of x0, okay, where g0 is a fixed point in 0, 1. And then you make appear the function of the low litilateral logarithm of fractional ornament motion. And again, we have that this converges to infinity. And these again can be dealt using some continuous So, an improvement on Garcia's lemma that we have in this paper by Davara and Dalang allow us to show that the expectation of this supremum is bounded. As a consequence, we get that this supremum converges to zero. And then we conclude the proof. So, this is the extension of Léon's ambila result to the stochastic heat equation. And then the proof also follows similarly. Once you have this condition on the Gaussian part, you lower bounds similarly as they did, using the fact that B is non-decreasing. And then here you call, so here, sorry, you use, so you lower one U by the infimum, and you use a lower band for the Gaussian kernel, and you obtain that the And you obtain that the drift term is lower bounded by this, okay? Then, if you call y to be the infimum of u, we have shown that our process x is lower bounded by this differential equation, which is of the type of Leon and Villa. Okay, so we conclude that the Aussian condition cannot hold. Okay, so it's a similar approach, but dealing with time and space variable. Time and space variable. Okay, so we extended this result to when instead of the Laplacian, you have a fractional Laplacian. Okay, and instead of R, you have Rd. When we are in Rd, in order to make sense of the mild formulation, you need to put a correlation in space. So the noise here is white in time as has a spatial correlation given by. As has a spatial correlation given by the risk curve. Okay, and then we prove the same result: the Osgod condition is sufficient for blow-up almost surely of the solution of this equation. Right? So here, the solution of the equation, we don't know how to prove it. So if there is a local solution, it will blow up. That's what we're proving here. And the idea of the proof is very similar, taking into account that this Gaussian process. That this Gaussian process now here is a bifraction of Brownian motion with parameters that depend on the fractional Laplacian and on the Rieskernel, beta. Okay, so when you compute the covariance of this Gaussian term, you get again a bifraction on Bernard-Bausian, but with more general parameters. So exactly the same proof, I mean, exactly. There are some new technicalities, but similar approach works. And here the X should be The x should be x is taken in a ball in Rd. Okay, okay, so this is uh this is what we got so far, but uh we didn't know how to extend. Okay, sorry, I got but here for the moment we had only a sigma and this argument doesn't work, at least doesn't seem to work when instead of a sigma you have a sigma of u. Okay, so so this is. So, this is the main result. Oops. Okay. Right. So, this is the main result that I'm presenting here. So, here we are. So, here we added a U. Okay. So, we added a sigma to U, sorry, which is different from the one that Dava had this morning because this morning was parabolic Anderson model, sigma zero equals zero. However, he must see. However, here sigma is bounded. Okay, so Higma is bounded globally leach it and bounded away from the origin. So we are not in the case of parabolic undersomal. And the initial condition is bounded. Okay, so now we consider this equation and we wanted to extend this result about the blow-up, but we proved something much more strong, which is the following. So we said that a random field solution UTX. That a random field solution UTX blows up everywhere and instantaneously. So far, the blow-up was in finite time. Okay, there exists a finite time that the solution blows up. Here, we're going to prove that the solution blows up everywhere for any t and so instantaneously for any t and everywhere for every x. So we prove that for any t and for every x, utx equal to infinity unusual. Okay? And we prove this again under the sufficient condition of the Oscar. Under the sufficient condition of the Osgoode condition to hold. Okay, so this is the main theorem. And here, as a difference of what we did with Mohammed, with Mohammed, we didn't really need it, the concept of solution, of local solution, okay? But here we need to define the concept of solution. What do we mean? I mean, the solution. We are proving non-existence, but of what? Which object? Okay. So we first First, define the concept of solution. Okay, so let me tell you how we did that. So, first of all, recall the mild formulation is the same as before, with the difference that here, while the approach by Leon and Vira didn't work, because this is not a Gaussian process anymore, right? This is a random process, but it's not necessarily Gaussian when you have a sigma of U, right? So the approach by fractional motion doesn't work, okay? Doesn't work okay. Okay, so first of all, how do we make sense of a solution to that? And the idea is to use the fact that V is non-decreasing, okay, and locally Lipschitz, and to do a truncation algorithm. So we consider Bn to be the B minimum on n, okay, when n is a natural number. Then Bn is Lipschitz continuous. And Bn by construction, Bn is less or equal to Bn when N is less or equal to n. When n is less or equal to n. So if we replace b by b n in this equation, everybody is global ellipsid, so we have a solution un. By a standard comparison theorem, since b n is less than or equal to b m, u n is less than or equal to um okay, so this means that this limit exists and has lower semicontinuous sample functions. So this is the object that we're going to call the solution, although it The solution, although it can be infinite. To be called a solution, we need to show that it satisfies the mal formulation. And actually, we observe that it's a minimal solution in the following sense. By construction of U, if C is less or equal to B, where C is a global ellipsoid coefficient, then U of C, the solution with drift C, is going to be less than or equal to our solution U. Going to be less or equal to our solution u with read b by construction of u. Okay, so this shows that u is actually the supremum of all the possibles you see where supremum goes over all global ellipsic functions. So we refer to u as the minimal solution when b is local ellipsoid. Okay, so this is the first observation. And the second observation is that u satisfies the mal formulation. Okay, so of course, up to some random variable, that it's the random variable taught that it's the first time that u s y is infinity for all s less than t and y equal to r. So this is a zero infinity value random variable. And then by the monotone conversions theorem, since b is monotone and sigma is bounded and continuous, we can take limits of the mild formulation of each term and we can prove that u satisfies the malformulation for all x and for all t less than tau. Okay, so this defines a solution of defines a solution of this defines the object u that we call the solution. Okay, and now we want to show that this u is going to be infinity almost shortly for all t and x. Okay. Okay, so what is the idea of the proof of this theorem once we have this solution? So somehow the idea is the same as Leon and Jorge and Villa, but it needs to be But it needs to be refined. So, somehow, the idea is to see that it's the noise that pushes the solution to infinity using some continuity purposes of the noise. But here we did it in a more technical way that allow us to prove this stronger result. And one of the key results is the ergodicity of the solution. Okay, so this is something that has been studied in these two papers by These two papers by Cheng Davar, David Noola, and Pu. So they prove, I mean, they give a criterion to show that solutions of SPDEs are ergodic, okay? And this criterion is given by this sufficient condition for the process to be stationary and weakly mixing. Okay, so a sufficient condition for the process to be ergodic is that. Process to be ergodic is that for all integers k, real numbers t and Lipschin's continuous function g, the limit when x goes to infinity of the covariance of gx. And g0 is zero, where gx is the product of these Lipschitz functions evaluated at the process that you want to show that Ipsirg audit of Tx plus psi. Okay, so if you show that the limit of this is zero, this implies the weakly mixing condition. Weakly mixing condition, and if the process is as well stationary, this implies aquaticity. Okay, so this is something that they used in these papers. And to prove that the covariance converges to zero, the idea is to use Mali-Venn calculus. Okay, so Raluk already introduced some slides on Mali-Ven calculus. So here, the only thing that we're using for Mali Vanux calculus is what is called Poincaré inequality, which says that the covariance of two random variables that are matched. Random variables that are malleable and differentiable, it's bounded by the integral of the product of the malleab derivative, the L2 norm of the Malleably derivative. So to prove that the process is ergodic, we need to compute the covariance of these two guys, okay, and bound the Malian derivatives and see that you get something that converges to zero. So this is the trick. Okay? Yes. You're saying that in the the setting that they're interested in, the solution blows up all T and all X. Yes. But at the same time, you also have the solutions ergodic. Okay, no. No. The solution is going to be ergodic in the no, that's in the global ellipsoid case. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You only need, yeah, that's a good remark. We only need the ergodicity when B is globally literally, so for the BN. Okay, no, otherwise, yeah. Okay, so here are the steps of the proof. So first of all, we look at the sufficient conditions for the solution to be ergodic. Okay, and for this, we did it in general for a general predictable random field. Okay, and we look at sufficient conditions on the Mali-Van derivative so that the process is ergodic and that the convolution with the space-time white noise is also ergodic. And the sufficient condition is that the Malay-Van derivative of the process is bounded by this two product of heat curve. So this follows more from the papers. So this follows. So, this follows from Poincaré's inequalities and these papers by Davar and the others. Okay? This case was not covered. Because in Let me remember, I think that we're dealing with the parabolic underson model, and here we don't have the parabolic underson model. Davar, correct me if I'm saying something wrong about your paper. Saying something wrong about your paper, but no, this was this case was not covered in. And here we have a drift that didn't have drift, and they were in the arparabolic under some other case. I think the drift does make the drift also matters. And the drift also, we also had a drift that they didn't have. So first, this deals with the stochastic term, but then, well, it's in the other slide here. Uh, well, it's in the other slide here, but here uh, you deal also with the drifter. So, here B is global ellipsis with constant initial condition because we need stationary to be ergodic, okay? And then we proved as a consequence of this general result that the solution is ergodic, okay. In this particular case, we have an equation for the Malayban derivative, and this works well. Where do we use ergodicity? And here is the result. So, this And here is the result. So, this result, so it's a technical result. So, remember that I z is the stochastic term. So, this is similar as what Leol Villa said, right? This condition of lim of inf that pushes the noise term to infinity, but here the trick was to do in x instead of time, okay? Okay, because here the ergodicity is in x, it is fixed and it's ergodic. In X, t is fixed and it's a got it in X. Okay, so the trick here was to look at the limit when in X instead of time, as Leon and Villa were doing. Okay, so using continuity properties of the stochastic convolution, etc., one can show that the probability of limp soup being big is positive, and then ergodicity implies that these holes are not sure. Okay, so this is really the trick where we use the ergodicity. Okay, so once we have all that, the key step of the proof is to show this lower bound. Again, for B L C continuous. Okay, so the idea is to show that the infimum of U is lower bounded by the supremum of over n of the integral of one divided by b integral between m and n. And here, it suffices to take, so sorry, rho is the. So, sorry, rho is the infimum of zero. Okay, so how do we prove this? So, the idea is to use again, similarly as Leon and Vila, we are comparing to a differential equation. So, the idea is to use this result on differential equations. So, if you have this differential equation with Lipschitz continuous drift, then the infimum over f over the interval t to t is bigger or equal to n, where n is. To n where n is where n is the is this constant in the is a fixed number in the integral. Okay, so the idea to prove that is that if you consider the equality, if you consider the differential equation, at time t, the g is going to be equal to n, okay, so after t is going to be bigger to n, and by a comparison theorem, so will be f after t. So that's the idea, okay. So that's the idea. Okay, so this is the crucial result to show this lower bound. And then the idea, as we observe here, is that using u, the limit of u n, is lower bounded by un. So we only need to apply this inequality for the truncated, which is global ellipses. Okay, so that's the idea. And then finally, taking n going to infinity and using monotone conversions. To infinity and using monotonic convergence theorem, and the fact that we are assuming that the Osgot condition holds, then this is infinity. Okay, so this proves that the solution is going to blow up everywhere in a random interval time. Okay, so and there is a bit of more computations to show that it's actually true for any compact set over R plus and R that the infimum will blow up. The infimum will blow up. So that's it, that's the end of the proof. So it's really a refinement using this ergodicity on space and this truncation argument of the starting proof of Leona and Villa that was the inspiration of all that. Okay, thank you. And here I finish with the papers I mentioned. Thank you. I think we can do like a tendable example. I mean, I think the classic example students already do it. Those burns like v S for S right one and I gave me. No, I gave you this example of u power one plus heteron. Right, yes. Yes, so u plus one plus eta was the example. Yeah, and what is interesting to see is that in the in the PD case, case uh there are eta for which if u0 is small enough there will be solutions that exist for all time here as you see u0 doesn't play any any role it's because the noise always pushes the solution to infinity and the pd there's no noise and then one can when one can construct the picar iteration and produce solutions that are bounded if the initial condition is small enough which is not true as we show in the spd scale I don't know, like what do you mean? Like only in space, for example, or only in time? So the Anderson model. So, the Anderson model. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Um, I'm going to go to the next stage. No, I see what you mean, yeah. Um so maybe in this case, yeah, So, maybe in this case, yeah, that's right. In this case, it would depend on the initial data. Yeah. Yeah, because, yeah, I think there are things done, but yeah, I think that in this case, you don't expect everywhere to blow up. Yeah, no, no. It may depend. So maybe the initial data is big enough, it will blow up. And if it's small enough, maybe not. Yeah.
