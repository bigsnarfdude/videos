Title of my talk is Arthur Packets in Generalized Endoscopy for Real Reductive Groups. Is the sound clear? Yes, okay, good. So I want to report on some recent joint work with David Vogan and Jeff Adams. We do basically. Atoms, we do basically two things. We introduce a generalization over R of endoscopic lifting, and we apply this generalized lifting to Arthur packets and use it to complete the proof of the unitarity of all Arthur packets over R. So the first half of this talk may be, I suspect, will be somewhat redundant with previous. With previous talks and probably review for almost everyone here, but anyway, here I go. So, g is a complex connected reductive algebraic group equipped with an inner class of real forms. And pi of g is the set of equivalence classes of irreducible, admissible representations of real forms of G in the specified inner class. Check G is the complex Langlands dual group of G, and check G. Of G and check G gamma is the L group of G associated to the chosen inner class. Wr, as usual, is the vague group of R. And I will denote by phi of check G gamma the set of Langlands parameters, phi. These are, in particular, homomorphisms from the Vague group to the L group. And this is a topological space. This is a topological space in a natural way, and it has a natural check G action by conjugation on the target. So here's a kind of simple formulation of the Languins classification for real reductive groups. For each Langelands parameter, for each equivalence class of Languins parameters, there is an associated finite set of irreducible admissible. Set of irreducible admissible representations called the L packet of phi. And these L packets together partition the set of irreducible admissible representations. And these packets consist of representations of various real forms in the inner class. And each L packet can be, the elements of each L packet can be parametrized. Packet can be parameterized in terms of representations of a finite group. So if phi is a fixed Langland parameter, we consider the stabilizer of phi under the action of check G. This is an algebraic group. And its component group is some two group. And the L packet associated to phi is in natural bijection with irreducible representations of irreducible. Irreducible representations of this component group, A of V. So probably Vogen's name also belongs on this list. Langland, Snapp, Zuckerman, Harishandra, and Vogan. Okay, so of course, we also have the notion of an arthr parameter. An arthrit parameter is a continuous homomorphism, psi, from the vague. From the Vague group cross SL2 into check G gamma, satisfying the following properties. First, the restriction of psi to the V group is a tempered Langlands parameter. Tempered in the real case means that the image of the parameter is bounded. And secondly, the restriction of psi to SL2 is holomorphic or algebraic. And I will denote by psi of check g gamma the set of Arthur parameters one. Parameters. Once again, this is a topological space and has a check-g-action by conjugation on the target. So in this talk, I'm going to be considering arthr parameters of various special sorts. We say that an arthr parameter is unipotent if the image, or maybe more accurately, unipotent modulo is center. If the image of C cross, C cross, this is here the C cross in. This is here the C cross in the Veg group lies in the center of the dual group, check G. And we say that a parameter is distinguished if the image of the SL2 factor is not contained in a proper Levy subgroup. And it's easy to see that all distinguished parameters are unipotent. And at least if the group is semi-simple, there are only finitely many unipotent. There are only finitely many unipot and hence only finitely many distinguished parameters up to conjugation by check G. Okay, so to each arthr parameter, we can associate a Langley's parameter in the usual way. So if the arthur parameter is psi, the Langley's parameter is phi sub psi. And this defines an injection. And this defines an injection from equivalence classes of Arthur parameters into equivalence classes of Langlein's parameters. You can think of Arthur parameters as being sort of almost tempered Langleins parameters. And here is sort of one of the main results slash constructions in ABV. This is ABV, this is the book of Adams, Barbash, and Vogan from the early 90s. To each equivalence class of Arthur parameters, they associate a finite set of representations called an Arthur packet. The Arthur packet associated to psi contains the L packet associated to phi sub psi and And for a fixed Arthur parameter psi, there is a map from the elements of the Arthur packet to finite-dimensional representations of the Arthur component group. So this is the component group of the stabilizer of psi under the action of check G. So, of course, the representations in the image don't have to be irreducible and not all irreducible. Irreducible, and not all irreducibles appear necessarily, just a map to finite dimensional representations. And by a result of Adams, Arnsibia, and Mezzo, these packets coincide with the packets defined by Arthur in 2013 for the groups for which both definitions make sense. So, for the quasi-split classical groups. In particular, I mean, the packets defined by Arthur are sort of unitary by construction. And so, Construction and so for quasi-split classical groups, it's clear that these ABV packets are unitary, and that motivates the following conjecture. Each Arthur packet consists of unitary representations. So the book ABV says very little about unit. ABV says very little about unitarity. I did a control, I control-F'd the word unitary in ABV before I gave this talk, and it appears a remarkably small number of times, maybe four times in the entire book. And so we set out to do something about that. So the main theorem that we prove is a sort of reduction theorem. So this is a sort of a slightly informal. Informal formulation of our theorem. I will make it more precise later. The slogan is that Arthur's unitarity conjecture can be reduced to the case of distinguished Arthur parameters. So a little more precisely, suppose size and Arthur parameter for check G, which factors through a unipotent Arthur parameter for a Levy subgroup of G, as all arthur parameters do. So that this Levy is denoted check. So, that this levy is denoted check M gamma, then the packet on G is unitary if and only if the packet on M is unitary. So we prove this theorem by showing that the packet on G is obtained from the packet on M through various kinds of unitarity-preserving parabolic induction. But this is the upshot for unitarity. So for unipotent arthr packets, unitarity is known in all cases by a sort of a collection of different results. So for G quasi-split classical, as I mentioned, unitarity follows from Arthur and then, of course, this result of Adams, Arnsibia, and Mezzo. G is real classical, not necessarily quasi-split. We have the work of Barbash, Ma, Sun, and Zhu. For G, real exceptional, which is to say, Exceptional, which is to say, yeah, real form of a simple exceptional group. Unitarity follows from work of Adams, Van Leeuwen, Miller, and Vogen. And if G is a complex group, classical or exceptional, unitarity follows from, well, from cheating maybe a little bit, but follows from some recent work of myself and Dougal Davis. And so if you if you And so, if you put all of this together, you have the following fact. Arthur's unitarity conjecture is true. Sorry to interrupt. May I ask a question? Yes, in your previous year, you said you reduced to the Levi-subgroup. I just want to confirm it's something from the real parabolic or you allow zeta-stable parabolic. Yeah, I allow, I allow, I certainly allow theta-stable parabolic. So these are, yeah, there's some, yeah, there's some. Yeah, there's some. I mean, the terminology maybe is slightly confusing. I guess the kinds of levees I have in mind are referred to in the Piatic groups literature as twisted levee subgroups. So yeah, so these levees don't have to be the levees of rational parabolics. Yeah, that answered my question. Thank you. Okay, so I want I guess what I want to do in the time that remains is to is to sketch some of sketch a proof, I suppose, of this reduction result. But first, I should maybe give an overview of the ABV point of view. So the starting point of ABV is the idea that there should be some kind of relationship, a duality relationship between the representation theory of G. Between the representation theory of G and the geometry of the space of Langlands parameters. So, roughly speaking, what this means is that character formulas for representations of G should correspond to closure relations on check G orbits on the space of Langeland's parameters. The first problem you encounter on the first several pages of ABV. Sorry, is there a question? Sorry, is there a question? No. The first problem you encounter in the real case is that all of the check G orbits on the space of Langlands parameters is closed. So remember, the image of a Langlands parameter consists of semi-simple elements. And so these, there are no interesting closure relations among the check-g orbits on the space of Langlands parameters. And so the solution proposed in ABV. So, the solution proposed in ABV is to actually change the definition of a Langeland's parameter for a real reductive group. So, to find some closely related space of closely related parameters with a more interesting geometry, which reflects the representation theory of G, of the real forms of G. So, I'm not, having said that, I'm not going to define what these closely related parameters are, but I will. Parameters are, but I will say a few words, general words, about this space of parameters, this space of, which I'll call ABV parameters, or sometimes geometric parameters. So the ABV parameter space is a certain check G equivariant quotient of the space of Langeland's parameters. And it has the following properties. So, first, the quotient map induces a bijection on the level. A bijection on the level of check G orbits. So equivalence classes of Langlands parameters precisely correspond to check G orbits on the ABV parameter space X. And if phi is a Langlands parameter which maps to some point X, then the natural inclusion of isotropy groups is a maximal reductive subgroup. So, in particular, there is an isomorphism of local component groups. So, the Langlands component group A of phi is naturally identified with the component group A of X, the component group of the stabilizer of X. So, just as there is a, so of course, there's a map called the infinitesimal character map from the space of Langeland's parameters to infinite. Of Langlands parameters to infinitesimal characters, h star mod w. If you have a Langlands parameter, you just take the differential of the Langlands parameter and you evaluate at one, at the point one in the Lie algebra of the Veg group. And this defines a map from, well, this gives you a semi-simple element in check G, which gives you an infinitesimal character. So just as there's a map from phi to h star mod w. From phi to h star mod w, there's a map from x to h star mod w. It's sensible to talk about the infinitesimal character of a geometric parameter. And this infinitesimal character map is compatible in the obvious way with the infinitesimal character map for phi. So sort of the idea is to work is to sort of all of the Is to sort of all of the geometry we care about for the purpose of this talk takes place at a single infinitesimal character. So I'm going to fix lambda in infinitesimal character and write x lambda for the pre-image of lambda under this infinitesimal character map. So this space x lambda is a smooth, complex algebraic variety with finitely many check g orbits. And more is true. It is built in a certain precise sense out of partial flag varieties. So here's an example. If G is PGL2C, then check G is SL2C if we fix the infinitesimal character of the trivial representation. And the space X lambda is this induced bundle. induced bundle SL2 times over SO2 the the the flag variety for SL2 so the the SL2 orbits on this space X lambda correspond to the SO2 orbits on the flag variety and there are finitely many in fact three SO2 orbits on the flag variety Orbits on the flag variety SL2 mod B. And all of the spaces X lambda look sort of basically like this, I mean with some minor complications. So we study representations using complete geometric parameters. So a complete geometric parameter for check g gamma is a pair. Check G gamma is a pair S tau consisting of a check G orbit of geometric parameters S and an irreducible check G equivariant local system tau on S. So it's the same thing, of course, as an irreducible representation of the component group A of X for some point X in S. And we denote by C check G gamma the set of complete geometric parameters. Of complete geometric parameters. Yeah, maybe there should be a subscript C sub lambda of check g gamma. So each complete geometric parameter determines, first of all, two different classes in the Grotendy group of equivariant constructible sheaves on X lambda. So the first class you can obtain from this local system is From this local system is an irreducible constructible sheaf. You just extend by zero. And the second class you can get is this irreducible perverse sheaf, which is the IC extension of this local system. And for general reasons having nothing to do with this particular space, these two sets, the set of irreducible perverse extensions and the set of extensions. Perverse extensions and the set of irreducible constructible extensions form two different Z bases for the Grotendy group. Two Z bases in natural bijection with one another. So on the other side, on the representation theory side, each complete geometric parameter determines two different classes in the Grotendy group of finite length representations of real forms of G of infinitesimal character lambda. G of infinitesimal character lambda. So remember that so C consists of an orbit, S, and a local system, tau. And the orbit S is the same thing, it precisely specifies an equivalence class of Langlands parameters. And the local system tau precisely specifies an irreducible representation of the Langlands component group. And that's exactly what's required to pin down a representation. To pin down a representation under the Langleins classification. So the parameter xi determines an irreducible representation, π of xi, and this irreducible representation comes from a standard representation, m of xi. And once again, these two sets, the set of irreducibles and the set of standards, give two different Z bases for the Grotend group of representations. Okay, so these various four bases are related by this Vogen duality pairing. So Vogen duality is a perfect Z linear pairing between the Grotendy groups, between the Grotendy group of representations of G of infinitesimal character lambda and the Grotendy group of Czech G equivariant perverse sheaves. equivariant perverse sheaves, constructible sheaves on x lambda. And it's defined on the easy bases, that is on the standard representations and the irreducible constructible sheaves. It's defined to be the Kronecker delta. So that's just a definition. The big theorem in ABV is that this pairing also This pairing also takes the form of the Kronecker delta, essentially, up to a sine on these hard bases, on the basis of irreducible representations and irreducible perverse sheaves. So unwinding this, what's being said is that we have two different bases for two different bases for representations and two different bases for constructible. And two different bases for constructible sheaves. In both cases, we have a change of basis matrix going from one to the other. And the theorem is that these two change of basis matrices are very straightforwardly related to one another. So they're roughly, I suppose, inverse transpose of one another with some signs inserted. So the definition of Arthur packets in ABV has to do with micro-local geometry on the ABV parameter space. So a basic invariant that you can associate to any perverse or constructible sheaf on x lambda is its characteristic cycle. And the characteristic cycle is a formal Z linear combination of co-normal bundles for check G orbits on X lambda, of which there x lambda, of which there are finitely many. So the multiplicities that appear in this formula are called the micro local multiplicities denoted m sub s of p. So just a very sort of elementary lemma about characteristic cycles is that if you know if you if you have a perverse sheaf, well, if you start with some complete geometric parameter, Some complete geometric parameter, and you look at it and you write p for its for its ic extension, then the only micro-local multiplicities with the only check-g orbits with non-zero micro-local multiplicity are contained in the closure of S, are contained in the support of this perverse sheaf P. So, the micro-local multiplicity along all of the check-g orbits, which are not contained in the closure of S, are zero. And the other factor we need is that the micro-local multiplicity of P along S is non-zero. In fact, it's equal to the rank of tau, the rank of the local system tau. Okay, so here's the definition. So here's the definition of arthur packets in ABV. Let psi be an arthur parameter. Remember, psi determines, first of all, a Langlands parameter. Sorry. Yeah, psi determines a Langlands parameter, and this Langlands parameter determines a check G orbit on the space of ABV parameters. So denote this check G orbit by S. Then the Arthur packet attached to psi is the set. To psi is the set of irreducibles such that the corresponding perverse sheaves contain the conormal to S in their characteristic cycle. So that's the definition of an Arthur packet. So, but by the lemma on the previous slide, it's clear that the Arthur packet corresponds. That the Arthur packet corresponding to psi always contains the L packet corresponding to psi. And the other representations in the Arthur packet, the ones that are not in this L packet, belong to check-g orbits which are bigger than S, check-G orbits which contain S in their boundary. Okay, so with this machinery established, it's very easy to define, at least on a formal level, Langlands functoriality for real reductive groups. So here's a very general setting for Langlands functoriality. You have a, in addition to G, you have a second group, complex connected reductive algebraic group, equipped also with an inner class of real. Equipped also with an inner class of real forms. And you have some E group associated to H. So this is not always the L group. The difference between an L group and an E group is that an L group is always a semi-direct product. An E group is just some kind of gamma extension of check H. Anyway, that's a technicality that I won't really stress. But we have this E group check H gamma. But we have this E group check H gamma and we have an L homomorphism from epsilon from check H gamma to check G gamma. So this L homomorphism, epsilon induces a continuous map on the ABV parameter spaces. And if we fix an infinitesimal character, Character, or rather, if we fix a semi-simple element lambda in the Lie algebra of check H, we get a semi-simple element in the Lie algebra of check G. And epsilon restricts to an algebraic map between the corresponding pieces, x lambda, check H gamma, and X lambda check G gamma. And pullback along this morphism is an exact functor and therefore defines a group homomorphism. Defines a group homomorphism on the level of Grotendy groups. So you have this pullback map from the Grotendy group of constructible sheaves on X lambda check G gamma to the Grotendy group of constructible sheaves on X lambda check H gamma. If we take the transpose of this map and we apply the Vogund duality pairing, we get a group homomorphism, epsilon lower star, from representations of H to representations of H. Of H to representations of G. So there's a the careful reader will notice a little apostrophe here on the on the source of the map. That's because we have we have for H an E group rather than an L group. And the perverse sheaves on the parameter space for the E group correspond not to representations, but sort of projective representations of real forms of H. So the prime just means that I'm talking. So, the prime just means that I'm really talking about projective representations, but again, that's not something I want to talk too much about. Okay, so it's sort of easy to see how epsilon lower star behaves on standard representations. So here's how epsilon lower star, how what Langland's functoriality does to standard representations. Suppose we have some orbit sh in the parameter. H in the parameter space for H and this orbit corresponds to an orbit S sub G in the parameter space for G. Then we get a natural homomorphism of Langland's component groups from A of S of H to A of S of G. And then on standard representations, epsilon lower star is given by the following formula. So if we have a, if we start with the standard of If we start with the standard of H parameterized by SH, we get a sum of standards for G. And the standards which appear are exactly well, all the standards which appear belong to the L packet for S of G, and the multiplicities are given by these HOMs. So we look at the irreducible representations of the component group for S of G such that the restriction to the component group for S of H contains tau of H, the representation that we started with. A little bit of, takes a second to interpret this formula, but very simple. So, a much more subtle question is how do we So, a much more subtle question is: how do Arthur packets behave under epsilon lower star? And remember, the Arthur packets correspond to sort of have to do with characteristic cycles on the ABV parameter space, and epsilon lower star has to do with the pullback of constructible sheaves. And so, this question is more or less equivalent to the following purely geometric question: How do characteristic cycles behave? Characteristic cycles behave under the pullback of constructible sheaves? And this is a very difficult question, and very little can be said at this level of generality. So here is a general setting in which more can be said about this question. So we say that H epsilon is a pseudo-endoscopic group if there exists a finite order element S in check G. Of G check G such that check H is the identity component of the centralizer of S. So this is just ever so slightly weaker than the notion of an endoscopic group. So if we require that S commutes with not just check H, but all of check H gamma, including its non-identity component, then we recover the Langland-Shell-stad notion of an endoscopy. The Langland-Shellstadt notion of an endoscopic group. And in this case, epsilon-lower star coincides, at least on stable sums, with endoscopic lifting as defined by Langlands and Shelsted. That's a theorem in ABV. So yeah, this remark is just saying that the data of a pseudoendoscopic group defines a one co-cycle. A one cocycle of gamma with values in the center of check H. And this co-cycle is trivial if and only if the pseudoendoscopic group is in fact endoscopic. Okay, so yeah, I've written on this slide that we have some general theorems about pseudo endoscopic lifting, but I But I don't need them and I won't state them. For the purpose of this talk, I just want to focus on a particular class of examples of pseudoendoscopic groups, which this theory was sort of developed for. So I want to talk about rational Levy subgroups or twisted Levy subgroups. So what is a rational Levy subgroup? Let M be a Levy subgroup of the complex group G such that the root datum of M is stable under gamma. Is stable under gamma, under the Galois group. So in this setting, it's always possible to find an L homomorphism, epsilon, from check m gamma into check g gamma, at least from where check m gamma here is an E group. If G is simply connected, we can always take check m gamma to be an L group, but in general, we cannot. This E group stuff is sort of unavoidable. Is sort of unavoidable in this setting. And it's clear that check M gamma is a pseudo endoscopic group, right? Because you just take some regular element in the center of check M and you take some regular element S in the center of check M. But this element S may not commute with the non-identity component of check M gamma. And so usually this twisted Levy subgroup is This twisted Levy subgroup is not an endoscopic group. So, this is the simplest example of this failure. If G is PGL2R, so that then in this case, check G gamma is the product SL2C times gamma. If we take M to be the compact Cartan subgroup of G, then there is no, I've written there is no. Is no, I've written there is no epsilon for which m epsilon is an endoscopic group because, well, this is some calculation. So on the dual side, you want gamma to act on check M by inversion. So, for example, you take check M to be the diagonal torus in SL2C, and you take And SL2C, and you take and you look at the group that's generated by the diagonal torus and the kind of the vial, the vial group element, 0, 1, minus 1, 0. And if you want an element S, which commutes with the diagonal torus and the vial group element, it's got to be in the center of SL2C. So it's got to be either plus or minus the identity matrix, but that won't do. That doesn't give you an endoscopic group. Okay, so yeah, so rational, in general, rational Levy subgroups are not endoscopic, but they are pseudoendoscopic. And so let me explain some of the things that we can prove about pseudo endoscopic lifting in the setting of rational Levy subgroups. So suppose psi m is an arthur parameter for check m gamma, and let psi of g be the associated arthur parameter for check mm. The associated arthur parameter for check G gamma. Then we prove that the set of, well, we prove that the arthur packet for g, every element in the arthur packet for g is obtained by lifting from the arthur packet for m. So here I'm using this notation, the square brackets notation to denote the set of irreducible constituents. So when you apply epsilon lower star to an irreducible in the Arthur packet for M, you Arthur packet for M, you get some linear combination in the Grotendy group. And brackets just means extract all of the irreducibles, which appear with non-zero multiplicity in this linear combination. So this is more or less equivalent to the following geometric theorem. For any irreducible equivariant perverse sheaf P on the Variant perverse sheaf p on the parameter space for check g um uh the the the micro local multiplicity of sg is non-zero implies the micro local multiplicity of s m of the pullback is non-zero. Let me say that one more time. So we have this we have this orbit s of g in the parameter space for g and this orbit s of m in the parameter space for m and the claim Space for M. And the claim is that if the micro-local multiplicity of P along Sg is non-zero, then the micro-local multiplicity of the pullback of P along SM is non-zero. So, I just want to maybe just, I'm not going to prove this, and I'm not even really going to sketch the proof, but I want to just mention. Just mention the sort of key geometric idea that goes into it. So we introduce a kind of an auxiliary space of parameters. So we form this induced bundle. We take the parameter space for check m gamma and we induce it up to check G. Denote this by y lambda. So it's clear that there is a there is a natural Here, that there is a natural closed immersion of x lambda into y lambda. And the action of check g induces a smooth fiber bundle from y lambda to x lambda check g gamma. So we can decompose this map epsilon as the composition of two simpler maps. The first map The first map is a closed embedding, and the second map is a smooth fiber bundle. And so the problem of determining the behavior of characteristic cycles under epsilon upper star can be reduced to two simpler questions. How do we understand the behavior of characteristic cycles under P upper? Of characteristic cycles under P upper star? And how do we understand the behavior of characteristic cycles under I upper star? The behavior of characteristic cycles under P upper star is very easy because P is a smooth fiber bundle. So we're left with the problem of determining the behavior of characteristic cycles under I upper star. And it turns out this X lambda is the this X Lambda is the This x lambda is essentially the fixed points of a finite order automorphism on y lambda. So this element s defines a finite order automorphism on this modified space y lambda, and x, the parameter space for check m, is the sigma fixed points in y lambda. And this equality. And this equality allows for the application of a Lefschetz fixed point theorem, which allows us to calculate micro-local traces along this map, I. So I should say in the what happens in the endoscopic case, and this is explained in ABV, is there's a finite, is that S defines a finite order automorphism on X lambda. Automorphism on x lambda on the parameter space for g and since s commutes with all of check m gamma, the fixed points of this automorphism is basically the parameter space for m. And so we can apply this fixed points theorem right off the bat, just to epsilon directly. Problem is, in the pseudo-endoscopic case, S doesn't commute with all of check m gamma. And so the parameter Check m gamma. And so the parameter space for m is not contained in the fixed points for the fixed points of s. And so we have to introduce this auxiliary space to get around that issue. Okay, so just a brief digression on cohomological induction. So fix a complex parabolic subalgebra, Q and G. Then there is a group homomorphism called cohomological induction, and this goes from the Grotendy group of representations of M to the Grotendy group of representations of G, preserving infinitesimal character. And this homomorphism, well, I won't, yeah, I won't define it, but it generalizes two important constructions in representation theory. In representation theory. So if Q is real, then this map coincides with ordinary normalized parabolic, real parabolic induction. And if Q is theta stable, then this map is a Zuckerman functor. So there are lots of theorems regarding this map, Rgq. This map, RGQ, and its relationship to unitarity, this map is known to preserve unitary modules under some conditions on the inducing module, basically some dominance condition on the inducing module. And this condition is vacuous if the parabolic is real. So real parabolic induction always preserves unitarity. This more general cohomological induction sometimes preserves unitarity. Induction sometimes preserves unitarity. And so we have now basically two group homomorphisms with the same source and target. So we have comological induction, and then we have this pseudoendoscopic lifting. And so a very natural question is, what is the relationship between these two homomorphisms? And here is a first sort of unsatisfying answer. So the unsatisfying So, the unsatisfying answer is that for this fixed infinitesimal character lambda, there is an element w in the integral Weyl group of lambda such that epsilon lower star is comological induction followed by this translation functor T sub W. Okay, so this is not the kind of answer we wanted. I mean, this translation functor is getting in the way. We don't know what it does to unitarity. But remarkably, on the level of Arthur packets, there's a much more striking relationship. Basically, on the level of Arthur packets, we can ignore this translation functor. So suppose psi m is a unipotent arthur parameter. Then we show that the We show that every lift of an Arthur representation for M is an irreducible constituent in an induced representation. So if you take the Arthur packet for M and you apply endoscopic lifting, every irreducible you obtain, Irreducible you obtain is comologically induced. So yeah, so this is just an open-ended provocative question. What is the correct analog of cohomological induction for p-adic groups? All of this stuff having to do with the dual group, the pseudo-endoscopic lifting, applies equally in the case of the group. Applies equally in the case of p-adic groups. And so it's natural to look for some kind of sort of description on the group side of this group homomorphism, E lower, epsilon lower star. In the real case, we have cohomological induction. What is the correct analog in the Piatic case? I have no idea. So let me just now sort of combine all of these pieces to prove our main result. So suppose ψG is a Psi g is an arthur parameter for g. So we can always find an E group, check m gamma, such that psi of g factors through a distinguished arthr parameter into check m gamma. Denote this distinguished arthur parameter by psi sub m. So by the first theorem, the arthur parameter for g The Arthur parameter for G is obtained by endoscopic lifting. Sorry, the Arthur packet for G is obtained by endoscopic lifting from the Arthur packet for M. And by the second theorem, the irreducibles appearing in epsilon lower star of the Arthur packet for M. On lower star of the Arthur packet for M are comologically induced. And so the conclusion is that every representation in the Arthur packet for G is comologically induced from a representation in the Arthur packet for M. And the comological induction preserves unitarity. So I mentioned there's some conditions on Q and the inducing model. Conditions on Q and the inducing module, which guarantee unitarity, and these conditions are met in this particular case. So, since the right-hand side is unitary, the left-hand side is unitary. And not just that, every representation in the Arthur packet for G is some kind of constituent in a comologically induced representation. So I will stop here. Stop here and see if there are questions. Thank you very much.
