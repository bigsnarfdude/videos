Okay, yes. Sorry, Richard, could I just get a thumbs up? Then you hear you? Then you hear us? Okay, great. Thanks, Richard. So, thank you very much for the invitation, Ania. And yeah, it's usual. Not usual for me to talk to all these people from plant fields, but anyway, so I'm coming from an physicist, experimentalist, making some funny experiments or setups and working a lot on single cell, single animal cells, but now trying to do something on these plant cells, which are already having. So first of all, oh, okay. First of all, but now you're asking me to answer. Need to answer again, okay. First of all, yes, the system we're working on, so it's a root hair from RV Stadiana. So the router, in fact, is still a single cell. So if you look here, so this is the root you see, and laterally. You see, and laterally, you have this growing hair, but are just single cells. And you can see here, maybe I can show you just the room. So laterally from the room, you get one single cell bulging, inflating in some sense. So it keeps as a radius a single cell, we say size, so 10 microns, but can really grow and see it till only. Till almost one millimeter. Okay, so it's interesting because it's one single cell, so it has to be simple as a system, but it's also growing. And when I say growing, maybe one point, it's either here. So you see here one growing. So you have, you resume all of the, what is known about the tip growth in this single cell. So you are under pressure and you have here at the tip a specific part which is, I would say, is creeping. Would say is creeping in some sense under the pressure, and then you have this growth, and the lateral part are more stiff and can resist this pressure. And we have developed some systems to just follow this. Okay, let's not do this. So, you can see, in fact, the interesting point here is that you can see also the nucleus here, and you can follow the dynamics of the nucleus. So, you can see the growth of the single cell and also the dynamics. Single cell and also the dynamics of the nucleus during the growth. Okay, sorry for the problems here. Anyway, so we have big questions. So I worked a lot on mechanosensing on single animal cells. And now I'm just wondering if you could say something on this single root hair cells. And as I told you, so of course, these are the soil and facing many obstacles, many different soil rigidities. And we will see here. And we will see here or we'll study the effect of stiffness on the single cell growth and also on the nucleus dynamics. So we use just some of the advice maybe we use two kinds of setups. So one is just microfluidic chips inside which we can grow. We can grow roots and with lateral channels we can follow this growth of single. Growth of single root herself, but we also develop some cantilever-based fault measurement, and we can do smart things. But I don't have time to ask a question or be like to show some. Anyway, to illustrate this a little bit more, we have here some movies. So, first one here, this is the chip. You will see the root growing. Yes, so the root growing. Yes, so the root drawing and lateral channels, and at some point works well, you will see, yeah, you see the root hair, and they will enter the lateral channels. You can follow really this movement. We can just focus on the nucleus, and we can see just below this one, we can follow in the reference of the nucleus, we can follow really how the nucleus is behaving, like you'll see like a fish in water. And we can also, as I told you, another part is to really do mechanics on single cells. So, here, just a single root hair pushing the calfila, so we can remove the force. And we can also hear, and this is maybe has something, some link with what Christophe showed yesterday, so it was any just I can just see this root here as a beam, cylinder. I can just make a small deflection. I can get then some information about the thickness of the wall. So I kind of think I don't have a grandma, but I want to comment on all this. So for today, it's just a very simple experiment. We can grow these root hairs in different media. In different media, so this agar media, so to make it more clear, it's something like this, very simple. So we use different agar media with different concentration, so we get more or less T and we just follow what happens to the growth of these single cells. Oops, a little too fast. So just fix some ideas here. So we are just So we are just following the length here of the root hair, growing laterally, and you see this growth in time. And you can see here, some point you have this maximum speed here, very constant, and then saturation. And you can see 700 micrometers in length finally. And oops. It doesn't seem to work. Okay, so these just are mean curves, and you have this color for stiffness. So, stiffness, in fact, is decreasing from top from blue to yellow. You're decreasing, in fact, the agar concentration, agar thickness. Anyway, you can see basically that the length of your root health is diminishing, in fact, with thickness increasing. But you can see also that the slope as the But you can see also that the slope at some point is changing, so the speed of course of road is changing. And we can comment more on this here. So this is like the statistics with at least 40 cells for each condition. And we can see, of course, the length is really decreasing with switches. Okay. We can also here have a look on the speed. So let, so these are mean speeds. People are all they won't see. Thank you very much, Peter. Okay, yeah, point I agree. Yeah, so this is our speed in time. And we can see, in fact, there is a phase of growth here. And at some point, it stops growing. And the interesting point is that whatever the stiffness, the time of growth is fixed. Okay, so time is fixed, length. So, time is fixed, length is increasing, speed also is affected, as I told you, whatever it's the average speed over the time of growth, or the maximum speed you can get at some point, it's decreasing with stiffness. Then, well, first thing I would say, if I'm talking about mechanical transactions, so you have this shell under pressure growing in some media and affected in its growth, but at some point we can also look at Some point we can also look at the position of the nucleus. So, when the root hair grows, at some point, the nucleus, which were initially in the flat cell, I would say, was of spherical shape. And at some point, it goes inside the new tube that is growing, and it becomes to be more flatten or more elongated. And it moves and migrates inside this tube. And what we can also measure here is the counter. Okay, so. Okay, so I can just measure the position here also and the speed of course as usually as a function of the stiffness. So, just first the comments, so you can look here at the in black, this is the tip speed, so the root hair root speed, and in blue, the position of the nucleus. So from the slope, you can get the speed, of course. It's very, I take all the points, it's very noisy, but you can take some mean speed. But you can take some mean speed at some point and define this mean speed, which is the mean slope you can see on the left. And here's the interesting point: that in fact, the speed of the nucleus, which is in fact inside this cell with very stiff walls under pressure and so on, in some sense feels the outside stiffness because the internal nucleus speed is decreasing with the external stiffness of the images. And it's also interesting to see here that the speed. And it's also interesting to see here that the speed of nibbles is really related to the speed of the rotor itself. We have some physical, I would say, link to the two. So just maybe to summarize the speed is changing, but also you can see here the average position following the T. And you can see in fact that this average position here on the left of the nucleus to the T is also diminishing with external. Also, diminishing with external resistance, I would say. Okay, so this, in fact, was the message I just want to give you today. So you can see, in fact, this correlation, this sensitivity of the nucleus and its dynamics to the outside world or the state of the outside world. How much time do I have? One minute. Okay, I have done what I wanted to do. I just want to show you maybe. So, of course, I have a lot of questions. So, of course, I have a lot of questions. I don't know how it happens. It's known in France that Atin is important in this stuff, but we don't really have any idea about the mechanism that lead to this adaptation of this length in between necrus and the T. So, I just want to thank all the people. So, this is in fact done in a human frontier science program with in collaboration with Marie Dichabute from SADU. From Stradhoo, and also Henrik, who should be here today, so he can do some modeling on this part. It's a work by David Perau, which really is a talented postdoc here, social proposition now, and Tom Ali, which is in PhD with me since one year now. Could I just comment on this? This is just a gift for Daniel, because he asked me last time. Asked me last time, so just one self-pushing on this middle, but if I can come there, you see when it impacts, as you said, it's inflating laterally, but then it still comes. You can see this is really fascinating for me. It looked like it swelled. As you said, as you said last time, so just blowing against it and swells. But then it recovers and then you have backlink. And then you have graphing also about this. So we have all this, and we can also, but I don't have time, can also play, as I mentioned from somebody in some discussion, we can play with the apparent stiffness of this plate, and we can change the dynamics in fact and see in real time how this single cell is adapting to the stiffness outside, but in real time. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, Angela. Thank you, Anthony. Daniel Posgrove has a question. So, the experiments where you bend the root hair, so you're treating the root hair like a sample lever, and so you can get some stiffness as a function of position along the root hair. Have you done that? And does it make sense? And are there changes along the length of the root? Yeah, so yeah, I don't know if everybody even online should see. Yeah, okay, so this is just a simple experiment. Oh, okay, anyway. Okay, so it's a beam. We bend the beam, and what you can see here from very simple low of this beam, we can get a relationship. But first, the direct one is just not directly. Young modulus, I mean, between the force and the deflection, you have this product, which is Young modulus of the wall, but also the way the mass is distributed. Also, the way the mass is distributed around the X. So we can just test here. This is very preliminary, in fact. Test if it's more or less following the law. It's a power law insert with the length. So where you are applying your force, that's your question. And you can see it's more or less working. So if I am applying some force at different distances from the basis, yeah. So my question was a little bit different. So, my question was a little bit different. So, when you bend it, if it's uniform material, then you'll get a predicted shape of the curvature. So, if it's non-uniform, right, some places are softer than other places, then by looking at that curvature, the local curvature, you can make implications about the local status. Okay, I know my answer was not exactly what you're asking, but it's still what is here, isn't that? It's not directly looking, which is exactly the Think which is exactly the third law of the position and so on. But if I just take different points, it seems like acting. So, this one, this one, very regular, so you choose it, seems like more or less uniform, at least with the position you can get in the mirror. But you're right, and now we are pressed to do something more. Very short ones, we think it's very soft, and very long ones to see if we can measure the difference. To see if we can measure the difference in rigidification or something like this during growth. And the other thing could be getting this root hairs growing in different media or different sea places, as I showed you. Then get outside the medium, and then we test them just to see the effect on the wall itself. But of course, here we have a problem, something information missing because it does E times I, so we don't know how the matter is distributed. Don't know how the matter is distributed, so of course, we need if we want to go to E for the young modulus, we need to, in fact, get some idea about the thickness. Yeah, so that's a beautiful question. Yeah, Anya and then Sarah. So, so you said that the nucleus is at different distances from the tip depending on the stiffness of the medium. Yes, and you seem to relate that directly to the stiffness, but isn't that simply related to the speed of growth? To the speed of growth? So, did you control? Did you do another experiment reducing the speed to see what? Yeah, you're totally right. Yeah, so I showed that the speed is depending on the stiffness. But the point is, still, you have, so the nucleus knows about the stiffness at the end. But I don't, I'm not sure. Yeah, so that's what you seem to say, that the nucleus knows about certain, but that's not necessary. I understand. So, your point is that it's not feeling this diffusion. Okay, it's just a certain difference. the sticklers okay it's just but but my my my my my idea i mean you could think about the niche be having ended up because so if it's in the indirect stuff like okay i am playing on the speed and now the speed is playing on the distance yeah that's what i'm saying yeah the other question the other question i have is about the temporary swelling that you showed at the end with uh with with the obstacles so we see that too in politics right so they actually grow wider in a stiffer medium uh and so um And so we were wondering whether that is to increase the effective force, right? Because if you grow wider with the constant pressure, you have a higher effective force. But it's fascinating that then goes back to the exact angle, which reminds me of our text. But anyway, go to Sarah. I think, Sarah. Yeah. Thanks, Sateth. Yeah, it's a beautiful setup and quite envious. My question kind of relates to Anya's second point as well, because we've done similar experiments with hypercottals, like pushing. Hypercottals like pushing. And I was just kind of curious about what happens when it hits that point and then it builds up some pressure to push. Like, do you see the cytoskeleton rearrange when it makes that contact before the pushing? Do you have any? Yes, thank you. So we are waiting for plants with a cytoskeleton with fluorescence so we can see what happens to cytoskeleton. We didn't do it, but to your right, of course, something to see. To see. And also, following Anyas, we can play with either playing on the set of skeleton to perturb this link. We can also play on the stiffness of the tip to make more or less speed and see if it can speed directly. So, of course, all this has to be done. Okay, Bruno has a question. Go ahead, Bruno. Yeah, hi. I just wanted to come back to what Dan tried to convey, I think, is because you at the moment. Is because you at the moment you're analyzing the overall behavior of your beam, I mean, with the displacement and the force, but you could make a local analysis like analyzing both the bending moment and the change in curvature at each place. And because you have also the cross-sectional geometry from can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes. I'm just trying to concentrate. So, so because you have the cross-sectional geometry, then you can really find out the you can really find out the apparent rigidity, let's say, of your tissue all along the cell. And this will be interesting because then you get a feel, I mean, of this rigidity. And this, I think, I wanted you to do, and I think it's a very good idea. Yeah, so this is just an experiment. So that's why I'm very pushed, like two weeks ago. And maybe it's pushing on the. and uh maybe it's pushing on the plate and stiffness change was in august so all this is very very new and okay so no no no worries just like it's i think it's a good idea to catch up with this um so enrica we'll have the last question and we'll hold questions for breaking yeah thank you thank you for that beautiful talk the um this business when the when the tip hits hits of an obstacle and then swells and then adjusts home it seemed like a homeostatic mechanism could that be Mechanism. Could that be because, thinking about it naively, you're delivering material to the tip to synthesize, you know, to maintain the tip. Now, if you block the tip, then you keep delivering at the same rate, then you're going to get accumulation of material. And so could that simply be that, and that's going to thicken the wall. So could it simply be that, that you essentially the feedback is one of a constant delivery rate? Constant delivery rate, and is anything known about the delivery rate and whether that's controlled or whether it just maintains the same rate? Okay, so I'm not the right one to say if I to know anything about the delivery rate of material, so it's very new for me, but I would say in that case, I'm not sure. Okay, so imagine you have this doma at the teeth, very softer than the lateral part under pressure. Lateral part under pressure, if at some point, just at the very tip, I put some obstacle. So I have the feeling that it will just expand geometrically, laterally, in fact, in some sense. So you don't really change the way you are giving material, but you could... And as you said, this looks like some status is something feeding back to maintain the diameter, but this is too much for today to comment on this. I'm going on a very long time. We're going very much losing. Thank you. All right, so let's uh thank us Afghan. And our next speaker is Richard Smith, who's a group leader at the John Ennis Center. Richard, the screen is yours.
