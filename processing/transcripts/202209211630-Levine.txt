Last time I kind of outlined this basic idea of having a package for a numerative geometry, which consisted in the classical case of the Chow groups, Chern classes, and degree maps. So I want to look at the today, I want to look at the quadratic package. Which will consist of Chow Wit groups. Or, if you like, there's a simpler version of this: the cohomology of the sheaf of rings. That's the quadratic version of the Chow groups. And here we have, instead of turn classes, we just have one class. We just have one class. We have an Euler class. So the Chow-Witt-Euler class or the Witt-Euler class of vector bundles. And then we have a quadratic degree map, which will map to either the Grotendie-Witt ring over your field in the first case or to the quotient, the Witt ring. So let me begin by just recalling a little bit about the Grotendiek-Witt ring. Little bit about the Grotendie-Witt ring because that's the main target of all these things. And of course, this is when you hear the degree map maps to the integers. That's where our invariants are coming. And there's a rank map going this way. So that's the connection between the two theories, the three theories. You have a rank map going from this theory here. You have this is some kind of quotient map to here. And the image here captures all the new information here. Captures all the new information here. But the Grotendie-Fit ring is the thing which unites the two theories. Okay, good. So that's a little overview. Let me remind you, recollections on the Groton-Digwitt ring. Okay, so what's the Groton-Digwitt ring? You start out with a quadratic form. I'm going to work in character. So K is a field. Field. We'll assume that the characteristic of k is not two. And then quadratic forms are the same as symmetric bilinear forms. And so a quadratic form, if you have a symmetric bilinear form, this will be Q of X will be the associated bilinear form on XX. And you say the quadratic form is non-degenerate. form is non-degenerate, you can think of this bilinear form as given by a symmetric matrix when the determinant of the matrix is non-zero. That's non-degenerate. Quadratic form. That's the same thing as saying that the determinant this BV is not zero. And so that's the gadget we're talking about. Gadget, we're talking about, you can add quadratic forms if you have another one. Then you can form the orthogonal direct sum. And this on x, y is just the sum. And if the two quadratic forms are non-degenerate, so is the sum. You can similarly multiply them. You can similarly multiply them, say tensor product or just multiplication on the tensor product of the vector spaces, and this will be just the product. Okay, so those are the operations. It's like it's almost like you have a semi-ring, sort of. I don't know if there's no identity, but what you can do is you can. You can then take these things, you have a notion of isometry if there exists a linear isomorphism with Qv equal to QV prime composed with alpha. And so that gives the notion you then define, you take the set of these non-degenerate Q. Of these non-degenerate QVs, modulo similarity. This is a monoid, and you take the group completion. And this is the Groton-D. Fidden ring of K. All right. What's group completion? It means you just take formal differences of these things with the usual relation that when you take the orthogonal direct sum of the same thing to both sides, the formal difference stays the same. And this product here makes this. And this product here makes this thing into a ring. So, this is a commutative ring. Okay, so there are some special elements, special types of quadratic forms. If you take a unit in the field, then you have the quadratic, the rank. Oh, there's a, yeah, there's a quadratic form U, which is just this thing here is just u times x squared. And any qv. And any QV can be diagonalized. This is equivalent to a sum of these guys. It's saying every quadratic form can be diagonalized up to isometry. Okay, and the product is just u times v is uv. And then by linearity, that tells you what the product of diagonal forms are. Let's see. So there was something I wanted to say. Oh, yeah. There was something I wanted to say. Oh, yeah, you have a rank homomorphism where the rank of Qv is just the dimension of V. And then that's, of course, a non-negative integer. And on the group completion, it goes to the integers. This is a ring homomorphism. All right. And then we have a special form, the hyperbolic form. We'll use the model x squared minus y squared in our note in the notation. It's this form. And then it has the following property. If you take any q times h, this is the, or is isometric to the rank of q times h. In other words, just this number of multiples of h. And the Grotend. And the Grotendie, the Witt ring is the quotient of the Grotendie-Witt ring modulo, the ideal generated by H, which by this relation is just the group generated by H. The one on the left. And this thing is, yeah, thank you. This is Vit. This is the Vitring. The Vitring actually historically, I believe, came up first before Grotendieep. First, before Groton Deep. It's quite strange to find this for between. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. Well, life is strange. What are we going to do? Okay. I think that's. Oh, yeah. One last thing. There's a certain functorial. Obviously, this is covariantly functorial in the field, right? If you just take k inside of f, you get a quadratic form over f just by extending scalars on the vector. Just by extending scalars on the vector space, remains non-degenerate. Let's see, some final remarks. If the unit group here is equal to that everything is a square, for example, if K is algebraically closed, that says the rank map is an isomorphism, right? Because u squared here is isometric. You can absorb the u squared and it just. You can absorb the u squared and it just becomes one. All right. And you also, in general, if you have k inside of f finite, let's say separable, then of course you have a k linear trace map on the fields, but this also defines a additive homomorphism from From here to here, where what you do if you have a quadratic form on some f vector space here, let me just outline that here, into f, well, it's also comes from a bilinear, f bilinear form, and an f bilinear form is also a k bilinear form, and then you just compose it with a trace map. And this thing here will be the trace from F down to K of Q. Okay, so that's the trace map. Good. I think that's all I wanted to say for recollections. Are there any questions? Oh yeah, I wanted to make a non-mathematical remark. So I've posted notes for this last lecture and this lecture on the appropriate page. I didn't post them. A fellow friend here. A fellow friend here hosted them for us. And there's some exercises there, so you might amuse yourself with that. Okay. So that's that. So now I want to go back to that. I want to eventually define these Chow wit groups. And one sort of simple, direct way to define them is by certain sheaf cohomology. Sheaf cohomology. And I want to maintain this analog with the Chow group. So I have to remind you: how are Chow groups also defined by sheaf cohomology? So that brings us to the Milner K groups and Milner K sheaves and the Chow groups. All right, so remember. All right, so remember: if you have a local ring, just do the local ring case. If you like, you can just take the case of a field, then the Milner K-theory of this local ring, let's assume, you have to assume that the residue field is sufficiently large. Infinite is enough, and I think if it has more than two elements, or something, it needs a few more than two elements. Needs a few more than two elements, but let's say infinite just to be on the safe side. You take the unit group, that's an abelian group, so you can form its tensor algebra over Z. That's a graded algebra, and then you mod out by the two-sided ideal generated by things of the form A, tensor 1 minus A. But here you need both of them to be units, which is not always the case. Okay, and that's. Okay, and that's this thing here. And the point is, this extends to a sheaf on, well, it's actually on arbitrary schemes, but let's say on smooth case schemes, that's the only case I'm going to fix the base field K, and we get a sheaf on smooth case schemes of graded algebras. And we have this formula block. It's really due to Cato. Block did the same thing. Locke did the same thing for the sheaves of k-groups of algebraic k-theory that says that the nth child group on x, here x is smooth k variety, is naturally isomorphic to the nth, say, Zariski or even Niznavich cohomology of this sheaf. I'm going to write it slightly curly to make it a sheaf of the nth K group. And let me just Remind you quickly of why that would be the case. It comes from a flask resolution of this sheaf since we have the so-gerston resolution of this. Of this Milner sheaf restricted to X. You could put a little slash X here, but I'm going to not overburden the notation that way. Right. So you start out with your sheaf. And then just by restricting to the generic point, this might have more than one generic point. So let's look at all the codimension zero points. You have the Zero points, you have the Milner K group and of the field. So this is the total. Each one of these would be the function field of the component of X. And then there's a boundary map to the next term, which is, if you look at things in codimension one, it's a sort of symbol map that lowers the degree by one. Oh, sorry, I should put a little ix lower star because this is really a. X lower star, because this is really a sheaf. It's a skyscraper sheaf supported on that, well, not the IX lower star of this sheaf, of this group, and you continue on until you run out of room. The Milner K groups stop in degree zero, so this would stop in codimension n. In codimension n. Of course, if this is empty, it stops before that, but let's say it might not. And then you have Miller A0, Ax. And before that, you had the same thing. Okay, so now fortunately, the relations in the Milner K-theory are all in homogeneous degree two or higher. So we know exactly what these things are. Well, this is the zeroth tensor power, which is just Z. And this is the first tensor power of the units, which is just the units. And this map is, I mean, this thing here is, of course, then, well, we now take global sections. We now take global sections. That says we have HN on X Milner Kn is the co-kernel of this divisor map, which just goes from the direct sum. Now, the global sections is just the direct sum of all, let's say, W. let's say w inside of x of codimension n minus one of k of w cross going to the direct sum over all z inside of x codimension n of z and this of course is just the co-dimension n cycles on x and this is the relation so the co-kernel is just the codimension Is just the core dimension and child groups. Okay, of course, the hard part is proving that this thing really is a resolution. And I think that was originally done for Cato in the case of n equals the dimension of x. And then, do you know who did this in general? Maybe he also did this in general. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And cats, okay. Cats, ah, okay. Oh, cats, cats, yeah. Thanks, yeah, thank you. Thought you said cats. Cats, more good. So that's a recollection. Okay, so we want to make this quadratic. So, this was originally a construction by Barge and Morel, but they didn't phrase it exactly in this way. And Jean-Fazel also worked on this, but eventually it got phrased in this somewhat neat form by Hopkins and Morel. They introduced the so-called Milner Witt sheaves. So, this is a modification. This is a modification. Hopkins Morel. The Sheaves, the fact that they're Sheaves is due to Morel. But the, well, I mean, for the field, it was due to Hopkins and Morel. Okay, so we take F to be a field. So I think this also works for a local ring, just as this does for the Milner groups, but I'm not sure. So let's leave it. Milner groups, but I'm not sure, so let's leave it. Okay, and then we define a graded algebra, so Z algebra K milner wit star of F by generators and relations. So we have generators, say u in degree one, for all u a unit in the field. So it's much like the u. Much like the you want to define the tensor algebra by generators and relations, it's generated in degree one. So these are the same kind of generators you have, but there's another special generator, eta, of degree minus one. Just a single degree equals minus one, just a single extra element. But this spreads everything out, so now, and we have relations. So R1 tells us how eta and these things commute, and they commute. How eta and these things commute, and they commute. Okay, and then we have R2. This is the analog of the Steinberg relation. If you take the product of these things in this algebra, this thing is zero. So that's exactly the Steinberg relation. Now, in the tensor algebra, this symbol would be linear with respect to products. And this is where it's different. Well, this is one thing, you also have this ADA here. Well, this is one thing, you also have this ADA here, but it's not linear with respect to products. You have a modified linearity, so this would be the relation defining the tensor algebra, but then you have a higher order term. Well, not really higher order because this has degree minus one, and this thing has degree two, so it's all homogeneous of degree one, but that's how it looks. Slightly more complicated. And then you have this fourth one, which even looks more ridiculous. You let You let H, and this stands for the hyperbolic form on some isomorphisms which will come later. You take this to be 2 plus eta times minus 1. Okay, that's something of degree 0. And then the relation is that eta times H equals 0. I mean, I could have just written this out directly, but it's nice to have this H here for later on. Okay, so that's. On. Okay, so that defines this thing as an algebra. And well, there's quite a lot of work that goes into showing that this thing extends to be a sheaf on smooth case schemes. But it does is a theorem of Morel. This assignment extends to a chief. A sheaf of rated Z algebras, this Z algebra, I don't know, why not rings? I don't know why. Say this on smooth varieties over K. And I'll just write it this way with this script guy. And there's a resolution, there's a so-called Rost Schmid. Resolution, which, oh, no, I can't say that yet. Sorry. Sorry, we'll get there. I'm getting ahead of myself. Okay, so that's this is the first point. Now, what does this have to do with anything? Well, if you send u in gw of a field, send it to, see this thing, now it's going to look familiar, one plus eta u. eta u in Milner-Witt naught of the field this extends to an isomorphism of sheaves of rings so the degree zero part in this thing is of course also a sheaf of rings so we have the grotendie-witt sheaf this is just the sheafification of the grotendie-witt groups so Wit groups. So sheaves of rings on smooth varieties over K, isomorphic to Milner, the sheaf, the sheaf, Milner width zero. Okay, and now if you do the same thing, if you send U in G W of F to eta to the N times one plus eta U. This lives in Milner Witt. This lives in Milner-Witt minus n of f. And now I'm going to take n to be positive. This extends to a isomorphism of the sheaf of vid rings isomorphically to Milner VIT minus n on smooth varieties over k for all n positive. In other words, in all negative degrees, this thing is the witch sheet. Degrees, this thing is the wit sheaf, and multiplication by eta is an isomorphism. Okay, and one more fact. Oh, dear. One more fact is that what does this have to do with the Milner sheaf? Well, you can see from the presentation, at least for a field, what happens if you set eta equal to zero? Well, then the resulting ring is concentrated. Resulting ring is concentrated in non-negative degrees. And this relation just becomes the bilinear bilinearity relation. And so you're just getting the tensor, and this relation is gone, right? Eta is already zero. So this relation dies. This becomes bilinearity. This relation is no longer there. And this relation becomes the Steinberg relation. So, in other words, that passes to the sheaves. The Milner-Witt sheaf modulo, the two-sided ideal generated by eta, is just the Milner-K sheaf. And so you have this surjection. Let's say for every n, you have this surjection. Let's say for n bigger than or equal to zero, and what's the current? And what's the kernel? The kernel is the sheaf i to the n plus one. Or what's i? i is the augmentation ideal. This thing, remember, is Milner-Witt zero. And there's this rank map with a constant sheaf z. And this is the augmentation ideal. Okay, quadratic forms of rank zero, virtual rank zero. So that explains. Virtual rank zero. So that explains how this guy is some kind of quadratic enhancement of the Milner sheaves. And then there's one more thing we have to do. We can twist this thing. We have a twisted version. So this is leading into notions of orientation. And that's because this whole theory kind of reflects what happens in real differential geometry. Real differential geometry or differential topology where maps have to be oriented in order to do certain things, and that's going to be reflected in this twisted version. If we take L to be an invertible sheaf on some x, then we can take the Grotendig-Witt sheaf on X and twist it by L. This is the sheaf of L valued. Valued non-degenerate quadratic forms. I mean, locally, L is the same as O. So it's just, you know, but you have a twist that occurs, and it gives you a slightly different gadget and just having quadratic forms with values in this invertible sheath instead of values in the structure sheet. Now, this is clearly a module for. A module for the untwisted ones by the multiplication rule that I described. You're just taking tensor product. So this is a, so locally invertible, if you like, or an invertible, it's an locally free of rank one GW module, sheaf of modules. And we, and now GW. And now, Gw is, of course, the same thing as the degree zero part in the Milner sheaf, and the whole Milner-Witt sheaf rather is a module or an algebra over the Milner sheaf. So we can define the twisted Milner-Witt gadget here as equal to the untwisted one tensored over GW, which is the same as milnuz at Same as Milnervit zero with GW of L. That's the twisted gadget. So, okay, so with these preparations, we can mount. Now, I should say we had this map here. And what does twisting do? It means if you take a local parameter for L, making it the trivial sheaf, this becomes the same thing. And if you go to a different coordinate, you're multiplying by a unit. So I should say that what's the A unit. So I should say that what's the relation here? The relation is take lambda, local generator, or L, then a typical element here will look like some alpha tensor lambda in Milner-Witt N tensor L. And if you take U a unit, then alpha tensor lambda tensor U lambda, that's another local generator for L, will be equal. Generator for L will be equal to the quadratic form u times alpha, hence our lambda, where this quadratic form is just another symbol for this one plus eta u. So that's the relation. Okay, that's the way of describing this in local coordinates, if you like. All right, any questions so far? So we make now we can define our chow bit groups. We define chow n tilde of x. tau n tilde of X with coefficients in L to be the nth homology on X with coefficients in Milner-Witt N of L. Oh yeah, and the thing I wanted to say was if you take the map to the Milner K-theory, the eta goes to zero. So this twisting doesn't do anything, right? So it means that you could also put an L here. An L here, and you could sort of tensor this thing by L. So that's the, in other words, you have this map extends to the twisted one. Okay, and so this will map to Hn on X Milner N without the twist, and this is your child group. Okay, so that's your comparison map. It actually gives you, in case L is trivial, this child tilde X. This child tilde x star that would be the direct sum over n of the child tilde n of x is a graded ring. And the map here to child star x is a ring homomorphism. Okay. And on the other hand, we also have a comparison map with the cohomology of the bit sheaf. With the cohomology of the bit shape at least as groups. So, of course, we have this map, Milner-Witt N twisted by L. We have the width sheaf twisted by L, which is we take the twisted Grotendie-Wittsheaf modulo of the hyperbolic form. And what's this map? This is just. And what's this map? This is just multiplication by eta to some large power. Right? And this gives you a ring homomorphism because the power doesn't really matter. And this induces another ring homomorphism. Well, it induces a map from the child tilde n of xl to h n on xwl. So this is sort of the purely quadratic version of this. Quadratic version of this mixed theory. This Chow Witt thing maps to both directions. And this guy is sort of purely quadratic, essentially because if you replace this with the width sheaf, you're modding out by the hyperbolic form that has rank two, so you end up in Z mod two, but the kernel is the same. That's a theorem. So the quadratic, the interesting quadratic information is not lost by passing to the Vitch. By passing to the VIT sheet. Okay, that's the twisted version. And so, why do we want the twisted version at all? Maybe it should make a list of various... Let me bring this here. So here's a list of some properties of these gadgets. So we take L to be again an invertible sheaf. Be again an invertible sheaf on X. Okay, now let's see. I've described this part here. So what about, of course, these constructions are functorial. Induces f upper star in the obvious way, chow tilde n f x l going chow tilde n y f star l. F star L, et cetera. And without the L, it's a ring homomorphism. Now, here's why do we have the twist at all? If F is proper, relative dimension D, then we have an F lower star. But we have to twist by the orientation sheaf, just as you do in real topology. You twist by the top wedge of the tangent sheaf or the cotangent sheaf. We'll do the cotangent sheaf. Tangent sheaf. We'll do the cotangent sheaf because that's more common. It doesn't really matter. I should also say if you tensor with a square of a line bundle, it doesn't change anything because multiplying by a square doesn't change the quadratic form. So let me not write that, just mention it. Right, so it goes from chow tilde n of y with coefficients. In if you had a line bundle down on x, you'd have to pull it back here, but you have to twist. Back here, but you have to twist by omega y. The canonical sheaf on y goes to chow tilde n minus d on x twisted by L tensor omega x. And of course, if you take L to be omega x inverse times some m, this becomes f star of m tensor omega of f, the relative dualizing sheaf. So that's another way to write it. So that's another way to write it. But it's more symmetric, maybe, to write it that way. So that's why you really need these twists. And you have similar things for H star with coefficients in twisted L's. It's the same formalism, so let me not write that in the interest of time. No, any questions? All right. All right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's a Geeseen map. Right. Yeah, it's a quadratic Eason map. It's a push. Yeah, push. I could call it push. Let's see. How you do it? The way, well, the way you construct it is the way. Let's see. You have to, I mean, the way I. You have to, I mean, the way I know about it is you have to use some kind of duality, but it's duality on the sort of space level. It's not duality of the groups. You have to show what the dual of the object is. It's a twist by the tangent bundle. And that's where the omega comes in. Yeah, you can do it by hand. Yeah. So if you do it with the Ross-Schmidt complex, you have to. Do it with the Ross-Schmidt complex, you have, yeah, um, yeah, that's a good point. So I'll get to that. Yeah, thanks, yeah, right. Thanks, Bruno. That's a good point. I'll get to that in just a minute. Okay, but formally, we also have, once we have these push forwards, we have Euler classes. So if you have V over X. Have V over X, a rank R vector bundle. And let's say here you have the zero section, and here you have any section. Then you have the Euler class, let's say the Chow-Witt Euler class on V. It's equal to S0 lower star of one on X. One is the, if you like, the constant quadratic form, X goes to X squared on X. On x, and then you could take s upper star for any s. And where does this live? Well, when you have this twisting by the s zero lower star, you see where it lives is in h r on x. Well, it's in the child tilde r on x, and the twist will be by the inverse of the determinant of v, because that's the relative dualizing sheaf. The relative dualizing sheaf for the inclusion. Right, the V is the tangent, relative, tangent bundle as the normal bundle. So the relative dualizing sheaf would be the inverse. Okay? And you have a similar thing living in HRXW twist by the universe. Okay, good. Okay, good. That's the Euler class. And there's also ones with support. If Z contains the zero locus of S, these lift to classes with support. Let me just do this one. It'll be supported on Z, but now it depends on S. And this, we need the cohomology now. This lives in HR with supports on Z, on X, with coefficients in the same group that define the Chalvit groups. To find the child with groups, but since I didn't have a notation for the child with groups with support, that's this thing, etc. for the VIT sheaves. All right, now yes, that's right. Sorry. That's obvious. I mean, you have to see how you define this thing. You'll see once I define it in a minute, you'll see it's obvious. In a minute, you'll see it's obvious, okay? Okay, so this sends uh this one to this one. Thanks, thanks for raising. So, I mean, so these uh pullback and you know, you can throw it down, are going to be functional with any compilable fees. That's right, they're all compiled as the ideal key. Yes, that's right. Wait, is it sorry, is it k there or h that we quotient gets the by h. You can quotient by h, and they're all going to be compatible with that, because that's just a ring homomorphism on the coefficients. Ring homomorphism on the coefficients or module homomorphism on the coefficients. Yeah. I should have said that. So thanks for the question. All right. So this brings up the analog of this Gersten resolution. These elements in the Chauvit groups are really cycles where instead of the coefficients being integers, the coefficients are quadratic forms. And so to make sense of that, you have to And so, to make sense of that, you have this Rust Schmidt resolution of the Milner-Mitsch n, let's say twisted by L on X. And it looks very much like the Gerston resolution, except you have twists that go along depending on the co-dimension. So you start out the same way. out the same way the next term will be the sum x and x zero and then you have the milner-witt group of kx listed by i'll just write by l it really you really take l tensor kx just for stick to the generic fiber continue along and uh in the say qth term A Qth term or Pth term, codimension P, how does it look? You have this Milner-Witt in degree n minus P, just as before. And these, of course, should be I X lower star AX. And now what's the twist? The twist, you twist by the, so this X has a local ring associated to it in the ambient variety. The ambient variety, and it has a maximal ideal. You take the inverse of the determinant of the maximal ideal modulo its square, which is just the determinant of the normal bundle at the generic point of the closure of X. Right, so this is just the determinant of the normal bundle. Yeah, and this is already a KX module, so we just have to twist like that. So you just have to twist like that. And then it continues merrily on until you run out of points because the algebra has things in negative degree. So if you look at degree n, what have you got? You've got the direct, the direct sum over all z inside of x of codimension n, and you have in the now it's in degree zero, so that's the Groton. Now it's in degree zero, so that's the Grotend-Dieke-Witt group on the residue on the function field of KZ with some twist, and it'll be twisted by you know the normal bundle of Z in X. Well, of course, that doesn't make sense, but let's say we're working over a perfect field. So at the generic point of Z, it's smooth. And so we're only interested in this tensored with KZ. So at the generic point, this really is a bundle. And I forgot to determine it here. Determinant here. Okay, that's those are sort of the cycles. So a typical element in here will look like some, say, Qi, Zi. And now there's a further boundary map that has to be zero, which lands in a similar thing, except now we're in degree minus one. So this will be the wit group of a similar type of thing on all w. W all z prime contained in my z i's of codimension one or contained in z. This is codimension one inside of x, this is codimension n. I wrote it this way because only the z's that live inside the zi's show up in here. And then you have a similar notion of rational equivalence. And now you have, so all w contained in x. So, all w contained in x, codimension n minus one. And now you're in something which is a little, which is quite new. It'll be the kw, again with a twist by a determinant of something tensor L, determinant of the normal bundle. And this is like a divisor map. So the typical elements here look like this guy here, and this will look a lot like a divisor, but you also have things like eta uv. Like eta, uv, et cetera. There are more elements here to worry about, but that's the basic idea. Okay, and then you have a very similar story of how to define the push forward. It's very much like cycles. You have a sub-variety upstairs with some quadratic form at the generic point. The push-forward is proper, so the image will be of the sub-variety will be closed. If the image has the same dimension, it will be generically finite. And then you take the trace map. And then you take the trace map on the Grotendie-Wittring upstairs down to the Grotendie-Wittring downstairs. And the fact that the normal bundles have to work out right is exactly why you need these twists. That makes the, that make the, right, if you take the normal bundle upstairs twisted by the canonical sheaf upstairs, it's going to be the same essentially as the normal bundle downstairs twisted by the canonical sheaf downstairs because the map is generically atol. The map is generically a tall. Okay, so that's why that works. Okay, I hope that's okay. Any questions? So the theory, and then you have a very similar thing for the cohomology of the vit sheaves. You just replace all these guys with the vit sheaves. It all becomes the same sheaf. Because you're just inverting ADA. Right, because you're just inverting eta, you can just keep multiplying by the eta, it doesn't matter. But in principle, it's the same thing, all right? So that's the uh setup. We've got Euler classes, uh, yeah, and now, of course, once we have push forwards, we have a degree map, quadratic degree map. And this brings us to orientations because the see the Euler Because the see the Euler class of a vector bundle, let's say we have a vector bundle of rank n on a smooth projective variety of dimension n. Then we get an Euler class, which looks like a quadratic version of a zero cycle, and we'd like to take its quadratic degree. But we have to make sure we can take the push forward and land in something on the point. So we have this notion of orientations. So let's say we have our vector bundle V on X of rank V equals n equals dimension of X. So an orientation, maybe we don't need this rank condition. Let me just say that the orientation for V is an isomorphism of the determinant inverse of V isomorphism. Isomorphic, well, determinant of V, determinant inverse of V. Is that what I wanted? Yeah, I guess that's what I want: isomorphic to omega x tensor sum L squared. Okay, so suppose we have such a gadget, then if we take the Euler class, let's say in the Chao-Witt group from V, this lives in H, well, it lives in Chow tilde. In chow tilde n of x twisted by the determinant inverse of v. And then we can just acting by isomorphisms on the line bundle gives us an isomorphism, say rho lower star with chow tilde n on x omega x tensor L tensor 2. And this is canonically isomorphic to chow tilde n x. tilde n x omega x and then we have a push forward map let's say push forward map p to spec k suppose this is proper then we have a push forward map to child tilde zero on k or spec k with its omega x which is just trivial and this thing is just g w k and so this composition we call the quadratic degree Quadratic degree, of course, the notation should have the row in it because if I change the row by a unit, it multiplies the whole story. Let's say a unit coming from K, it multiplies the whole thing by that quadratic rank one quadratic form. So it really does depend on the choice of orientation. It's like if you're dealing with real manifolds and there's two choices of orientation, because there's two non-trivial rank one forms over the reals, there's one and minus one. And minus one, and that's why you choose orientations, right? And you choose a different orientation, you get the negative of the number you got before. All right, so that's Euler classes, orientations, quadratic degree. That's our quadratic enumerative geometry package. So let's see if I can do. I did some examples last time, the bazoo theorem and the And the counting of lines. So let's see if we can look at those examples. Any questions? All right. So let's see. So quadratic bazoo theorem. So this is kind of amusing because the answer, it's like Charlie Chan. The answer is very easy, but the question is very hard. Is very easy, but the question is very hard. So, answer very hard, question very easy, whatever. So, we take C1, C2 plane curves, and now we work over a non-algebraically closed field K, like the reals, no common components. Okay, and then it's a F1 and F2 defining equations. F1 and F2 defining equations of degree D1 and D2. And that, and we have to, the orientation condition turns to get anything reasonable, we have to assume that D1 plus D2 is odd. That's because the canonical sheaf on P2 is O of minus 3, and minus 3 is an odd number. Okay, so now let's let V be the obvious thing. We did this. Obvious thing, we did this before to get the intersection multiplicities at the intersections. We take this guy and then we have this section here, S on P2, which is just the section for F1 of OD1, section for F2 on OD2. And the zero locus of this thing is exactly the set of intersection points. So then we have, let's have Z be the zero locus of S. Be the zero locus of S. That'll be the set of the intersection points. So reduced. And we have the, I didn't tell you exactly how you got this, but you have to believe me. We have this Euler class with supports on Z for V with respect to this section S. And this lives in the cohomology with supports on Z on P. On z on p2 with coefficients in Milner wit2 twisted by the minus the determinant of v, which is minus d1 minus d2. Okay, and since this is a finite set of points, this is of course the direct sum i equals one to r of the same thing with supports and pi. So I'm just gonna equals here. Equals here. Okay. And so this thing here goes. I can write where this goes to in this sum is a sum of quadratic multiplicities. Let me just avoid the notation mpi times pi. Let's write it that way. Because, oh, I should have said there's a purity theorem. And you'll see you look at the Rose-Schmidt complex for this thing. Look at the Rosh-Schmidt complex for this thing. The Rosh-Schmidt complex, if you just take the part supported on Z, that computes this. And so, if you look at the twists in the Ross-Schmidt complex for this guy at the point PI, what's the twist? It's going to be this line twisted by, there's an O here. Twisted by this line bundle, tensor, the normal bundle. And the normal bundle. Is well omega p2 restricted to pi or the inverse. I don't care about the inverse, right? So this thing here is the same thing as g w of k p i twisted by O of D, well, this is direct sum over I, E1 minus D2, tensor omega P2 inverse. Inverse. Okay. But I want to get something in the growth and degrad group so I can take its trace. So I have the orientation condition. I have to choose an isomorphism of omega p2 inverse with OP2 of 3. And the way you usually do that is you choose a generator for omega p2 of 3 to be. omega p2 of 3 to be this usual sum minus 1 to the i x i dx omit i. So there's the canonical generator for this guy. And so that gives you this isomorphism, and that gives you this isomorphism of this O minus D1 minus D2, hence our omega inverse, isomorphic to O minus D1 minus D2 plus 3. And this is an even number. It's 2m. even number it's 2m so this is all of m answer 2 and that's your orientation and so that gives you um you can view this e p um this m tilde pi which is this local term here for v with respect to the section s as in g w of k p i so there's a trace map here So there's a trace map here down to GW of K. And the Bazoo theorem says, quadratic bazoo says that the sum of these traces of these multiplicities is D one D two over two. D1 D2 over 2 times the hyperbolic form. Okay, so why is this? It's because give a quick proof. Well, not a proof. I'll tell you the main ingredients that go into the proof. It's quite simple, in fact. So, proof well, the first part is that if V has odd rank or W has odd rank, then the W Euler characteristic, Euler class. Characteristic Euler class too many W's V has on rank and this thing is zero okay so now if we want to see this thing we know what the rank of this thing is we know that the sum of the ranks of this trace is just the bazoo theorem it's d1 d2 which is the rank of this thing so we just we can look at the image in the vit ring and we want to know this theorem is equivalent then to saying the image in the vit ring is zero so The image in the wittring is zero. So we can just look at the wit ring story, and well, and we also know: well, we don't have a Whitney formula because we don't have lower turn classes, but we'd have it shadow for the top turn class. E of v plus v prime is equal to e of v times e of v prime. And that says my e of all of d1 plus all of d e w. Plus O of D E W here, O of D 2 is 0. Okay? And that's why we get this. Now, this is not, let me, in the last remaining minutes, unfortunately, I won't get to the story about the lines, which is also kind of fun. This is sort of not so useful because it's just Bazoo theorem together with a big fat zero. So, what good is that? Well, it's kind of interesting if you know what these guys are because it's telling. Know what these guys are because it's telling you a relation on these local quadratic indices. So here's how you compute the local quadratic indices. This would be Bazoo 2 to compute these guys here. Well, remember, somehow in here, we've transferred from this canonical thing to just this. canonical thing to just this by using the orientation. So that's going to have to go into the formula. So what we do is we take at each PI local coordinates t1, t2, and a linear form L such that L of Pi is not zero. So we can use that to dehomogenize my F. In other words, My f. In other words, I can use that to define the local coordinate for my O of D1 or O of D2, such that under this isomorphism here of this, this sheaf here is isomorphic to O of M tensor 2. Let me call that rho, such that rho of L to the D1. L to the d1 plus d2 tensor tt1 dt2 inverse is equal to lambda squared of some lambda local section of O of M. That's the orientation condition. And so I'm out of time, but let me just tell you there's a very, now there's an algebraic formula for what this guy is. You take, you know, everything, the original multiplicity was you take this local ring modulo F1 and F2, where Fi is Fi divided by L to the DI, right? Now on this thing, we have a particular element, E, in the sockle of this ring. This ring is an Artin algebra over. Artin algebra over k, and since it's an Artin algebra, it actually contains Kp, the residue field. And the sockle of this thing is one-dimensional because this is a complete intersection. And what's this E? We define it as follows. You take Fi and you write it as A1I T1 plus A A sum Aij Tj. J equals one to two. J equals one to two. And then you take the image of the determinant of this two by two matrix in this ring. This generates the succle. And now you take L to be any Kp linear form that sends L of E equals one. This is to Kp. Then this guy here is represented. By the quadratic form qi, qpi, qpi of x is equal to L of x squared qpi from O modulo F12 to Kp. So that's the answer. If these guys are intersecting transversally, this is essentially the Jacobian determinant. Essentially, the Jacobian determinant. And you recover the usual intersection orientation over the reals by saying whether this determinant is positive or negative. Okay, so didn't quite get to everything I wanted to say, but that's the way it goes. Thanks very much for your attention. I was just wondering, is there also some kind of long guessing type of sequence in these uh well these would be the starting term depends what you want to converge to so uh yeah I mean there's a vit there's a global for example there's a global vit theory right and uh now vit theory has the property that um over a field or over a local ring it's zero in degree It's zero in degree n not congruent to zero mod four, and it's the wid ring in, or the wit groups if n is congruent to zero mod four. So you have a local to global spectral sequence for the wit theory and also twisted by L, you have a twisted version where the starting point is the cohomology of the wit sheaf, but repeated every zero mod four. And I don't know. And I don't know. I mean, you have the other theory, which is kind of like the Chow-Witt theory, is Hermitian K-theory. But there, it's not true that the homotopy sheaves of Hermitian K-theory are exactly these Milner-Witt sheaves. They're sort of going in a different direction. These Milner-Witt sheaves, actually, they're very, there's a theorem of Morel which explains what these Milner-Witt sheaves are. In fact, the nth Milner-Heaves In fact, the nth Milner-Witt sheaf is the minus nn homotopy sheaf of the sphere spectrum. So Morel's theorem was that the endomorphisms of the sphere spectrum are the Grotendie-Witt, is the Grotendig-Witt ring of the field. That extends to a sheaf statement, and it says pi naught of the sphere spectrum as a Nisnevitz sheaf is this Grotendie-Witt sheaf. And in fact, that extends for every n, pi minus n minus n. Pi minus n minus n of the sphere spectrum is Milner-Witt N. So it's a fundamental object because of that. And so so-called homotopy module. And it's something living in the heart of the motivic stable homotopy category. So, but it's, I don't know the standard spectrum whose homotopy sheaves are the Milner-Witch sheaves. I'm not aware of that. Yeah, then you don't have the orientation condition and it says you get an answer. You can define this thing, right? You could say, okay, I just have my section. I choose some neighborhood on which I can make this isomorphism. And then write this trivialization. I want to get something. This trivialization. I want to get something, you know, if I choose some affine neighborhood of my points, I can certainly do this, right? I just trivialize the O sheaf. Everything's trivial. Everything's a square. And if I remove a line, right? But so then I get local intersection multiplicities and I could take their trace, but I don't know what it is because there's no global thing that it's this is right. You need a global gadget, which gives you the local thing. So there's no answer. Local thing, so there's no answer, and presumably, what it means is as you do the points, you take your curve and you move the curves around, and it crosses this line, you'll get a different answer as the points cross the line. It's a wall crossing. We can write down examples that actually changes in a specific way. I mean, for really basic examples, you can interpret it. Yeah, the intersection of two lines. Yeah, it's like a crossing where you go from plus to minus one, maybe those are the real numbers, and you can interpret it. Yeah, you take two. Numbers and you can interpret, yeah. You take two lines, you do this. You take two lines and you go like this. Yeah, was the equality to the d12 over 2.5 is common no matter what section you chose and all the trivializations. And then this absolutely fails. You can get different numbers that way with three. Yeah, yeah, but that's that's the example over the reels. Take two lines, intersect them. And yeah. I think then working on the point is my question. What do you mean? Your referee would ask you to take that out of the introduction, Bruno. But no, I don't think there is. I mean, if you look at it as a coal-model. If you look at it as a cohomology intersection problem for RP2, the point is: in order to get an integer out of the intersection, right? So you're going in the vitring of the reals, which is the integers. That's where your target is by taking the signature. And if you want to get an integer out of intersection theory on RP2, it means you have to take H2 with the twist by the orientation sheaf. Okay, now the two lines are going to be comalgen class. lines are going to be cohomology classes in H1 so but only one of them if you take the product if they're both they're both twisted by the orient either they're both I don't remember I guess they're both twisted by the orientation sheath so when you take the product you land in H2 without the twist so you get an answer maybe you get a Z mod 2 answer yeah you get a Z mod right so okay that's an answer but that the point is that the quadratic theory and the non-quadratic theory intersect The non-quadratic theory intersect over Z mod 2. So you, if presumably, if you want, but you can do that using the Chow groups, mod 2. That's what you would. Yeah, it would be one mod 2. So, yeah, and presumably there's over an arbitrary field, I don't know where it's landing. It's maybe in it's It's maybe in it's probably in H0 of mu2 or something. No, in the answer, you don't get no, but you get more quadratic information about here on this side. This is the interesting part that you have this, I mean, it's let me just draw the simplest picture is when you're taking a line intersecticonic, and over the reels, you have to orient this thing. And over the reals, you have to orient this thing, right? And here you have a plus one, and here you have a minus one, depending on what your orientation on RP2 looks like, okay? But and then if you move the line over here, then you get obviously zero. And what it's saying, this quadratic term here, let's say there's intersections here, you're getting a Jacobian, the quadratic form of a Jacobian matrix here and one of a Jacobian matrix here. And in this case, if the two points are defined. There's if the two points are defined over your field, it means the sum those two those two quadratic forms add up to the trivial up to a hyperbolic form. So one is going to be u and one is going to be minus u. And if they're away from here, then you're taking the trace of something that's going to be hyperbolic. You have something whose trace is hyperbolic. So it'll be on some quadratic extension, but you're going to be taking the quadratic. But you're gonna be taking the quadratic form associated to the thing you're taking the square root of. That's the thing that has trace equal to h. So it's, I mean, in this case, you can work out, you can write down explicitly what happens. You don't need the formula, but it's saying in general, you have such a thing happening. And it just generalizes the fact that if you take a curve of odd degree and a curve of even degree in Rp2, then the sum of the intersection multiplicities has to be. Intersection multiplicities has to be zero. So yeah, no, I think it's a nice story. And this is the simplest case where you get nothing as your answer, but there are lots of cases where you get something as your answer, like the lines, which I didn't get to, but maybe I'll get to it next time. Very vague question. Yeah, sure. Usually, when one studies homology and chao-rins, one striking thing is that homology behaves very well in family, while chao-rins, chow groups, not at all. And on the other side, when one studies enumerative problems, usually they behave well in time. So this allows you to compute the problem in one of the problems. Yeah, yeah, exactly. On one of the same for all the families. So, my question is: is I mean, somehow interpreting something, some invariant as a homology shield, usually, I mean, it allows you to, I mean, maybe, I'm sure not in this case explicitly, but this allows you to deform or to work with something. So, my question is: is this the case or this other that's an interesting that's a very Ah, that's an interesting. That's a very different regular child groups between families. Not the child groups, no. But what behaves, I mean, the thing in numerative geometry, the thing that behaves well in families is the degree of the answer, right? It's not like if you move curves around, the number of points where they intersect, and you have to add up the multiplicities, and that degree is what remains constant. So it's the same thing here, right? If you have the orientation. If you have the orientation conditions, then you don't have wall crossing, and the answer remains constant because it's just the Euler, it's the degree of the Euler class, which doesn't depend on what input you put into it. So in that sense, that remains constant in families on a fixed thing. Now, there's another interesting phenomena, which is conductor formulas, where there you have a family. So a conductor formula says you have a flat production. Flat projective map to like a disk or to a DVR. The general fiber is smooth and the special fiber has singularities. And you want to say what's a description, let's say the total space is regular, smooth, and you want to give a differential geometric, say in characteristic zero or some other thing with swan conductors or whatever, positive characteristic of the difference between the Euler characteristic, the general fiber, and the Euler characteristic of the special fiber. So I did a terrible job. So, I did a terrible job last time of saying that you have Euler characteristics in this quadratic sense, but you do. But here, the difference is for the general fiber, the Euler characteristics lives in the Grotendie-Witt ring of the generic point of the base. And for the special fiber, it lives in the Grotendie-Witt ring of the residue field. Let's say you're over a DVR. So, they're not even the same group, but if you choose a parameter, you have a specialization map, which is compatible with this nearby cycles. Compatible with this nearby cycle specialization for the chosen parameter. So you can still hope, you can say, what's the comparison of the specialization of the Euler characteristic of the general fiber and the Euler characteristic of the special fiber? And there's the usual formula. Let's say you have isolated fixed points. The usual formula is the sum of the Milner numbers, which are the sum of the dimensions of the Jacobian rings for the differential. And there's a, I was next time, I'll get the. I was next time. I'll get there's a nice quadratic form on a Jacobian ring. And it turns out the answer is it's not that. It's almost that. There's like a slight error term, which in the case of the reals, you don't even see. But over an arbitrary field, there's actually an error term between those two. At least we don't have a general formula, but we have some examples. And even in the examples, there's an error term which deviates from that formula. Error term, which deviates from that formula you'd expect a little bit, and this deviation disappears over the reals, but over the rationals, it doesn't disappear in general. And it's kind of a strange story, and it's a mystery to say, what do you do if you don't have, we only can make this computation for very special singularities. We don't have a general yoga for it. Anyways, that's sort of one of these things in families where actually, like, the Euler characters don't remain constant. Like the Euler characters don't remain constant in families, but you know how to modify that. That's the so-called conductor formula. Well, I'm afraid we are already with time, so we will take
