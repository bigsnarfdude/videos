And today I will talk about this topic: non-linear dynamics of helical vortex disturbed by long wave instability. And this is a collaboration with my student, former student Akihiro Hirano, and Ivan Delbende and Maurice Rossi from Sorbonne Universities. So I think Toma kindly introduced the background of these studies. So I can quickly go about the background. So as we heard, the motivation comes from a wind farm and the hergo vortices appear in helicopter rotors, wind rotors, ship propellers, turbine impact. Propellers, turbine impellers, the devices which include any rotating blades. And they affect performance of these devices and become a source of noises in some cases. And for the case of ship propeller, it causes tip vortex cavitation. And in particular, in the wind farm, he could vortices affect load and performance. This affects load and performance of the wind turbines and power produced by downstream turbines are quite affected by the hequo voltages, as we saw in the Thomas talk. And sometimes the downstream turbines can only produce 48 to 60 percent of the flow turbines. Turbines power. So, accurate prediction of weight properties is important. And there are three types of instability of Hickel vortices according to Wednesday. And one is the long wave instability, in which the core size, well, sorry, the wavelength of the instability is much larger than. The instability is much larger than the core size of the vortex, and the second is the short wave instability in which the wavelength is of the same order as the vortex core size. And this includes elliptic instability and curvature instability. And there is also a third type, mutual interaction or mutual inductance mode. And sometimes And sometimes it may be included in the long wave instability. And how do these instability do turbulence is my question? So objectives of our research is to explore roles of each instability in nonlinear evolution and dynamics of the Hickor vortices and the transition to turbulence. Turbulence and which type of instability is dominant. Of course, it can depend on the parameters specifying the problems. But yeah, it is quite important in predicting the wake properties in the wind farms, for example. And yeah, the title only includes long wave instability. Only includes long-wave instability. But today, well, the organizers kindly assigned me a 16-minute talk. So I will include our shortwave instability as a second part. And for the first part, what happens for the long wave instability is briefly summarized like this. So topology after reconnection depends. After reconnection depends on the pitch of the Herculavortex, like the figures shown in the right. So before going to my results, I introduce previous studies, and this is taken from the work. Taken from the work from the Luvex group, Thomas group. And as Thomas showed, so they did, well, experiment of the this case is a single herculo vortex case, and they studied this problem by experiment and a theory. And the theory is essential, essentially. Essential essentially, the methodology is as same as the Widow's results, I believe. And as we see in the figure, which shows the growth rate as a function of the wave number K, the peak of the growth rate occurs at K L equals to integer plus one half. So, like here. Have so, like here and here, and so on. And this is well captured in a beautiful experiment like this. And the structure is quite similar to the theoretical prediction. But we should note that here the pitch by pitch we call L Y R as pitch and this. And this small pitch 0.1 case. We have these many peaks, but for larger values of peak, pitch like 0.2 and 0.3, this peak of growth rate only occurs for small n. For example, for L by R equals 0.2, we only have, I think, yeah, one half and one. Yeah, one half and one and a half. So 0.5 and 1.5 is the only peak of the growth rate we can observe. But unfortunately, a fully known linear dynamics after this instability has not been explored to my knowledge. So the problem settings of The problem settings of our numerical study is: well, we consider incompressible viscous fluid, and the governing equations is the incompressible navist equations in cylindrical coordinate system in R theta Z. And the Heckel vortex is contained in a box like this. Okay, and we assume. And we assume a periodic boundary condition in Z. This is an idealized case. So the Higger vortex extends in both directions infinitely and periodically. And the numerical methods are the same methods we used for the study of a vortex ring. So So, in 2019 in paper, we studied linear instability and some non-linear evolution of a disturbed vortex ring. And this is done in the same similar setting. So, in cylindrical coordinate system, spatial discretization is like this. So, we perform a fully discrete Fourier discrete Fourier decomposition in theta and Z. And in the R direction, radio direction, we use a finite difference method. And the actual scheme is the sixth order accurate compact scheme. So this combination is quite a high resolution. And in the radial direction, we employ non-uniform grid, so stretching grid, the grid size. The grid size becomes large at the outer boundary. And the axis of symmetry r equals zero, no grid points is placed here. So we skip the grid point by, well, setting the grid point well, extending the radio direction to the minus r. And to solve the incompressible Navier-So equations, we always encounter Poisson equation, which can be a source of errors or prohibit some high resolution. But in this case, we can decompose the Poisson equation to single Fourier modes and And only the well Poisson equation which should be solved is the R direction. So we can apply the compact scheme of sixth order scheme, accurate compact scheme also for the Poisson equation. So it can be solved very accurately. And the numerical domain is is like this. So for the R, it is zero from 100 R. R is the radius of the surrounding cylinder of the helix. And theta is of course 0 to 2 pi. And Z is from 0 to 2 pi L. And the spatial resolution is like this. Resolution is like this. So it is a quite well large simulation. So each direction has about 1,000 points. And for the minimum grid size, so the grid size in R is small in the region where we contain this heaker vortex and it is this order. It is this order. Okay, and as I pointed out, in solving the Poisson equation, the actual equation is decomposed like this. And this is Laplace in the R direction. And for theta and Z, it is already decomposed as a Fourier mode. So we have a So we have just a ODE as a Poisson equation, decomposed Poisson equation. And to actually solve this method, well, I'm going to some detail of the numerical method. The incompressible Navier-Sox equations in the cylindrical coordinate system is written in the form like this. So HR. form like this. So H R H theta H D contains all nonlinear terms and some viscous terms which are not included in this Laplacian, like these terms, these two, well, these terms is included in this age. And this is discretized in time like this. So temporal discretization Discretization for viscous terms, we use second-order implicit method, and for the rest of the terms, we use second-order explicit method. And this becomes like this. So for the temporal discretization, well, time marching, we also solve the Poisson equation. And again, so. And again, so and well here H, the capital H is like this and phi to obtain phi which is close to well effectively the pressure is solved also or well obtained solving the Poisson equation. So all Poisson equations appearing here Poisson equations appearing here is a second-order ODE for each Fourier mode, and it is solved by a compact scheme of high precision. Okay, so and this is the outline of the actual DNS. And first step, we should obtain the base flow numerically because there are Because there are some expressions for the base flow giving a steady state, but it is normally given by a perturbation expansion and not so effective. So we should obtain the base flow numerically to achieve a quasi-steady state. And we solve the 3D Navier-Sox equations to obtain the base flow. To obtain the base flow. And after obtaining the base flow, the next step is to obtain the unstable modes. And to do this, we linearized the Navi-Soxi equations around the base flow obtained in the first step. And we solved the linearized 3D Navi-Soxy equations for a long time. And if we have an unstable mode after After a sufficiently long time, we obtain the eigen mode of the largest growth rate. And the third step is the non-linear evolution. So we put the unstable mode obtained in the second step with a small amplitude and add it to the base flow. The base flow, and we integrate the 3D Navis equations again. And important parameters for the base flow are, well, there are several base flows. And here, the most important parameters are the thickness, which is the ratio of the core radius. So the core radius of the core to the curvature radius and the curvature. Curvature radius and the curvature is like this. And another parameter important is pitch. So it is sometimes called reduced pitch and this is defined by L by R. So L is, well, actually, this determines the slope or angle with respect to the. With respect to the r theta plane, and r is the radius of the surrounding cylinder of the center line helix, and the 2πl is the period in the z direction. Okay, and to obtain the base flow, we should specify the initial conditions. Specify the initial conditions, and there are some procedures here. And we assume a Gaussian distribution along helix. So we have a center line helix like this, and we assume a Gaussian distribution near this helix. So it has a finite core, of course. And here we define a helical coordinate system. Coordinate system introduced in well in many studies like this, but I take my collaborators work, Delbend and others, and Celsik and others. So along helix, we can define this orthogonal base system. So EB directs to the center line helix, and the R is the radial direction, which is the same as the Which is the same as the cylindrical coordinate system, and Eφ is perpendicular to this EB and ER. And we specify the vorticity in this direction. And in general, we assume, well, we consider axial flow, which is the velocity field velocity in the EB direction. Okay. And in order to In order to perform simulation, well, we need a whole velocity field, and this is how to obtain the velocity field. So in the Herical coordinate system, the base flow has a helical symmetry, and it is described by essentially two-dimensional space. So R and phi is an independent variable here. Is an independent variable here. So in this case, we can express the relation, well, the string function in this coin system. And this string function and omega b and u b is real, has this relation. These three satisfy this relation. And L is. And L is a Laplacian in this coordinate system. And here, alpha, which is defined like this, appears as a factor peculiar to this Hilgar coordinate system. Anyway, this is a kind of Laplace equation. So, by solving this equation, we have this string function. And after obtaining this, we can obtain. Can obtain the versity field like this. So u equals ub eb plus gradient psi times eb gives the whole versity field. And as I pointed out, so the initial conditions is not in quasi-equilibrium. So we integrate for some long time and after a certain time evolution, we obtain a quasi-equilibrium. We obtain a quasi-equilibrium. And for the quasi-equilibrium, we can check the condition. When, well, UH is another, well, a variant of UB. So if we don't have actual flow, there is a functional relationship between omega b and psi, as in the case of the normal 2D case. And when the actual force is present, we have a function. We have a functional relation between uh and psi. So we can use a scatter plot of these two quantities to check whether the system is in equilibrium or not. So from here, I am showing the results. So first result is about the base flow. So if we start from initial conditions shown here, this is by the way, Uh, this is uh, by the way, a the cross-section taken in the Rθ plane. So, uh, it is uh, well, it has a uh, it is not perpendicular to this helix, so we have a elongated vorticity distribution like here. And uh, Hegel vortex has a rotation velocity, or in a different view, uh, translation velocity, it moves in this section, so it rotates. This section. So it rotates in this direction. And as it rotates, it achieves a quasi-equilibrium state. And this motion is quite close to the results obtained by a Hercul code developed by my collaborator, Derabent, and others. And this is a distribution of Omega B and the UH, and it has And it has well similar distribution. And we can check the quasi-equilibrium by checking for this case, it has a actual flow. So we are showing UH and psi, and it has a beautiful function relation. This is actually a scatter plot, but it collapses on one single curve. So it Curve so it reaches a quasi-equilibrium state. And we also checked the time evolution of invariants and circulation is beautifully conserved. And the PZ is impulse and it is also conserved. And LZ is a component of angular moment, angular impulse, I think. Angular impulse, I think, and it is not conserved and it actually grows in the viscous fluid. And its behavior is well linear and the coefficient depends on the viscosity and it is also checked. So the time evolution is quite accurate here. And the vignette stability results is shown here. And first, this shows the time evolution of the disturbance energy. So as time proceeds, it quickly goes to exponential growth. And here we are checking the effects of the actual flow. And this is the case of the long wave vinci. And for the long wave visibility, the actual flow. Fincibility: the actual flow does not affect the growth rate very much. And this value is compared to the theory shown in the previous works. And it is slightly larger, but it is in a reasonable agreement. Okay. And for the structure of the unstable mode, I'm showing I'm showing verticity distribution. I think actually omega b on the plane perpendicular to the center line helix. And it shows a typical structure of the bending wave. Actually, this distribution implies that the vorticity is well increased in this. Well, increase in this direction. This corresponds to the movement of the vortex. So in this direction. So in another phase of, well, another position of the helix, it becomes in opposite direction. So it responds to the bending waves. So the unstable mode for this KZL equals one-half is captured here. So, from now, I'm showing the nonlinear results, and the parameters of the base flow is like this. So, for the thickness of the Hiervortex Epsilon, it is around 0.1, and the actual flow is zero. And we consider a single Hierker vortex, and the Reynolds number based on the circulation is a Circulation is this number. And for the pitch, I'm showing the results for 0.2 and 0.3. And the wavelength of the disturbance is KZL equals one-half. And for the linearized, well, Navi-Sox equations, I set this value. But for the non-linear simulation, unfortunately, small-scale structures appear after a turbine transition. Turban transition, which can be very small. So we should reduce the Reynolds number to this value. So a quarter of this value. And from here, I'm showing this domain. So this is a perturbed state. And to accommodate this wavelength, the numerical domain should contain two terms. Two well turns, two or two spirals. So, or the numerical domain consists of two pitches, but for the visualization purpose, sometimes the structure, interesting structures is divided in well in the neighborhood of the end of the section. So, we are showing four pitches for the visualization. Okay, so this is the case of pitch. Of pitch 0.3 and wave number one half. So, what is shown is the isosurface of the magnitude of 40 or entropy. And the color is yes visualized well by this. So, angle of the vorticity vector. So, as you see, As you see, a vortex ring detaches after the reconnection. And after the reconnection, the pitch is nearly doubled as we have just two spirals. Initially, we had four spirals. Well, I like to show this again. Yes, so the initial motion is motion, yeah, close to leap forking. And this part tries to go into this, but this well reconnects and after the reconnection, vortex ring is detached from the Hickor vortex. Detached from the Hickor vortex. Okay, so the process is summarized by a typical well instance like this. So this part tries to get into this, as we saw in the Thomas talk. And this part becomes closed and becomes closed and almost becomes anti-parallel. So as this color is quite different. And here the bridge is formed and vortex ring is detached from the Hiker vortex. And after this, the pitch changes. So we have four spirals here and the end. Spirals here, and at the end we have just two spirals. And as we check in the time evolution of energy and entropy and so on, no transition turbulence, well, no transition to strong turbulence occurs here. So, the next case is the pitch 0.2, and this is a bit fast and And what happens here is like this, and recognition occurs again, but after the recognition it becomes quite turbulent. Okay, once again. So reconnection occurs here. First reconnection occurs here. Recognition goes here. Okay, so typical moments are shown here, and here the part of the vortex tries to go into this larger loop. Go into this larger loop. And actually, there are two possibilities of reconnection here. And which is actually this upper part, and another is this part. And here, this part reconnects and like this. And this is the one that is. Is almost the end of the reconnection. And if you look closely, it is a system of vortex ring and a deformed vortex, which are linked. So after the reconnection, we have a system of vortex ring and a deformed vortex ring, which are linked. And after this, After this and successive reconnections, actually, there are other places at which the vortex reconnects. And this series of reconnection leads to transition to turbulence. And to look closely the structure of these. Structure of these vortices. This is a view from another angle, and this is before reconnection. And this is the, I think, the midpoint of reconnection. And this is after reconnection. And to look at this structure clearly, I applied a filter, low-pass filter to this field. It is actually a Gaussian filter used in the Actually, a Gaussian filter used in the large eddy simulation. And the result looks like this. So, before the reconnection, it is not so turbulent. So, the structure is nearly unchanged. The angle is a bit different. And in the midpoint of the reconnection, it is attached like this. And after the reconnection, you can see that the vortex ring and the deformed vortex ring. And the deformed vortex ring are actually linked. So inside this vortex ring, this deformed vortex is contained. And this linking, well, in our view, this linking forces a strong interaction between the vortex tubes. So So, this topological constraint is the reason for the transition to turbulence. And here I'm showing the time evolution of entropy and energy and helicity. From the top, entropy and energy and helicity. Here, helicity is defined simply by inner product of U. By inner product of u and omega. And please note that we have a finite value from t equals zero because the Hegger vortex has a translation velocity. So it is a bit misleading to see here is a finite value. But well, subtracting a uniform velocity is A uniform velocity is tricky after the transition, so we simply calculate according to this. And for L by R 0.3, we have a small peak of entropy after the detachment of vortex ring. Energy is slightly decays faster here, but this is quite weak. But this is quite weak. And the helicity changes rapidly after, well, during after the reconnection. But that's it for the pitch 0.3. But for the pitch 0.2, the entropy becomes quite large after the series of reflection. So this So this arrow, two arrows show the state I showed in the previous slide. So well, sorry. This T equal to 13 and this 1875. So after the reconnection, well, because of the reconnection, HST changes rapidly here. Here. And there are another rapid change here, which shows another part reconnects after this. And after this event, the entropy becomes large. And you can see the decay of the total energy becomes large here. And after this, After this, the one-dimensional spectrum of the energy is compensated like this. It shows a chromograph scaling here. So here, five instance is taken. So before the reconnection, it is quite far from this scaling. But for the well, 1825, which is close to the K well. Uh, the K well after the reconnection, uh, it is well close to the scaling, and after this two instants, yeah, like here and here, we have a good scaling. And after sufficiently long time, it decays and there are this shows another case. This shows another case in which the wave number is one half and the pitch is 0.2. And in this case, yeah, this case is under well analysis now. And you can also see, well, weak transition to turbulence here. Color is a bit different here. In this simulation, we are forcing a three-fold well preserve this symmetry. And no particular simple reconnection occurs here. And some typical moments are shown here. And this preserves threefold instability, well, threefold symmetry here. And what we observed is, well, no simple recognition occurs. Occurs. Well, at the small scale, there are reconnections, but these main tubes do not experience a simple reconnection. And one typical feature is there is an expansion in radio direction. So at this moment, the vortex tube becomes quite large, well, wide in, well, three. In well, three directions here and here and here, symmetrically. And although it looks like a similar state like in the previous case of KZL equals 0.5, but well, actually, the turbulence is weaker than the previous case. Okay, so let me summarize the first part of the long wave instability. So we have considered the non-linear evolution of Hiccup vortex disturbed by long wave instability. And well, the short methods is the process depends crucially on the pitch. And this is quite close to, well, for the detachment. For the detachment of the vortex ring, I learned from Renzo's introduction, the movie Renzo showed yesterday. This is observed in the experiment. And well, in the paper, they referred to the linked system of the system of the uh well vertex ring and uh he well deformed vortex in the different case so this is actually observed in the experiment and uh but the uh nice thing uh about the dnss is uh we he can control the uh simulation and the uh single or well mode of a long wave instability he can induce this He can induce these two cases. And for this pitch 0.2, after reconnection, we have a system of linked vortex ring and deformed vortex. And strong interaction due to the topological constraint forces the system goes to turbulence. And for the pitch 0.3, a vortex ring detaches after reconnection. Detaches after reconnection and pitch is doubled after reconnection. And more importantly, this Higger vortex with larger pitch remains after the reconnection. Okay, so I move to a second part of my talk, and this is about the hecal vortex disturbed by. The Hiccup vortex disturbed by a shortwave instability. And we are particularly interested in the role of curvature instability and ellipsic instability and how Heger vortices break down and become turbulent are our questions. And before going to the results, I briefly introduce the curves instability. Introduce the curvature instability and elliptical instability. And this is based on the theory which we developed with Yasuhi de Fumoto and Blanc Rodriguez and Loudizes. And the base flow of the Herger vortex can be expanded by a small parameter, epsilon, which I introduced. Long, which I introduced already. And at the leading order, we have a line vortex. In general, we have an axial flow. And at the next order, we have a curvature term responsible for curvature, well, induced by a curvature. And this becomes a vortex ring. And the And the next order, order epsilon squared, we have, well, a vortex ring, or in general, we have a Hager vortex. And here at other epsilon, we have a curved effect. And this component of the base flow makes a resonance between the curving waves. Curving waves or inertial waves, which is essentially neutral, neutrally stable, to give parametric instability. And this we called curvature instability. And at the next order, we have a correction to this exponential i phi term. And we also have a 2 phi contribution which gives Distribution, which gives a strain here. And by this strain, elliptical instability is induced by resonance of these two modes mediated by this strain field. And this order has some effects of the torsion and rotation on the curve's instability. And we have done linearized stability. Well, we have solved linearized Navi-Sox equations and we obtained elliptic instability for this parameter. And this is the structure of disturbance we obtained for the headquarters vortex for this parameter. And this is a most fundamental mode of the instability. Of the Eric Instability, which has an index like this. And this is the mode. This is essentially the same mode we have observed for the vortex ring. And we also captured the curve instability for the Hickor vortex of this parameter. And this is the curve intermediate mode of. intermediate mode of m equals minus one and m plus one equals zero and in the indices which characterize the Haker well neutrally stable wave is this pair two and four and this is the structure of the disturbance and this is similar to the disturbance for the vortex ring and if we decompose the mode The mode into a Fourier mode take into the well around the local polar coordinate system centered on the center of the vortex core. We have this energy ratio of the waves and this clearly shows the structure of. The structure of this instability mode. And the question is again: when and how this vortex score becomes turbulent. And so far, we found that there are three cases, both for vertex ring and Hickor vortex. One possibility is a linear saturation or a viscous saturation, so saturation caused by viscous effects. Caused by viscous effects. And the second case is saturation caused by non-linear effects, we call weakly non-linear saturation. And the third case is the turbulent transition. And this animation shows in the left, which are showing the turbulent transition. And here, in the right, we are showing the case of a weakly nonlinear saturation. And the linear saturation is And the linear saturation is caused by the loss of resonance here. Well, actually, this shows the results of direct numerical simulation. So the disturbance energy grows with growth rate of the linear instability, but it saturates here and it decreases like this. And this is caused by. And this is caused by the growth of core size. When the resonance number is small, the core grows well relatively fast. And important point is the growth rate of the shortwave insability is determined as, well, dictated by the core size. Actually, what matters here is matters here is the wave number scaled by like this non-dimensional lines like this so ks multiplied by a a is the core size so this is actually ks a so if a becomes large and ks is determined by the initial condition or it is well determined by a the eigenmode and we he pass this like this Pass this like this. So we go well, we lose the resonance needed for this instability. So the loss of instability leads to the saturation. And another possibility is a non-linear saturation. It is observed for the vortex ring here. And here I'm showing well different initial energies. So amplitude of the disturbance is multiplied like this. But nearly all simulation stops like here. The first peak is almost the same for this. Almost the same for this and this, and this. And if we scale the initial energy to become this value, all curves collapse initially. So this shows that this process is linear. And this deviates because of the non-linear effect. So when it deviates, Yeah, when it deviates, it is an effect of the non-linearity. So this level seems to the saturation caused by the non-linear effects. And at this point, if I take the energy spectrum, it is far from the Kornworf spectrum, and the state looks like this. So this is a state of the weakly non-linear saturation. Saturation. And for the large Reynolds number and the large growth rate of instability, the core can be directly turbulent because of the instability. So in this case, the first peak of the disturbance is here. And here, if I take the energy spectrum, it is close to. spectrum it is a close to the uh it shows uh this scaling of the k to the minus five thirds and we have a nice isotropic turbulence uh here and the uh core looks like this and uh quite turbulent so the core uh can go to a turbulent transition and quickly and uh what we are trying to do is to evaluate a the uh The appropriate amplitude for these three cases. So we are trying to estimate at which amplitude the linear saturation occurs, and at which amplitude non-linear saturation occurs, and at which amplitude turbine transition occurs. And if we can evaluate this, the smallest amplitude. The smallest amplitude will determine the process. For example, if A and S for the nonlinear saturation is smaller than the other two, the nonlinear saturation should occur. And linear saturation for the linear saturation, if we have a growth rate and this width of the unstable band, we can estimate the We can estimate the growth rate by a simple calculation. And for the weekly non-earsaturation, for the simple case of the most fundamental mode, we have a result of SIP and others. And we have amplitude equation, non-linear amplitude equations derived from the weak linear saturation. Well, we Well, I skip the details here. And the yes, well, results look quite good here. And we check our estimate by numerical simulation. And we consider two cases here. One case is edificability of this mode. Of this mode, and the other case is another LPC instability with actual flow of this mode. And for the first case, the energy of the linear mode behaves like this. And this shows two different Reynolds number and two different amplitudes. And for the smaller Reynolds number, it is It is actually like a linear saturation. So the estimate of the saturation of E linear saturation and loneliness saturation is estimated like this. And the initial amplitude is this. And the first peak obtained by the DNS is like this. So actually, the linear saturation amplitude is underestimated. Amplitude is underestimated a bit, but it is consistent with well DNS and S. So for this, we have this linear saturation and it stops here. And for the larger amplitude, we have a similar result. And the ENS is much larger. So all linear saturation occurs. And for the other cases, we have this ENS. This ENS, so larger Reynolds number, ENS is here and ELS is here. So ENS is smaller, so we have a, well, either non-linear saturation or a turbine transition. So linear saturation doesn't occur in this case. And actual case is a turbine transition here, like here. And yes, this here case is the. This here case is the turbine transition. So, unfortunately, the amplitude for the turbine transition has not been obtained here. So, we cannot say that turbine transition occurs actually, but at least it is larger than the actual peak, so it is consistent with the numerical results. With numerical results. And for the other cases, the other case, the work is still going on. And it seems that, well, linear saturation is a bit, well, quite underestimated here. So we are still working on this problem. Okay, so I skip. Okay, so I skip this and quickly summarize the second part. So we considered the evolution of the vortex core of disturbed vortex ring or hectare vortex disturbed by a short wave instability. And we are trying to clarify conditions for three possible cases. And we are estimating the amplitudes for this viscous saturation, weekly nodal saturation. And we are trying. And we are trying to establish a criterion to predict these three cases. So I stop here. Thank you for your attention.
