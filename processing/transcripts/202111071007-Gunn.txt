So Kira did her master's in UBC with Greg Martin on colexic problems. Spent some time at what was it, Alexander College, an extended period as an instructor. I'll come back to the dark side of research. And today, Kiri's going to talk about. And today Pira is going to talk about some recent interest, the zeta function for endomorphisms of positive characteristic tora. Yeah, thank you. So this is basically work that's coming from a paper that's being done, completed now between JC, Kwa, and myself. I'm presenting what is mostly Kwa's contribution to this on these Argent Maser Zeta functions. So, which one am I doing? Okay. There we go. So just to There we go. So, just to describe what these functions are, we're going to take maps from topological spaces into themselves, and we're going to describe this n sub k of f to be the number of isolated fixed points of iterations of this function f. And as long as this is finite for every k, we can define the Artin Maser zeta function as e to the power of, and then this sort of power series thing going on here. thing going on here. So the number of fixed points after k iterations divided by k times z to the k. And so the idea here is try to like figure out how these things behave. So there's a bunch of different results on sort of different topological spaces, but the really relevant one for us was a 2010 result from Bath, Lau, and Pascunis that proves that the zeta function of endomorphisms on the classical torus are rational. Taurus are rational. So that classical Taurus, if you're not familiar with it, it is just the reals modded by the integers with sort of a similar absolute value. It's not quite perfectly defined, but we basically just kind of view that as the decimal parts of numbers with wraparound addition. And then in 2014, a paper by Bell, Miles, and Ward introduced a conjecture that, in fact, for any compact metric abelian group with the property that all of those With the property that all of those fixed points are finite, then this zeta function is either going to be rational or admit a natural boundary. And so what's kind of cool about the results that Qua got is that we have a contradiction to that, which is kind of fun. All right, so the world that we're working in for this paper is the positive characteristic torus. So it's kind of the cousin of the real torus. And just to kind of build it up, And just to kind of build it up, we're going to take a finite field, order q and characteristic p, so q is a power of p, and we're going to create the integers as polynomials with coefficients in that finite field. And then naturally, we're going to create the positive characteristic rationals as the rationals over those polynomials. Those are going to look like basically polynomials with these like 1 over t chunks, which are a lot like your decimals in the real. Which, a lot like your decimals and the real numbers, they'd have to have some sort of repeating pattern to the coefficients. And then, sort of like how we build the reals from the rationals, these are actually going to look like sort of all the Laurent series in 1 over t. So essentially, we eliminate that requirement of having to have repeating patterns, so just like our decimals. We are able to equip this with a discrete valuation, so this map. Valuation, so this map from the reals to the integers along with infinity. So the valuation of 0 is going to be infinity, and the valuation of any x that's written as one of these series here. Oh, there's like a, I don't need to point, right? Yeah, there's that. Okay, that's better. So yeah, any x that's written in one of those series will have m as sort of like the highest power of t in that series, and then they go into the negatives. That valuation is just going to be the negative. That valuation is just going to be the negative m, so it's essentially the highest power. And then that allows us to get this absolute value, which is kind of in sync with the real numbers and how we'd set them up, but it's also very much in sync with p-iadic absolute values of q to the negative vx. Again, q is that order of f, and then just essentially to the power of sort of like, not the degree, but the highest power of t in the series. So, next slide. So, then we get the positive characteristic torus, just like we would over the reals by modding the reals by the integers. And I didn't mention this, but I should also say across that absolute value, Rf is the completion of Q, of the rationals that should be. So we get the torus this way. Essentially, kind of like how our real torus is like the decimal parts of real numbers. Like the decimal parts of real numbers. For this finite characteristic torus, it ends up being the sort of powers of t that are all just negative. So they're sort of like the 10 to the negative 1 places if you think of it like that. So we can represent them all like that. And then we can induce an absolute value that's very similar to the finite characteristic reals by just sort of doing the absolute value on that representative piece. And it works out. And it works out. Okay, so if we take some finite extension of Rf, any field really, we can naturally extend this absolute value. Oh, sorry, wrong button. So we can naturally extend an absolute value so that we can continue to work with it. And so just so I can build up some definitions before I get to this theorem that we have for the finite characteristic torus. Finite characteristic torus, it's big. I have to sort of break down what these elements are going to look like. So, any element in this k, this finite extension, that has an absolute value of 1, what we're going to do is kind of split it into two parts. So, we're going to split it into this a sub 0 part and this a sub 1 part. So, in different work that I've been doing on the finite characteristic torus, I've actually come. Finite characteristic torus, I've actually come across a representation that we can do for these algebraic components. And generally, they kind of look like series again with powers of t, except that the powers of t can now be rational. And there are some rules on it, but it's not quite the same as the rules for like the rational or the real elements. But in that context, we can kind of think of this as, so this A0 is supposed to be in, I know there's a better notation for it, but I scrambled. For it, but I scrambled. It's supposed to be in the roots of unity of k specifically. So for rf itself, that would be the constants. So the things that don't have t. And then in this extension, if we do view them as these t powers with rational powers, it'll be kind of the same idea. It'll be that constant chunk that doesn't have any t powers attached to it, t and zero. And then the remainder will be sort of like that decimal chunk. Be sort of like that decimal chunk, but in the context of these algebraic elements, they would have sort of wacky powers of t, wacky rational powers. But we don't really need that actually to construct this. Essentially all we need, and it's a little bit more complicated to explain it through algebra, but we can uniquely break it into what is essentially this root of unity in k, and then something whose absolute value is less than 1. And then by breaking those two apart, we can. And then by breaking those two apart, we can actually do a lot of work with this stuff. And then now I can define the order of alpha modulo p. So, yeah, just some ideal there. So, it's going to be the order of that sort of constant part or that unity, root of unity part in the multiplicative group that we're working in there. So, essentially, what we have to take that sort of constant part to get it to one, and then you have the trailer left behind it. And then what's going to Behind it. And then what's going to be useful of that is that it's going to be the smallest positive integer n, so that alpha to the n minus 1 is less than 1. And that's what we're going to be looking for for this claim here. Alright, so here's the theorem. So it is a mouthful. So we're going to take an A in the D by D matrices with integer coefficients, and then we're going to have this R of A equals R of A equals, so it's the product over the eigenvalues, where we either take just one or the absolute value of the eigenvalue. Sorry, yeah, the absolute value of the eigenvalue. And these a's are going to generate the endomorphisms that we're looking at. So our map is going to be integer matrix multiplication by A. So the first chunk of this paper was actually work primarily done by JC, establishing that this is in fact the entropy, if you're familiar with that. Entropy, if you're familiar with that. So that's the entropy of these maps, and it just kind of nicely fits into this second chunk of the paper. And so what we're going to do is buttons primarily look at the eigenvalues and how big they are. And we really care about the eigenvalues that have an absolute value of 1. The ones with big absolute values, they're kind of easy to handle. To handle. So when they have an absolute value of 1, we're going to split them into a bunch of mu's, and these are going to be the ones that are roots of unity, and then a bunch of etas. And these are going to have absolute value of 1, but are not roots of unity. So if we were to express them as powers of t, they'd have little chunks at the end. And then what we're going to do is look at those orders, modulo, that fractal p. So again, that's where we just look at. So again, that's where we just look at the constant part of it and see what we have to do to get it to 1. And so the m's are going to be the corresponding orders of the mus, so those are the roots of unity. And the n's are going to be the corresponding orders of the etas. And so they're the non-roots of unity with absolute value 1. And it's going to break into two cases. So basically, if every n has an m that goes into it, Has an m that goes into it. We end up getting that this zeta function is algebraic. And it's this big formula here, which is a little scary to look at than it really is. The products are just kind of going through all of your combinations of m values that show up, like every subset we can make. And then we compute this r, which is just going to kind of depend on the least common multiples as they go through. And that minus one. As they go through, and that minus one is going to come through from the proof with a whole inclusion-exclusion thing in the yeah, counting basically. So it looks really chaotic, but in simple cases, it's actually very easy to compute. Otherwise, so if we don't have this property that all the n's have an n that go into it, that means that we have some n that doesn't have any m's. What we're actually going to get is that this series here is going to converge in an open disk. To converge in an open disk. That part's easy enough to show, so I didn't really include that in the rest of this. But in fact, this part is the whole function essentially is going to be transcendental. So yeah. And what you can see from actually looking at the R's is because we have this like one over in the power here, is it's going to potentially, as long as those least common multiples don't somehow reconcile themselves. Don't somehow reconcile themselves, it's going to give you rational exponents that are going to leave you with an algebraic expression, which is going to contradict that conjecture. So here's a really simple example here. Let's say we're in F7. Our matrix A is just going to be simple 6 and 3, so constants. We actually only have μ's because both of them are roots of unity, so we don't have any eta, and so by Have any eta, and so by default we will result in the A situation. And so the order of 6 is 2, the order of 2 is 3. And so if we plug this into this formula, so remember we do this product over kind of all the combinations. So we'll start with all of the sets of size 1, and then these will be all the sets of size 2. And yeah, we end up just kind of throwing in these products. We end up just kind of throwing in these products. R of A is 1 because all of the eigenvalues have order or absolute value 1. So that product is 1. We just get a bunch of 1 minus Z's. And we plug this in here. So this was the chunk at the beginning. If I just kind of, yeah, so we have that, that's this piece here. And then the rest is kind of coming through from that product. So we have the least common multiple of the set of 2, the least common multiple of the set of 3 is showing. The least common multiple of the set of 3 is showing up here. And then the sets of size 2 are going to get the negative attached to it from the power. The least common multiple is 6. We put it together, we get this expression. You can simplify it a little bit maybe, but you're not going to get rid of those rational exponents. So this is, in fact, algebraic. It doesn't really have a natural boundary in the sense that we can extend it along that boundary, like this would have a Boundary, like this would have a radius one, but there's really only the six points on that radius where you can't extend it a little bit further. So it does contradict that conjecture. So that is at least kind of neat. And what I'm going to do now is go over the proof of it a little bit, because it is kind of cool. And Qua really wanted me to do that, so yeah. Okay, so to go through the proof, what we're going to The proof. What we're going to start with is this fairly well-known result for this positive characteristic torus. That if we take any matrix in B and we want to find just the number of fixed points from multiplying by B, it is the determinant of, the absolute value of the determinant of B minus 1. I think you can find several proofs of that anywhere, not anywhere, but. So as a consequence of that, then Consequence of that, then if we take k iterations of a, that's just the matrix a to the k, so we get this determinant here. And so we're going to be able to swap out that number of fixed points formula for a determinant, which depends on eigenvalues, essentially. All right. And the way that we're going to write this out is going to be this giant product. And this is why it really matters if the Why it really matters if the size of the eigenvalue is 1 or not, because that's going to affect what the determinant looks like in this a to the k minus 1. So the eigenvalues of this are just going to be like lambda to the k minus 1. And so looking at that, the r a to the k that we had before that grabbed essentially ones or absolute values of lambdas, so this is going to grab the absolute values of all. Absolute values of all of the lambdas that are bigger than 1, basically. So it's going to grab all of those because if we take them to the k, they'll just take your absolute value to the k. If we subtract 1, it's not going to affect that absolute value because it's like this big polynomial type thing with a high power. And then this chunk right here is going to handle what happens when we subtract 1 from these eigenvalues who have absolute values. Who have absolute value 1 already. So the a's are coming from the μ's, so those were all of your roots of unity. And basically, if k is a multiple of the order of that root of unity, we're going to get a determinant 0. So that's going to wipe out the whole thing. Otherwise, we're going to get an order of 1, because when we subtract 1 from this, it still leaves something. And then the other ones are a little bit more complicated. More complicated. So these are coming from the etas, and they were things that had an absolute value of 1, but were not roots of unity. So, like, no power is going to turn it into 1. We're never going to get a 0 out of it. But if we raise these to powers, if we raise it to something that's a multiple of its order, it will wipe out the lead 1. And it'll leave you with something with absolute value smaller than 1, and that's where that eta comes from. Value smaller than 1, and that's where that eta comes through. And then basically, this chunk really only applies to that, so that power, in the sense that if k has a bunch of p's in it, you get some sort of Frobenius mapping, and it'll sort of kind of push the absolute value down a little bit. So that's just where that's coming in. And in the statement of this theorem, it really depended on if n's had m's that N's had m's that went into it, and so that's how things are going to break into two cases. If all of the n's have an m that goes into it, then every time we get this absolute value of eta chunk, it's going to coincide with a zero. So it's going to wipe out. Which means that we don't really have to worry about that ever. So it makes the formula a lot easier. And so, really, all we care about is when we get these ones, which When we get these ones, which essentially like the ones will go with one, they may go with zero, it doesn't really matter. But the key is all we actually care about is whether or not the Mi goes into K. Because if it does, we get zero, if it doesn't, we get one because of that divisibility property. And that at least makes the formula much easier to work with. So, yeah, so if we have this property, then essentially. Yeah, so if we have this property, then essentially we're going to get that the number of fixed points coming from that determinant formula is zero whenever the m's go into the k, and it's ra to the k otherwise. So when we write this out, I can take the summation and just sort of rewrite it with the r's, and then just kind of just say as long as it's mi's that don't go into k. Then I'm not going to go through all the math, but it's
