So, I'm going to start by motivating a little bit what I want to do and stuff with a neutral literature example. So, just so we're all on the same page. So, essentially, the type of model we're looking at have very much to do with the types of model that Assad presented in his talk, which can be demonstrated as KCLGs, so kinetic post-gases. Essentially, Gases essentially replace the fluid dynamics, global dynamics, by the germ dynamics where the particles can move throughout the system, provided that they satisfy some given constraint. So of course I'm going to define a little bit more precisely what I mean, but just so we introduce the notion of lattice guesses, let me start with the very most basic one, which is the set. So the symmetric simple exclusion process. Let us start in one dimension. So configuration. The configuration of the set is just a collection of configuration for each site. So each site is either empty or occupied. And given an initial configuration that can be random, that can be pretty much whatever you want. You perform particle jumps in the sense that each edge of the system is going to be flipped at rate one. So each edge is associated with a sequence of exponential clocks. And when a clock rings, you flip, such as you exchange the two configurations. Essentially, you exchange the two configurations at both ends of the edge. Okay, so this means that essentially each particle changes one on an empty neighbor because exchanging two particles which are identical does not change anything and exchanging two empty sites neither. Okay, so the question we're interested in in our line of work, let's say, is the macroscopic behavior of such a system. Okay, so you have Z, you have a bunch of parcels each site. Have a bunch of passcodes each site, okay? And now these passcodes are, and you want to be able to characterize the microscopic behavior of the system, which is to say that you want to see Z as a discretization of R, okay, and you want to make sense of the limit as the size of the mesh, of the size of the discretization goes to zero. Okay, it's a very well-known fact for Russet that the macroscopic limit is characterized by the heat equation. Characterized by the heat equation. And this function rho that appears in the heat equation can be sorted out as rho of tu, which is going to be simply the expectation of eta tn squared at site x. So x is n u. Okay, so formally you can write it down this way. And you see that I rescue time here because you want to see microscopic changes. Changes in your system, which means that the password needs to have some time to move over microscopic distances. And of course, since passwords are essentially performing symmetric random works, in order for them to jump over a distance of order n, you need to leave them at time of order n squared. In that formula on the slide on the left-hand side, and the file, n squared shouldn't be there. So the way the way we okay, so another way of looking at it is that these phi. Looking at it is that this phi Tm square, which I didn't talk about, but the empirical measure of the process, is going to converge to rho of Tu. It's a bit strange that you have T n squared on both sides. I was thinking you also had to. Wait. No, so essentially, this TF squared is exactly this one. It's my one. So does phi t n square converge to rho or does phi t converges to rho? So phi t n square converges to rho t? Pi t n square is a very yeah pi t n square is okay it's just a question of properly yes but pi t n square converges to rho g. But it's a classic computer. Yeah I mean it's in perpetuity it's a fairly standard way of looking at things. You could write just a t on rho. You could write just a G on box. I apologize. I agree that this is a little confusing. Yes, so quite G and compared just to quote T. Okay, so let me now go to the main point of my talk, which is going to be the facilitating ethereum process, which in the broad sense can be taken as a kinetic constraint, yes, although it does not really satisfy the definition that Asaf had yesterday for a very simple reason. For a very simple reason, but first let me present the model. So you can think of it as a set. Okay, so the set, in the way you flip an edge, essentially does not allow more than one particle per site. You're never going to have more than one particle per site. So this is called the exclusion rule. And to go from the cell to the fat, you keep the exclusion rule, but you add one more constraint, which is going to be a kinetic constraint. And the constraint is that a particle, in order to jump to a neighboring site, Jump to a neighboring site must be pushed by a particle on the other side. Okay, so for example, this particle can jump here because this site is occupied, this particle can jump here because this site is occupied, but this particle is isolated and cannot jump. And the question behind it is, well, what can we say and what is going to be the effect of this symmetric constraint on the macroscopic behavior of the system? So this model is inspired by a model by John Sarves Laminim and Tony Nelly. Model by Gon√ßalves Lamin and Tolinelli, where a particle was allowed to jump from here to here if this side was occupied or this site was occupied. And this is a KCLG in the sense that Asab gave it, because the constraint in the first particle does not take into account the position in the edge of the particle. So this constraint here means that the Bernoulli product measure are invariant for the dynamics. Product measure are invariant for the dynamics, which is no longer the case because now we have oriented our jobs because the particles need to be pushed from behind and cannot be pulled. So, the way the edge is occupied actually matters. Okay, so this is a very important fact about this process. The second problem we have with this process is you don't have some kind of mobile cluster for the system. Once again, this ecosystem was talking about. Was talking about. So imagine that you have a couple of particles. Well, the idea of a mobile cluster is that those two particles can move together in order to move the configuration somewhere else. But here, once the first particle has jumped, well, this one a priori cannot jump anymore. Okay, so this one is stuck, so you don't have any mobile cluster. So you have very small problems when you try to mix your configuration. It's not even reversible. Yeah, it's not reversible. I mean, it's reversible once you look at. Reversible. I mean, it's reversible once you look at it in the right way, but clearly on the set of total of global configurations, it's not reversible. Okay, so for what follows, I'm going to consider an asymmetric version of this process, and then I'm going to consider both the symmetric and the asymmetric case. So imagine that this jump is going to be performed at rate p, and this jump is going to be performed at rate 1 minus p. And we'll explore what happens when p changes. Okay, so the first results we got were about the symmetric version of this process, which is of course the case where p equals 1 minus p equals 1 half. Okay, so imagine that you start your process from a very nicely behaved product measure, so a product of Barnobi, fitting some profile, which is going to be the initial data of your hydrodynamic units. Well, we first consider the case where the total density is larger than 100. Where the total density is larger than one-half for reasons that I will get back to later. Okay, we prove that in the case where the initial density is larger than one-half, what you have in the end as the hydrodynamic limit is a diffusion equation. It's a non-linear one, but still you have a pretty nice diffusion equation. What's more interesting is when you don't make this assumption on the initial profile and you let the initial profile take any values between 0 and 1. And then what you get is still a diffusion equation, but it's actually a Stefan problem with a moving. But it's actually a step-up problem with a moving boundary because here in the diffusion part you have an indicator function that the density is larger than one half. Okay, so what does this system behave like? Well, you start from a given density, taking arbitrary values, and it's not going to work. I don't know why. Okay. So it's not from a given density and you see that. Density and you see that this rubber critical region where rho is larger than one half is going to diffuse and it's going to progressively invade the rho less than one half part, which is completely frozen. Here you see that here you still have the initial profile of the density. Okay, and this is going through completely vertical interfaces. And if there were initially enough mass in your system, eventually you get to this diffusive part where your densities are just one half everywhere. Density is larger than one-half everywhere. Okay, so this is the behavior of the system. So, of course, there must be a reason microscopically to explain this microscopic behavior. So, let's take a closer look at the configurations. Well, first, what happens at low density? Well, because of the utility constraint, if particles are isolated, in the sense that if particles are surrounded by density sites, nothing can happen in your system. Okay, so this is basically a frozen phase. Of course, you start from a band-off product method. Of course, you start from a band-only product measure. So even if the density of a role is less than one-half, there's no reason that you would be at the beginning in a frozen state. So you actually start from a transient bad configuration, we call it that way, where sure there might be some active particles, but ultimately you know that you're going to reach a frozen state. So this is probably why the phase density less than one half is frozen, is because ultimately you get to a frozen state and the critical configuration in some sense would be alternated. Configuration, in some sense, would be alternating between particles and anticipates. At large density, at some point, well, once again, you start from a binary product measure, so you don't really know what happens, but if you have enough particles, ultimately you're going to get to a state where this time the antisites are isolated. And it's not hard to see that this is an embryo component because if you have a pair of anticipes Neighboring anti-sites, well, you can break it down by making a particle jump here. Okay, so this is okay. You can break down a neighboring pair of anti-sites. However, if you wanted to break and to create a pair of neighboring anti-sites, well, this would require the particle inside to jump out, which it cannot do. Okay, so once you get to this configuration, to this set of configurations where all the sites are isolated, you cannot leave it. So this is the embodiment component for a system. And actually, to A system and actually to just use those points. Once you get to the ability component, the process actually becomes reversible. And you also show that all these configurations are connected. Yes, so actually you just show that we cannot go outside. That's true, but yes, I mean once you're in the component, you can reach any configuration for any other configuration with the same number of clusters. You also have mobile clusters and you still don't have mobile clusters, but You still don't have mobile clusters, but you free care because now essentially particles behave diffusively. Okay. So in the field of aerodynamic image, we have a bunch of tools. We have a toolbox, and you kind of try and adapt to tools depending on the specifics of the model you're looking at. And so here, the critical point is that the dynamic product measures are not stationary. So you need to understand, and it's very important, the nature of It's very important the nature of your stationary measures for your process and your equilibrium measures in the symmetric laws. Okay, this is important because the hydrodynamic limit, in some sense, is an equivalent and analogous of the lower numbers. It's the convergence of some local averages of quantities, which would be the eta x, to some definite, to some deterministic quantity, which would be rho k. Okay, so you need to understand the distribution of the eta x's in order to be able to apply a logo numbers. Able to apply in low-lap numbers. So, first, you can see that this symmetric step is reversible with respect to a family of explicit distribution pi rho, okay, where rho is the density of particles. And as I mentioned, once you get to the agonic component, you can achieve it, so these reversible measures must be supported on the agonic component. Laterally, it's not too hard to characterize this pyro. And pyro is a boundary product measure with density rho. However, it's conditioned However, it's conditioned to having all anticipations isolated. Okay, so it's not a product measure. This has some correlations, and actually, these correlations become long-range when the density goes to one half. But still, you have an explicit boundary product measure. So, this is the first very important thing if you want to prove the hypermethynet. Okay, so now let's get back to the tools. So, typically, the most used tools to provide. The most used tools to provide dynamic limits are entropy tools. There are two techniques that are called the entropy method by Roca Paniko and Baradan, and the relative entropy method by Yao. And both essentially are based on the fact that your process has a given distribution at time t, okay, and you're going to compare this distribution at time t, with thanks to the entropy of the system, with respect to some nice reference measure. So here we see that we have a first problem, which is: okay, so you expect Okay, so you expect that pretty far the distribution of your system is going to be supported by the AOL component as well, at least in a suffer critical phase. But in the beginning, it's not the case. So either you take pi rho to be supported by the AOL component, but in this case, you have some problems at time zero because pi t and pi rho do not have the same support, or you take pi rho to be supported over all configurations, but then you have some problem because at some point you're going to reach the only components, and in any case, And in any case, any measure other than piero will not be a good choice to estimate the anti- because you need that uniformly on the yeah so you so essentially you need to you need to show that your your distribution at time t is not too far from its equilibrium state but but at any time at all time so you cannot just at all diffuse time okay so diffuse so at any time t n square which won't be the case because initially Which won't be the case because initially if you have this uh it takes a different so initially pi zero is a product of the loading and so there are you have here you have some problem because the the entropy is not going to be able to write order does it take you decrease your time to go to the entropy so okay i'll get to that but actually no and this is an important uh an important part okay so uh yeah so we have some problem using the So we have some problem using the different tropical tools because the initial distribution is a very natural one, a product anode, and the equilibrium distribution for the process does not have the same support. Okay, on top of that, you see in the simulation that just showed you that you have no smooth solution for the aerodynamic limit because, okay, at least in the general case, because you have this front that cuts down your configuration in half. Okay, so these are two problems. The way we solve these problems The way we solve these problems, well, in the supercritical case, actually, you can prove that the abolition component is reached in a subdiffusive time. You show that in the supercritical case, the probability that eta at time, let's say, log n to some power alpha is hydrodic goes to one as n goes to infinity. Okay, and since we're interested in a process on the time scalar order n squared, The process on the time scale of order n squared, we're going to reach the other component way before. So essentially, we can use the classical tool, except starting from this time, so log n alpha, which is in macroscopic scale, is log n divided by n squared. And you know that the initial profile, when you wait this time, has not changed. Alpha have not had the time to move over microscopic scales. So essentially, you can prove the hydrodynamic initiatives. The hydrodynamic at all. In the general case, well, then you have your separate problems, and entropy methods cannot be used because you have these two phases. So, you're never going to have a good reference measure throughout the whole system. So, instead, we used an adaptation of some scheme by Funaki, where essentially, for those who are familiar with this kind of things, the one-block estimate is true in a very general context with definitely time-type decompositions, and the two-block distribution, the two-block estimate is bypassed. Look estimated by mass by just proving some young measure type estimate. Okay, so let me now address the asymmetric case. So let us now take P to be between one half and one. You still start to process from a nice band of product measure, and you want to understand the macroscopic limit of this object. So, of course, now you have a nice remedial system, so your time scaling needs to be different. Different. You are no longer on a diffusive time scale which is square, you are on a hyperbolic time scale which is n. And what we showed is that the hydrodynamic limit for the asymmetric Stefan problem is given by this equation here, where you see that you still have a Stefan problem, but this time the Stefan problem is hyperbolic. I'll pass over the details of the notion of a unique entropy solution. I guess it would be very natural for those of you who are familiar with it and we make no matter photos. With it, and we make no matter for some who aren't. So, I'll just skip over it for now. Okay, so now we are looking at the massive hydrodynamic limits, and our set of tools is greatly reduced. It's great to be reduced because the typical thing you want, which is the two-long estimate, is no longer true on the proper scale. So you need to find something else. And when you're looking at asymmetric hydrodynamic limits, you actually have a very limited tool. You actually have a very limited toolbox. So, the first one is the entropy method, which doesn't work because you don't have a toolbox estimate. The relative entropy method could work, but the relative entropy method requires a smooth solution, and we don't have a smooth solution, first because the hydrodynamic limit is hyperbolic, and second because the hydrodynamic limit is a Stefan problem. Okay, so these are two significant problems. There is another technique which is based on compensative compactness arguments. For the red here, it should be better to understand why due to the non-smoothness it doesn't work. Why the fact that it's a steven problem by state you cannot choose? So which is the well the relative entropy method you require to have a smooth solution. And here you have two reasons why your solution is not going to be smooth. So the first one is because you have an hyperbolic equation which is going to develop shots. The second one is because you have a separate product, so you have this platform. Products, so you have these flat fronts. Okay, then the presence of the front, yeah, exactly. So, okay, you could say, okay, I'm going to use the symmetropic method, that's fine, I'm going to get the hydrodynamic limits until the first shock. But as soon as you have the two phases, you're not even going to be able to do that because the second problem is going to be irregular from time zero. Yeah. Okay, so Fritz component compatness argument is very technical and it also requires to have some steering. It also requires to have some steering dynamics to weaken, in some sense, your model, so it's not very satisfactory. But essentially, the only tool we have left is attractiveness. And of course, the problem is our model is not attractive. Okay, but fortunately, it's almost attractive. So why is it almost attractive? Because surely the exclusion process is not. And I will get back to the notion of attractiveness just right. Notion attractiveness just right after, but so the extrusion process is not attractive, but once you properly map it, it becomes attractive. Okay, so imagine that you have an exclusion configuration, you can transform it into a zero-range configuration. So for those of you who may not be familiar with the zero-range terminology, it's just a system where you can have as many particles as you want on each side of the system. And at a rate, depending on the local configuration, a particle is going to jump out of the system. A path where it's going to jump out of the site. Okay, so I have an institution configuration. I'm going to transform it into a zero-range configuration. The way I do that is very classical, and I guess most of you have already seen these kind of things. You choose a given anti-site in your system, okay? And then each cluster of an anti-site plus all the particles coming right after are going to become one-site in the zero-launch process. So you have an anti-site following it. Anti-site following it are two particles. So the corresponding site in this uranium process is going to have two particles. Okay, so an anti-site here is a site here. Now you have another anti-site. You have one particle on it, so you put one particle on the site. Then you have another anti-site, but there are no particles right to its right, so its site remains empty, and so on and so forth. Okay, so you perform this construction, and this is going to map one-to-one an exclusion configuration towards the orange configuration. An exclusion configuration to a zero range configuration, provided that you have chosen a tank zero, you can attack anticipating your configuration. So, natural question is: what becomes of the fossil exclusion dynamics through this method? Well, essentially, the point is the fact an isolated particle cannot judge. What is an isolated particle for a fact? Well, it's just a particle that is alone on site for the zero inch process. So, this means that. Process. So this means that the zero-h process you have here is just a process where a stack of particles is going to perform a symmetric jump at state one, except if a particle is alone at its site, in which case it cannot jump. Okay, so this is a fairly simple process. So here you see that the particle here can jump to the right at rate one or at rate p if you're a passymetric case. This particle can jump at rate one minus p to its left. Its left. So it's a very simple Dirang process where the jump rate at site y is given by the indicator function that the number of particles at site y is larger than two. Okay, so what are we gaining through this mapping? Well, we have gained attractiveness. So what does that mean? Well, we said the functional indicator that k is larger than two is not decreasing. So what that means is So, what that means is that if you start, there is a way of coupling two configurations, two zero-n configurations, in a way that if, so here you have omega, here you have zeta, if initially omega and zeta are older, so omega is below zeta, there are a way to couple these two processes such that the two processes each follow the zero-range dynamics, but at time t, you are still going to have. But at time t, you are still gonna have your domination, okay? So at time t, most likely it's gonna flatten out somewhat. Here you're gonna have omega, here you're gonna have zeta. Okay, but you will still have the same domination you had at time t. And this is a very powerful tool because it allows for a bunch of complete arguments that facilitate a lot the proof of hydrodynamic limits. Another remark on this process is that it's equilibrium status generic. Is that its equilibrium stationary or stationary distributions, depending whether or not you're in the symmetric or asymmetric case, are very simple? They are very simple because they are just product geometric measures, which do not allow for empty sites. Because the equivalent of the ergodic component for the exclusion process is the ergodic component for the zero-range process, which is a configuration where each site has at least one task. Okay. Okay, even so, still, even with attractiveness, you have some trouble developing the copying arguments because the process is not achieved and you have these two phases, but up to technical details, proving the asymmetric hydrodynamic limit at least becomes doable. So now we have a strategy because recall that we want to prove the asymmetric hydrodynamic limit for the exclusion process. So now we have a pre-strategy, which is proving the hydrodynamic limit for the zero. Hydrodynamic limits for the zero-range process, and then mapping both at the microscopic and macroscopic level in order to prove the hydrodynamic limit for the exclusion process. Okay, so first we need to prove the hydrodynamic limit for the zero-h process, but this is actually doable sense to attractiveness that we gained. And then, well, then you need to map back and forth your hydrodynamic points. Uh, you hired anything else, okay. So, first, let's talk about very briefly about microscopic mapping. So, recall that the mapping is defined to a tag-denticity. So, initially, in your zero-range configuration, you have a tag-denticite, and you're going to build your zero-range configuration seen from this tag-enty site, which is going to evolve in time. Okay, so this tag dentisite in the extrusion configuration is going to move. Anticytes in the extrusion configuration is going to move around the system. And you're going to build your mapping seen from x0 of t. Once you perform this mapping seen from X0 of T and you have the facility utility process here, you know that you're going to have the facility. Here, you know that you're going to have the facilitated zero-launch process. Okay, no, you need to follow the target particle to make a mapping. Yes, exactly. I mean, you need to follow the isolated, the tag dentistic size as well, the configuration, because otherwise the one-to-one because you would just change, you would just change the empty sites. However, the dynamics. anti-sites however the dynamics seem the dynamics for the zero and forces will no longer be the facilitated zero wouldn't be just the fact that given the configuration for the the zero range you cannot reconstruct it yeah oh yeah i mean that's another way of looking at it but so the when uh yeah i mean when uh but if you change so my point sorry i'm not making that sense but my point is if you change your My point is, if you change your tag anti-site, then you see the configuration from a completely different point. So you need to follow the same anti-sites in order for the dynamics to make sense. Okay, so since we want to understand things from a macroscopic standpoint, the first thing we need to do is to understand the macroscopic behavior of this tag anticycle. Okay, so this you can do. You now mut the position, the reserve position of the tag anticyte. Tigen site. So, how do you do it? Well, if you look at the Zorange process, when does the tag entity size move in the extrusion configuration? Well, it moves to the right when a particle jumps to the left, and it moves to the left when a particle jumps to the right across this edge. Okay, so essentially, in order to understand the position of X zero. The position of x0 of t, you just have to count the particle current along the first edge of your system. Well, this is not hard to do because you can just subtract the mass that you see on the right at time t minus the mass that you see on the right at time zero. This is going to give you the total currents reach, and this is going to give you the macroscopic position of the time and t sounds. Okay, so this depends on the whole hydrodynamic profile for the zero-range process, but still you don't need hydrodynamic chemistry for. Still, you don't need hydrodynamic limits for the orange process. So, this is something you can work with. Okay. Now, you need to understand a little better your space variables. Well, recall that the sites for the zero-ench process are the anti-sites for the exclusion configuration. So this is what I mean here. So, y is a site for the zero-engine process, which depends on a site in the exclusion process that is unoccupied. Process that is unoccupied, and you know that y, so the number of the sites in the zero-range process, is going to be the number of anti-sites until I x. Okay, you translate this at the macroscopic level. Now, u is the space parameter for your exclusion process, v is the space parameter for the zero-ench process, and you know that the space parameter for the zero-inch process is the total mass of anticipes between the tag zero. size between the tag zero and the spot u that you are looking at. Okay, so the space variable can also be explained, for the zero edge process can also be explained as a function of the space variable of the exclusion process and this function here that tells you the number of zeros. Okay, so we have mapped the side side, we have mapped the space coordinates in both systems. Now remains to map systems now remains to map the hydrodynamic limit for the zero edge process and the hydrodynamic limit for the for the zero and sorry the hydrodynamic limit for the exclusion process and the hydrodynamic for for the zero edge process well what's it the density of particles uh in the in the exclusion process well you have a stack if alpha is the density of the orange process you have a stack of around alpha particles which are preceded by an anti-site okay so you have By your anti-size. Okay, so you have a cluster of size one plus alpha and a total of alpha particles, which means that the density in your exclusion process is going to be alpha divided by one plus alpha. So in the end, you have this identity here, which is that your exclusion density at point U, which is the macroscopic parameter for this rule process, is alpha divided by one plus alpha at point V, which is the macroscopic spot for the zero-anchor. But just sorry, in the formula for the macroscopic point of the zero-range process, they give mu t. So, mu t is the position of the tagnot, the macroscopic position of the tagnotism. So, that's the density of emptiness. Because yes, yes, I mean, everything is at times. Yeah, yeah, yeah, because your mapping depends on time, okay. Okay, so now we have the mapping back and forth. Let's try to use it to prove the macroscopic behavior of the system. Well, recall that you want to understand the empirical measure for the exclusion process integrated against the test function H, which is this quantity here, at time tn square. Well, thanks to the mapping ut, assuming that everything we're talking about is smooth, which is not, of course, but assuming that everything is smooth, this continues. This quantity here can be written as the same quantity but from the zeranged process, but you have slightly changed, or slightly, you have completely changed your test function. Okay, and your test function now becomes H composed with the mapping U T, which deforms the state variables into each other. But still, this is a very good limit. Assuming that everything is smooth, this H composed with UT now could be the new test function. And you know that you have the other band. And you know that you have the aerodynamic limit for the Zirange process, so you know that the left-hand side here converges to this alpha integrated against H composed with UT. So you know that the left-hand side is almost row to that, and you can perform a change of variable, V becomes UT of V here, and you recover exactly row and integrate against H as you want it. Okay, so this is all. Okay, so this is all fairly natural, but of course the problem is that I behave, I mean, I explained that as if everything was smooth and nothing smooth. So there's a little bit of work here because you need to smooth down everything, especially because you're looking at a hyperbolic problem which has its own non-smoothness issues. But you can take the vanishing viscosity limit, you can regularize everything, and in the end, you can use your mapping in order to prove the hydrology. Your mapping in order to prove the hydrologic kit. Okay, so let me conclude with just a couple of pieces of current work. So everything else I talked to you is in one dimension. Okay? So fine, but what about five dimensions, of course? That's actually a lot about asking questions. The problem is everything we did so far in one dimension. Did so far in one dimension heavily relies on this mapping between exclusion process and zero range process. And this mapping is no longer available in higher dimensions. So the gist of it is we don't know how to do anything in high dimensions. So currently with Asaf and Marielle and Miguel, we are trying to look at this numerically at the two-dimensional problem in order to understand pretty much how it behaves. But so far, mathematically, But so far, mathematically, we have essentially nothing on the higher damage. The other thing we're looking at, and which is very interesting, is the effect of boundary interactions on the facilitating extrusion process. So this is also a fairly natural question. You take your facilitating exclusion process on a box of size N and you put it into contact with reservoirs at both sides. What happens microscopically and what happens macroscopically? Well, both are not so clear and actually. So clear, and actually, the FEP has some very unusual behavior in the sense that the reservoirs that you put it in contact with are not gonna enforce their own density. So you're not gonna get, if you have a reservoir at density alpha, you're not gonna get the original conditions at density alpha, which is very unusual. Instead, you're gonna get The actual conditions of a function of alpha and this rho of alpha is such that if rho is the density, alpha is the active density. What I'm saying is the reservoirs do not fix the density, they fix the active density. You mean the density of non-isolated sites? Yeah, essentially, yes. Yeah, you fix the density of active functions. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much.
