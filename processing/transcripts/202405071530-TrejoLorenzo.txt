I work in departamentos of national security, and departamentes of national public as a person who is institutions there is this connectivity, so. This connectivity. So I apologize, also, the group or the committee very accessible to all the cartas that meet the 50 gates by Congress. So, many attractions for all possible, and I can't construct. Well, for a little bit of my study, well, I'm going to go to study in applications. In Mathematicas Applied Mathematics, measure and math having applied mathematics, and I was aidos where a doctorate in Mathematicas, but also having applications. So, I mean, utilizar la Mathémátética, as myself to resolve problems real problems, and well, what is the epidemic of COVID-19? Epidémico COVID-19 puestam investigations between modelación epidémicol. Algo que yo no hacia, but interestante, my estabat workando hacind postdoc in Los Alamos, in Los Alamos es un laboratory deguridad nacional y dentro de laboratorio a grupo que hace biología theoretic biology and este grupo puestambien a grupo fuerte que ase epidemiología. So I involukar como aquí. If we also analyze the reproductive basic and other groups, the number established between them is that to put in alarm, but The idea. But if no, as you can see, this immediate nuestros. Well, what is going to be platinum here? This group of people or epidemiologists, or people of sciences of salute, plantean, and yo como matemática pues esto yuna respuesta. What is going to present here? Presentar here, well, the presentar cuel voyage for CDC and these institutions distilled that what I present was not necessarily represented the position official position of CDC or Los Alamos. Okay, so my laba in this book is utilizado models mechanistic models, models stochastic models, and a combination of these two queues with known as models and models. There are various objectives, for example, this type of models, and we differential ordinaries principally, statistics, with the objective of determining or quantifying the values of the parameters. Los valores de los para metros de lo que conosemos datos. Nomes, nos mescuchami. Ok. Listo. Yueno tamien podemos complicar un poquito más los modelos y nos otros queremos estudiaro analizar differentes or observamos no en esta pandemía del COVID sinue. Tosses másos menos estáni plática voya comenzara describir bunos modelos mechanistic modes, y vago me voya central markar. Mechanisticos, y vago megoya centrarmas en el model los ibridos. Okay, so that's the introducing terminología y vocabulario. Les voya presentar lo que maurícionos comes pláticando ayer. We have this canónic model, model basic model to study epidemic. This model is susceptible and infected. Model people susceptible and infected recuperadofor the classic types. For these two people, Carmani McKendry, 1928 to study as evolution epidemiological. So, here is many hypothesis considerations that we have a population that we study: this population between classes, the classes of susceptible classes, the queen of infected, and the classes of the science. And in fact, y the classes of recoperados, and what interests us is like evolution with respectual time, the people who are in cadar class. So, this system of casions one two citres is what they are describing as the number one in particular describe the process of transmission of a infermed, for example, this of the coronavirus, this process no dice the And we have no idea that so that infection interactions between the susceptible interfaces and the infected susceptibility, and also a probability of contact between a susceptible infected side, but really occur the infection. So, that is descriptive and for that parameter that describes. Parametro que describe this la transmission of the infermed transmission. So in epidemiologia, it is very important to identify these parameters, beta, and gamma, gamma, and recuperation of a infected treatment, and how we must have the number reproductive basic effect. This really cuando really observes a epidemiological object, or not, and more velocity. Velocidad enamos biendo que la informedad está propagando. In these graphics, we are learning, because they are a solution of these systems of differential ordinaries where we know or study a population of 1 people, we will see with a infected person, erosion recuperados, the task of transmission of the infirmadada especially, the task of recuperation is. One sobre, in promotion, a person recovering in sixteen years. So, using this parameter, our numerous reproductive effective products are a point 35, whatever, in promoted people infected, producing a 35,000 infections. When I say a simple epidemiological aqueous qualitative form of solution, Horma qualitative solution of the numerous people infected people who have especially champagne, so we are distinguished when we are observing on the epidemic. Well, utilizing this type of systems of differential systems, so we can utilize everything that we have solutions, the stationaries, the bifurcation, and all that types of people that we. Of course, we have different ordinaries, and we can see very interpreted in the ambit of salute, between the basic reproductive room, also explicitly, what is the solution of recovery in the time that reality is infected, we obtain alternative epidemiological. Termino de epidemiological. Other candidates for employees the maximum, the maximum number of people and affected people that we observed in this type of simulaciones and also other candidates, like maximum people, hospitalized people. Okay, good. Okay, well, we have the model canonical model, and the model canonical model forces studiar different informed, how the dengue is here in this diagram, representing the mechanism of transmission of the virus dengue between distinctions in this case, we have the human beings and the vectors or the mosquitoes. So, when I say models deterministas, Model determinists and mechanistic models because we have raised how transmission of the virus between us. So, in this diagram, what this representing is the dynamic between the vector and a infected person. So, if we have a vector capacity of the virus, when injecta or pica una So, injecta or pica una persona, there is a probability of this vector to the virus, there is a lap of tien points that have the virus dentro, in pieces of virus a proliferarse, promedio battard, more 50 so that the mosquito infected, the infectious, capacity transmitter el virus have a person. When you are the pique, and one is that the virus is entropy human. The virus is between the human beings who are the virus proliferating between the cuercuman and the person infected and a infectious person. So we know as the period of incubation. Well, we have occurred the process the mechanism of transmission of the infirmed between hospitals and also we can replant or distribute. Replant or destribir to grand razors with this system of differentials, where we don't have the classes of people expuestas, but here is super important because we have two different scales of time. In promedio, live already trained, but a person promised living this year, super important. So, that is here super important introducing the time of incubation or the classes of expuestas, and more dynamic vaccine. The dynamic for the human dynamics, we have the susceptible people, expuestas, infected, requiperadas, but for the population of the mosquitoes, expuestos, infectados, and no tenemos a recovery. So, it is not the question number one describe that the rapids with observable. When we are observing the new infections, this directly proportional with the number of people susceptible. But this function lambda, however, infection, here we are characterizing how the infection. Valcorré unfection, when we have this contacts between people susceptible, and vectors infected, the probability of a susceptible con. A susceptible 5 mosquito infected, one sobre chambie que cura la transmission de la enfirmed, but with this termino que represent the candidate from medio y unos quito puede pictar la una una persona. So, there is nosotros empe termas characteristicas de mechanismo de transmission de una informedad. Okay. Okay. Well, we are resolving a system of differential systems. We have to determine what they will do the values of our metros, our conditions initial conditions, but here much of the mosquito is very sensible to the climate conditions. So in these graphics, how the time of mosquito changes with respect to the temperature and Temperature, and also how this period of incubation, the time that the tomb, the virus, in proliferate the mosquito, también is a time or a parameter, which depends on the temperature. And what we are guide is not a relation una one, and no este are curbs the form that depends. For example, the time maximum or the climate maximum of the mosquito has a majority. That the majority of 30 years, our interests, many studios, how will it be relaxed between these two parameters, if these two parameters also con respect the temperature, but this model determinista, having no. Determinista, having the question of what their unidentities build a brothel for their climate conditions promptly in that year, interventure, and that passes and our incrementamos, three great integrated climate conditions, how evolution of the number of infected people. So, these locations like that. So, this is what we have in this type of model we have these types of questions, which pass here. That is why we are our model, we have the simulation of numeric simulations, and we have to temperatures promise the simulacions in the riga, my queue. Parte, my trash queenamos, tres grados integrados in the promedo, we are what are the values of the parameters associated to that new realization of temperatures for our model and that we have. So, super interesting that for the lugars of Los Angeles and Houston, if a growth purdue incrementamos la temperature, we are. The temperature we are going to see more numerous people infected people. But it is here for Miami, what we observe is that the maximum infection reduces. Yes, so here what we are the transmission of many of the temperature that we have with collaborators. With collaborators from Fred Hodge, particularly with the children, and invite this ten problem that is a model that meads to determine or two protocols of distribution of vacunas. So this is my parallel vamos model two protocols of distribution of vaccines for the COVID-19, where we. Where we are that we have a candidate that vaccines that we distribute in a nation with two protocols of vaccination, in first protocol, is that we are vaccinated with boosters. And that is very personal, we will inject with two doses, or our segment protocol of vaccination is with first doses. The question will be. So, that we are a model of deterministic study, the idea in groups of data groups, because we are the unpup uniform for all the population. So, first, So, first of all, in 5 groups, one is that we have our 5 groups of data groups, stratification organizations in classes of susceptible, expuests, recovery, or hospitalized, very because the two indices or candidates that also observe how evolutionary evolution control. Well, then here in this simulation what is presented. What is this presentation? The simulacions that we para Afghanistan is the values of the parameters associated with countries, their queen, a number of people. But what is that simulation in 60s? And we preguntamos observamos que pasaba y tratar. If we are optimized, also our strategy, and our numerated two. And what is there are the numerous faculties in the cumulative colour that we have vaccinated the protocol of distribution of numerous variables, and vajo protocol of distribution of numerous doses. So here we are, that the numeros are more. No, no, seem. Well, disculpo la strategia que reduce en numero de personas very strategía pupa se que es strategia la uno es este protegiendo lomas que puedas atu poplación. Okay, the two que es este primeras dosis. Aha. La estratega enumero dos estrimeras dosis que cuando nos otros tratamos de protegera todos mundo, nomo mi transmas protejamos estamos reduciendo muer. So thatos los resultados y bueno y les ejo. Yempeamos perdon semos vidomensional eso que empeamos a. We are vidamentional eso queamos a distributor vaccine of adults, las more niños, así como la mayoría de los countes due ziro. Exactly. Claro aquí notamos haciendo un problema de optimización. What we are having a group CDC cues now is plants, a About plantiaris now a problem of the optimization of distribution of vacunes if you want to reduce porjempru-infections, or if you want to reduce hospitalizations. So, there are not necessarily vulnerabilities, but proteger will give more interactive. Mass interactive, more transmitted informed queens are convenes. But in this we are more encountering probability of transmitting infrastructure, but it is super interesting to see that management indirect management reducing. Reduce a mixture of infections, but not necessarily reducing very contact.  Of a yo est contact with their control, so there is the probability of transmission of the infermed translation a contagion. That matrices of contagion, we are constantly not respecting time, but there is interest. What consideramos because our simulation is on 6 meses, considering that vase correct a protocol distribution of vaccines and a period of cortex, no, no. The principal objective of this model is facilitating or the countries subdued without necessarily with an infinity of vaccine and not necessarily with this type of software. So, this aquí esteem is software, which can utilize a little economic basic epidemics.  But if we don't get a analysis of this, no que pass areas and other people move the parameters. You can see respectual time, effectively, when we are alerts of a broad pandemic, because we are mentality change and change.  And well, we also consider very biennial community. If it is here, but we don't have data, not for estimates we are in reality a person of maintenance in munitions. So, there is also hypotheticals, one idea, and good, but here is much work for you. Poor what matrices of contact variables with respect to a porque with classes not changed from groups of data groups, including vulnerabilities or infections with morbidities, no consideradas in this type of modelage, but there are many investigation and goods to do the collaboration, data, and this. Data and this type of ideas, where other interiorly, because nobody will live this type of situations, but there are more data there, so many costs that are bienvenidas to study this type of problem. Biences, what we can do is model the total determinists, one of them with parameters, nosotros. Parametros, nos other simulacions, and if we don't pass. So, what is a quick los data, data that can say a little bit? So, here when we group, in particular, their work with NIC, NIC, is the proposed order established epidemic, otoenera pandemic. This epidemic pandemia remains that you can decir if only observando una fraction of people infected that you can say what is affection, for example. And well, it is super interesting because it's like that. No, as in this, in our podium, in Boston, February, and not per tuba y vas nosa because this pandemic can be. Because this pandemic can be many infected people who have a strong symptom of this superior infection. So, supervisors in this area that are infected. So, we have this studio, we are going to use data, and we determine what number of people infectious people, and well, for all things that we experiment, we can see the magnitude of the language. The magnitude of the infirmary, because we have characteristic biennial symptoms of infirmity, and this and the asymptomatic symptoms that initially contribute to the order 200% of the infections. And what we have: well, we're going to suponer queen a model classic mode of this type of susceptibility infected, that we are describing as evolutionary. We are describing as an evolution an evil region, the transmission of the infirmary transport, but we are modeling the observables. Yes, because we are not susceptible to guilds, which is decirvent what observando, the task, the rapidity with this observando new infections, reality is a proportion of what is occurring. If the rapidity with infections, and well, utilizing this hypothesis. Utilizing this and vajo la population, with that construction nuestro determinist, and what we have data to estimate this fraction of people infected. Sentences here, the cases of infectades that can report to unidospher. For example, in the basic world of Saludia, in a period of observation of 2020. So we have the crudes in assulating and the curb roja is a promise of us. So we have to suave the data, that is not much. So, here we go from series of time, these series of time, these data, this smooth, notadas for the escutchoo, established and managed, or if we have a promise of cadacious ideas, or a promise of one, so that is an interval of time. However, that is what this described in this lamina. Well, then I have data voyages to study these data with a statistical model, and observando data can be a abinomail. We have a negative abinomial, because we don't need our data. This parameters represent. Parametro represent the insertion, and we have in the data. And well, here in this equation, what we are saying is the valor of our infections reported in my interval of time, is directly calculated by the solution of my differential equation ordinary. Here is the link where we Triemos, our differential systems that me describe the process of transmission of the informed transmission with misattacks, that, for example, in what presentation is mauricio, it is a dice, trotting our predictions, where dependency data, but also here the mechanics of traffic. The mechanic of transmission of the transmission. So that pad to this type of connections. And well, I know that we have to calculate our valor, we have our statistical model, utilizing our structure of value structure, we have the maximum vertex military, because if they are familiar, our pupil is optimized. Optimizar esta function with respect to our parameters and in this case the passage of transmission of the infirmades, veta es la fraction of cases that are observed to parameters associated with the data and well in our maximizar utilizar technical calculo, but in this type of estimations or predictions, we also estimate the infertilizum in our predictions. So, we process the parameters that mejor me van estimate my data. This is the algorithm of cadences to metropolis, where we have our space of possible values of our parameters, and so we are algorithms. We are algorithm where we are all the combinations of these parameters or a probability function that is the measure density with satisfaction. So, in this graphic that we are doing, corresponding results you see the bases of all these unidashes, what they do, and what we are doing is here. For example, the fraction of cases observable infections with the transmission of the infermed transmission, when the rival and the documentation also distributions marginal distribution of associated parameters, and because that I wanted to do, I wanted to say, So we can analyze different various data, and we are counting American countries. Americanos, our unidos, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and our data, we are going to transference in contramos the marginal distribution and what is present here: the values obtained for the media, the values of credibility, in 205% to our module.  Identifiability. Yes, por estas observacions, but we are here to make the first observations. Effectively, our model is a model. Our model is a very sensitive model, the task of transmission is constant, the fraction of observation is constant, but in the past of this model is that the applicant, I think, the data in a model and rejoicing. And if there are many consistency, that our model is that really the initiative of the epidemic was in reality the Because the mask that represents this pandemic can be very intrinsic in the informed pandemic, not this mentality of all red. But if there are many things that are condiendo veta, and that there is a more para mijora esto, no, to say really the gene between cultures can also be the evolution of a panel. It can be a evolution of a pandemic, no. So, one solitas. This is good. They are more. It is more, and what can this be? Okay, and the transmission is per consistent transmission: very incidental countries, more Peru is the unique observando more propagation of the intermediate. This Mexico and Peru are the countries that are reporting in cases. This variability in the data source is different. Different queen, so we can change, what we can do to do a function. Because also, I know that this change and apply and obtain results, no, no, this presentation is perfect in this article, we have changed the reports with respect to time. And there are And generalization can be. Where we optimize this function, and what we can do is possible values of maximizing probability. But in verse, we are digital if I say, but no. So we have this type of inference. Okay, no, what I told them are datos. I estimando the values of the parameters, not observo. So, it is a partir of observable, yo, estoy estimando pueles es fraction, de casos que si es están observando de no gas infections. Exacto, sí. Es secto, siences este estáido, no se como como es como yo valido mimodelo. Y sí o ser esto traí, tú me dices como tú vemos, no. But this report, but this type of dependent. But this type of thinking that I think we have very clear as mathematics of my hypothesis: this mimodo and this location. When we are saying, because I don't want to say that, if Mexico is reporting, having with colleges here in medicine, because in Mexico, there is a supercesgo. What is reporting is practicing. What is this reporting es practicamente? What seven hospitals? There is no air esteem to verify in the community. So here, if there are a superceso, it is what we communicate in, but these are conclusions.  Of the infection, an oblational population, no and good interest that you can decide what I say are epidemic, typical campaigns that can be used in our people and infected people in this type of information. And so, that is what this is doing, proponent of a model. This is a model type susceptible infected or recoverable. One is that my models others will consider that the recovery in promotion when people infected disdainfully. My objective is to valor estate transmission and determine the numerous infected people to conservation that we have. Okay, so this great system susceptible infected or infected, but studio como is the relationship between the datos that have reported in the plants of residuals. How relax the dataset of these residuals with numerous infected people and work. Infectadas and workiendo la position more simple voyage for candidates, genetic sequences, observadas in a pote subca dado que yo, seque hay, y subca personas infectios, esta directly proportion with numerous infections. I feel that this is like the hypotheses more or simple suponer que 6 relations between this. That this relationship between two candidates. Now, how people impact people, this degree is because I have my dynamic model, agreed a error that depends on an interior observation, and well, we have a model for studying infected people to biotilizar a natural logistrib to this model. To model the data, here we have more changes of scale in these vases of data, but here we are observing in the concentrations of genetic copies, there is a scale, it is also very rapid, for example in this curb, polarized, marino. Polorazul, Marino, Lord, is the space that the Grárfís que estánroja es nordende de altrador de es la siete. So, here much variability in our products depending on the study of the facility of lugar soilizar una logarithmo naturar. Outra este. Outrages of ours queremos utilizar what we are observing in the past. So, that will be resolved in systema differential ordinaries, but the resolving pork interval of time in the data of the form that misconduct initials vanir chambiendo cada esque cones codatos, pueste vuye pegando lo que conos con es una idea de lo que no. With a idea of what our utilizar data of the passage. So, that is what we have different ordinaries to recalibrate with my data passes. So, my estimation is not yet deterministic, my stochastic model in which the function of maximum vertical maximum, and the interest that I. Santiagora was that I know a based on numerous infections. So, that is here not super intended, the tamos as a parameter, and the voyage estimates utilizing what are the data that provides residuals. And here is ours, no que les estoy must ensure. What is this in these graphic, and that the predictions of our model in assumption are the data in negative, so the median of our estimations, and what this is from the estimations. So, here this model fitting with us, the part. So, here we are seeing this kind of reflection, what we have in the data with the infected person, so without super important that we have here a retracement, not necessarily when. When this is how very no data decimals, so the data provens of residuals can be like an early warning. Or two in hospitals, or the data in our types of cars. Y, lo derivas are the personas infected that we have our model and not observables. Yes, for ideas like we validate, no. We have no idea not to validate because we have no people infected there. Or not possible have these data in our vase data, because we have people infected, that we are symptoms that are not possible. Symptoms that are possible to monitor, so here a utilizar bases of data serology, a vision. A via I presented not necessarily our data. But if you could format validado, what create our department can utilize reports that we have from this type of vase of data where in this area, and if they continue to lash and we have related queue in if you are in firm, and that. And we have no work of this type of study. And then, in eso, we are like effectively the number of people and we don't have this period of observation. Look no in this period of observación. Because.  Yes. However, that is the question that I go to have a model that parcel information. So data information utilizes cases of infected people now that live in the residuals, how do we really go to misestimations, mispredictions that vaccine investigations, but to connect, and not how to utilize different. To utilize differential ordinaries, and I don't know how deterministic to fluy, the number of genetics in our cities that consider degradation of the data, there for the hydraulic cases. So, that is an area where I live, but super interesting for the meeting.   So, first, first, I want to see that with my basic and there are moving, but consistency. Really, I modeling what I do as trampoo, because I've seen simulo changes initial simulation, change my condition, and change my condition. But also good passing more, but for predictions, human beings also don't like how dynamic and decided in a very local stability, or not, but in this case, okay. I think that the mathematics we are converting with people who are. Logos, people who are in 50 de la salud, or there are many things that are all much that other simulations numeric simulations don't bring rapidism as to simulate different. Because what really is a passa constant of transmission of the infirmed transmission, the We lament with cubic polynomials, or what we are inferior, these parameters or constants of our lineal combination, using this type of note. And well, we are producing this type of graphics type, this representing here the effective reproductive product, which in reality is the version of the reproduction basic, but also with respect to time. And well, this type of model can be about. Modelación can curb, where we describe this more real, what is the transmission of the informed por COVID. If it is, and this with their own mathematical model, we utilize this type of model to attack problems that surgery in epidemia. And well, there are many questions: the data that we have different data in different lugars, hospitals, all this social network. So, there are many opportunities of work. There is some razor because the methods that. Por la que los methos que usan encedecidemas en los alamos no involupre en technical. Ah, es que so yo, because bien el grupo de machine learning group, but I think I comene studiar postémicas raís del COVID sinue. So I incorporate all this, but in reality, the people will be secure in machine learning. Machine learning is this. So, we are using models statistics, having inference. Machine learning has to change this language, where it is incorporating great vases. That is what I understand, but not yet experts in machine learning or intelligence and artificial intelligence. But if not comparable as when we are in response, in this university, it was much financially, and the people utilized all the recourse to one of these invert in structures of this type. The recollection of data in the plant stratadors of Aguano, but if continued, this is one of the objectives that medicine is very utilid so that the government doesn't financially in this analysis of this type of data. Well, Italian. Well, and Italian continues with the conversion of this. And we continue 50.
