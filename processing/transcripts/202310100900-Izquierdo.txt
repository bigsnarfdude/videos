Here. So this is a survive talk. So I will try to cover a certain number of results concerning this topic. And then John Carlo will give a more research talk about what they did in this context in our last article. So the goal in this talk is to study how Geoffentine properties of fields are related to their homological properties. So by Geoffentine properties, I mean So, by Geoffentine properties, I mean studying typically rational points, homogeneous varieties over fields. And cohomological properties, I mean the Galvest cohomology of the field. And to start, I will begin by introducing two instances of this relation. So, two instances of this relation. So the first one will be without low degree hypersurfaces. And well, the starting point here is a very naive idea that if you're working over a field and you take an equation in a large number of variables and of no degree, well, it has more chances of having sol having solutions, right? Having solutions, right? So Artin and Lange formalized this by introducing the following definition. So Artin and Lange, this is in the 1950s. So you take K a field and I a non-negative integer, and then we say that K has property C. Has property CI if, well, whenever you take X in P and K, a projective hypersurface of degree D and with the inequality d to the I smaller or equal to none. Smaller or equal to n, so this is the inequality telling you that you are looking at an equation of low degree and large number of variables. Well, then it's automatically as a rational point. Okay, so maybe let's see some examples to understand a bit better this uh notion. So the first example is uh uh the most uninteresting one, but I still should give it. I still should give it. It's the case of C0 fields. Well, it's an easy exercise to check that K is C0 if and only if K is algebraically close. These are, in some sense, the most simple fields from an arithmetical point of view. A second more interesting example is a theorem you probably know, which is called the Chevalier-Warning theorem. Theorem and it is about finite fields. So, this is in 1935. And it states that finite fields are a C1. So this is simply done by a simple computation, I mean looking at uh counting points on hypersurfaces with a fine fit. On hypersurfaces with a finite field. It's just a counting variable. A third example is a transition theorem, so typically a theorem that tells you that if you know that some fields are Ci, then you can deduce that some of their extensions are Cj for some j's. And well, this is the Nagata theorem. So this is from 57. 57 and it is stated as follows. So if you have k, the field which is Ci, and you have an extension k prime of transcendence degree delta, well then you can deduce that k prime is c i plus delta. Okay. Final example I'll give. Final example I'll give today is another transition theorem, this time for formal power series. So, this one is due to Greenberg and it is from 1966. So, if k is a Ci field, well then we can deduce that the Levant series, one variable over k, is Ci plus one. Ci plus 1. So here is a surprising situation in number theory where the local statement, this Grinberg's theorem, is in fact harder than the somewhat global one about function fields. Essentially, it's deduced from the Zen-Banner-Magetta theorem. Anyway, these are some positive examples. Of course, there are fields that do There are fields that do not satisfy the CI properties, and well, you know, at least one of them. So, counterexamples. Well, the first counterexample, which is not very interesting, but that has to be mentioned, is the real numbers, right? R is not Ci for all I, right? Just because the sum of squares is non-negative. Class is non-negative. You can, of course, say the same argument whenever you take a subfield of R or when you take an ordered field. A second counterexample, which is a bit more interesting, is that of p-adic fields. So p-adic fields. Well, Ortin conjectured that p-adic fields would be C2, but got it wrong. In fact, we'll have the In fact, we'll have theorems due to Techena first. So, this is in 1966, and then it was improved by Achtipov, Javatsuba, and Alemu which gave that, well, the addict fields are not only not Or not only not C2, if they are not CI for any fields, are not CI for all I. Okay, so this is very classical material. And now, well, as I told you, I want to relate these kind of Geophysline properties of fields to the homological properties. And, well, if you look. And, well, if you look at the examples, the positive examples you all have here, well, you see that these CI properties tend to behave in a very similar way to a cohomological invariant, which is a cohomological dimension. So just to remind things. Sorry, do I recall it properly that the contact examples all have even degree? I think they all have even degree. I think they all have different yes, it's it's yeah correct just uh just to to to remind the homotical dimension field K for me will be the maximum of the integers n such that there exists a finite Galoft module m over k such that the nth Such that the nth copy group with values in n is non-zero. Okay, so this was the classical definition. It works well when we're working with perfect fields. If you go to imperfect fields, it does not work well anymore. One needs to modify it. But I don't want to get into that technical things. Okay, so we have this graphomological dimension. Now we can come back to our examples. So here, Examples. So here, if you're in the algebraically closed case, the cohomological dimension is zero. For finite fields, the cohomological dimension is one. In the context of the Ten-Lang-Nageta theorem, well, the cohomological dimension of k prime is bounded above by the cohomological dimension of k plus delta. Finally, in the context of bringing. Finally, in the context of Grinberg's theorem, the cohomological dimension of the Lorentz series field, k double parenthesis c, is the cohomological dimension of k positive. And when you see this, well, you get the feeling that there should be a deep relation between the CI properties of fields and the homological dimension of fields. So the naive question in my task. Might ask is whether, in fact, these two questions are equivalent. So, in the sense that k is ci, if and only if the homological dimension of k is at most i. It's that naive because quite quickly you can convince yourself that this is completely wrong, and there's already a counterexample to that on the blackboard. It's here, even by the PID. Here, even by pianic fields, right? Piadic fields have cohomological dimension 2, but we saw that they are not C2. So the implication from right to left here is wrong. And so the answer example is given by the addictions. There's still the other direction, right? Whether if a field is CI, can I deduce if It use if the cosmological dimension is at most fine, right? And well, this was a question raised by Seth in his book, About Galax Cophomology. And well, we have answers in some situations. So the case i equals 1 is easy, it's a small exercise and it works. The case i equals 2 is much more. I equals 2 is much more difficult, but it is also known. This is a theorem due to Susan. This is in year 85. Plus, if you go to imperfect fields, it's also due to Gill in 2000. This is for imperfect fields. So that works. So that works. It's some step in the proof of the Loch Ketter conjecture. And then, well, in the case i greater or equal to 3, the problem is still widely open. So i great 343 still widely open and the And the best result known until today is due to fashion and mat3. So what does it tell us? Well, it tells us that whenever you take P prime and well then there exists a constant Cp greater than 1. Constant Cp greater than 1, such that for any field K that is Ci, well the peak homological dimension of K can be bounded by Cp times I. So maybe here, just for those who are not familiar with this P cohomological dimension, the definition is the same as the cohomological dimension. As the coherent dimension, but it's just that we require here that M is P torch. Of course, this gives a bound that is linear in I, but the constant Cp goes to infinity as P goes to infinity, so it does not give a bound of the cosmological dimension in itself. Okay, so this is a general picture of what happens with these low-degree types of surfaces. Are there any questions until here? Can you repeat, sorry? What is the example that the transcendence recognition reminds us of? Um sorry, the CI dimension, the molecule dimension reminds us of. So you said less than or equality, right? Yes, less than. Oh, well, there's not equality in general. Well, for example, you take real numbers and complex numbers. Okay, so this is for low-debris hypersurfaces. The other instance I want to show you. The other instance I want to show you about these relations between Jeff and Tein fields and quartical dimension is about homogeneous spaces. Homogeneous spaces. And more precisely, I want to talk about Self's conjecture one and Self's conjecture two. So you probably are, most of you, familiar with that, but let me recall. With that, but let me recall. So, Sales conjecture one says that if you have a field that has a cohomological dimension atmos one, well, then every I think the original conjecture was for principal homogeneous spaces, but one can remote principle here. It's a principal homogeneous space. Space under a connected linear group has a rational point. So this is called Salt's conjecture one, but it's not a conjecture. But it's not a conjecture. It's in fact a theorem. So this is the theorem which is due to Steinberg and Springer. Here is 1966 and here while Steinberg is for the principal case and Schwenger by developing monopoly. Developing non-abelian second degree cohomology solved the, I mean, removed the condition of being principal, so non-principal. So that's for Salves conjecture one, which is for fields of harmological dimension at most one. If it's Salf's conjecture one, imagine there's a Salves conjecture two, which is about fields of cosmological dimension at most two. So sales. So sales conjecture two says that if the cohomological dimension of k is at most two, well then principal homogeneous spaces under semi-simple simply connected Simply connected algebraic groups, over k, half rational points. This time, it is a real conjecture, it's not known in general, but there's quite important progress that gets There's quite important progress that has been done since it was stated. So, in which cases is it done? Excuse me, this is stated for perfect fields only? Initially, yes. But one can with the modification of the definition of copomology and cosmological dimension for imperfect fields, this also should hold for imperfect fields. So, So this is known for a certain number of groups, so for groups of types, first the classical types, so A n, En, C N, G N, and here I remove the trialitary case. Also for I four, For F4 and for G2. So these are results due to Bayer Fuquider and Parmala. In the perfect field case, that's in 95. 95 and in the imperfect field case, this was done by Derry, Friggs, and Signor in the imperfect case and that's in two thousand oh seven. A in one is used in a previous system. Yes, correct. AN1 is essentially a Mercury system. Okay, but the first case AN1 is Mercury system. Thank you. Yes? And in those cases, is principle important or not? Yes. Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay, so this is Okay, so this is essentially the results we know concerning the different types of groups one have. One may also look at the question for specific fields. And so there are results in that direction. So over specific fields. So for example, it is known for complete discrete validation fields. Validation fields. This is due to TIT. I think it's in, I think they're around 84. It is also known for, well, totally imaginary number fields. So here I put totally imaginary just to get cohomological dimension 2. Dimension two, okay. So this was done by Knezer, Arder, and Charlotte Zov. So here, Knezer was the classical grips. Powder was the exceptional greps, but not the eight and Charms was the Eps. Mostly e-pills. And maybe for the years, so we have 69 for Knezer, 75 or harder, and 90 for Chernusaf. Which is, I think, was done by Fnezer first, and then Briatis did not. Yes, exactly. You know about perfectness, what is disturbing Briatis because they have a But it's they uh have assumptions that the residue must be per perfect. I asked Ed, but no one can say me what's going when the residue is not perfect in Bietica? Yeah, right probably it's true, but I don't know. Maybe here yeah with perfect residue field. I think the older fields or simple discrete valuation fields. I mean, multiple dimension actually one, of course, so that it falls into the conjecture. And maybe a last example of research. A last example of results in this direction. We also know reconjecture for function fields of C double parentheses T curves and finite extensions of the Laurent series in two variables. The Laurent series in two variables, C double parenthesis xy. So this is due to Cohutel, Gile and Palmala in 2004. Okay, so here you have two examples of situations in which rational points are in some sense controlled by Are in some sense controlled by the topological dimension of fields, right? And now, well, which questions could we ask? So we have here maybe two main questions. So the first question one may ask is whether one can modify the CI properties so that they do characterize the cohomological dimension. Dimension, right? They don't, we would like them to, and so when we try to modify them so that they characterize cosmological change. That's the first question. The second question is: well, if you look at the second example about homogeneous spaces, it deals with fields of cosmological dimension at most one. Of cohomological dimension at most one or two, well, whether one could do things in that mood and in that spirit, but for higher cohomological dimension fields. So, how to modify SALS conjectures for higher cosmological dimension. Cosmological dimension fields. Okay, so here the first question was first raised by Katoan Kuzumaki in the 1980s and they tried to solve it. They tried to modify these CI properties to characterize cohomological dimension. So I'm going to present now their own conjectures. Conjectures. So that's the second origin of my into. So Kato and Kuzomakis. Conjectures. Okay, so their idea is to, well, if you see what we've seen, I mean the If you see what we've seen, I mean the CI properties and the sales conjectures, they talk about the existence of rational points. And the idea of Kato and Kuzumaki is to weaken that, to weaken the existence of a rational point and replace it by a weaker condition. Which condition? Well, it's a condition that is related to the ideas that come from zero cycles. And to state them, I need to use Melody theory. So again, I Theory. So again, I imagine most of you are familiar with that, but very quickly, to be sure that everyone is on the same page, recall that the Q-Milnoch degree group field K is defined to be C if we are in to be zero. And then in higher degree, you just take K star, you take the Q called tensor product of K star, and in there you mod out the pure tensors, X1, XQ. One xq such that there exists two different entries that add up to one. Okay, so we have these grips that are associated to our field K, and there's a bunch of structures that come with these Milnon K-theory grips. In particular, the one I will need is the existence of normal maps. maps. So they are entered with normal maps. So whenever I take L over K, a finite extension, well, I have a normorphism and L over K that goes from the Qth Milner K theory per Cafell to the Qth Milnar K theory of K. Of course, it satisfies a certain number of properties. It's not at all obvious to come. Properties. It's not at all obvious to construct this. This is due to Cato in 1980. And of course, this norm can be well understood. It's very easy to understand. It's a low degree. So for q equals 0, well the norm goes from c to z and it's just multiplication by the degree. And for q equals 1, for q equals 1 the norm goes from l star to u star and it's just the usual norm okay so we have all this structure and now I can introduce the first definition that Carton is automatic and sidelines and that will help us to relax this condition on rational points. So the gas mission, which is due to Kato Nenjikuzumaki in 1986. So you take Q greater or equal than 0, that's the degree of our Milner K theory, and you take Ix of the K of R I D. And well done, you introduce the norm breadth. Introduce the norm group nq of x over k. So this is a subgroup of the q's normal k theory of k. And it is the subgroup that is spanned by the images of the norms on Kilofmel-Norm k-theory. Of course, I'm going to look at finite extensions L over K, but I will not take all of them. I will only take those finite extensions over k. There's how many extensions over which x acquires a rational point. This is their definition of the normal groups. Maybe let's see some examples to try to understand this button. The first example is to look at what happens in degree zero. So if they take q equals zero, well, the n zero Well, the n zero of x over k, well, this is the subgroup of the integers that is spanned by the images of the norms, but the norms here are multiplication by the degree. So, it's the subgroup spanned by all the degrees of extensions over which x applies as a rational point. So, this is just the subgroup of z spanned by the GCT of all those degrees. This number has a name. It's called the index of x. Here you already see how zero cycles appear in this context. Second example that is good to understand, I mean it is very easy. Understand, even if it is very easy, it's the case where x is just a point. So x is a spec L for L over K a finite extension. Okay, well, what is then the N cube of X over K? Well, the extensions over which X acquires a rational point are those that contain L. So this is just the image of the norm coming from L. This is the image of the norm now from L to K. From Alex OK on killed milk A3. And maybe I can show you a last example of such normal grips. Third example. Third example, I will take X as the Heribra variety corresponding to a central simple algebra A. Well done. What is the n1 of x over k? That is the subgroup spanned by the images of the norms k star. norms k star coming from extensions over which x is a rational point. This is just the image of the reduced norm of our central sample A inside B star. Okay, so now we have these norm groups and the idea of Katon Kuzumaki was to replace the condition that there are right. That there are rational points by the condition that these normal bursts are as large as possible. This mq of x over k is the whole normal k-theory grade. So they introduced the following definition. This is still Kato and Kuzumaki in integer 6. So we take i and q two non-negative integers. q is again the degree of the Milno K theory, but i is the same i as in the But I is the same I as in the Ci properties. Okay? And well, they say that K is Ciq if, well, whenever you take L over K, a finite extension, whenever you take X and find P and L, a projective hypersurface of degree. Of degree d with the usual inequality, so d to the i smaller or equal than i. If we were in the ci property, we would impose that x has a rational point. Here instead, we impose that the non-verb n cube of x over l is the whole minimum group aq of l. In other words, you're asking that your minimum words you're asking that your Milnochi theory grip is spanned by the images of the norms coming from extensions over which X requires a rational so maybe let's also look at some examples yes sorry I'm over sorry yes so yeah this is a bit technical but uh So, yeah, this is a bit technical, but in the CI properties, if k is CI, then any finite extension is also CI. But here, if I remove this, this would not be true. So, I need to stabilize it, but this is true. Okay so examples. And I think it's enlightening to look at the two extreme examples. Two extreme examples, i equals zero and q equals zero. So first, q equals zero. What happens? Well, remember that the n0 was a subgroup of t spanned by the index of x. And so essentially, what we are asking is that, well, for any l with k finite, for any x in p and l with the conditions that are there, well, you're asking that the index. That the index of x is equal to 1. Or if you prefer, that x has a zero cycle of degree 1. And so here you clearly see that, well, this is being C I 0, and of course. I0, and of course, this is weaker than being CR. Because if you have the rational point, you have a zero cycle of degree. The second example is the other extreme case. So we take i equals zero. What happens if I take i equals zero? Well, I look at my inequality here. T to the zero is more equal than that. It's always satisfied. So I might take n equals one. So I mean p1, projective hypothesis. In P1, projective hydro surface, is just, I'm taking an extension of out, right? It's just a point. So we are in the context of this example we together here, right? And so what we get is that the C0Q property is equivalent to saying that whenever you take the tower of finite extensions, m over L over K, well, the null map from M to L on Q's Milno K theory is Meanwhile, the theory is surjective. Sorry, so it's surjective. So here what you see is that, well, when you have low values of q and large parameters of i, these are very geothermal time properties. Whereas when you're in a situation where i equals zero, q is large, these are not really. To large, these are not really Geoffentine properties, but more K-theoretic properties. And so, in between, you have all the other CIQ properties that might be more K-theoretic or more Giophantine. Okay, so now the main observation that Catoon Kuzumaki did is proposition. So, I'll attribute it to Catan Kuzumaki, but in fact, it's so they used the So they used the Bloch-Cato conjecture, which was known at the time, and it's a quite direct consequence of Bloch-Cato. You can do it as an exercise if you want to. So they proved that the field K has the most key theoretic property, the C0Q property, if and only if the cohomological dimension of K is at most Q. Is at most skew. So this property does perhaps rough the chronological damage. Yes. Is this fact one of the reasons why Cattle conjectured cattle property, but Cattle conjecture? I guess it was conjectured before. Conjectured before, okay. So yeah, of course this is not very satisfying, because this CZRequeue property is not really Jeffaton. T is not really devoted. So we would like to see if the other CIQ properties do characterize also the cosmological dimension. That was the conjecture that was stated by Katan Kuzamaki in 86. So they conjectured that K has the Ciq property if and only if the cosmological dimension of K is at most I plus Q. In other words, In other words, if you prefer, they are saying that the CIQ property should only depend on the sum i plus q and not on the independent values of iq. However, well, Kato and Kazumaki were wrong. This conjecture is not true. This was seen a few years later by Merkoviev. So counterexamples. So the first counterexample was due to Mercury Pieff in 1990. And it is a field that has a harmonical dimension 2, but that does not have the C20 property. Then a few years later we even got a counterexample in homological dimension one. This was due to Colyotelen and Madov. In 2004, so they gave an example of a field with cosmological dimension one, but that was not C12. C10. Both of these counterexamples are constructed by a method of transpinitive induction. That, for example, in the second case, since you want to get a chromatical dimension one field, what you want is to kill the broader. So you take successive function fields of essential simple algebras. And you do that by transmitting induction in order to take all of them. And at the end, you can. And at the end, you get the field that has trivial prior curves, and you get essentially the coherent multiple-dimensional introduction, and you check that it does not satisfy the C10 prompt. How was C20 for PLV fields? I'm going to talk about it, but it's unknown. It's completely open. It's only known for prime-degree hypersurfaces. Okay, and so since these examples were And so, since these examples were constructed by transfinity deduction and you got fields that you will probably never encounter in your entire lives, Wittenberg asked the following question. It was a long time later, that was in 2015. Well, he asked whether one could prove Katoan-Kuzomaki's conjectures fulfilled. Fulfilled appearing naturally in arithmetic geometry. Of course, this notion is not well defined. There's not a notion of the field appearing naturally in arithmetic geometry, but one can understand a little bit. But one can understand a little bit what that means. So, typically, you can consider finite fields, you can consider algebraically closed fields, the addict fields, number fields, and then we might allow you to start from them and consider function fields, or wellness series fields. And this gives you already a class of reasonable fields you might look at in this context. So that's this question. And I'd like now to present a little bit what is known in that context. That's what is known in that context. So, positive results about Cartoon Prussia matters conjectures. Conjectures. Well, as Matthew asked, probably the first interesting situation one might look at in this context is that of chaotic fields and totally imaginary number fields. So chaadic and totally imaginary number fields. Okay, so these fields have cohomological dimension 2. And so what you expect is to get three properties. So you have the C20, the C11, and the C02. One of these properties is already known, say it's all too, by Katrina Kusumaki, I'm not yet a conjecture. So this one is good. And there are two remaining, C11 and C20. And as I told you, I mean, this one is the most k-theoretic one, this one is the most just time one. So the natural way is to try to first do C1 than C20 principle. The more you go towards C20, the harder it is. And the C11 property was studied by Wittenberg. This is the theorem George Wittenberg. Wittenberg in 2015. So he proved that these fields, the addict totally imaginary number fields, have property C11. How did the proof go? Well, I'm not going to do the proof in detail. Not going to do the proof in detail, but just say a few words about it. So the thing is that these CIQ properties tend to be very rigid. They only make sense when you're working over hypersurfaces of some low degree. So you cannot look at other kinds of varieties. This makes things difficult geometrically. You cannot make any debissage. You cannot take a sub-variety and try to Sub-variety and try to deduce something for your whole variety versus some of its sub-varieties and so on. And the idea of Wittenberg was, well, to modify this C11 property and, well, make it translate it in a more flexible way. So he introduced, for example, what he called. Introduced, for example, what he calls the strong C11 property, strong C11 property, which could be stated as follows. So whenever you take L over K, the finite extension, and whenever you take the proper L-scheme X, so here you see already a big difference with respect to the Katan-Cuzzmatic's properties, it's not anymore. Catten Puzzmati's properties is it's not anymore about low-degree hypersurfaces, it covers all proper schemes, essential. For any coherent sheaf E on X, well, you have the Euler-Point having characteristic of this coherent sheaf kills the quotient L sum virtual the norms. Mojave the norms and one episode. So since it's called strong C11 property, this suggests that it is stronger than the C11 property, and it is. So why? Since why it's easy to see, well, if you take X and P and K, the hydro surface of degree T smaller or equal than N, well, then Or equal to n, well, then you know that the Euler-Pointer characteristic of the structural sheet is equal to 1. And so this one should kill the quotient k star noisy than naught. If you prefer, this is telling you that naught is equal to local k star. And so this strong C11 property is indeed stronger than the C11 property, and at the same time, it makes sense when The same time, it makes sense whenever you work on a property. Then you can do déhisage by working with it. And he did some devisage that allowed him to reduce to some specific x's. He didn't need to prove his statement for all proper scheme x in the end, but only for some of them. So typically, for example, over number fields, he reduced to smooth proper schemes. When you're over PI fields, to themes that to proper schemes. Schemes that proper schemes that have nice models in some sense with the ring of integers and so on. And then you can use other kinds of tools that come typically from Carl's field theory, either local global. In the global case, he based himself in a result by Kato and Saito in 83, in which they proved. In which they prove that if X is the smooth proper K variety, while there is a local global principle in this context, for K stop modulo norms, you can send this to the same groups locally, so you make the code over all places of K. So of K these thumps. Of KD stock motor points. Okay, and this map is injected. Okay, and so his strategy, for instance, over a number field, was to introduce this strong C11 property, use the TV Sach technique to reduce to smooth proper schemes, and then, for smooth proper schemes, apply this cut-on-side result. Nice button and smooth buttons. No, uh no it's a more complicated technical conditions here. In this property, does he need all shapes or some specific shapes? So in order to be able to do the devisage correctly, you need essentially all chips. Of course you can reduce to to some generating genes and some signs, so for example the ones that come from close source elements and so on. That comes from close source satellites and so on, but it will be equivalent. Okay, so that's what's been rooted. What is K in this? Number three. K in number three. So concerning this C11 property, there This C11 property, there is one extra result to mention. So, because this local goggle principle is in fact not optimal, one can prove that it is true for many other varieties. In fact, so this was something I did in 2017. In fact, this local global principle. Holds whenever X is a k variety, not necessarily smooth, not necessarily proper. The only condition is that it contains a geometrically integral. Integral self-right. Here the proof is completely different. It comes essentially by using, in particular, the quite two-tixt duality. And to this statement, if you replace here cut and situs results by this statement, you might get another proof, the C11 property for totally imaginary number of fields that does not use the data set. Fields that do not use the data such. Anyway, so that's for the C11 property. There's still the C20 property, so the one about the zero cycles, optical one. And that one is completely open. So C20 property is open for chatic and totally natural. Totally measuring number fields. The only case known, which is due to Katan Kuzamaki, is that of prime degree hyper surfaces over the age. He had cakes. Even in the number field case, we don't know the case of prime degree hydro system. Any questions until here? Okay. So this was P-Atik and totally matured number fields. There are some other fields in which we know to grab some of the To prove some of the Kato and Kuzumakis properties. In particular, some function fields have been studied. So the first case one might look at is that of function fields of varieties over an algebraic closed field. For example, with the complex numbers. And the theorem is that it does work well, and we get It does work well, and we get all the cutting Kuzumaki's products in that context. So, function fields of complex varieties, and you can replace the complex numbers by any characteristic zero algebraical close fields, satisfy all the Katan-Kuzumaki conjectures. Kraitonicals and Mikey's conjectures. The proof of this theorem is surprisingly simple and short. But since I only have four more minutes, I may be not going to do it. And I am going to go on to my talk. So here we get all the catchment post-machist conjectures. We get all the catchment push-machist conjectures. There is one last situation that has been studied. This was in a recent article with John Casro. That's 2023, which is a situation in which we looked at function fields of the adding curves. Curves. Take K, the function field of a piadic curve. Here you are in cohomological dimension 3, right? Cohomological dimension 3. And so you expect to have the CIQ properties for i plus q greater or equal to 3. We managed to get one of them. Uh, we managed to get one of them. It's not an optimal result, but uh it's what it is. So uh so uh k satisfies the C22 property. Here the proof of this statement combines the methods used in this local global principle I show you with the quadratic tool in the answer. With the quadrotech duality and so on. So, here it's a more delicate situation in which we use a quadrotech duality for homotific cohomology and we combine it with the deficit techniques of the need to reduce to some special kinds of varieties. Okay, so I guess these are all the results that are known about the Katrin-Kuzamakis conjectures for specific things. Now, a final question one might ask. One may ask is whether one can go further and modify the Katan-Kusumakis properties so that they do characterize the homological dimension. And we're going to mix that with the idea of starting with cells conjecture one and sales conjecture two and giving higher versions of these conjectures. That's going to be the last two minutes of my talk, I guess. So migrant cells conjectures. So if you want to mimic what Kato and Kusamite did, but by generalizing Sachs conjecture one, the natural definition we may introduce. So this was introduced with Katie. This was introduced with Ken Pravalo in 2022. So we say that K is CQ HS, HS is homogeneous space. If whenever you take L over K, a finite extension, and whenever you take X, a homogeneous space. Space under a connected linear grip G of raw. Well, you expect that the norm grip nq of x of raw is equal to the q of Melnote theory quote of function. This is just the same as the CIQ properties, but you replaced the third degree high. The low-degree hyposalces by homogeneous spaces. HS, homogeneous space. Okay, so I'm finishing. So we have this definition, and this definition, well, gives a good answer to the two questions I asked, because we have the following theorem. So still within a bitch, 822. So for perfect years, we have that K is CQHS if and only if the homological dimension of K is at most Q plus 1. This was what we would have expected in We would have expected in principle for the C1A C1Q property. That's not true. You know, that's not true. But it's true with this CQHS property. So this CQHS property is a good replacement for the C1Q property. It does characterize the cosmological damage. And it is at the same time a higher version of SALS conjecture law. I'll finish with some. I'll finish with some remarks. So, I should say that this theorem also has a version for imperfect fields. Of course, for imperfect fields, you need to modify the definition of your cosmological dimension. And in the CQHS property, you should not look at all homogeneous spaces. You have problems with individuals and groups and so on. So, you have to look at principal homogeneous spaces under reductive groups. But it still works. Still works. The proof of the theorem goes by working with the groups that appear here and working with the Isage of the algebraic groups that appear here. And now that we have managed to get a higher conjecture of self-conjecture one, the question is whether one can do the same thing for self's conjecture two. And that's what Jean Gadlo is going to tell me. Thanks for this nice lecture for that, I think, for the next talk. Are there more questions, comments? What you said, very quickly, so if you replace CQHS by CQPHS for a principle, there's two weaknesses. At all. Is this too weak or is it still so? For the characterization here, it is enough. In fact, the thing is, so the hard direction in this theorem is from right to left. From left to right is easier. And in fact, you only need to look at some very specific homogeneous spaces. So, for example, it suffices to look at principal homogeneous spaces under normal tobacco, or if you prefer, it's Or if you prefer, it's sufficient to look at several bar of rights. We could think of finite field, wonder what are the points of P-Idic field, right? Finite uh unlimited extension or super QP. Are there points after all uh ext unified uh extensions? I don't have to because we're not final feed there points after all uh a zero cycle of degree one by uh points in all uh by replacing zero cycle of degree one by points over every five. Over every finite annual fine distances of high enough degree. So that would be even stronger. Okay. True, I cannot know. Since the weaker statement, I don't know if it's true. The question is whether it is false, I guess. No, I would need to think about it. There is a counter example. Oh. Definition of CI fields that I learned from Fister's book unhomogeneous one. I never understood the connection between that. So, what you know about that is that if you're a Ci, then if you take a system of homogeneous equations that have all the same degree and that satisfy any inequalities of the sum of the i-th powers of the degrees is more than variables, well, then that works out. They have a rational point of pure overflow. But if you take different degrees, then that's unknown. That's unknown. So, in this context, you can have some conditions that are satisfied by many fields, but I mean, in full generality, it's not that it's a question of having some modeling forms. I don't remember precisely what if you replace the so it is the cutter. So it is in the Catan-Plusomachi's congestions if you replace solidarity hypersurfaces by these systems of equations. So I guess the results I actually the at least most of the results I presented should also hold in that context for specific fields. So for example, if you think about Wittenberg's Truth, as I said, it can As I said, it's concerned about this strong C11 property. And so the question is: can you compute the Euler-Bohnter characteristic of, I mean, essentially final completeness of section, things like that? And then you will get also one. So that will also show you that it works in that context. So I guess here it also works: function field of the PI curve. Curve and for function fields of compact varieties, yes. It is, I do agree. But still, it's not that much flexible because the condition of the debris is very rigid. Coffee work from next stop that's it. So that's that's a good idea.
