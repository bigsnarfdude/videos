Okay, this subject of swimming attracted attention to understand how fishes and aquatic animals perform. There are many applications in ocean engineering, especially A-B, autonomous underwater vehicle. Almost underwater vehicle. So this picture is some example of AUV. You can see the size of this AUV over human size. And the right one is more larger and pretty much look like fishes. Actually, it's made by China. This AUV has many purposes, like surveillance. Surveillance and rescue somebody, and also some environmental purposes. There are different types of fishes in terms of swims in undulated form. Okay, this shaded part is an undulatory part. So, in the case of ear, so most of the body moves in undulatory form. But in the case of tuna, the undulated part is only tail. It oscillates only the tails. So, we are mainly focused on this ear-like feces. It's called angliform swimming. So, this So, this type of species propel forward by propagating variables along their bodies. This is outline of I comment some background and also I present. Also, I present an inviscid vortex. By using that, I conduct numerical simulations, vertical flow. So there are some theoretical studies at early times. The first one was by Lightheel. He presented an elongated body theory. It's called EBT. It's a well-known theory. He analyzed He analyzed added mass effect on the swimming. And right after that, Wu proposed a linearized potential theory. And he included vortex shooting effect on the model as well as added mass effect. So these two theories gave good insight on the swimming motion, but overestimate the thrust and efficiency on swimming. And efficiency on swimming. So the thrust is about twice larger than a real thrust of the swimming. So the most of work directed to numerical works. There's two different approach of numerical matter. The traditional way is that swimmer is stationary on stream. So, but in strict sense, this different from swimming freely in a still fluid, like this one, this self-profile. Because in the first case, fish moves only forward. There is no lateral or change of angle. Or change of angle. But in reality, fish experience some force in the lateral directions. So that force and that effect is not taken into account in this traditional approach. So the self-proportion, but this traditional approach is easy to implement. So yeah, people many People, many early age of numerical work are by this traditional approach. But recently, people are more interested in self-proportion. The self-proportion of numerical modeling for self-proportion is much difficult. So first attempt was done by Culling at 1998, and most of work are done after 2000. 2000. So acrid modeling is done elderly by a vortex particle. So this is in terms of Levi-Stokes equations. I use a different model. So I use a vertex shading model. Uh we consider uh this solid plate and it's moving to right, maybe. So then we have uh this leading edge vortex and training edge vortex here. We describe both body and wake as vortex sheets. So, this model was uh developed by uh Nietzsche and Krasny and John's system. Since then, this model is very popular and applied to many problems like falling current and flat and flare and harbouring and insect flight. And also, there's work on swimming by Arben, but he assumed stationary flow, which is a traditional approach, as I said. So we see, we here consider. So we see, we here consider swinging in several proportions, and we see how their difference and how extra force is important. Okay, to extend the model to a fish-like body, we assume this underlined form of fish bodies. So the body shape is a prescribed function of time. Prescribed function of time is given function, but the center of mass, center of mass and inclination angle is not prescribed. That is determined from interaction of fluid and body. So these two quantities are governed by linear and angular momentum equations. This one is just Newton's law. We consider only a trailing edge of vortex and Trailing edge vortex and neglect leading edge vortex. Okay, so this carbon equation for free vortex field, which is well-known Bokop load equations. So this gives a velocity field of free vortex field. Okay, this is Bokop Lord equations. The first term is contribution from the Contribution from the fish body and second is contribution from the free vortex. But here the shift strengths along the body and also edge circulation is not known beforehand. So that should be found in the solution procedures. So to determine these quantities, we give some conditions. We give a We give a kinematic condition, which is just a continuity of a normal velocity. So this condition gives this Cauchy type singular integral equations. A Cauchy type singular integral equation is not unique. There are infinitely many solutions. So we take So we take the solution, singular, singular at the leading edge. But we impose quota condition only at the trailing edge. So coupling uh coupling uh with the uh circulation conservation equation, we can determine uh shear strength and edge circulation uniquely. And edge circulation uniquely. Okay, we also need to know the position of center of mass and angle. So as I said, that is determined by linear and angular momentum equations. The expression of force consists of two parts, normal force, and social force. Force. The normal force comes from pressure difference along the body, and suction force comes from the infinite pressure at the leading edge. Pressure is infinite at the leading edge, but the integral of pressure over an infinitesimal small circle that keeps a finite value. So that is the suction force. So suction force is. Force. So, suction force is included. And also, the contribution from suction force is in the angular momentum equations. So, coupling this, solving this equation, with coupling with a previous equation in time derivative form, we can determine the acceleration of position and angle, and also shedding rate. And also, shedding rate. So, this is an outline of a numerical method. We use a loose quicker method. So, previous works used in previous scheme. Here we use explicit scheme, which is much easier to implement. To implement and point protect each time. Also, a point insertion procedure is applied to maintain resolution of the free voltage. Okay, for setting of an ear-like body, we give a function form for the linear function times sine wave. Sine wave. So this gives like this time snap, snapshot of this ear-like body. So front part moves only a little. The tail moves more. Actually, the scale of X and Y is different, and Y is much enlarged. So this amplitude is much smaller in reality. Small in reality. So I show the result of simulation. Okay, fish go slightly and swim to the left and generate a pair of anti-rotating vortices called vortex street. Strength of vorticity actually weak in the upstream. Weak in the upstream and stronger at the downstream. So, this type of vortex is called reverse von-Kalman vortex street. So, it's different from standard von-Kalman vortex street because, in this case, the rotating direction is different. Standard one rotate this way and this way, but here, upper one rotate count curve. Upper one rotate counterclockwise and lower one rotate clockwise. So, in most thrust-generated motions, this kind of reverse von Karma street is produced. Okay, this is for this field and streamline. For this this is one cycle. This is one cycle. In the middle of downstroke, it generates voltages of counter-rotating. This way, it rotates this way. And in the upstroke, it generates clockwise rotating vortices. For a streamline, in the middle of downstroke, you can see this circular type streamlines. And this circular streamline is. And this circular streamline is enlarged at the end of the stroke. So, also, see some enclosed streamlines in the front. So, this is comparison with the Navier-Stokes equations for Reynolds number about 5,000. So, after the first cycle of stroke, you can see this diaper here. This dipole here and it's similar. So at the finite time T7, we see seven pairs of vortices and also that is quite similar. So this is trajectory of center mass and angles. As we saw, the center of mass slightly goes up, goes up, and also you can see its oscillations. Also, you can see these oscillations. That means fish move forward and also the oscillations in the lateral directions. Also, there's oscillations in the angle. Angle, when fish moves, it changes the angle slightly. So we need to here we consider lateral translation also. Also, angle change of angles, and we will see how these two effects are important. This prediction for forward velocity and lateral velocity. At early time, forward velocity increases rapidly and converts to some stationary values. And we compare with Navier-Stokes simulation for NANCA area 5. 5. This is NACA 16, 12, and 4. The number of NACA means as the number reduced, the thickness of L5 is reduced. So this means as the thickness is reduced, there is a convergence to our value. In our model, the thickness of body is infinitely thin. So there is a consistency. Consistency. So if you look at the rotary velocity, it oscillates uniformly oscillates. But this quantity, the rotary velocity is not that negligible quantity. It's very large. This is circulation, edgy circulations. We can see the peak at early time and also uniformly oscillates. This is forward force and a lateral force. Ford force, there is a negative peak at early time in the forward force. This indicates that rapid growth of forward velocity at early time. So in both lateral and forward force oscillate uniformly, but interestingly, the amplitude of lateral force is larger than forward force. The force. The mean of this oscillation is almost zero. Okay. Okay, so we consider three different swimming motion. The third one is free swimming, which we already saw. In the first one, we assume there's no rater or angular. There's no lateral or angular motions. So it only moving forward. So the second one, second, we allow lateral translation, but there is no motion in angular way. So we can see the many differences among these three flows. Three flows. The first difference is that the traveling distance is different. The longest traveling distance is the second one, angular constraint. So smallest traveling distance is the first one, constraint in lateral in angular direction. So the as well as traveling distance, another difference is that the The another difference is that the structure of voltages. This vortex strength is in the first case, we see very strong voltages of reverse bond karma time. But in second one, the intensity of vorticity is reduced. And also almost this is almost aligned vortices, not the reverse one. Reverse one. The third one, the intensity is more reduced. So there is a difference in the three different swimming styles, but the second one travels a largest distance at the same time. So does that mean the second one is the most efficient swimming? No, because we don't know. No, because we don't know how much energy and input power is needed in this case. So we need to consider the efficiency of swimming, we need to consider input power and input power also. So to measure the energy efficiency, we consider cost of transport for the COT. So this is the ratio of mean input power. Of a mean input power to forward velocity. So the less input power is needed and but generate a large forward velocity. Then this COT value is pretty low, but that means very efficient streaming. So this is expression for input power. And using this one, this table is resulted for input power and COT value. So we see. COT value. So we see the input power, the largest one is lower coin motion. Nor coin means there's no constraint in the lateral and angular motions. So this is input power. It consumes much more input power. The smallest input power is free swimming. So about it's much smaller. Comparing COT value, Comparing COT value, dual core motions is also largest, and smallest one is free swimming. So this means free swimming is most efficient and worst case is low recall motion. So lateral record is in the middle of that. So this result means lateral translation and angular motions give significant information. A significant effect on the sewing performance. Okay, this conclusion. We investigated underrelated streaming. The model successfully demonstrates a self-proportional body and formation of pairs of anti-rotating vortices. Free swimming requires least input power and demonstrates. Least input power and demonstrates the most efficient energetic performance. When most record motions are prevented, the body consumes a significantly large power and energetically inefficient. Okay, that's all for my talk.
