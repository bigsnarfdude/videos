about quantum reference frames and symmetries of the third and the mystery of the third particle, I think. I'm trying to look at two screens. Oh, the paradox. And the paradox third, okay, paradox, much better word. And the paradox of the third particle. And so Marcus, I'll give you a warning after 20 minutes. And so then you can speak for five minutes, and then there's. Five minutes, and then there's um, that leaves five minutes for questions. Okay, please take it, take it away. Excellent. So, first question: Can you actually see my first slide? Am I sharing already? Okay, good. Good. So, yeah, thank you, Flaminia and Lucien and Rob for putting up this very nice workshop and for inviting me. I will talk today about joint work with Marius Krom and with Philip Hoohn. And let me jump right into the overview of the talk. So, in the first part, I will tell you about the idea. So, in the first part, I will tell you about the idea and the approach to consider quantum reference frame transformations as physical symmetries of some kind and about the consequences that arise from that. For example, the study of relational observables that are independent of the reference frame. In the second part, I will briefly introduce an apparent paradox from the literature. I think it's about 10 years old now, the paradox of the third particle. And then I will offer one possible resolution in the last part where we In the last part, where we can see that we should replace the partial trace by something like a relational trace. So, what are the quantum reference frame transformations that I'm talking about? So, this is a really extremely brief overview. So, here's a picture from the pioneering work by Flaminia and Esteban and Chaslav. Think of physics in one dimension and physics is translation invariant. So, if you want to say where a physical system is, then we need a reference frame. For example, we need Reference frame. For example, we need some kind of physical system that tells us where the origin is. But physical systems are quantum systems, and this can lead to interesting quantum phenomena when we change the reference frame. And here's a very simple example that has appeared in similar form also several times before, in particular in Flaminia's paper. So think of a scenario like this: we have A, B, and C. So these could just be three particles. Particles, and they are in a global quantum state. Now, how can we write down this quantum state? We could, for example, say that we place the origin where particle C is. So then this would put particle C into position zero. And then particle B is kind of distance of three to the left. So this would put particle B into the state minus three. But here, particle or maybe observer A is in a funny superposition. So here it could be a superposition of either being Here it could be a superposition of either being seven or eight places left to C. So then we would write this as the superposition minus eight plus seven plus minus seven over square root of two or so. So this would be one possible description of the global quantum state of these three particles, in some sense relative to C, because we put now the particle C in the origin. But what we can then try to do is to say, well, what if we choose another particle, in particular particle A as our reference frame in some sense? So we can try to jump into A. So, we can try to jump into A's perspective. So, how would A describe the situation in some sense? I'm still hand-waving here because we get a bit more detail later, but A would say, well, I am definitely in the origin. That's where I always am. So the particle A would be in state zero. But now the group of particles B and C would either be four and seven positions to the right or five and eight positions to the right in some funny superposition. So you would get a different. Position. So you would get a different description of the quantum state, which arguably describes the same physics, but which is different in many respects. For example, this state is now entangled, whereas before it was separable. Now, what do we want to do now in our paper? So let me say that there have been lots of studies about these kind of quantum reference frame transformations and what you can do with it. For example, describing spin of particles and changes from one particle to the reference frame of a reference. To the reference frame of a relativistic particle, but here, really, our goal is a kind of axiomatic approach. We want to study these transformations rigorously via quantum information methods. And to keep things simple and easy, we do it in finite dimensions. So we discretize everything. And we will see that this helps us to actually resolve some of these paradoxes that have to do with the partial trace and subsystems in this case. So, what we do here then is we say. So, what we do here then is we say let's have finite abelian groups as configuration spaces. So, the motivation is again this example of a particle on the one-dimensional line. In this example, think of the translation group, the real numbers. This plays now a double role. On the one hand, just the basis vectors, the position basis vectors, are labeled by elements of the real numbers, of the translation group. But we can also apply the translation group unitarily to just shift the quantum state. Unitarily to just shift the quantum state. So the group is the manifold, but the group also acts on itself in some sense. Now, here we do it the same thing, but in a discrete setup. We say, let's start with a finite abelian commutative group in just a Hilbert space. It's just spanned by basis vector labeled by the group elements. And we put n distinguishable particles on that Hilbert space. And now the intuition is we want to describe physics where the global translations are physical symmetries. Are physical symmetries, and there are perhaps more physical symmetries. So the simplest example would be when you place n positions on a ring or on a circle. I'm talking about small n, not capital N, so n points on a circle. And you can think of translating these points just by rotating it place by place. So the group that describes is just the cyclic translation group of these endpoints. And we place capital N particles somehow on this ring. Particles somehow on this ring. So we have basis vectors of capital N particles that are labeled like this cat G. So when I make a bold face G, then it's always like something like a vector. So these are many components. So the first particle is in position G1, the second particle in position G2, and so on up to the last particle. And in fact, all finite abelian groups can be interpreted in some way like this. They all describe translation of some. This. They all describe translation of some kind of discrete toros, for example, the circle here. Now, when we label the basis states, for example, by zero, then we should think of this as being done implicitly with respect to some reference frame that tells us where is the origin. But now, what if we don't have access to such a reference frame? And here are a couple of assumptions that we now make about observers that do not have this reference frame. We assume that such observers still can agree on Still can agree on a couple of structures that's sitting there. So we say that two such observers would still agree on the set of basis states. So they know what the position basis is, they just don't know how it's labeled. Two such observers would also agree on the pairwise relation between the particles in a given basis state. For example, that the second particle is right just one place next to the first one or so. And finally, we also assume that different such We also assume that different such observers agree on whether one basis state is a global translation of another state or not. So, this should be possible to decide without a reference frame. Okay, and then we say good, under this assumption, what's the symmetry group that relates to such possible observers? And this is what comes into our definition here. So, we say a symmetry, a unitary U is one of these quantum symmetries. Unitary U is one of these quantum symmetries if it satisfies the three conditions that I've just told you, just written down in mathematical form. So the first condition tells you that two observers will agree on the set of basis states. So you put one basis state in, you get out another basis state and not a superposition or so. So u maps, you know, g1 to g n to some other g1 prime to g n. The pairwise relations are something that observers agree upon. So if the pairwise relation is So, if the pairwise relation is bold phase H, then both observers will agree on that. So, what do I mean by that? Well, I just mean that your first particle sits somewhere, and then the second particle is in position H1 times G, the third particle is in position H2 times G, and so on. So this H here tells you how you get from the first particle to the JF particle. And then it also tells you how you get from one particle I to particle J. I to particle J. So on the ring, on the circle, the group element would be really addition. So this tells you how many positions you have to add to the first particle to get to the chapel particle here. These are the pairwise relations between the particles. Third condition is that if one state is a global translation of another, then the same is true for the transformed states. So when I apply such a So, when I apply such a global translation, the same for all n particles, what I mean is that I apply the same group element g to each of the particles. So everyone is translated, say, by two positions, each one of them. And if that's true initially, then it will also be true finally after you applied a symmetry transformation. Now, once we make these assumptions, we can show or work out what this group is, and then we prove the theorem. Group is, and then we prove the theorem that the group looks like that. So, the quantum symmetry transformations of such a system are exactly the relation-conditional global translations. So, every unitary can be written in that form. So what is that? Well, you basically go into the subspaces of some fixed pairwise relations. The pairwise relations define a subspace. In each subspace, you do a global translation. Global translation. But the translation can depend on your relations. So let me give you an example. Here we have a state of three particles, A and B, it's a product state, and the third is in a superposition of places 2 and 3. Now, we do the following conditional relation, conditional translation. If the distance between A and B is 1 and the distance between B and C is 1, then translate everything by minus 2. But if the distance is 1, Minus two, but if distances are one and two, then translate everything by minus three. And if you do this, then what you find is a state like that. So that's something like jumping from the perspective of A into the perspective of C. And then you get a very similar transformation like the kind that we've seen on the slide before. Except now that the transformation can be seen as a kind of element of a symmetry group of some physical system. Good. Good. Now you can ask: well, good. Now we have a symmetry group, but what I really want to do is express a state relative to one of the particles. Can I do this for all states, or for which states can I really do that? So let us put out a definition. Let's call a pure state psi, let's call it i alignable, if it can be expressed relative to the ith particle. What does it mean? Well, I can apply some symmetry transformation uu that maps it to this form. That maps it to this form. So the form says that the ith particle just gets mapped to the origin, the unit element of the group, and the other particles end up in some pure state. Let me denote all other places than i just by i bar here. Now, which states are alignable if it forms? So, what we've shown in our paper is the following. First, we've shown that if a state is i alignable, then it's also j alignable. So, we can jump into basically perspective, describe it randomly. Into basically perspective, describe it relative to particle i, you can always describe it also relative to particle j. And indeed, the transformation that maps between the two relative states is in a transformation that's also appeared already in the paper by Anne-Kathrine de La Hamette and Tomgelli, and in the paper also in different form by Flaminia. It's this quantum reference frame transformation from particle I to J. Now, what are these states? Can you say more clearly? Well, you can actually say that those states Actually, say that those states are alignable that are superpositions of at most one classical basis state per pairwise relation H. So you can do this to states that are superpositions of different relations. That is, if you superpose two states with the same relation, then you cannot do it. That's a way to classify those states. Now, another question that you can ask, and will become very important in the next part, is to ask which observables or which states are independent. Which states are independent of the choice of quantum reference frame. So, think of something like the relative distance between two particles classically. What's the quantum observables that have this property? And you can basically study two different things. So the first question, the way you can ask this question is to say, well, I want an observable A so that u A U dagger is the same as A. So the transformed observed is the same as before. As before, and then you can work out what this is. It tells out that this is a sub-algebra, an observable algebra, a inf of in, we call these the invariant observables. And these are arguably the physically relevant ones. If you have this physical symmetry, then the ones that change under the symmetry are basically just pure gauge. And so these are the relevant observables, arguably. What are they? Well, in some bases, they look like this. They are diagonal. They are diagonal. They have a big block on the left, on what's called a physical subspace, and then they are diagonal in a basis, so just diagonal elements on the rest of the operator. What's this basis here? Well, that's a basis that's spanned by eigenstates of the global translations. These states are labeled by H, by the pairwise relations, and then by K, some kind of discrete momentum, some non-zero discrete momentum. Some non-zero discrete momentum. And they are given by this equation here. So when you apply a global translation, then the state is preserved up to a phase. And the phase is what this phase is, is given, that told you by the momentum. So you get a kind of super selection rule that you cannot superimpose these guys. So momentum different from zero cannot be superimposed. But momentum equal to zero, these are the states that are completely translation variant. You can superimpose the volume. Completely translation variant, you can superpose them. And then you get what's called the relational observables living on this little block here. These are observables that are situated on this H first, this physical subspace. I say more about the name on the next slide where this name comes from. But this is the subspace of states that are as vectors invariant under the unitary symmetries. Now, these are observables, but you can do the same for the states, and then you find two classes of states. States and then you find two classes of states. You find first the invariant states, these are the ones that are the same in all quantum reference frames. What about the relational states that are supported on this relational H first? Well, it turns out that this describes states that are invariant under change of reference frame, but also their entanglement with a reference system is invariant under the change of quantum reference frame. And now it turns out that this subspace on which they live, and that's why the name H4. And that's where the name H first comes from, is indeed the physical subspace of constrained quantization. It's related also to the perspective-neutral approach to quantum reference frames that you, for example, discussed in the paper that's mentioned here. That I don't have much time to discuss the relation, but we point out some relations also in our paper between these two approaches, and they show up here kind of naturally in this axiomatic approach. So, we have relational and invariant states here that have a kind of different meaning. Have a kind of different meaning. Okay, so this is first all you can say structurally, somehow. Now let's get a bit more physical step by step, and let's look at the apparent paradox of the third particle. So this appeared 10 years ago in a paper by Angelou and co-authors. And here's one example. So consider again a three-particle state. I've slightly changed notation. I'm sorry for that, but I think it's kind of clear. That, but I think it's kind of clear. So you have the first and the second particle in a superposition state on places minus A or A and B or minus B, and the third particle is independently in position Z. So that's what's also in this picture here. Now, you can ask the following question. So in this state, there's a phase theta somewhere here. Now, what's the relevance of the phase theta? If I do some measurements only on the If I do some measurements only on the first and second particle, is this phase theta relevant or not? And if you just look at the state as it's written down, you would say, yes, of course, this phase is relevant. When I ignore the third particle, I just trace it out. Then I just get a pure state with a relative phase theta. And then for some of the measurements that I might decide to perform, this has some detectable consequences. However, if we have a situation where quantum reference frame Where quantum reference frame transformations are symmetries, then we can just perform transformation and jump into the first particle, so to speak. And that's the state what we get afterwards. So we get a state wherein the first particle ends up position zero and the second and the third become entangled. So if you trace out now the third particle and look at particle one and two in isolation, then you find that the phase theta disappears. You get a mixed state and theta just cancels out. So now. So, now, what does it mean? Now, does it mean if I ignore the third particle, is the phase theta now relevant or not? How should I think of this? So, what do Angelou et al. say in their paper? Well, their proposed resolution is to say we first have to do a quantum reference frame transformation that jumps into the center of mass, basically, and then we trace out the third particle. Turns out that this preserves the phase, but we really wondered why. So, I don't see any obvious reason why. I don't see any obvious reason why this is the right thing to do. So then we have to think about more clearly and in detail about the observables that are involved in these measurements. And that will be the last part of my talk to offer kind of resolution of this paradox with what we've learned so far. Okay, so we have to go one step back first. So why do we usually take the partial phrase? If you're given a state of three qubits, for example, row one, two, three. For example, rho 123. When you ask, well, what's the state rho12 if I only look at particles one and two? How do we work this out? Suppose we don't know that it's the partial trace, then we can argue as follows. We can say this object rho12 should give us the correct expectation values. So if I take its expectation value on some observable x12 for the first two particles, I just get the same answer as if I took the full state row one two three, but now evaluate. But now evaluated on the observable x tensor one, x times one. So what we do is we say, well, I first embed the two-particle observable x into the three-particle observable space, and then I write down this equation that I get the same expectation values. And indeed, it follows then that rho 1, 2 must be given by the partial trace over the third particle. Good. Now, why does this not work in the context of Now, why does this not work in the context that we have here? Well, here it turns out that this embedding, if you want to actually compute the tensor product, then the result is quantum reference frame dependent. It depends into which frame you first jump before you do the tensor product. And also, we are not interested really in all observables, only in the invariant ones. These are the physically relevant observables. So, then our strategy to resolve this paradox is that we would first want to find the kind of Want to find the kind of correct embedding of the two-particle relational invariant observables into those of three particles. And then we can take something like the dual. And this gives us the correct discarding operation, which will not be the partial trace, but we call it then the relational trace. Marcus, this is the 20-minute warning. Ah, yes. Okay, thank you. Good. All right. So now let's look a bit more at the physical content of this and. Content of this and the physics behind it. So, suppose I write down this state of three particles under quantum symmetries. So, as it's standing here, it's a superposition of A and B. And then particle C is just placed a couple of positions to the right at position 4. And now we can ask: well, formally, this looks unentangled, but is physically, operationally, is the particle C correlated with AB? So, what So, what does this question mean? How should we think of this question? Well, let's first try to draw a picture of the situation. So, you have two branches that I've put on these two lines now. One branch, you have a superposition. So, in the first branch, the two particles are at position zero and one, and the other particles in position four, and you know, in the other branch, different positions, and then a superposition between the two. It's kind of the yellow wiggly thing. Okay, now under quantum. Now, under quantum symmetry, we forget where the origin is, and we also forget how the two branches are related to each other. So, basically, the labels and the relation between the branches disappears physically. So, now when we now ask the question, is particle C physically operationally correlated with AB? Then we have to say the answer is yes, it is correlated if particle C carries which branch information. In other words, Information. In other words, if the relation of the particle C, that's all what it physically is about, if that relation is different for the two branches, in this case you would have entanglement or correlation. But what do we mean by the relation of C with the group of particles AB? How should we define this? We have different options to define this. We could say, well, it's kind of, say, the distance to the leftmost particle, for example. The leftmost particle, for example. In this case, the relation would be the same in both cases, in both branches. We say it's the distance to the rightmost particle of the AB group, then it would be a different relation in the two branches. And so the answer would be different. So what we find here is first that there are different ways to define what we mean by that. And this will also lead to different embeddings of the observables of two into three particles, and then to different kinds of partial traces. And then to different kinds of partial traces. The correct choice of embedding, according to this picture, first of all, will depend on the experimental context about how we actually assess or access the two particles inside the three particles. Okay, you say, well, fair enough. It's kind of disappointing still. Is there maybe still a natural context-independent or quantum reference frame-independent way to embed the two into the three-particle observables and to do that? To do that, and indeed we found yes, there is one, though it's not obvious. So, what you can do is instead of deciding how you define the relation from C to AB, you do a kind of uniform superposition over all the possibilities. And what this tells you, this leads to an embedding then of the, not of all the invariant observables, but of the relational ones, this gray block here, the relational two-particle into the relational three-particle observables. Particular observables. So, embedding, I mean, it's a map that's linear. It maps products to products. So, it preserves the structure of the observables, which is absolutely not obvious if you look in the formula at the bottom, what this map does. And it's sub-unital. And this embedding is independent on the reference frame transformation that you do before you define the product. So, if you do a unitary U before you do, Before taking the tensor product, then the result will still be the same for all quantum reference frame transformations. That's why it's independent, the definition is independent of the choice of reference frame. And then you can do say, well, now good. Now I take the dual of it, basically, and I get a relational version of the partial trace that we have denoted trail here. So state of AB is then the relational trace over C of the state on ABC. And you can write it down in this form. Basically, what you first This form. Basically, what you first do is you project onto the three-particle relational observables, then you take the standard trace, and then you project into the relational two-particle observables. What does it do now in the paradox of a third particle? So if you compute that thing in this case, it turns out that the phase theta is also fully preserved when the particle C is traced out. So indeed, when you only look at particles one and two, then you find that the phase theta is relevant under this natural choice of embedding. Natural choice of embedding. So I'm running out of time. Let me just give you a final slide. Not read everything. So, our paper that I've talked about today is the first one here that you find in the archive. There are also a little follow-up paper that we're doing now with Philip and Marius, where we look at time evolution. So far, we just had kinematics. Now we look at dynamics as well. And there's a final thing going on where we look at the perspective-neutral approach for general groups. Approach for general groups. So I don't have time to say anything about that. Also, still in preparation. Okay, with that, I would like to thank you very much for your attention. Thanks. Thank you. So thank Marcus for the talk. And if we have questions and I see I see Faye. Faye, please go ahead. Faye Delco. Yep. Thank you, Marcus, for a very clear talk. What you've described depends on the particles being distinguishable. So particle one, particle two, particle three. And a warm-up exercise that one can always do in moving. Always do in moving beyond quantum mechanics to a more fundamental quantum field theory is to move to, even in the non-relativistic regime, move to deal with indistinguishable particles. So have you thought what happens to your framework in that context? So far, we haven't really thought about this because I agree that this is something one should. Agree that this is something one should do, and it would be very interesting to see what the differences are. It's just, I would say, that another direction to go is a bit more natural, where you say, I don't care so much whether it's the same particle n times or so. I just have a global quantum system. I pick out one reference system, and the rest is just my system, no matter what structure it has. So, what can you, in this sense, in this case, say in general? Your reference frame should always be. Your reference frame should always be distinguishable from the rest because you want to know where you have to look at your clock or your rod, where it is. But then the rest of the world could just also be in a bosonic or fermionic state or so. So this would be something to do. And I think lots of work, not only by us, but by other people in the field, is in that direction. It's not assumed that they have end particles or so, but just a reference system in the rest of the world. I understand that. I suppose my own instinct is that, I mean, if you're really free to choose your subsystem in a sort of arbitrary way within your larger Hilbert space, then all sorts, I mean, questions like whether what's entangled with what, as you've shown, becomes becomes very. Yeah, it becomes very. I mean, then entanglement isn't a physical property anymore. It's just a question of the ways that you look at things. That's challenging for me to grasp. And in some sense, my starting point is the idea that locality in space-time is what defines subsystems. And that without that underpinning, I think it becomes very challenging to say what. Yeah, it becomes very challenging to say what you even mean by a subsystem that you can think of independently from other subsystems. But yes, so that's my point. I'm fully on board with that, right? I mean, even this relational trace is a bit in that direction. It's not so much about you just formally write down states and then they look entangled or not. And then sometimes they do and sometimes they don't, but it's a kind of operational question. You also wouldn't just call a two electron state entangled because it's, you know, Entangled because it's you know a finished state or so you would have to say operationally I would still distinguish the two electrons and the positions for example so um and I think group theory also you need a group representation of your space-time symmetries on your reference frame for example this is a restriction that you cannot pick any subsystem you want but it's kind of distinguished by having a carrying a group representation i think yeah thanks that's that's clear i mean i suppose then for me it boils down to Then for me, it boils down to operational means that you have the action of agents, but what constrains what agents can do? I mean, that. Yeah. Thank you, Marcus. And let's take the question from Rob. Oh, okay. Yeah, I just, everything you've done is for abelian groups, but of course, you're going to have to tackle non-abelian groups if only to deal with general rotations. General rotations. So, have you thought much about that? I have. Well, a bit. There is work out there, however, for example, by Chaslov's group. There's work on spins and the rotation group. There's work by Anne-Kathrine, De Lahamet and Tom Gelli in kind of similar discrete setup. Could be also continuous and could also be, is also non-abelian. So there's other work out there that does this in a more general case. It's just so simple. If it's finite abelian, Here's just so simple. If it's finite abelian, you can just diagonalize everything via the characters, and so it's a kind of an easy start. So it's just things are so simple, and that's basically why you did it. Well, okay, I just will the relational trace carry through? I mean, that's not obvious to me. I believe it will, but one should probably ask Philippe Hohen, who is now looking at this in more detail. But this is kind of a good open question. Yeah, something would be nice to look into. Not sure, honestly. Okay, so we should move on to the next talk. Let's thank Marcus again.
