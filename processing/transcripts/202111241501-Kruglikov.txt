So thanks to organizers for the nice organization. So it happens physically and I'm glad to be here in Canada in a month. So this is kind of my overview of some old stories. The article with the name Relative Invariance appeared more than half of the year. Appeared more than 100 years ago in Alphon, and then also relative variants was the title of the paper by Mark Felson Peter Walder. And I hope I will be able to say something new also here. But let me just. So I'll send something which will be not necessary maybe in this conference, but just to make some setup. So you can see the lips of the group. Consider the ellipsoid group, okay? It acts on manifolds. We will consider action on sub-manifolds and therefore their jets. And that's build a notation for jets of sub-manifolds of dimension N in manifold M. And this group can be also defined through jets defined by the equation. Let me write, for example, as jets of diffeomorphism from M to M. And many particular problems are interesting, like representation theory and symmetries of. Representation theory and symmetries of PDs or H actions. Okay, and the main problem is to distinguish something like Jet of submanifolds with respect to this group. And there are many partial tasks which are solved through this, like normal forms, shapes, image recognition signatures. So I was talking about differential invariance, and usually by this I understood absolute differential invariance as just functions, constants, and orbits. Orbits. And we usually consider fine-to-jet space and then pull back differential environments to infinite jet space. So there's always some minimal order. But every function is actually a function of some finite jet space. It depends on finitely many arguments. The meta-of-month frame is applicable when the group action, compared to realgebraction action, is explicit and is an effective tool to And is an effective tool to compute in differential invariance, provided the action is nice, actually. So that's how about have to do some specifications. So what about structure of the space of differential invariance? So for now, I denoted I, but actually I'm going to change notation. So classically it's something like a sheaf of rings, depending on what people consider smooth, but then there's also problem division, so I have to do specifications for those things. For those things. And more recently, we can say that's like algebra of fields under some additional natural assumptions. Okay, and I'm going to talk about rational diffirational invariance. And actually, this is a slide which I showed, I think, a bit less than ten years ago on Peter's conference in Minnesota. In Minnesota, which shows why we have to think about Russian analogies. So, first of all, they are natural because you see many, but also you encounter sometimes roots, but one has to be very careful with those. And that's classical what people would call differential invariant, but it's not, right? So then we can see the progo-motion group on the plane. So you do two translations and one rotation, so you can know that this group is actually. Can note that this group is actually also connected, right? And this classical invariant curvature seems to be invariant, but it's not. If you do rotation by 180 degrees, then it changes its sign. Okay, so proper invariant is actually k-square, and it actually doesn't have any roots here. Okay, so based on this, well, maybe you also saw this slide, but I would better like. Saw this slide, but I would better like to talk about it again. So, then based on this, we specify functions which we would like to consider to be invariant. So, we actually prescribe type of behavior for invariant functions. So, they have to be the following. So, now I introduce a bit different notation for those parameters. A, algebra of functions, and there are some parameter L, and it's actually filtered by parameter K. Filtered by parameter k. K refers to jet, L is also some jet, but I'll specify it in a moment. So this has to be smooth by base variables, like dependent and independent, not jet variables, like J0, and then rational by some jets which are restricted in order by L, and then starting from L into infinity, going to the polynomial. Okay, that's the algebra to be considered. You have to be a bit careful with language because by those A bit careful with language because, by those which are lower order, we actually allow to divide, because that's rational story here. Okay, so and oh sorry, different direction. So, and with this, I would like to recall a virtual global literacy, which is due to Valencian Lichagen and me. And well, I don't know which year to say it was 14 electronics, 16 paper, but approximately this. So, and so here are some assumptions. So here are some assumptions which is important to pay attention to. So we can see the algebra action tilde group, which is very often the case, right? It's given by algebraic equation. And shall act, we can say, just on just spaces, then there's no requirement at all. But if it actually acts with some differential restrictions, then we would like that this equation, which describes these restrictions, will be formally integrable and irreducible differential equation. Irreducible as algebraic sync. Okay? Okay, and also very mild restrictions. Well, actually, to be discussed, that the two acts transitively on the base, on J0. Under this assumption, there exists a number and the risky closed invariant proper subset such that the action is regular in the complement. So it means we take remove the subset and all its pre image in in all higher jets and then on this group acts regular, so this rational geometric quotient. This rational geometric quotient. And therefore, there exist a finite number of functions from this algebra of invariant functions and finite number of rational invariant relations which generate everything. So that the general function which is absolutely invariant is just a combination of those things several times differentiated. Coefficients may be actually rational functions only of those things which have bounded order. which have bound it order. So that's the story about absolute invariance, but actually I'm going to talk about difference. So I'm going to talk about relative environments. And here's the classical definition. So if we have, well, we have Lie group and then we have Lie algebra corresponding to it, the G capital and G small, we actually may just consider sheaf of Lie algebras, but okay, so pseudo group that actually is not the algebra, it's shifted. The group that actually is not the algebra, it's chiefly algebras. But here's the definition: so a function is relative differential learned if action of group actually maps this function to proportion, to something proportional to it. And this learner is called multiplier. Or equivalently, so here I assume connected because I would like to say equivalently, but in principle we don't need this connected. So equivalently, you re-differentiate the invariant and you get again something proportional. Again, something proportional, and this coefficient proportionality is called weight. So, actually, since the thing happens in jet, I have to write some prolongations, but I just omitted in this writing. So, what is this W? So, W is one co-chain only algebra G, okay, so with some values. So, it actually belongs to tensor product of G star, of the altogether. Of g star, of dual to g, and some algebras of functions. I will say in a moment what it is. On this equation, if you don't want to think about equation, you can just think about unrestricted gems. Okay? So, of course, well, in general, this actually both are infinite dimensions, so one has to be a bit careful about this tensor product sign, but let me not be explicit about it. Okay, so absolute differential invariants are relative, of course, with weight zero. Relative, of course, with a way zero. We just put here zero, right? Or we just put here one. So when we do multiplication or division of relative invariants, that adds or subtracts their weights. So the weight space is linear, denoted by W. And so here's an important point. Since in previous theorem we saw that absolute and variance are rational, so that's this only enough to separate. So that's enough for us to restrict this algebra of rational polynomial invariants. So we can actually assume that relative invariants are polynomials. Okay, so you go to this ratio and you could take numerator, denominator, these are relative invariants. And this is corresponding G model P. So that's kind of polynomial. Okay, so so but again, on base, abitric response behavior injects polynomial behavior. Polynomial behavior. Let us cure the lost. What is B of E? Yeah, that's a space of polynomial functions to J, right? So that's just, at this point, it was just functions on equation, all functions. But now, by this reason, I actually restrict only to polynomials. However, on basis, these are smooth functions, so these are smooth functions of J0, but in in jets, they are going to be actually polynomials. So a real function of the variety of gel space defined by differential equations? Yeah, thanks for the question. Okay, so for any relative differential invariant R, the equation given by R equal to zero is indeed gene variant. And if R is generally relative, not absolute, I mean, then it must contain singular orbits. And singular is not regular, and regular means that all Regular means that the orbit has a neighborhood which is fibered by other orbits. So any invariant subset of code-dimensional one is given by relative scalar, differential invariants. And actually, in this talk, we'd like to talk only about scalar story. So invariant means actually function, right? We scalar values. More generally, of course, we can talk about with coordination greater than one, but these are described by some relative unveiled tensors. Described by some relative unveiled tensors, but this may be reducible, so there's a bit more things to go there. So let's go forward. Think at this place is good to have actually an example. And we consider the following example. We consider action of the projective group on projective plane. Okay, I wrote here actually R2, but you have to think about actually well P2. But since I need coordinates, I just take a fine path. Coordinates, they just take a fine part. Of course, PSL3 doesn't act on that because we understand this, but I mean, like for as pseudo-group, it does. Okay, so we consider the section and I identify the plane with just a GA0 space of maps from R to R. Coordinates will be X and U, that's independent and dependent respectively, and therefore I extend the action to the space of K j. Of what? Of curves in plane, right? In plane, right? And here is the algebra of PSL, right? So projective algebra, you see, well, that's two linear fields, that's the other four, sorry, that's translations, with the zeros, that's linear, and that's quadratic. And of course, all of them we can lift. And then easy computation, so especially if you have maple or mathematical or whatever, so then the following are the first relative invariants. Okay, this is very easy to Okay, this is very easy to to to guess, right? Because when you two equal to well when you two equal to zero, it it tells you that you you have a line, right? And of course lines are invariant with respect to projective group. This is the set of all lines. The next invariant is also known, that's called Klein invariant. Vanishing of this invariant means that you talk about quadrics and again space of quadrics, well, set of possible quadrics is invariant with respect to a projectile group. And then there's a bit And then there's a bit bigger invariant in here, J7, right? And interesting story about it is that J5 and J7 have proportional weights. So if go back for a second, no, that's going forward, so going back for a second here, right? So you see that in particular that there's G star here. So of course there's many multi-dimensional things, this one and this one, but even if you go straight on this one, right? But even if you go straight on this one, right, so yeah, sorry. So I talk actually about those things. So we don't talk about everything, you talk about just space of weights. So it's not one-dimensional in this example, right? So in particular, J2 and J5 have non-proportional weights, right? We are in vector space. But J5 and J7 proportional weights. And therefore, we can take a proper combination, it's actually rational combination, and then And then arrange from this an absolute emergency. And I would like actually to have no roots, as I explained why, such roots are not allowed. Therefore I don't write G7 divided by J5 in power 8 over 3, but I actually write integer powers and as a ratio. Oh, you're right, thank you very much. That that's that's that's a j5, yes. That's a J5, yes. Okay. It would be nice if it's the only paper in here. Okay. So, but I'd like actually to talk here about weight lattice. It is two-dimensional and this weight of J2 and J5. So what are these weights? So I can show explicit formula for them. And of course I have to show like one form on G with values and functions. These values and functions, but in fact, I will just take arbitrary vector field here. So there's this projective vector fields in the plane, but actually this formula, just remember that it will appear. Okay, so one way you take vector field and you compute its divergence with respect to standard volume or area form on the plane. Okay? That's x actually not a bit of a vector field, but one of those. And the other way is the following. Way is the following. You take vector field from here, but you take its prolongation to contact space. Mark taught us how to do this prolongation in his lecture. And so you know x1, right? And then you take, well, contact form and this space. Oh, sorry, so you take contact form in this g1, right? And you take corresponding volume form. And then you compute divergence with respect to this. That's the second way. Okay? That's precisely way. That's precisely weight space. Wait a minute. DL, that's a three-form. Yes, because J1 is three-dimensional, yeah. Oh, three. Yeah, so we do prolongation. So this leaves in two, but this leaves in three dimensions. Okay, so now absolute invariants are just generated by those relative invariants and the invariant derivation, so that's easy to describe. But actually the easy story to describe relative invariance is a bit more complicated, right? But okay, I would like to finish with this example anyway. Like to finish with this example anyway. So, what about weights? So, first of all, of course, we have a consistency condition, right, for those, because there was definition of weights, and if you do commutation of rederivative, then we get re-derivative of commutator. And so, this implies one cos cycle condition for the weights. So, here it is. This means that precisely this this W is just one cosycle, because well, it was previously just Hochie. Okay? If you do rescaling of relative invariance, Scaling of relative invariance, right? This results in shift of weight by exact one form and sock boundary. And therefore we get actually an element of uncohomology, and that's actually Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology, because these things which we see here are vector fields, and that's some module. And in general, both things are infinite-dimensional. And in particular, one can also think about Li-Renhart algebra, which Oleg Baros discussed in his lecture, right? In his lecture, right? I should stress also some difference that he took here some basis. He's thinking about geosparable. So he actually takes basis, but I would like actually to think about this as continuous approach. Can I just ask you guys a question just to make sure I'm tracking you? Okay, so for the infinitesimal action, in the infinitesimal picture of the relative invariance, right, you can no longer say that the vector field acting on the relative invariance is zero. Rather, you have to replace Rather, you have to replace the vector field with a first-order operator with a zeroth order apart, and it's that action that will annihilate the relative invariant. Am I tracking correctly? Or is that... Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, you're just going to weigh it over the other side of the equation. Yeah, because how do you describe the criterion for relative invariant infinitesimal? It's this one, right? So here's a vector field you need to change. So here's a vector field, you did your shape. I have to be proportional. But mainly what I'm discussing now, what is this factor, right? What is this weight factor? But he's translating it to a bit. So it's the same as the QES construction. Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah, exactly. Or what you did with Mark on the rollout. Yeah, and so Peter called this thing multiplier, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he also talks about weight. I'm good, I'm good. I mostly will be talking about. Okay, so here we are. So f is invariant function here, should be invariant. I don't see f, sorry. R is scaled by f. Oh no, no, just some sequencer. Well, even r is not invariant. R is just relative invariant, right? So that's the story. So I don't know about r. So if I multiply r by f, then I get actually another relative invariant. Correct, but for any function is in some sets of relative function. Any function so fine, as you see it's actually not zero, right? Because I would like to do this, but uh I I I'm going to a bit specify right away. So for some, something, right? But but I get the equation the same type as relative R. The only thing is the W changes. So there's no reason for me to think about particular R. I can rescale it. If you want the same weight, then it has to be an invariant. But that's like in count, you don't talk about it. Yeah, but yes. But that's like in co you don't talk about homology, but only talk about cost cycles. But then you have much bigger space. You don't want to have this huge space. Okay, so having computed those, for example, right, which is not easy usually, so one has to check realizability of cos cycles, which ways define actual relative environments, and then we get the space double. And so two conditions arise due to local algebraic property, which we saw in You saw in global literature theorem before. And the first thing is that cos cycles actually should be local in finite jets, right? So we don't consider infinitely many derivatives. This formulation actually doesn't specify. So we would like to have this local or differential behavior. And the second thing is that rational behavior should not confront log modules, right? log modules, right? So after all for absolute invariance I would like rational, for relative I would like polynomial. And if f is actually functions on z, that's not a polynomial. I have to be actually careful here. Okay, so so so so so yeah, okay. So now I'd like to relate this to leaf of the actions. So we have let me for now just talk about shift of the actions. Shift of the algebras on a manifold, but of course, later we will do jets and prolongations. So we have this algebra vector fields on n, and we have space of functions. I wrote C infinity, but I don't like C infinity, and yeah, well, you already saw that I would like to change it, right? So let me write this algebra function A. But at this moment, you're actually free to do some other specifications. Now, elements of this cohomology. These classes, or actually even representative core cycles, give lifts of vector fields to algebra of functions on m hat. And m hat is total space of trivial line bundle. That's actually easy to generalize to any line bundle. What what I have to sh ch change, I have to change this F to sheaf of sections, right? But okay, let me just talk about the trivial story. The trivial story. So, what's the lift? So, we take t to be coordinate here on R, and then the lift is the following. So, vector field x from g maps to vector field x hat, which is x plus w of x times dg. So, we add the vertical component. And if you change the jukacycle w, then actually this lift change by equivalent lift. Okay, so in the paper by By Marquels Peter Wolver of 1997, that they have criteria for this relative invariant. So for given cos cycle W, this relative invariant are if and only if the sleeved, well, I did rephrase what they write there, if the sleeved possess new absolute invariants. Of course, all previous invariants you can just pull back, right? But new ones shall appear. Okay? And therefore, relative invariants. Okay, and therefore relative invariants are in bijective correspondence with the invariant sections of this line bundle. And when we look to divisors of zero loss of those things, we get invariant hypersurfaces, in jet language invariant equations. Okay now, but these are not all links actually. So actually in in Peterson Mark's work uh this is not dt, but t times dt. But it doesn't matter, right? Because uh But it doesn't matter, right? Because it's just like Log transform. So, but and but it gives linearity of structure in the fiber, right? But there are other things, so not all list are exists. So I don't use TDT, I use dt here, therefore I call it constant in T list, because this thing, it doesn't depend on T, right? It depends on only on point on this M. Okay, and this, we can say that this respect matrix. Can say that this respects metric structure on R, because what is this? That's dt, that's just shift. That's present what's dt square on this line. But you can also consider affine structure and projective structure, right? Which gives two-dimensional and three-dimensional algebra, respectively, as we know from Sophos Lee Walker. And therefore, we can actually consider lifts, which can be linear, inhomogeneous, or quadratic and homogeneous in T. So that's what you will write in here. Not just one W. Write in here. Not just 1w, but for example, w0x plus double t times w1x. That will be factor. Or maybe quadratic factor, homogeneous. And actually, if g is one-dimensional, this leaves up all. Okay, but in general, I consider infinite dimensional g as well. Okay, so those are a bit more complicated to describe those, those non-linear leafs. Okay, and here I would like to formulate analog of GLT, but not for relative invariance. So that's one of the main theorems of the talk. So there were some assumptions in GLT, right? Assumes the same. Then, first of all, the space of weights is fine-dimensional lattice. Because if you go slightly there, right, and if you look to Gail functionality, Look to George van Fuchs cohomology. I mean, this doesn't follow from anywhere, actually. It's a complicated story, of course. Okay, so, okay, so the first statement is that space of weight is five-dimensional, and I don't say space, linear space, I say ledges, right? So it's discrete. And then there exists jet numbers such that for a lot of differential environments of water greater than this, and the weight from this lattice, it is. From this lattice, it is a combination of absolute differential invariance with coefficient to be relative differential invariance of this low order and with this given weight. And the whole algebra of relative invariance is actually gradient. Okay, so we write it as some Rw, this is a weight from the lattice. So it's, yeah, therefore it's finitely generated by finitely many of differential variants. Of differential environments and relative environment derivatives. So, relative environment derivatives, they act a bit differently. So they act from one place in the latest to some other place in the latest, right? But I have to be a bit careful, that's graded algebra, right? So you shall consider only pure a weight differential invariance. You cannot sum two differential invariants of different weights. This is not going to be a relative invariant, right? So that's as usual with graded torture, probably. Graded algebra. You may multiply, for example, in variance of different weights. That's okay. Remind us what GOT stands for? Globally stressful. Yes. That's the first theory which was on the slide. This algebraic assumption. Yes, that's important. Okay. So well work. Funy generation here. Here should be understood not as you might think because there's polynomials, of course, not as unhildered by theore. It would be too good. But we are localizations of some set of invariants of order up to L. So in other words, you are allowed to divide by some lower order relative invariance, just due to some synergies. Okay, so so this this thing is a bit more complicated, but still there's some fun uh generation. some fun uh generation okay so um let's maybe look to example uh so it's called essentially contact ODs but I will explain a bit later so that's algebra of vector field it's actually contact right it's sub algebra of contact the algebra S P4 R right because that's that's act on G1 the maximal On G1, the maximal algebra of vector fields, maximum sub-algebra of context-dimensional vector algebra, SP4R. And this SP4R contains two parabolic subgroups, P1 and P2, and contains the intersection, the smallest parabolic subgroup P12, which is called Borel sometimes because it's kind of um upper uh triangular. So so it is actually six dimensional, you see. That that's vector fields precisely. That's vector fields precisely. Okay. So we take this fine-dimensional algebra and we compute its invariance. And so here's the first invariance. So this number here means order of invariant, right? So three derivatives, here six derivatives. So it's R3, there's no R4, and there's R5, R6, R7, R8, and then every order. Okay, and I don't try, I can write as many as possible. As many as possible, but actually just becomes longer. Okay, so here's a wave latest is one-dimensional and is generated by the following co-cycle. W of x is the following. So it's almost divergence, right? So I take linear relative of alpha divided by alpha, where alpha is just volume. Well, lengths form onto the line. And to understand what this consider means, actually, take a look at it's actually one on x5 and what is x5. x5 is actually scaling. So this thing, so it has elongation of x5 actually. So the w counts how many differentiations of x we have in any monomial. And then if you have products, then we also sum those things. Just number of total differentiation by x. Just number of total differentiation by x. That's what this this uh this relative invariant this what's what this weight count. And this is one dimensional. I will not write k w, simply write k, right? W will be just basis in this latest. Okay, and then the weights of this invariance which I wrote here are the following. So for R3 it is three, and then it goes uh regular afterwards. Eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty every time plus four. To be inky every time plus 4. This is the weights. Okay, and here's propositions: algebra of relative differential environment is generated by R3, R5, and relative environment derivation and this derivation. Don't sleep, don't sleep, don't sleep. Okay, sorry for this. Yeah, okay, good. So, and this invariant derivation, it raises weight by 4. Okay? So, actually, you see, it starts like actually should be absolute derivation, but then you have to divide by something. And here's, so it's not derivation, actually. It's operator first-order, right? Because you see first-order part and zero-order part, and it's operator, right? So, this usual absolute In variant derivations, that's actually vector fields on ongets, right? But these are not, that's just all parameters. And this zero order part that actually contains weight. Okay, so let me give proof. Okay, let's have to give proof at least to some sort. So that's a very simple one. So we take lead determinant because G prolonged to jet and it sends its vector fields, so we get 6 times 6 matrix. We get six times six matrix, and we compute well this determinant and we factorize it, and then we see actually well we have to go to force prolongation because force just have dimension six, right? So I get six by six matrix. And then actually it is this one. So that's redetermined. Right? And starting from order four, the action is locally free and there's a bijection between absolute and relative invariance. So here I can use just So so so here I can use just absolute numerics which are easier to compute. Uh and then just clear denominators uh because all denominators will go into these guys. Locally free outside the singular set. Where the redeterminant vanishes. Yes, yes. That's a good specification. Thank you. Okay, so here are some first synergies. So I think normally I apply to those relative invariants which you see and you see your relations are pretty nice. You see, relations are pretty nice. They can be continued everywhere. And this is the reason, actually, not auto R3 is equal to zero, that I can't actually use R3 as only generator. I have to also use R5. But also, like I said, there's a space of weights, it's, yeah, find the weights of 3 and then actually start 8, 12, 20, then shift by 4. So if I shift 3, 8, I don't get... So if I shift 38, I don't go anywhere. Okay, so corollary. So all these scalar with essential contact symmetries are given by elements of R. So anything else by contact transformation can be brought to equations with only point symmetries. So this tells that we actually can effectively Tell that we actually can effectively describe all ODEs with essential context symmetries. Okay, the first such appears in order 3, that's y 3 equals 0. Then nothing special happens in 4. So any ODE of order 4 has point symmetries only after some conjugation. Then in order five actually there will be precisely two reducible ODEs that's somehow related to the fact that polynomials with one variable is PID. With one variable is PID, and then actually there are pure polynomials with many variables, and then there's infinity many, but it's effectively describable. Okay, so that's kind of the outcome of this computation. Okay, now I would like to change to some other things. So I would like to talk about other structures for which computations coordinate may be difficult. So I would like to invoke a bit of representations here, and I'd like to do some representations. I'd like to do some recollection. So I'd like to talk about homogeneous bundle G mod H. So if I have such and I have representation space of H called V, then I can form a homogeneous bond. So I take this product G cross V or H. That's bundle over M, this type of fiber V. V. And in particular, I will be caring about one-dimensional because I actually think about like scalar or different variables. So this will be classified by such one-dimensional, like line, homogeneous line bundles will be classified by one-dimensional representation of H. For generalized log varieties G over P, where G is in a simple P is parabolic, the line bundles are characterized by this lattice. So what's here? So what's here? So here stays the order of center of parabolic group or algebra. And let me recall that semi-assembly algebras have the gradations which are actually one-to-one with parabolics up to conjugation. So we can think about actually G as graded Lie algebra, right? Symmetric grading because non-degenerate killing, and T is non-degenerate. And P is non-negative path. And in this case, actually, G0 is reductive, and center of P equal to center of G0. The model tangent space for M can be identified with the negative part. Boris, to get a line bubble, don't you need maximum reparabolics, maximum parabolics? Or am I confused? No, not necessary. I mean, first of all, there's no relation of this choice of this and the choice of this, right? I have to talk about representation also. So the central reading element. No, it is sorry, that's stupid, but I wrote you now. I have to write just Zg0. That's what I mean. I mean Zg0 everywhere. Yes, because we take P and there's P plus, it's Nilpotent. There's no actually all one-dimensional representations are trivial. You quotient by it and you go to G0, then you take center actually, because also there is no one-dimensional representation for for G0, same as simple part. So the only thing which remains is actually is this one. Sorry, same san same things. Uh just forget about GP. Yeah, huh. Just forget about Z P. Yeah, it h have to be Z P for all. Okay, so I I I talk about this homogeneous picture. Of course, it's nice to talk about homogeneous bundles, but actually I would like to go to more general things. So it's just introducing, so let me go to general Cartan geometry. So general Cartan geometry type GH is an H principal bundle over a manifold. So now you don't have actually G, right? You forget about G. The only thing which remains is H. So in the flat case, in the most In the flat case, in the most symmetric case, it's actually G mot H. But actually, there's no G acting here. G doesn't exist. The only thing you know is H. But G is important, actually. So how? Because then catanger is not only this bundle, but also a choice of fine connection. And what is this? This is one form on the bundle of the total spatial bundle with various in Lie algebra of G. And has to satisfy three properties: equivariance, it has to be. Equivariance, it has to be a isomorphism of tangent bundle to total space to the algebra gene, and has to reproduce the fundamental vector fields, the right-invariant vector fields from H. Okay, a parabolic geometry specification of this when G semi-symbol is parabolic. And this class contains many, many geometries. Then it's talking about it, but we'll not read it. So that's what we kind of derived from previous slides, which was for homogeneous. For parabolic generators type GP, the weight lattice for all different variants is this, well, actually when I write lattice not good, it shall be Z here. Ah, that was all maintained. That was so many types. Sorry, sir. Z in power cardinality of Z of G0. Again, sorry for many types. Okay, so and how do we compute fundamental invariance? It's actually related to both talks of Dennis and of Rope. So I'd like to talk about cotton balance, but that's actually a picture from the From the paper with Ivan Schneider and with David McNutt. So actually, this is part of where we discussed the relation of invariance to Cartan-Kalchid algorithm. So consider finding a type of geometric structure called type Q, metric connection, whatever distribution, a signal structure. So and I could consider equations of all structure of this type. So I consider a bundle of this. Consider a bundle of this if there's no differential restrictions, just like Purejet bundle. Maybe there's restriction if you have some like Einstein-Weinstein condition. Okay, and then you get bundles of this. And P will be Cartan bundle for particular choice of Q, and then I do pull back. So I actually consider all possible structures of this kind and all possible Cartan bundles. So Cartan bundles depends on general structure. I'd like to kind of distinguish those two things. I think about this as very concrete for. I think about this as very concrete, for very concrete structure, and this is for unspecified structure. Because it will be different bundles, right? So that's just jet projection from J infinity to M, and it just has the same story in here. But this is P principal bundle usually when you do Cartan connection and construct this. Okay, now when we are here, here actually, then we compute Cartan. Here actually, then we compute carton invariants and that's precisely what was just described by Rohr. So we compute all structure functions, then we differentiate them along frame, and so forth. So what do they give to us? They actually give to us algebra of functions on this space, which are j invariant. Okay, there's just subspace in here, that's a special one. And if you would like to discuss absolute invariance, then we do the following. So absolute invariance which live in here, right, so those things, you take this space and you take p. You take this space and you take p-invariant part of it. Now, if we would like to talk about relative invariance, right, then we have to do a bit quite a false story. And I would like just to discuss in the case of parabolic, not in the general Cartan case. So here, the structure group is product of reductive and new potent, and reductive is semi-simple cross-center, right? And all invariants And all invariants, actually all relative invariants for nilpotent are the same as absolute. And the same concerns for G0SS. They also absolute. And so here it's important I talk about scalar, because there's no one-dimensional representation of semi-simple groups, as well as for neuroportants, that they're also trivial. Okay, so the only thing which remains actually is this guy, the center of G0, right? There are four relative invariants as a four. Therefore, relative invariants are the following. There's functions which are h invariant, h is this bit smaller than p product, on this base omega and such that actually, yeah, that center acts somehow on that, by rescaling. Okay, and this gives us simultaneous resolutions. Okay, so that's how it works. So, I aimed to I aimed to actually tell something about some examples of it, but I see that I don't have much time. So, what I wanted to do, I wanted to have actually a couple of examples, but that's the first example. That's a very classical example. Second order OD is mode point transformation. The transformation group here is just all the functions of the plane, and then you lift them to first jets, to second jets, and then you lift it to actually a space of jets of this function f, right? Right? So, and yeah, and you can lock your screen. And I wanted to show you actually computation in Maple of this Gilfan-Fuchs cohomology. I mean, I do it in Maple because, well, you have to do some differentiations and so on. But I mean, it's just some number of exercises there. So I was willing actually to show you how to... It's a hard way to compute this homology actually. And so hard for you to see the latest. So this. But okay, I think I don't have time because as well. So I skip this computation. So relative invariance goes way back to 1896. Surprisingly, Tracy didn't pay attention to right-absolute invariance. I have to slightly help you. So the latest is two-dimensional here. And you see that that's actually our first example. First example. This to generate all the latest I actually first example which I did for projective. That doesn't follow from any way, actually, because that's, of course, projective group is maximal group in group of different plane, but actually it doesn't help to see it at all. At least I don't see it. Maybe it follows off, but I don't see it. So it's just a result of computation, and there's a hard way to do it. You first take different plane, this way. Take different plane, these values of functions on the plane, and this is one-dimensional to homology actually. By doing this, you just recover this divergence, it's this part. Then you lift things to contact and compute, you get up the second one. Then you lift further, and nothing clear comes. You lift further, nothing new come, you get stabilization. That's approximately the routine. And these are realizable. There are two fundamental relative invariants. One has very simple formulas, the other has very complicated formulas. Formula Zaus has very complicated formula, but as wrought as today, there are some duality, and actually, complexity of these two expressions is the same. If you do different duality, they just switch. You do some transformation, so this big one becomes small one. Yes. Well, so there are a bit more examples, and I don't think I actually have time to go there. My next example was about 235. So you can get also some other things in here. But let me just maybe skip it. And there are a bit of applications which are related to different talks actually of this conference. So in any place you can see relative environments. For example, this Darboux, well, that's actually Laplace environment. They are relative and the Detonian Darboe intercredit. Right? And that they actually, yeah. They actually, yeah, absolutely. You can understand the entire different variant story. Yes, and that was the last thing which Avin discussed, right? That's Q type matrix. And then you also can ask, just let's consider matrix of this kind. H is an arbitrary function, W is arbitrary function, H almost arbitrary doesn't depend on one variable, on variable V. But then you start looking to all sort of see the group of all transformations which present. All transformations which preserve this class of matrix, right? And then you look actually to relative invariance. You don't know any relativity. You just look to the story and you like to say, let's just look to single orbits. So what are they? What are relative invariance? The first one which comes is this one. And that's the first condition for kilomet. So without any understanding of what is relativity and for just doing this game, we can actually now that you have to say what means the generative generate metric. They come very naturally. They come very naturally. The second condition actually is not relative invariant, the so-called conditional relative invariant. You have to assume this equal to zero, then this becomes relative invariant afterwards. So the transformation law is a bit more complicated there. So it's conditional relative environment. Is there a relative invariant? Is there a relative invariant? So W is just a. No, which reduces to H, B, V, W. It's always she. It's always shifted by by W V V. So if you don't assume it, it it's it's it's like triangular transformation. So you apply a group to H triple derivative, you get something times H triple derivative plus something times double derivative for double derivative. You meet these kind of things when you start investigating the direction of the equals. Yeah, yeah. So and these guys are much more complicated, these conditional relative invariants, much more complicated to compute or even understand what they are actually. What they are actually. Because for relative, there are some actually, okay, so here's some theories, some weights, and so forth, but those exist only on some singular surfaces. So, yeah, I probably don't see them outside at all. Okay, so that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much, Org. I already have a question. Yeah, sorry, I was about the early confusion. So, the lattice lid. Confusion. So the lattice lives on fracture H, the algebra growth, the isotopics of the algebra, right? Okay, so you've got a homogeneous phase, G mod H, right? And the lattice for which... No, no, it's kind of extrinsic to all of this. However, it has to be H representation in a sense, right? Yeah, it has to be a character of H. Yes. That's right. Yes. And the lattices you were talking about. And the lattices you were talking about, right? The weights, where do the weights live? They live in H star, right? In the dual of H, no? No. So where do these mattresses live? I think you have to do some bautiens there, right? So for general issues, I actually even don't understand. But paparapolica are kind of discussed, that they live in the dual to center of reductive part. And when you say lattice, it's not an emergent, it's an embedded. So each point of the lattice is isolated from all the others. Yes, a discrete subgroup. And in fact, it's not like the usual definition of lattice, it's actually discrete vector space, like this discrete subgroup of vector space. But actually, here it will be a semi-group. So because I want. So, because I want polynomial, I don't allow divide relative invariance, so I cannot subtract rates. So, it will be just semi-group there. Or part of the latest set. So, what, um, for GP5, can you just go back to yourself, please? Wh where what's the order of the two relative currents? Well, they actually of order They actually of order, I forgot, what's the quadratic? Six order, right? In this Cartan quadric, right? It's the first fundamental invariant. I think it's order six, right, in data of the distribution. And then you just hook up from them two expressions which are relative invariants. And they can proportional weights. They're just functions of the coefficients, right? Because these are just the standard relative invariance of coordinates. Of course, absolutely, yes, yeah. Of course, absolutely, yes, yeah. And of course, in general position, if it's type one, right, I don't remember how it's called, then you can cook up absolute invariant. But I would rather prefer not to like have this invariant as like you have those roots and as reaction of roots, because it's uh is computable because it's quartic, you have formula fruits, but that's not nice formula, it's Ferrari formula. So prefer rather to have the slight disclosure. For us to have the slight disclosure completely and completely on which you break. There is one more question in the same words. Thank you very much.
