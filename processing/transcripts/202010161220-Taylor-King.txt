I started out as a mathematician where I met Thomas, did a postdoc in a biology department where there really wasn't any quantitative support. You had to work it all out yourself. Did a biotech MBA at Cambridge and then went to join Juvenescence. Juvenescence is an anti-aging biopharma company. So we're an investor in a bunch of different sort of portfolio companies all around. Different sort of portfolio companies all around anti-aging. And one of the sort of interesting, well, sort of the best bit of my job is that you get to see lots and lots of different companies telling you about their ideas and how they want to save money in the drug development pipeline. So that's going to be a little something I just want to talk about, my perspectives there. And recently, as of the last year, we spun out a sort of incubated company within Juvenescence. Company within juvenescence called Relation Therapeutics. And this is around drug repurposing, which I might talk a little bit about later using some of the sort of cutting-edge methods from graph machine learning. You'll notice that I've called this presentation AI within clinical development, but really it's ML. And, you know, AI is this kind of hyped up term. And, you know, I think really it's quite interesting. We're noticing that no one's really using AI. That no one's really using AI anymore. It's really a 2019 term. And as such, this is actually an old presentation from last year. But I thought, why not just give it now? Because I think it's still relevant. Typically, I'd give some, like, you know, if someone asked, like, can they record this and stuff, I would probably point them in the direction of some rather generic and boring, like, legal nonsense. But really, what I want to say is that these opinions are my own and don't really. That these opinions are my own and don't really reflect anything from juvenescence. I'm trained as a mathematical biologist, I guess. It's probably the most appropriate fit for me. But, you know, I've kind of done work in bioinformatics and a bunch of different areas. So, you know, as a quantitative person, let's just say that. But, you know, I've not seen everything. And so I'm going to miss out stuff. And there's always like biology is always, it's always more complicated than that, as the last presenter was. As the last presenter was talking about his work with dimerizing receptors, which seemed quite interesting. I really want to know more about that actually. And yeah, the real issue is that we don't know how complicated anything is. So yeah, it's pretty horrible. In short, why are we doing all of this? Well, AI within pharmaceutical and the biotechnology industries has the promise to expediate clinical development, hopefully increase lifespan. Hopefully, increase lifespan and longevity, at least from juvenescence's perspective, and then optimize the resources we currently have. I'm going to be moving through this quite quickly. It was once like a 70-page thing, I'd give over an hour, but we've got 15 minutes, so I'm going to be quick. Really, the thing which sort of drove me behind a lot of this is that, you know, if you look at how the government, the UK government, and I assume this holds for Canada too. Assume this holds for Canada too. You know, we spend most of our money on basically healthcare or social protection, which is really very similar in a way. And, you know, the reason we can't, why you spend so much money is that as you get older, you know, you're frail, you've got neurodegeneration, you've got a weakened immune system. And when you look at the evolving aging population, this isn't going to get better. So this is something we've really got to work on. To work on. Now, drug development is a very slow process. It takes 10 years, and with a fetch, you've got a failure rate of more than 85%, depending on how you count these things. And, you know, the average drug costs about 2.8 billion per drug, as I believe the first speaker was saying, because you've got to pay for all the failures which it took to get you to an approved molecule. And, you know, every new technology you try, it's always, you spend some money here, it means you can't spend some money there. And, you know, a lot of the sort of biological modalities we've been working with previously didn't actually have a huge amount of predictive power. And so here's, I think maybe Helen did this earlier, but this is like the kind of, you see this in every single drug development talk, and you call it the funnel. Development talk, and you call it the funnel. And it's basically: you say, Well, I've got molecules here, and you start out with, sorry, I've now got my hand over the camera, but you've got molecules at the beginning where you've got, you know, a giant chemical library. You might have a few hits out of that. Then you start, medicinal chemist starts playing around with it. Then you've got safety, toxicity, you're putting it into mice, you're checking that the mouse models of a disease work. You end up going into clinical trials one, two, and three. Going into clinical trials one, two, and three, and then finally you've got your FDA filing and approval. It's a long time and it's a slow process, but there might be ways that quantitative techniques, not just at the sort of PKPD level, but at all sorts of different levels could really help you provide an advantage. So I hear you're all quantitative students, so I don't really want to labor this. It is just this kind of like It is just this kind of like generic catch-all term, but I've got an idea what I think it is, but you know, this could be wrong. It seems to be some mix of where you're mixing together a kind of causal or mechanistic model of variables where you've got some kind of axiomatic system driven by something from the physical sciences, law of mass action type kinetics. Action type kinetics and also phenomenological models. So the phenomenological models you can really break down into statistical modeling, which of course every sort of biomedical statistician can tell you a lot about what they do. You know, you've got survival curves, demographic risk, but also machine learning, which is really what's happening now. And as far as I can tell, what Can tell what AI is, is the kind of rebrand, you know. It seems to be a sort of rebrand of inverse modeling within biology. Well, at least in this setting, you start off with the data, you've got an ensemble of kind of like semi-mechanistic deep neural network models, and you start parameterizing the model instances. And you then start coming up with some conclusions and trying to test if this works out of distribution. Works out of distribution. So, you know, can you start making inferences to a new scenario? This is just about how a model learns. You know, I really like this example of something which I think demonstrates this. You've got a neural network in the corner. You've got multiple realizations of some process. And they get a little bit better each time. But the thing is, is that these models of cars, they've got a little sensor. Models of cars, they've got a little sensor on the front, and you're integrating information from the environment. And I think there's a sort of evolutionary component where we're doing this over and over again. With that, I'm going to keep moving. So what's exciting in AI? I'm going to hit right to it. This seems to be the big research areas: high-dimensional statistics. People are looking at random matrix theory. People are looking at random matrix theory, compressed sensing, and sort of numerical approximation of operators. Really hot areas there. Natural language processing, you know, if you want to get into this, start googling about transformers and attention mechanisms. There's image and video analysis. I'm going to talk about that too for a second. This is all around convolutional neural networks and kind of advances around these architectures here. And then you've also got. And then you've also got GraphML, Graph Machine Learning, where you're basically trying to carry out machine learning over data, which has got a sort of graphical structure to it in one way or another. So natural language processing, you know, it starts out where people are just trying to translate between languages and you've got some kind of embedded space which, you know, instead of going from one language to Instead of going from one language to every other language, you'd have a kind of computer-generated language which allows you to sort of map between all of these different spaces. You would typically use a sort of transformer mechanism to do this kind of thing. And well, we're now very, very good at this. I mean, if I start translating to French and back again, demonstrate becomes show in the translation there, but you can see how well we're doing. There, but you know, you can see how well we're doing. But what's quite interesting now is we're now getting to the point that we are able to generate narrative. There's this great paper. People might have heard of GPT-2. It's an OpenAI's language model. There's now GPT-3, which has just come out. And the amazing thing is, is that through these incredibly complex sort of mathematical functions, you're able to, you know, with To, you know, with quite simple ways of encoding words, you could actually start generating narrative. If you go to talktotransformer.com, you can have loads of fun. So, for instance, I can say you could start filling out the rest of a paragraph. So, I could say, like, my prompt is, my name is Jake. And so, I'll start talking about how, you know, I've gone to college. It's a major college. It's a beautiful college. Sounding a little bit trump-esque. Sounding a little bit trumpesque, actually, which is quite fun. Anyway, it turns out, even though I'm Jake, I got pregnant at 18, which was an interesting twist to his tail. And, you know, everyone was really gutted and I'm just preparing for motherhood. It's quite funny, really. But, you know, this is what happens when you train things off biased human-generated data. And we've got the same. And we've got the same kind of things which happen now in the image and video analysis space. There's really amazing advances here. You know, we can start playing around with some of this cycle gang type work, which is really amazing. Like, how the hell did they start transferring context onto zebra context onto a horse? It's a really, just really simple but smart idea, which is that, okay, before. Okay, before we would typically need sort of paired data. So, supposing if you want to map between a shoe and its outline, before you would need paired data, but there's some really interesting work on how we're like advancing some of these sort of deep neural architectures where you could have unpaired data. And the idea is, is that you've got the idea is you try to build a bijective map. So you can't make it quite bijective, but you've got one map forward. But you've got one map forward, you've got a different map back, and you create a loss function which penalizes the difference between your forward map composed with your backwards map compared to the identity operator. And just really smart idea. And you're able to shift context from one set to another set. Sorry, sorry, I can actually show you this a little bit earlier here. So you can go from Bit earlier here. So you can go from Monet to photos, zebras to horses, summer to winter, this kind of thing. It's a really, it's really amazing what we're able to do now. You know, that's really cool. These are all like, you know, there's a lot of work being done in sort of AI and ML in social media and kind of the sort of audio visual world. What on earth can we do with biological data? We do with biological data? Really, where I'm excited by is what can be done with knowledge graphs, where you've got these giant networks of different diseases, symptoms, genes, side effects, and go terms. And you've got all of these different relationships, and you're trying to navigate this to understand biology. And so, really, if we take a step back, what a lot of the quantitative modelers are doing is. A lot of the quantitative modelers are doing is going, like, okay, well, there's just these key genes which we want to study, and so you know, this is all really noisy. And you know, you can end up 20,000 genes in the human body, you've got, you know, just countless drugs that could potentially be made. And, you know, if you're trying to look at how all of this ties together, you're really in the machine learning statistics space. But if you want to study something closely, you want to start thinking about. Closely, you want to start thinking about ODEs and trying to just study that kind of system in a very refined manner, which I will admit in a lot of cases is much more useful. But you've got to know what's important first, and then you can get to that stage. So, with all of the examples that people were saying before, they kind of knew what mechanism they were trying to get at. The bit which a lot of the data sets out there at the moment is the big problem is that they can't really deal with. Problem is that they can't really deal with a lot of the complexities of biology. So, you know, you've got epigenetics, post-translational modifications, non-coding RNA. There's just so much there that we really can't deal with it all, should we say. But, you know, people are trying and they are succeeding and they're getting there. I mean, there's so much money at stake that, you know, people are definitely going to give this a shot. Really, we've got to break down the pipe. Really, we've got to break down the pipeline and look at where machine learning and AI can help. You know, when you're earlier on in the pipeline, you're really looking at things like target ID, indication, characterization, design of these new chemical entities and new biological entities. You know, if there was one of our portfolio companies, which is called In Silico Medicine, I mean, they've been incredibly successful by using some of the Using some of these sort of, I believe they were using, I believe it was a GAN framework, or it may have been a VAE framework. I need to remind myself. But, you know, they were using these frameworks to actually look at how, you know, just designing small molecules from scratch, or at least getting a very good template and adding to that later. And so they had this very fast turnaround time where you could give them a protein target which you thought was interesting, and they could generate. You thought it was interesting, and they could generate the chemical matter around it. There's loads and loads of other players within this space. Recursion are doing a lot of work with imaging. Other people are working more on the biochemical molecular docking simulations. Other people are working with like natural language processing and how to uptake these giant documents. But what's really interesting for me, at least, is sort of later on in the pipeline, how can we? On in the pipeline, how can we maximize the benefit of drugs which have already shown which are already shown to be safe? So you can do drug repurposing, drug resurrection. I thought it would be good to actually just talk quickly about one of the companies, again, within our portfolio. What they're really interested in is that, well, you might have a clinical trial. The clinical trial went wrong, but it does work for some patients. So the question is. Patients. So the question is: how do you identify those patients? And you can uptake omic data and find those clusters in that really high-dimensional space. And that's a trickier problem than one would imagine because, you know, well, we're in a, you know, it's just the, you know, the curse of dimensionality is probably what I'm getting at here. There's also now, you know, people are looking at like post-launch when you've got a drug on the market, how on earth do you actually How on earth do you actually make people pay for it? How can you actually show that your drug works? You've spent all of this money developing it. But if you've got a bunch of people on statins or something, these are quite cheap now. So why would they jump to a much more expensive drug? So you've really got to show the benefit for what you're doing, especially in the UK where you've got a sort of national. In the UK, where you've got a sort of nationalized system. I'm not going to talk about this so much because I've probably not got the time, but I just want to close things out and just say, well, you know, this is a really emerging and exciting space. One of the issues is that, you know, there's still a lot of regulation that needs to be done to actually get it such that, you know, you can't just go around saying, like, I've got my black box and it's going to give. Black box, and it's going to give you all of the answers because as soon as it goes wrong, then you know, one, they won't let you do it, and two, you know, you should be liable for a bunch of mistakes which you made. And, you know, we shouldn't see ourselves as immortal in this space. We're definitely, you know, helping a process as opposed to guiding it. And the other big thing is, no matter what we do as quantitative professionals, you've got to know that, like, there's still huge. Know that, like, there's still huge amounts of problems with actually the delivery of medicine. You know, there's like actually really low compliance, even within doctors who are actually being told, you know, wash your hands. And, you know, other people, you know, take your medication. We'd actually just do so much better if we could just tell people to take their medication and they actually would do it. That's it from me. You can reach me at jacobrelationrx.com on. At relationrx.com, and I also tweet and do LinkedIn once in a while. So, thanks you so much, everyone. And I've got five minutes before I've got a jump. So, maybe do questions for me first. Yeah, thanks a lot, Jake. Very interesting. So, then let's have questions for Jake, if there are any. So, Jake, is there a disease you are currently working on particularly? Oh, yeah. Yeah, so we were kind of trundling along at the beginning of this year, and we had our designs for our technology stacks and everything there. And of course, COVID happened and we actually started looking into well, what did happen? So we were looking at all of the repurposing which was happening within COVID-19, or you would see like literally. 19, or you would see like literally 10 papers a day where people would say, Oh, you know, what we should really be using is metformin for COVID, or we should really be using, you know, hydrochloroquinine or whatever it is. And, you know, you'd see paper after paper, which was just throwing random suggestions out there. And the real issue was, in my mind, that one, no one was going to. One, no one was going to act on any of this. Like, you know, you throw a paper out and you just throw it into the nether, and that's it. The other bit is that, you know, viruses are an evolutionary disease, like with all of the talk on oncology earlier. Tumors evolve, viruses evolve, bacteria evolve. And so, you know, the way to get around this is to actually think about polytherapies or combination therapies. About polytherapies or combination therapies, where you're not going after one mechanism of action, you're going after multiple together. With so really, we kind of came to this conclusion that we need to go after combination therapies and we need to have experimental evidence for what we're doing with COVID. So we thought, well, actually, let's do a high-throughput screen. But then we're kind of hit by another problem, which is high-throughput screen. Problem which is high-throughput screens will work for you know thousands of molecules. Uh, the guys at Big Pharma can do way more than us because we've not got the money. Um, but you know, how do we do a high-throughput screen in an educated way? When you've got 4,000 drugs to repurpose, you know, that means you've got millions of drug pairs you could go for, or, you know, probably billions of triplets or quadruplets of drugs you could try together to find sort of synergistic combinations. To find sort of synergistic combinations. So, what we're now doing is we applied to the Gates Foundation with Mila, which is the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms. And they were having some similar ideas around could we try drug combinations experimentally. And we put together a grant, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have funded us. So, this has been really exciting. And, you know, we're now looking at doing some high-throughput. Know we're now looking at doing some high-throughput screening work for COVID-19, so but looking at different aspects, mainly viral entry and replication using different cell lines for that. Okay, interesting. Yeah, very interesting. Yeah, so in the chat, there was no other question showing up. I have a question. Yeah. Hi, Hariana Thomas, a second-year PhD student at Oklahoma State. Very interesting talk. Talk and my question is: So, compared to the other speakers, yours was more focused on AI, theirs was more mechanistic modeling. They seem to have that. So, what is the relationship, I guess, in Pharma when you guys are building these models between AI and mechanistic modeling? Like, do those two work together or is it more kind of so you know, I mean, I think. You know, I mean, I think really the reason why these things take so long is, you know, well, one, we didn't have omics before, but now we do. But still, things are a slow process, even with omic data. So if you think about it, you know, what does RNA-seq data look like? So you've got like some disease cells and you've got some healthy cells, and you do RNA-seq on both of them, and you start counting. And you start counting how many reads you get of all the genes in the genome. So you've got 20,000 genes. Let's just say some tissue of interest expresses 8,000. And then you've got 8,000 statistical tests to do where you'd say, is this number higher than this number? What's going on? Are these genes dysregulated or not? And you're really in this statistics space where you've got to use, you can't just use p-values, you've got to use adjusted p-values to work out what's statistically significant or not. What's statistically significant or not? Eventually, you'll kind of get to a point where you've looked at one, maybe you've got some mouse model of a disease, sort of an in vitro model, you've done a profiling study where you've taken in some patients, and you'll start like trying to, you'll see certain patterns over and over again of genes you should be interested in.
