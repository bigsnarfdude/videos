So, I'm going to talk about character shifts on Tori over local fields. This is joint work with my student Sania Wag. So, to begin, let me quickly recall the local Langlands correspondence for Tori. So, local Langlands for Torai so So let me say K is a non-Archimedean local field. FQ is the residue field, finite residue field this ring of integers O And pie a generator of maximal ideal ideal okay, so first of all, we have the we have this We have this absolute Galva group of K, and inside it we have this ramification subgroup and its quotient is Z hat and inside Z hat we have the way group which is the pre-image of the integers sitting inside here and And yeah, and then we have the reciprocity isomorphism of local class field theory. So this is an isomorphism between the multiplicative group of K and the abelianization of the W group as topological groups. As topological groups. So this is essentially the local lung lens for the multiplicative group. And more generally, if you have any torus over K, then the way group is acting on this. Acting on this character and co-character lattices and yeah, and it acts via a final via a finite quotient via finite quotient and so uh Uh so uh yeah, so we form the dual group over let's say complex numbers and the uh the semi-direct product uh let's say L T which is defined to be let's see and then the The local Langlands correspondence says that if you look at so this says that if you take smooth homomorphisms from T of K to C this See this can be canonically identified with the local Lung lens parameters, which is homomorphisms to this modulo conjugation by the dual torus and. Taurus and this can be also thought of as H1 of the wave group with values in this torus. So that's the local Langland's correspondence for Tori. So in this talk, I want to talk about a geometric analog of this statement. Statement. So, for that, let me. Yeah, so the geometric analog is going to be in terms of character sheaves. So, first, let me say a few words about character sheaves on, let's say, so for this talk, I'll only need commutative groups. So, let me talk about character she is. On connected commutative pro algebraic groups. So in this setting, these character shields are also called multiplicative local systems. So, I'm only going to define multiplicative local systems on connected groups. So, let me point out that Clifton Cunningham and David Rowe have considered similar questions and they define multiplicative local systems on possibly disconnected groups. But I will just talk about multiplicative local systems on connected groups. So, yeah, so first. Yeah, so first, so let's see what are the groups we are looking at. So, yeah, so let's let now K be any algebraically closed field. So, this is small k. So, this is essentially going to be the residue field. You know, when we, so capital K denotes local field, and small k is going to be play the role of the residue field. So let's small k be an algebraically closed field. Characteristic of k can be zero or positive. And so in positive characteristic, it will be more convenient for us to not work with algebraic groups, but perfectization of algebraic groups. So these are called quasi-algebraic groups. And we are only considering Uh, and uh, and we are only considering commutative for this talk. So, so I'll denote Q, the category of quasi algebraic groups over let's say commutative, commutative quasi-algebraic. And so basically, these are just perfectizations of smooth group schemes over K. And so Ser has studied the pro completion of this category. So we let P be the. So this is an abelian category, of course. So this is an abelian category of quasi-algebraic groups, of I mean commutative quasi-algebraic groups and P is the category of commutative pro-algebraic groups or pro-quasi-algebraic, but we're going to call them pro-algebraic groups. So yeah, so this is a category that has been studied in detail by SARE in 1960. By Sir. And so he proves that this is a very nice abelian category and it has enough projectives and has all projective. All projective limits has all projective limits. And so basically any object here, any object in this category can be thought of as a projective limit of a quasi-algebraic group, which is just a commutative connected. Commutative connected algebra group or a perfectization of such an object. So, yeah, so you know, if G is something, it's possible to define the connected component. So, if G is written as such a projective limit, then its connected component is simply the take the projective limit of the connected components of. The connected components of these objects. So, the first thing So, right. So, yeah, once we define G naught, maybe let me okay, let me just write it here. So, then once you have G naught, so that's like the connected component of a pro algebraic group. So, we define pi naught of G to be this quotient G mod G. G mod g naught and it so basically this is a uh well uh it so this so inside P there is a category of you know projective limits of just finite abelian groups so finite abelian group can be considered as a pro-algebraic group so so basically this is the category sitting inside P of of pro finite pro finite abelian groups so yeah so this yeah so we have this functor pi naught from p to p0 and this is a right exact functor and cell defines the higher homotopy groups as the left derived functor The left derived functors of uh so define pi i so yeah so pi naught is right exact so define pi i to be left derived functors of Functors of pi naught. And so basically, so all these, you know, I'm going to state various results which were proven by a cell. So pi i is actually zero for i greater than equal to two. So basically there's only Basically, there's only pi0 and pi one. And yeah, and moreover, you know, given any, by the way, you say that something is connected if pi naught of g is trivial. So, say I also prove that any group, let's say any connected group has a universal cover in the sense that. Cover in the sense that so basically he proved that you have this so if G is connected, it has a universal cover. So basically, this So basically, this means so that you know pi one of g is g bar is trivial and g bar is connected. And you know if the group is disconnected, g bar can be defined to be the universal cover of its g naught. So here let me say g connected. But for disconnected, also, well, you get one more term in the exact sequence, which is pi 1 g to g bar to g. So the image here will just be the, if g is disconnected, the image here will just be the connected component. And when you go mod that, it's pi naught. So So for the general G, in this category of pro-algebraic groups. So, by the way, let me just say that. So, this is, you know, there is a notion of ital fundamental group, but this is slightly different from that. In fact, this pipe one is going to be. That in fact, this pi one is going to be a quotient of the ital fundamental group because the ital fundamental group doesn't take into account the group structure of G. So, if you forget the group structure and take the ital fundamental group, this sales pi 1 is going to be a quotient of that. So, now let me define a multiplicative local system. So, definition. Definition let G be connected so then well the I guess the easiest way to define okay so I'm going to also fix an L which is invertible in our ground field K. So L. k so l invertible in k and then we are looking at we are going to look at eladic local systems so uh yeah so a multiplicative local system on g well the simplest way to define it is It is let's say a continuous homomorphism is a continuous homomorphism from the fundamental group from the SARS fundamental group to the units of QL bar with the eladic topology. So, as you see, this is the quotient of the etal fundamental group. So, a character, so a continuous eladic character. Character, so a continuous eladic character corresponds to a one rank one local system. And this is so we are taking characters of this, you know, pi one as defined by a share. So, you know, corresponding to this, there is this eladic local system on G. And an alternative way to define a multiplicative local system is a local system. A local system such that, you know, so G, so let Î¼ from G to G be the multiplication map. So equivalently, this. So if you have a, so then the pullback by the multiplication is just the box product of. So you could define a multiplicative local system in either of these ways. System in either of these ways. So for us, it will be convenient to define a multiplicative local system as just a representation of the fundamental group. Okay, so yeah, so I want to talk about a nice class of profinite groups, which is called admissible. So G so G in P is said to be admissible. If G can be written as a projective limit of Gi, where the maps, there are various maps between. So this map, the kernel of this map, should be connected and unipotent. That so this kernel is connected and unipotent and then uh And then, uh, okay, so now let's see what happens for admissible, uh, you know, so write G as a projective limit where you know each of these kernels is connected and unipotent. So then, in fact, okay, so let me call the character sheaves on G. By this, I mean the set of all, in fact, it's an abelian group, it's an abelian group of all. abelian group it's an abelian group of all homomorphisms from pi1 g2 so it's the set of all multiplicative local systems so uh yeah so in this case uh can this is just the direct limit or the union of character sheaves on each GI so basically if g is admissible every you know see g has Every, you know, see G has this finite dimensional quotients Gi. But if G is admissible, then every multiplicative local system comes from some quotient. This is not true if G is not admissible. So this is a property of admissible. So here you need the fact that for unipotent things, the fundamental group is a pro-P group, and we're looking at eladic things. Things so essentially that's used to you know to get this. So this is only true for G admissible. Okay, so right, so now I talked about character sheaves on pro-algebraic groups. So now let me come to Torai. Me come to Torai. So, okay, so now I'm going to have a slightly different setting. So, now I take capital K brev. Okay, so now yeah, so now this is a complete discrete valuation field such that the residue field is algebraically closed. So, this is an algebra with an algebraically closed residue field. And so, O brev, integers, the ring of integers, and pi, again, the uniformizing parameter. Okay, so we will work in this setting and we consider a torus defined over Kbreve. So, you know, we want to think of objects which are defined over local fields as geometric objects over the residue field. Objects over the residue field, and that is the way to do this, which is called this loop functor. So, let me quickly describe that. So, yeah, so let's say we have some, okay, some suppose we have a scheme over, let's say X is a nice scheme, finite type over K brave. Let's say even affine. So let's say Y is. And let's say y is a scheme over the ring of integers. So we're going to define two, I mean, we are going to associate some geometric objects defined over the residue field. So yeah, so of course the residue field is K. So we want to define a geometric object. So we need to look at K algebras. But since we are in the world of these perfect group schemes, we look at group schemes. We look at R, a perfect K algebra. And then we have this width. This is the ramified width vectors. Okay. So this well, let's say okay, if we are in the Okay, if we are in the equal characteristic case, then it is just the power series in equal characteristic. And this is so how do we define this in the mixed characteristic? Take the unramified width vectors. So this is an algebra. So, this is an algebra over Wk with the unramplified width vectors, and this ring of integers is an algebra over this. So, we define this ramified with vectors in this way. So, this is in mixed characteristic. So, and then we define. And then we define these geometric objects over the residue field. So let's say LX, this is called the loop variety of X. So its R points are simply going to be the points of X with values in. So this take the width. Take the width and invert the uniformizing parameter. So, this can be defined for any x defined over k brev. But if you have something integral, you can define something called the l plus y. So, this is going to be plus y of W. So this is actually an ind scheme. So this is an inductive limit of schemes. And this is a scheme of infinite, it's an infinite dimensional scheme, but yeah, I mean, it is a scheme. Okay, so right, so now Okay, so right. So now we have, so okay, so for us, we had a torus defined over K brev. And actually, any torus has what is known as the connected neuron model over the ring of integers. So, so yeah, so I mean, actually, I should maybe use a different letter for the integer model, but since the connected neuron model is functorial. The connected neuron model is functorial in T. I will use the same T. This is the integral model, which is the connected neuron model. So we can, you know, we have now this. have now this L T and L plus T. So in fact, this L plus T is in fact and you know it's in fact a pro-algebraic group. So this is and it's even admissible. So this L plus T is and also since we're taking the connector neuron model L plus T is T is yeah, so L plus T lies in P admissible and connected. So this means that now you know we can talk about character sheaves on L plus T. So yeah, let me see how I'm doing. Okay, so Right, so uh all right, so the first question is: We want to study character shield use on L plus T. So the study character shields on L plus T. So the first question is what is the fundamental group of L plus T and so the first result of this type was proved by Ser so the so in Ser old result in 1961 which is geometric local class field theory. So you know you look at G and You look at Gm over K brev or O brev. And so Ser proved that pi 1 of the loop group of G M is the abelianization of the absolute Galva group of K brace. So this is so So, this is so this is as topological groups. So, both are profinite groups, so as topological groups. So, and right, okay. Now, suppose we have a finite Galois extension of K brev. So, suppose E brev. Suppose E brave over K brave is a finite Galois extension. Then, you know, okay, so we have this zero twelve. So this is a finite group. So, this is a finite group here, and in this case, there is a you know transfer. Okay, so first of all, this acts on the abelianization. So, this finite Galwa group, sorry, Galwa group of will act on the abelianization of this group. And in fact, there is this transfer homomorphism which goes from the abelianization of this to abelianization of that. And its injective and its images. Okay, so let okay. So let me write it. So in fact, you have a transfer map from So, let me call this finite quotient to be gamma state galva okay, so uh okay so we have this transfer map so uh so So this is the pi1 by SER. This is a pi1 of L plus gm. This, you know, you do the same, but you now look at gm not over k brave, but over e brave. So this is pi one of I'm going to denote L E brave plus. So this E brave. So, this eBrev means we're doing this loop construction over this bigger field. So, you know, by SAR, we have these thing and this loop group sits inside this as the gamma invariance. And in fact, this diagram commutes. So basically, this is compatible with. This is compatible with the transfer homomorphism. So, that's those are the results of SERE. Now, we again look at any torus, any torus defined over K Brev. So, and let's say, so it will. So, it will split over some finite Galois extension. Suppose it splits over eBrave finite Galva as before, EBREV is a finite Galva extension. So, yeah, so then, of course, the Galva group, the Surjection to gamma and this gamma is acting on this character lat co-character and character lattices and we can form the you know the dual group now over QL bar so so So, we form the dual group and L T is defined to be, okay, maybe let me write it here. L T is defined to be T dual semi-direct product Galva group of A brace. A brave okay, so okay, so let me now state the first result that we proved. So yeah, so the first result is that pi 1 of L plus T is canonically isomorphic to take the O character lattice tensor over Z with and then take the gamma invariance here. So apparently this may seem like it depends on this choice of Galaxy, but it's easy to see that in fact you. You know if you have another, if you have a bigger Galva extension When there is a so using the transfer map, there is a canonical identification between these two and this diagram commute so yeah, so maybe second. Maybe second statement is that it's functorial in to ride, so it's basically let me just see how I'm doing on time. So, yeah, let me not go into the. I mean, it's easy to figure out what this should mean. I want to say that, say, a statement about induced Tori. What happens for induced Tori? So if T prime, okay, so is the restriction of scalars. So suppose K prime is a separable extension of Extension of so the I take a separable extension of K-brave and define this induced torus. So then you know this induced the loop group of the induced torus well it's exactly same Exactly the same as the loop construction of this. So since I'm a little bit behind on time, so let me just say that this, you know, so there are two ways to compute the pi one of this, and they are compatible. So you can either do it over K brave or over K prime brave, but these are. Over K prime wave, but these are compatible. Okay, so that's about the fundamental group. And the next result is about multiplicative local systems. So now, yeah, so yeah, so basically, what do we have, right? So I defined this L T, which was like the Langlands dual group. Dual group. So, okay, so if we have a torus over K brave, you know, so the tori over K brave, it forms an additive category. And so, one, so given such a torus, we can associate an abelian group, which is the character sheaves on L plus T. So, this is like one functor from tori over to abelian groups. And there's another functor which is inertial. So, given such a torrent, you associate a Langlands parameter, which is a map homomorphism from Galva group. Galva group to this that L group. So but these are over Q L bar now and such that and up to equivalence. And as I said, this can be identified with H1, but now in the eladic topology. Now in the eladic topology from Yeah, so now we have these two functors from Tori over K brave to abelian groups which is character sheaves on L plus T and so I'm calling these inertial Langdon's parameters. So yeah, so the next theorem is Theorem is that the about two functions, I mean, there is an there exists a unique there exists unique natural isomorphism between about two functors Which is compatible with the third statement here. So, basically, what this means is that for every torus, this abelian group is so the set of characters. So, the set of character sheaves is the same as the set of, I mean, the abelian group of character sheaves on L plus T is canonically identified with the abelian group of inertial inertial local Langlands parameters for the torus. Okay, so right, okay, so now. Okay, so now any questions? Okay, so now let me. Okay, so now we so there is this inertial, you know, this is like the, you could think of this as a geometric analog of the earlier statement, which was the Langland's correspondence for Tori. But now I want to relate these two, so I want to relate this to the classical local. The classical local Langlands correspondence for Toray. So, for this, let me talk about the sheaf to function correspondence. So, I talked about character sheaves on pro-algebraic groups, but now I want to talk about the sheaf-to-function correspondence. How much time do I have? Nothing else. Okay. Yeah, that's okay. So, you know, if so, let me go back to the setup of pro-algebraic groups. So, now suppose, so now let's take K to be To be the algebraic closure of a finite field, and we look at pro-algebraic groups. So, let G be, well, a pro-algebraic group. But let's say it's defined over FQ. So, okay, so I'm just going to say, assume that G is like a limit of GI and each GI is defined over FQ. Q. All these are so now you know basically there is the Frobenius now acting on G. So in fact, Frobenius will act on the set of character sheaves. So Frobenius will act on the set of character sheaves. And And we look at the fixed points. So we look at character sheaves, which are okay, let me say G connected. And on the other hand, we can look at this FQ points of. G. So basically, what the sheaf to function correspondence says is that let's say eladic. So this is a profinite group and the eladic. So the characters of these FQ points can be canonically identified. Be canonically identified with the Frobenius fixed character sheaves. And so these are the eladic. Something nice happens for admissible. So if G is also admissible, G is admissible, then in fact, the allylic homomorphisms. The allylic homomorphisms are the same as the smooth homomorphisms. So, smooth means they factor through one of these GI of FQ. So, in the local Langlands correspondence, we are usually concerned with the smooth representations. So, if the group is admissible, then in fact, LADIC and smooth characters are the same. This is not true in general, but for admissible ones. So, So, right, so now let's come back to the setting of the local Langlands correspondence. So, now we had a T which was defined over a local field K. So, K brave is going to be like the completion of the maximal unramified extension. So, yeah, so one thing is that. Well one thing is that you have this okay, so in this case we have sort of this in fact in you know this L T so so this L plus T you can think of it as a connected component of L T. So, I mean this is like think of this as the these are the integral points and these are the points over the field and this you know in the in this provider And this, you know, in this pro-algebraic setting, this is the connected component of this, and the quad-width homomorphism says that we have this exact sequence. This is the quotes homomorphism for a torus, and this is the co-invariance for the Yeah, so let me ten minutes. So, right, so and okay, so we have you know, this is like an exact sequence of some sort of end group schemes or group in, I mean, whatever. So, like, so and the thing is, this is connected, so so and Is connected so and pro algebraic. So actually, yeah, so this actually gives you so actually what I want to say is we have this T of O take the I mean so again this is just coming from the quote width homomorphism to So, now you know this Galva group of K brave is the inertia group because K was a local field and K brave is the completion of the maximal unramified. So, I'm going to write the inertia group here and the Frobenius invariance. So Yeah, so we have some this thing, and so now let's take the we have this exact sequence, the integral points sitting inside the rational points, and by the quotwitz homomorphism, the quotient is you know the co the inertia coinvariance and then taking the Frobenius invariance of. The Frobenius invariance of that. So when you dualize it, so let me just dualize that exact sequence and it remains exact when you do that. When you do that, so I'm taking the elliptic characters of all of these groups. And since you know this quotient is discrete and we are looking at admissible groups, the elliptic characters will be the same as the smooth. Will be same as the smooth character. So, this dual is also the smooth dual. So, characters of this, this is and the characters of the integral points. So, by the local Langlands correspondence, this can be identified. So, for now, it will be convenient for me to write it as. Convenient for me to write it as H1 L Adic. So is the local Lung Lance parameters. And again, here it's you, in fact, it's doesn't matter if I replace this by smooth. If I replace it. By smooth. If I replace it, so it's possible to show that I can replace this by smooth. And so let me erase this line because I have to so and this, right? So remember, this is like the Remember this is like the T so T of O is L plus T F Q points and the characters of this are given by Frobenius table character sheaves. And now the Frobenius, you know, the character sheaves are given by inertial Lung Length parameters. Inertial Lung Lance parameters. So inertial Lung Lance parameters is this H1 L ADIC. So these are all the character sheaves, but to get characters of the FQ points, I need to take the Frobenius fixed ones. And, you know. And, you know, so this okay, so this way group is acting on this, and you know, you have this sort of inflation, you know, so there is an inflation restriction sequence for this group cohomology. So, and this one will be H1 of Z comma. So this identification comes from the so that you know top exact sequence is just coming by dualizing the quotes homomorphism. The bottom sequence is this inflation restriction sequence for this group homology. Group cohomology. This identification comes from the local Lung Lungs correspondence. This identification comes from our result about character sheaves. So the final theorem is that sort of this diagram commutes. So basically our identification here is compatible with the local Lungland's correspondence. So So and this is sort of a you it's easy to see there is a canonical identification between these two I mean this can also be thought of as the take this take the invariance under inertia and then take the Frobenius so because this is H1 of you know this is acting by the Frobenius so taking H1 is like taking So, taking H1 is like taking the Frobenius coinvariance. Okay, so I'm almost out of time. Okay, I have two minutes. So, I just wanted to say something about character sheaves on. So, I define character sheaves on the connected part. I want to define character sheaves on all of this. So, you know, character sheaves. You know, character sheaves on the whole of this, you know, as they're supposed, you know, they're supposed to lie in this equivalent category of, you know, look at the conjugation action of L T on itself. So the character sheets are supposed to lie here. Now, so the you know, the connector component of L T is L plus T. And so, sort of, you know, we're taking equivariance with respect to a disconnected group. So, this equivariance structure will involve representations of the group of connected components, which is this. So, this is the group of connected components. So, and what you can do is we know what are the character shapes on the connected component. We just translate it to. Translate it to various connected components. So, this is on the neutral connected component, but we take those, translate it to various connected components, and then take equivariant structure corresponding to different characters of this. So, let me just say that the character shifts on L T associated with. So, I fix an inertial Lunglance parameter. We can show that. We can show that, so basically, this will be in bijection. First, you have to see each character sheaf is supported on one connected component. So, connected components are parameterized by this. So, this tells you the connector component where the character sheaf is supported. But there is also this equivariant structure. Equivariant structure that you should give. And this equivariance structure is given by the character of this group, which in fact can be shown to be. Okay, anyway, so it's like the so what do I want to say? It's just the, you know, yeah, so just the dual of this, which is like the TQ. And the yeah. So, corresponding to each Langland's parameter, the character sheaves corresponding to every inertial parameter are given by this. So, okay, but maybe let me not. Okay, but maybe let me not say more because I'm out of time. So I'll stop here.
