Hello, everyone, and welcome to my talk on the causes of moderate and extreme hydrological droughts and how these different causes or drivers differ with event magnitude. So, a little different definition from the definition Gabi used. We're still talking about a slightly related phenomenon. This time, we're focusing on stream flow droughts rather than Stream flow droughts rather than heat waves, but we're staying in the same type of events. I want to start by showing you this picture, which was taken a week ago in one of Switzerland's larger river basins, the M. And as you can see, this river basin completely dried out last week. And we currently see similar pictures. We currently see similar pictures of very dry rivers in northern Italy, where the Po River, for example, is experiencing one of its lowest water levels on record. These type of drought events, they're currently triggered by a mixture of snow melt deficits, which arise from the fact that the winter was rather dry and snow accumulated. Dry and snow accumulation was far below average. And the fact that these regions have, in the past few weeks or even months, experienced very little rainfall. So these events, they arise from a mixture of different processes, namely rainfall deficits, but also snowmelt contributions. Different types of events are triggered by different causes. There might be other events that are might be other events that are purely driven by rainfall deficits and others that are purely driven by snow melt deficits and other types of causes and triggers. In this type I like to explore how the different causes of stream flow droughts vary across Europe and I want to ask whether moderate and severe droughts that's droughts that happen once in a while versus droughts that In a vial versus droughts that are very rare, and we want to know whether these types, different types of events which differ in terms of severity, are also driven by different types of processes. In order to look at this question, I've identified a large sample data set of a bit more than 800 nearly natural catchments in Europe. What does nearly natural mean? What does nearly natural mean? Nearly natural means that these river basins are uninfluenced by large dams. And we consider that the stream flow signal observed in these catchments is mainly driven by natural processes and climate variability. For each of these catchments, we identify a set of drought events by applying once. By applying one specific definition, and as in Galve's case, obviously there's different definitions you can use to define a drought. What we did here was define droughts as stream flow anomalies. We start with a raw time series of stream flow at daily resolution, and to make sure that the events we identify are roughly independent of each other, we, in the first step, smooth the time series. Smooth the time series by applying a moving window approach. In a second step, we then compute a threshold that varies by season. That means we compute the percentiles of stream flow for each day of the year across the different years, and we use that threshold to identify drought events as those events where the stream flow falls below that threshold. So, as you can see in this example, we identify Example: We identify droughts as anomalies. That means the stream flow is below or far below average or below the 15th percentile to be more specific in that particular season. Then, for each of the events in each catchment, we look at different drought characteristics. We look at the drought duration, that's the number of days between the start of event where. Start of event where flow falls below our threshold until the day when it again exceeds that threshold. We look at the stream flow deficit accumulated of this event duration. That's just the sum of stream flow we're lacking compared to our threshold. And then, third, we're looking at stream flow intensity. That's just the minimum flow during any particular drought event. Event. Now, to answer our question about the different hydrometrological drivers of drought events, we here propose a drought classification scheme that subdivides drought events into different governing processes or causes. The approach we propose here differentiates between rainfall-driven events that are the result of the Events that are the results of rainfall deficits and snow-related deficits that develop if the drought event is to some degree related to what's happening in the winter season. So in the first step, we ask whether our drought events was proximally driven by rainfall deficits in summer. If the answer to that question is yes, then we go into that left. Yes, then we go into that left rainfall-driven branch and ask another set of questions that allows us to attribute that event to one out of three different drought classes. In order to attribute that event to one of these three classes, we have to ask another set of questions. The first of one being whether that rainfall deficit transitions into the snow season, that means we have a rainfall deficit. We have a rainfall deficit, and at some point it starts to snow, which means that no more runoff is actually formed, and we're prolonging the drought into the winter season. If the answer to that question is again yes, then we assign that event to the class of rain to snow season droughts and use this class to describe our event. If the answer is no, then we talk about a purely rainfall-driven event that Driven event that, as a main driver, had this initial rainfall deficit. Now, let's go back to define our third drought class. If the answer to the question of whether the rainfall deficit happened in summer is no, then we ask a further question, which is whether our rainfall deficit period transitioned into the dry season into fall where evapotranspiration. Where evapotranspiration was particularly high, and our deficit continues because we had these elevated evapotranspiration rates. If the answer to that question is yes, then we call our drought a wet to dry season drought. And if the answer is no, it's again just a purely rainfall deficit driven drought. Now let's move to the snow-driven branch. And if we don't And if we don't see this initial rainfall deficit, we go into that second branch and we have to ask another set of questions to attribute our drought events to four different drought classes. We first ask whether the stream flow deficit we observe happened in the snow season, that's in winter. If the answer to that question is yes, then we ask, Is yes. Then we ask: Was snow accumulation possible in the winter season? Which means the temperature, the question is then basically whether the temperature fell below zero degrees. If the answer is yes, then we talk about a cold snow season drought, which was caused by the fact that there was snow accumulation instead of runoff formation. If the answer is no, we have to ask. Answer is no, we have to ask even more questions to assign it to another class. And we ask: was there snow available in winter, which has already melted? If the answer is yes, then we talk about warm snow season droughts. There was snow, but it's already melted too early. If the answer is no, we'll talk about Will talk about a drought that cannot be assigned to any specific class. Now, let's move to our last branch and see what happens if the stream flow deficit happened outside of the snow season. Then we ask whether there was snow available for melt. If yes, or no snow was available for melt, then we talk about a snow melt drought, and that's the type of drought we're The type of drought we're observing right now in the catchment I've shown you in the beginning, or also in the Po Valley. If the answer is no, so if there was snow available, we check whether the catchment is glaciarized. If yes, then we talk about a glacier melt drought caused by the lack of glacier melt in that season. If no, then we cannot assign our We cannot assign our drought to any specific process, and we're assuming that this is some sort of a composite drought caused by a mixture of different processes. So now let's take that scheme and apply it to our large sample of catchments in Europe. An example of how this works, you here see in solid black lines our stream flow. The dashed line represents the smooth curve. Represents the smooth curve and the gray line, our drought threshold. And for each of these droughts, we've now assigned one of these nine different or eight different drought types. We're going to repeat this analysis for all our catchments, and we're first having a look at how the different drought characteristics vary by drought generation process or by the cause behind the drought event. Behind the drought events. If we look at mean drought duration across all the different drought types, we see that it's mainly the rainfall-driven events that show long durations, while these more snow-influenced events, they have shorter durations and are a bit less severe in terms of that characteristic. This is a phenomenon we also observe for the deficit. Again, the Again, the more rainfall-driven events show larger deficits than the snowmelt-driven events, with an exception of the glacier melt droughts that can also be characterized by pretty large deficits. Last, let's look at minimum flow. Here we can also say that the rainfall-driven events in blue, they are those events with the most severe low flow. Severe low flow, so the lowest flow, while these more snowmelt-driven events, they still have relatively to the rainfall deficit routes, higher minimum flow and are therefore a bit less severe. So, in summary, overall, what we learned from this graph is that rainfall deficits rainfall or droughts driven by rainfall deficits, they have, they are more severe in terms of. They are more severe in terms of both duration, deficit, and minimum flow compared to the snow-driven droughts. If we now want to look at spatial variability in these different drought types, we can just, for a first assessment, look at which drought type occurs most frequently in each of these basins. And I here call this the dominant drought type. The dominant drought type over The dominant drought type over large parts of Europe, if we look at all events combined, is purely rainfall deficit-driven droughts. In the West and in Scandinavia, there are some catchments in the Alps and in Northern Europe where cold snow season droughts caused by snow accumulation are the main driver of drought events. Now, this dominant drought driver depends on the season if we Depends on the season. If we look at the droughts that happen in winter, we see that it's still these rainfall-driven events and the cold snow season droughts that dominate. But if we look at the summer droughts, which are the types of events we're usually interested in if we look at water management or water supply, we see that these processes or these droughts are driven by different processes. Processes. If you look at the catchments in the Alps in green, you see that they're mostly driven by snowmelt deficits. That's again the type of process we see currently in parts of the river basins in Switzerland and also in northern Italy. And in the west, we see that wet to dry season droughts are important. These were the droughts that are initially triggered by a rainfall deficit, but prolong into the dry season between. Long into the dry season between and enhanced or enhanced by evapotranspiration anomalies. Now, this dominant drought type is just one maybe way of looking at these droughts from a pretty puristic view, but actually if we zoom in and look at each individual catchment, we see that all these different events in a catchment are driven by slightly different processes, and one process might be One process might be more important than the other ones, but it's actually a mix of processes that is important within each catchment. In order to show this, I've computed the relative importance of each of the drought types in each individual catchment, which you see here plotted as bar plots. And my catchments, they're sorted from warm, that means low elevation and low latitude catchments. And low latitude catchments on the left, two cold depths, high altitude and high latitude catchments on the right. You see that each catchment has a unique combination of different drought types and this distribution or the relative importance of the different drought types changes as we move from the warmer catchments on the left to the colder catchments on the right. For example, we see that in these For example, we see that in these high elevation catchments, snowmelt-driven droughts are much more important than in the low elevation catchments. And we also see, for example, that this process of rain to snow season droughts becomes only relevant in catchments at certain altitudes. Now, coming back to my initial question, which was whether moderate and severe droughts are driven. And severe droughts are driven by different processes, we're finally getting to the extreme value analysis. And what you see here is a drought frequency curve, which plots drought deficits against their return period. And for each event, you've also indicated the corresponding drought type. And the question now is whether these upper-tailed droughts here are driven by different types of processes. Driven by different types of processes than these more normal droughts in the bulk of the distribution. We can do the same thing in terms of duration and look, assign one return period to each of these events using a generalized extreme value distribution to assess the probability of our drought events. Now, what I did is I divided my sample in My sample in two different subsets: a moderately extreme subset, that's all those events with return periods shorter than 10 years, and the severe subset, which consists of those events which exceed a return period of 10 years. Now, looking at these two plots, one might hypothesize that indeed those events in the upper right tail Events in the upper right tail might be driven by slightly different processes than those below because these dots actually show different colors for the moderate part and for the severe subsample. But let's now look at this a bit more in detail. So we're again looking at the most dominant drought type in a catchment, and we're here seeing two maps on the left for the moderate deficits and on the right. Deficits and on the right, we're looking at the dominant drought type for those events that are classified as severe deficit droughts. If you compare these two maps, you immediately see that they are different. When we look at the moderate events, we still have these rainfall deficit-driven events that dominate. But if we look at the severe events, we see that other processes become important. For example, in the Alps, we see For example, in the Alps, we see that snowmelt-driven droughts are often associated with severe deficits. While in the West, we see that the severe deficit droughts, they're often associated with wet to dry season droughts, that was the droughts that were enhanced by evapotranspiration anomalies. Now, we can also take this one step further and again look at the whole distribution by again looking at the relative importance of each. The relative importance of each different drought type in each catchment by subdividing our moderate events on top from the severe deficit droughts at the bottom. Yes, thanks. And as before, we're again looking at the warm catchments on the left and the cold catchments on the right. If you compare these two panels, you see that there's again differences. If you look Differences. If you look at the warm catchments, you see that the severe droughts are dominated by these wet to dry season droughts, while other types of processes also seem to matter for the moderate to deficit droughts. If you look at the cold catchments, you see a similar pattern. You see differences between moderate and severe droughts, but in this case, the severe droughts are importantly driven by snowmelt deficits and a rain. Deficits and rain-to-snow season droughts compared to the moderate deficits routes, which are driven by a larger variety of different processes. If we do the same thing for durations, then we see again that severe duration droughts are different from moderate duration droughts, both in warm and also in cold catchments. Now, the question is whether these differences in the drivers of moderate and severe droughts tell us something about the future development of drought severity in catchments such as the one we're looking at here. And I think that our results suggest that if these evapotranspiration-driven droughts become more frequent because of climate change, More frequent because of climate change, and also the snow melt deficit-driven droughts become more important as we see shifts in snow lines and also decreases in the snow cover and changes in the snowmelt seasonality, that these types of droughts may become more frequent. And as we've seen, these are the types of processes associated with the most severe drought, suggesting that drought. Suggesting that drought severity might increase in a future climate where evapotranspiration becomes important, even more important, and in a future climate where snowmelt contributions to discharge tend to decrease. In summary, I've here introduced a standardized classification scheme to classify stream flow droughts according to their different causes. We've seen We've seen that drought types in Europe vary both regionally and seasonally. And we've also, most importantly, seen that drought events or these drought types, they vary for severe and moderate events. That means that severe and moderate droughts are driven by different processes, which we need to take into account if we look at changes in drought. We look at changes in drought severity under a future climate. With that, I'd like to thank you for your attention, and I'm now very happy to take your question.
