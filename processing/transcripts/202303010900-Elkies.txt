Okay, to give some context, if I have an elliptic vibration, some rational elliptic surface over P1, well, I can always get a K3 surface out of it. out of it with an elliptic vibration by just taking the quadratic base change let's say if this is as coordinate to the t there be some p1 with some other coordinate I don't know maybe capital T where this T is equal to some non-zero square than C squared zero scalar than c squared, and then this will be some K3 surface with an elliptic vibration. And what's more, this elliptic vibration, I mean this K3 surface, of course, has a symmetry because this is the Galois cover. So we do actually have a symmetry of a K3 surface. And what's more, the elliptic racial elliptic surface that I will deal with will have some. Will deal with will have some non-trivial Morder V group which will be inherited by the K3 surface. It might have more, but it will certainly at least have that with the canonical height doubled. And well, any element of the Modern V lattice gives a translation, which is a symmetry of the K3 surface. So I do actually get some K3 surfaces with symmetries, and it will turn out that these are actually some. And it will turn out that these are actually some nice families of K3 surfaces. So let's see. So, what are we going to be using here? Well, as a reminder, there is the Shioda taste theorem that goes back, oh, to roughly when I was born, which Which it works for a general elliptic vibration, let's say over P1, connecting the Bordeaux-V lattice with the Neurons-Vay lattice and the configuration of reducible fibers. But it's particularly nice for rational elliptic surfaces. It says that they were there very nicely. That the Rudell V lattice is, well, in fact, I mean, I can write it as an exact sequence, if you like. There is always this lattice E8. It contains some fiber contributions coming from the singular fibers. And And the quotient, together with the inner product structure, is the Mordell V lattice together with the height varying. So that's very nice. In particular, it lets you predict the rank from the configuration of reducible fibers. And we are used to, from K3 war, to have nice. Nice, what do you call it? Nice marginalized spaces when you fix something like an electric fibration and the configuration of fibers and sections. Now, the thing is that if you actually figure out what the contributions are from these fibers, well, that states the algorithm. Backwards actually this is about 75, I think. And usually there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ADE contribution and the reduction type. But there are three cases where you have the same lattice. Notice A1, well, okay, actually, yeah, A, how do they want to do this? You can have a fiber that contributes either nothing or a, you can have a fiber that is not reducible, so contributes nothing on the ADE side, and you can have a fiber that. And you can have a fiber that contributes A0 to A1 or A2. And that can arise in two possible ways. Even assuming that fiber is reducible, so never mind that any one of the, excuse me, even assuming that fiber is singular, so not even worrying about all of the smooth fibers, a singular fiber that contributes a node can be either just a node. Just a node, or it can be a cusp, which has these are clarity symbols, one sub one and two. And likewise, type one, excuse me, the A1 can be either type one, two, or three, and oh, sorry. So, the one sub two, of course, is two components that meet in two distinct points, and the type three is two components that meet doubly. And likewise, there can be either a triangle or a star of components of the three components of the fiber that gives rise to an A sub 2. And so he might not expect to be able to say anything particularly nice about the modularized space of abelian, extremely, of rational elliptic surfaces with some fiber configuration for which we distinguish the possibility of an A naught, which is usually one of these, degenerating further to form a type 2, and likewise this becoming a type 3. Likewise, this becoming a type 3 and this becoming a type 4 because it's not visible in the neural civiliaratis, which is what we usually use to start our classifications, our modular descriptions. Fortunately, in this case, Shioda in 1990 or so observed that, well, he started by saying, supposing you. Say, supposing you have an additive fiber. So, if you have some additive fiber, that means that, well, the group of the, locally the group of the elliptic curve is, there's an additive group, possibly together with some finite group of order two or three in the case of type three. In the case of type 3 and type 4, respectively. And you have a homomorphism by evaluation at that group from the Mordeir vein additives to the additive group. And that can be used to give an actual map from the Mordeir, excuse me, from the modular space of marked surfaces with that structure. So, you know, rationally elliptic surfaces. Rationally elliptic surfaces with some configuration of reducible fibers and with a marking of the word El Verais. And that by evaluation at this fiber gives you a map to some projective space, namely the projective space of rank, extreme dimension, one less than the rank. Because after all, there is no canonical choice of coordinates on GA, so this map is defined on. So this map is defined only up to moduli, it's defined only up to scaling. And so I have a map from m to r to a p r to projective space of rank of dimension r minus one. And amazingly enough, there are several cases, including ones for which the reserve valius is quite large, for which this can actually be an isomorphism. What's the dimension of What's the dimension of n? Say that again. What's the dimension of the modulo space n? That's a good question. In the cases that I'm going to be describing, the dimension is r minus 1. So this can actually be an isomorphism to, let's say, hyperplane complement. Maybe I should be clear by saying hyperplane complement. complement in PR minus one. And these are some very beautiful configurations, marginalized spaces because one actually gets, so the first example where we see this is when there's only one reducible fiber and one reducible, no reducible fibers. No reducible fibers, one additive fiber of type two. That means that this part of the exact sequence is trivial. I should probably have put in a second arrow here since I'm doing the compressed version of the exact sequence. That makes it very valuable all of E8. And the modularized space then is just a hyperplane complement in some dimensional projector space together with the action of the fuse. Together with the action of this huge, finite but huge symmetry group of the E8 lattice. So we're getting symmetries, so we get these are symmetries of the modernized space, not of individual surfaces. So that is the situation on the rational elliptic surface side. When you take this double cover, you get one, you know, in some sense, explanation for why. Explanation for why this might happen, which is that if you take the quadratic base change, you actually do pick up a different fiber type if the t-coordinate of this fiber was one of the branch points. So types one sub one, two, and three, of course, go to types. Of course, go to types 1, sub 2, 1, sub 4, and 1, sub 6. These are just multiplicative fibers where you're doubling the valuation of the discriminant, and these contribute the lattices A1, A3, and A5. Whereas type 2 becomes a type 4 fiber, and that contributes A2. That contributes A2. Type 3 becomes a fiber of type 1, 0, star, quadratic twist of a smooth curve, so that contributes D4. And type 4 becomes a type 4 star, which contributes to C6. So each one of these, the K three surface, picks up on the single parameter that you have used. Single parameter that you have used to collapse this node to a cus, or to collapse these two intersection points to a single tangency, or to collapse these three points to a coincidence, by increasing the contribution of the fibers to the Durance variables. And so each one of these marginalized spaces actually does reappear as a marginalized space. As a marginalized polarized K3 surfaces, or possibly a quotient of that space by some involution, because in a couple of these cases we introduce a pair of fibers that is not distinguished by the picture we've done here, and we need to take some additional quadratic extension. But at any rate, it's a But at any rate, it's a natural quotient of one of our favorite kinds of marginalized spaces of Markov's polarized K-trees. So that is, as you can tell from the dates here, this is all a very classical, well, classical at least being several decades old story. The new thing today is that. Today is that we will look at a situation where we have not one, but two of these special additive fibers of one of these types two, three, and four. And in that case, I mean, we still can pick up on it on the K3 side because we have two branch points. Have two branch points to play with here, and so we can actually put one of these branch points under the excuse me, under the additive fibers, and so that will be fixed up and we'll get a monogenized space of K3 surfaces. But in this case, in this picture, we have two different maps from the Bourdain-V lattice to some additive group. And therefore, we have two different maps. And therefore, we have two different maps to PR minus 1. And each one of these maps, if you compare dimensions, it's still an injection, but it's no longer an isomorphism because there's a codimension one. And so we find an identification of M at least rationally with a hypersurface. And that's a hypersurface. Surface that still carries all of the symmetries of the relevant Border galaxies. And so it's no longer projective space, but still some nice, highly symmetric variety. And we have usually two different pictures of it. And so we can, so that gives us several new things to play with, and we find several. play with and we find some results that i think are at least some of which are new which for example are an identification of some of these nice hyper surfaces with modulated space of k3s which i don't think was known before and also it turns out that in each case where i can track down and i'm guessing also in the one case where i haven't been able to figure this out yet these two hypersurface models i mean there are Surface models, I mean, they're pirational to each other because they're both isomorphic with them, they turn out to be geometric duals of each other. So if you have a hyperplane in P in some projective space, you have the Gauss map to the dual projective space of the same dimension. And usually it takes a smooth hybrid surface to a very unsmooth and very much higher degree hypersurface. Much higher degree hypersurface once you're in degree two. But these hypersurfaces do have some singularities, and that allows you to have both of these be excuse me, both of these be nice surfaces that you can actually write down. Some of these dualities are already well known. The simplest one is just a quadratic to itself. In Gusa and Segre. Uh, Igusa and Segre duality shows up. Also, the title of this talk was the first case which goes beyond the classical picture, and that's the case where the two fibers are of type two and four. And if you look at this part of the table there, you see type two doesn't contribute anything here, but type four contributes in A2, and so that makes them or their very nice. And so that makes the Mordell V lattice E6 star. And there, this hypersurface, where you have two choices. One of them is just going to be the quintic invariant for E6. So I remind you the vile group of E6, being a reflection group, has a polynomial invariant ring, and the polynomials are generated by invariance of degrees. Invariance of degrees 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12. Most of these are not canonical because, after all, if I have one invariant of degree 6, I can add any multiple of the cube of my basic invariant of degree 2. And you can have even more choices later on. But the quadratic invariant is canonical up to scaling, and so I have a unique quadric. Quadric invariant under its viral group of V6. That's not very exciting. It's just an inner product. But I also have a unique invariant quintic. And that has a beautiful geometry. Bruce Hunt voted the entire, I think, last chapter of his book on special varieties and marginalized spaces to that one case. But I don't think we had the picture. Don't think we had the picture of it as a moduli space yet. We had suggested pictures of nice four-dimensional one sub-varieties of it, but this turns out to be the moduli space of these two, four type two and type four rashi elliptic surfaces. And by taking the quadratic base chain, you see that it's also going to be the moduli of a Of a polarized K3 surface with an effibration that gives you one fiber of type E6, one fiber of type, where was it, of type A2, and a word there is, which is E6 star 8 by 2. So you might think, well, okay, that's one of the One of an uncountable infinitude of four-dimensional modularized spaces. Yes, that K3 does have rank 16, so the modular space is fourfold. But that one actually turns out to be quite nice in various ways, for most notably it has a quartic model as a smooth quartic surface, which has this configuration of 40 lines on it. Of 40 lines on it, each one intersecting 12 others. So this configuration, there are two such configurations. They both have automorphisms by the var group of E6, but they're not equivalent. So this is a K3 with what, to extend the classical notation, is a 4012 configuration of lines. Of lines. One of those you get by taking the Burckhardt quartic, which is a four-dimensional, excuse me, it's a three-fold in P5, which also carries an action of a projective action of this group. It has a unique quartic invariant, and take random hyperplane sections of that. That quartic has a configuration of 40 planes, so hyperplane sections. 14 planes, so hyperplane section has a configuration of 14 lines. Unfortunately, I can't draw a picture of it because inevitably most of these lines are defined over the Eisenstein numbers. You have to enjoy a coupon of unity. The other one, which was also noted in the same paper by Dektyarev in 2016, is the one that we are dealing with here. Is the one that we are dealing with here, but he did not give examples or formulas or explicit moduli because he got it by saying, well, there is a lattice. So by Torelli, we know that there has to be such a family of surfaces. So this one I was able to find the modulated space and identify it with the WV6 Quintic back in 2018. Squintec back in 2018, and I did mention this in several talks, including, I believe, one at the last time I was in Banf about five years ago. So possibly somebody here has already heard about this, but didn't have it as part of this more general picture. So, given that there are three of these Are three of these possibilities? And there are, I'm allowed to have two reducible fibers, each of which is one of these. There are six possible ends. Right? There are three of them for which I get two different hyposurfaces, and one of them for which I get the same one. So I should tell you what all of them are. What all of them are, but I'm going to run into the difficulty that I only have a very small amount of blackboard or whiteboard real estate to do this in. So I have to erase something. And what I will do is I will, I mean, maybe remember these numbers, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 9, and 12. These are rather different. These are rather different kinds of numbers than these, which are actual coordinates of a point in P5. So I write them in red here, and I erase everything else of this part of the blackboard. Excuse me, whiteboard. I take no responsibility for what happens if you take either one of these. If you take either one of these sets of stitch numbers for your next lottery chart. Okay, so here is the general, here is the complete picture as I have is now. There is so the dimension of the marginalized space can be two, three, four, five, or six depending on how complicated these reducible fibers are. The further I go down this list, the larger the number that appears here is. But you notice this number is going to be, you know, each time I increase this by one, this increases by two. But the size of the rank of the Venatus of the rational surface and therefore of the K3 increases. And therefore, the K3 increases only by one. Actually, it decreases only by one. So that means the total derived survey rank increases as I go down here. And the largest possibility is when both of these are going to be of type 4. And in that case, well, let's work it out. So 8. So we have A2 appearing twice, except it's become an E6, excuse me. So 2E6 appearing twice. So that is rank 12. The Morder Venatus has rank 8 minus twice A2. And of course we also always have the fiber at the base. Always have the fiber and the base, so divide up to 18, and 20 minus 18 is 2 for the dimension of the marginalized space. And in this case, if you go through the standard recipe, you find that the Cordervae lattice of the K3 surface, the elliptic K3 surface, is E6 squared. Surface is E6 squared from these two, and then the orthogonal complement, excuse me, the quotient of E8 by a lattice of type A2 squared turns out to be A2 star squared. This whole thing has to be scaled by 2 because we did a quadratic base change. And it turns out that this whole thing, so it's rank 18, of course, and it's determinant, to be discriminant rather, To be discriminant, rather, is 2 to the 4th. And so, this is an elliptic vibration of a K3 surface with these invariants, which is just the cumar of the product of two elliptic curves. So, this was already obtained by Ogiso, who listed all of the elliptic vibrations of such a surface back in 89. Surface back in 89. And in this case, the moduli space, I need a two-dimensional moduli space, so it's just a quadric in P3. Okay, in the picture that I drew, of course, there are many other ways of realizing this, as a, what you call it, realizing this modulation. This marginalized space where rational D is some rational two-dimensional thing. Okay, so the next possibility is 3, 4 or 4, 3. These are different because I have to, in my picture, because I have to specify one of them as the additive group that I'm going to use to get the map P, in this case, to P. P in this case to P4. And one of them gives me the segra-cubic. Right? So that's the sum of x of i equals sum xi cubed equals 0. The sum always goes from 1 to 6. And this is the ecusaquortic. Which is given by, it's again, the group is going to be instead of A2 star two, in this case, the neuron several lattice is going to be, you know, the usual fiber and base together with what she ought and should have taken into calling the extension lattice, D4, E6, and then A5. And then 85 star again scales by 2. The var group of this is just a symmetric group of six letters. And so this is acting by permuting these six coordinates, and it's also acting by permuting six coordinates of the Agusa cortic. And in this case, what we get is just the Kumar of the Jacobian of a generic genus through curve. Now, if you have a generic Now, if you have a genus to curve, you have six points. If you have a configuration on P1, you have a configuration of six points in P1, then you have a point on the sacred cubic or equivalently on the Agus Aquordic, and these are indeed the same point. This is not new, although it's more recent. It's contained in the paper of my student Ablin Av Kumar, written sometime after he graduated. You know, sometime after he graduated, whatever he gave, I mean, it's archived 2011, it's published 2014, and he gave all the elliptic vibrations of the Kumar-Vitacovian and noted that the Gusa cubic and cortic arise here as well. Okay, now we come to the passive venue part, so 2-4 and 4-2. 4-2. So, this is what I was just describing over there. Excuse me. Right? It should be A2 star, right? A2E6 is the fiber contribution, and then the lattice is. And then the lattice is E6 star again scared by 2. Here the discriminant, here the discriminant was 64. Here it was 3 times 64. And that's this configuration I mentioned. That's the surface that gave rise to a 4012 configuration. And here, well, you get this invariant quintic for the bar group of V6 on one side. On one side, and you get some more complicated surface, hypersurface of degree 32 on the other side. But it's not as complicated as it could have been, even given that it has to be a polynomial in these basic invariants, because I can just write it as a resultant of two coefficients of this. Coefficients of this elliptic vibration. Now, the fact that the dual of this surface has degree 32 and even a formula for that dual, that was already known. So there is a paper in Experimental Math by Freitag and Hunt. Sorry, I'm running out of room here, so this is Hobby. Here, so this is probably too small to read, but the degree 32 surface was obtained, hydro surface, was obtained by Freitag and Hart in a paper experimental math reporting a rather, at the time, heroic calculation by substituting a whole bunch of special points and checking that the two agree there. And as a consequence of the picture here, the marginalized space picture in terms of elliptic surfaces, we find We find, first of all, a much simpler formula for this as a resultant, and we find a somewhat more conceptual, at least explanation, if not explanation, at least picture of how the resultant of this turns out to be that one. Because you simply change t to 1 over t, right? If you put the invariant, if you put these two fibers at t equals 0 and t equals infinity, you take t change to 1 over t, that switches them. Change to 1 over t that switches them, then you just have to keep track of where all the generators go. And you just have to check that the new parameters here are in fact the derivative, the partial derivatives of the quintic here. Now, there is room here for a completely different thing, which is when both of them have type 3. Have type 3. In that case, I get a different surface. I mean, I can tell you what the I can tell you what the relevant lattice is. It's going to be, well, I could tell you if I trusted my right up here. Oh, here it is. D4 squared. And now we get D6 star. Sorry, this is very hard to read. Maybe it'll be easier. d4 squared d6 star again scaled by two so that's just some power of two lattice and this one has degree six so it's a degree six invariant for the vile group of d6 okay i realized this only about a week ago and then i said okay i have an interesting degree six invariant Interesting the Greek 6 invariant. By this time, I had already guessed: okay, a quadric is always dual to itself. These two are dual. And in fact, I checked that the duality map is consistent with this picture. And likewise, I'd already checked it here, gee, this one should be self-dual too. Okay, for all of the wonders of Google and Chat GPT and so forth, we don't know how to find we don't really have good algorithm for checking whether something like this is new. Whether something like this is new or already know. I mean, I think the best argument we know is to come to a conference like this where other people thinking about the field are also, you know, can also be asked in person. But in this particular case, I don't have to resort to that, at least not for the question of is this known already, because I typed in just a sexic fourfold. Sep Stick Fourfold into Google. And the first thing that showed up was a paper by, okay, these are five authors, Dr. Burry, Bertrand Heyman, two people with the last name of Kapulska, and J. V. Schnevsky, I hope I pronounced this more or less right, which has already obtained the same sextant from a completely different point of view. It's a quotient of It's a quotient of the fourth power of it. It's a generalized Kubernetes surface. It's a quotient that says a quotient of the fourth power of the elliptic curve with Cm by squared of minus one by some group that leaves it with, that still acts trivially on H4. It's already known to have this model as a sexic, excuse me, as a self- as a As a septic, which is in fact self-dual. And there's a bunch of other things where it arises, but it didn't arise yet in this picture. It was not apparently known to be a Majorite surface, a Majorite 44, excuse me, of three surfaces. Now, I don't have quite as nice a picture of it as this one. And by the way, it's one of these where it's moduli space up to some kind of quadratic. Up to some kind of quadratic cover. Because starting from this one and forming the quadratic base change, I don't quite get an elliptic, I don't quite get a polarized k3, I get a polar FK3 up to some value one volution I've taken for the quadratic extension. However, it turns out that there is still a nice description of it, and that's what I have written here. It's the marginalized space of a Marginalized space of, among other things, pairs of split cortex which agree in all but the middle term. How the heck does that have to do with K3 surfaces? Well, I got myself the list of all the possible elliptic vibrations, and there's one that has rank zero and has full level two structure, and if you figure out what it's doing, it's basically surfaces of form y squared equals x times x minus. x times x minus p of t times p1 of t times x minus p2 of t, where these are both quartics and the roots have to be rational because these roots are the coordinates of a 2 squared a1 fiber and the difference between them is a perfect square. Well, constant, a square times perfect square. That's because times perfect square, that's because that reducible fiber instead of being just four of type one sub two collapses to a pair of type one sub four. Anyhow, so I gave an example. Here is the slowest generic point I could find on the surface. And here is one of the ten corresponding pairs of quartics. There's a ten to one correspondence because you have ten choices of elliptic vibrations of this given. Elliptic vibrations of this given one of these K2 surfaces. Okay, so that's a picture here. And going further, if you make it type two and three, the modular space are probably of general type. Here we get some degree 10 thing. I don't know what we call a degree 10 dectic. Anyhow, it's a degree 5, excuse me, degree 10, 54. It's a degree 10 five-fold, which is invalid under the vile group of E7, and I have a dual, which is some polynomial of degree 36. And again, I have a retargeted formula for it. And I did check that these are, in fact, each other's dual by that fashion, by that transformation. And finally, and most inaccessibly, if I haven't Most inaccessibly, so I haven't quite worked out all the details here yet, but this is going to be some degree 100 invariant for E8, which I can write as a resultant. I can tell you what the modular space of K3 is, although I don't know what use I have for these K3s any more than I do for this one. And the most ridiculous thing about it is this degree 100 thing. 100 things seems reasonable to conjecture a self-dual. Anybody know a self-dual sig fault of that degree or of any degree other than quadric? Anyhow, that seems to be what's happening here. Okay, I haven't actually left myself all that much time, so. So, maybe I will call for questions here and then at least give some details because I'm sure most of the people here haven't seen or don't remember that these wonderful Shiodo Sui papers, so I'll give a bit of the details there. But any questions so far? Yeah. So for two and three, we get uni rational varieties. Yeah. This one is also uni rational. This one is also unique. So five, you said it's general type. Okay, this one already, I think, is a four-dimensional cannabia, whatever that means. Yeah, this one, I suspect it's of general type. It's a degree 10 surface, and it's not that singular, but I'm not exactly sure how to prove it. And this one, I mean, I have a formula for, but it's probably of gender type, but yeah. This 3-3 example, it's just one, but it's basically something like the double covers of each and six slides. That's a good question. It can't be because that, so Adam is asking, could this possibly be the marginalized space of double planes branched in six lines? It can't be because that is clearly uh that one clearly is is rational. Also, if you figure out the corresponding discriminant, this one has discriminant two to the eight. Has discriminant two to the eight. The one you asked about the discriminant two to the six. I think there is a natural map. Like, you know, you can probably find some elliptic vibration, excuse me, some genus one vibration, and then take the five walls Jacobian to get the one that you asked about. Or maybe a twisogeny. Or maybe just a two isogeny. I haven't worked out details yet. But I suspect it's in the same universe, but it's not quite the same thing. Other questions? Okay, I was planning to put here a whole table showing exactly what the algorithm tells you you should do to get from a type 1 to a type 2. But for lack of time, let me just indicate the, give some indication of this Shioda pseudoimagine. So let's look first at the case of E. Let's look first at the case of E8. So that means we're just going to have a single reducible, excuse me, a single irreducible but nodal fiber, an additive fiber of type 2 at t equals infinity. So now usually an elliptic, rational elliptic surface is going to have x cubed plus something times x squared plus something else times. x squared plus something else times x plus some constant term, where these are as polynomials in t, these are polynomials that agree at most two, at most four, and at most six. Forcing a reducible fiber, sorry, forcing a singular fiber at infinity basically gets rid infinity basically gets rid of gets rid of the six degree and the four degree term here and then making it additive gets rid of this term here okay and then I can scale so that the t to the fifth coefficient is just one and once I've done that scaling there's a few other things I'm going to do like I can get rid of like I can get rid of these by shifting X by suitable linear polynomial T and I can get rid of this one by translating T and then I still have these eight parameters up to some scaling and well what's the scaling if the main terms are y squared equals X cubed plus T to the fifth so we have something of weight 20 So we have something of weight 20, 30, excuse me, where x has weight 10, y has weight 15, t has weight 6. So that means that these invariants here have, that these coefficients here have weights 12, 18, 14, 20, and then 2, 6, 14, what have I done here? 24 and 30, right? This has to be multi-groups of 6, and this to the same multi group of 2. Of 6, and this is the same multiples of 6 minus 10. Okay, these are not random even numbers. These are the invariant degrees for the value group E8. And the amazing thing that Shiota found was that... The sixth should indeed be an 8. Thank you very much. Good, that means I don't I I can't claim that I've that I did it on purpose, but at least it means that my numbers can be visible that far back in the audience. Can be visible that far back in the audience. So, yes, this should be an 8. And the amazing thing that Shiota found was: well, take one of these surfaces. The Modern Feight group is E8. We get the map by evaluating at the fiber at infinity. And the map explicitly takes takes some x, y to a, where x is t over a squared plus low order terms, and y equals t over a cubed plus low order terms. This a here is of weight one. If you, for example, take the 240 minimal generators, you have a configuration of 240a satisfying all the linear identities that you have for E8. And in fact, even these polynomials. Even these coefficients, which are necessarily invariant on the var group V8, are in fact generators of the polynomial invariant ring. And that has a bunch of applications. You can explicitly write down surfaces which have all the more derivative group rational. You can take random coefficients here and get explicit W of E eight Gerois covers. Of E8 Gerois covers and so forth. Now, the thing that Shiota and Lusui discovered a bit later is that if you then also require a multiplicative fiber at zero, well, so let's look at what happens if you put a multiplicative fiber of order three at zero, because that's what's going to give rise to the complement of A2, which is E6. which is E6. So basically to get a reducible fiber, you get rid of to get a noser curve, you get rid of these coefficients and then you have to restore this coefficient here of weight 6 because you can no longer translate t. And you have to restore this thing here of weight 10. And then to get And then to get one sub two, you have to get rid of this coefficient. And then to get a discriminant to have multiple of three, this one has to, these leading terms have to form a perfect square when you interpret it as a polynomial, a quadratic polynomial. So that 10 is really the square of some invariant of degree 5. This 18 is really the square of an invariant of degree 9. And this 14 is really the product. And this 14 is really the product of, twice the product of those two invariants. Okay, so now we have invariants of degree 2, 6, 8, 12, 5, and 9. Those are exactly the invariants of the minimum invariance of the viable group of V6, and the same picture works. If you want to then make that into a type 4 fiber, well, you have to get rid of this term. Of this term, and what happens then is that means that I5 is 0. So you get rid of this term, you get rid of this one, this becomes just I9 squared, and now you have your W of E6 invariant quick. And if you look at your del Uso in 1993, you will find out how to get, you know, how to get. To get, you know, how to get from this to the explicit generators. There's a similar picture if you start with a type 4 fiber, you will have your dominant term instead of t to the fifth, t to the fourth. Repeat everything I did before for E8, you'll get 6, 9, 12, 2, 5, 8 here. These are two, this is a different configuration of nice WV6 invariants. W V6 invariance. And if you take the resultant of this quartic in T and this quadratic in T, that will give you the condition for these two polynomials to have a common root, which is to say that somewhere on the T line, there is a reducible fibros type T. Okay, I have minus two and a half minutes to go, so I'll finish here. Thanks again.
