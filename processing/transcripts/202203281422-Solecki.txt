     Can you hear us, Avek? Yes, I can. Yeah, the volume on this one was on, that's why. Which was muted? Which is the bottom is muted, the network's not? No, the bot is now unmuted, so now it can be requested for. Now unmuted, so now they can hear us for sure. This one, you shouldn't have to mute it or unmute it. Somebody just got unmuted, but it is fine now. It should technically work. I'm just going to change a small name. Get rid of that blue ball. And excellent. So they should be able to hear you guys and vice versa. Thank you. So once again, I'd like to introduce Vavir. So let's get off to Cornell, who will give us part two of an overview of descriptive set theory. All right. Okay, so let's continue. So during the break, I looked it up. The term analytic goes back to all the way to the origins. All the way to the origins, it's due to Suslin and he used it in 1917 paper. And I got an email from Martin Elikes, who has an interesting theory why they are called analytic. And I'll mention that theory when it's appropriate. So I should say that the root of the subject go back to France, to Beer and Lebesgue. Then it was continued in Russia, in Lusi, in Sussex. Luzin, Suslin, and Alexandrov, and then there was also a Polish contribution later on, Kuratowski and Scherpinski, and other people. And the books, I should have mentioned it earlier, there are good books on the subject. So Keklis' book, for example, Classical Descriptive Set Theory, there is a thinner book by Srivastava, Morel Sets, and there is an older book by Muskovaki's Descriptive Set Theory. So you can find. Is descriptive set theory. So you can find all that I'm talking about in some form in Kekris and Srivastava for sure. Moscovaki is more of an effective stuff, so it's a little different. And Anusherunyan, for example, has a set of notes on her webpage too. Okay, so this is where we were. So basic structure. So this is one of the. So can Borelness and analyze it be defined within the space in which the sets lie? Within the space in which the sets lie. So I should say that this definition I defined analytic as continuous images of Polish spaces and Borel as continuous injective images of Polish spaces. As far as Borel said, this is not a standard definition. So we are now fighting to get the equivalence of what I define to be Borel and what is normally defined to be Borel. And that's why we look at this sigma algebra. Look at this sigma algebra generated by open subsets of X. And so this will prove that Borel sets are actually in X are precisely the ones that are in the sigma algebra generated by open subsets of X. This will also give an answer to this question for Borel sets. And for analytic, we'll have to introduce a certain so-called substance operation A. I will talk about it later. And then on the way there, On the way there, we have to investigate the relationship between analytic and Borel. Okay, so that the main theorem here is this Lusin's theorem, that if I have two analytic disjoint sets, I mentioned it already last time, and that half of the proof, and the sets are disjoint, so analytic, complicated set, disjoint, you can still separate them by a relatively small, simple set, namely a set that is in the sigma algorithm. Set, namely a set that is in the sigma algebra generated by open sets. So that separation means this. And if you remember, the way we are running this proof, this proof can be made direct, but it's easier to do it by contradiction. We assume that we have these two disjoint analytic sets, and we cannot separate them as here. And then we will get a contradiction. So, since these sets A and B are analytic, there are surjections. B are analytic, there are surjections f and g as on the slide, and then what we will, what we have to do, this is what we have to do still, is for each n, we are producing longer and longer on the f side and on the g side, on the f side and on the g side. We are producing finite sequences of natural numbers, and they are getting longer and longer. So this. So, this means they extend the next one, extend the previous one, and get actually longer, so properly extends. So, as I look at these basic sets determined by Ns and Nt, these basic sets as N goes to infinity are getting smaller and smaller, right? Because if I extend S to S n plus one, the set N S sub n plus one is getting is being smaller than N. Is smaller than n s sub n. So I will have now smaller and smaller sets that still cannot be separated. Right? So this is the picture. Here is Sn here with F and G, Sn and T N. This is this N Sn and T N. They still cannot be separated. Because Sn's extend each other and TNs extend each other. There is an X, a unique X extending all Sns, and there is a unique Y extending all TNs in Sn. Y extending all tns in n to n okay, but then I take pay attention to these points that I produce in the bare space and n one is the image of one under f is in a the other one is in b and they must be distinct because a and b are disjoint so i can put them in open set that are disjoint but because f and g are continuous at some point they will dump At some point, they will dump the whole NSN and NTN inside of U and V respectively. But then this U separates this set from that set, contradicting our choice of Sn and T N and T N. Okay, so how do I get these? So I just need to show that I can do this. So I assume I have some S and T. Some s and t such that f of n s g of n t not separated. So what I do is this. I have to say the following thing: that something of look, I will look at sets of this form, and s extended by i. s extended by i and g of n t extended by j so here this is part of this notation for finite sequences if i have a finite sequence of natural number and the natural number this means so this is in n less than n this is in n this just means a sequence of length one more than the length of s and it's s followed by i By I. Okay, so these sets now assume I cannot extend S and T N to sequences one longer and keep non-separation. Therefore, all such will be separable. They can be separate because they are one. This one is one longer than S, this one is one longer than T. So I'll be able to find here C. To find here Cij such that Cij intersection G and T J is empty. And this fellow is in B of X. Because I can separate them, so this is what must happen. But now you can see kind of more or less immediately what you need to do. Well, Well, I remember I have the Cij separating from this guy. So I'll just define. Notice that if I take the intersection over J of Cij, this separates F of N S I from the union of G N T J over J because you know for each J. Because you know, for each j separately, Cij contains this and this is disjoint with that. So if I take the intersection, I have this separation. And then notice that if I take the union over I of these sets, they will separate union I F of N S I from union over J G. union over J G of N T J. But this is just G of N T and this is F of N S. If you think about it, N S is just the union of those and NT is the union of those and images preserve unions. So I've separated by this set this from that. And this set is in B of X because each Cij was in B of X. Each Cij was in B of X. This is just some countable intersections, countable unions. So it still stays there. So I reached a contradiction. Therefore, for some ij, this set is not separable from that set. So I can extend S and T by one and continue. So, okay, so this proves Lusing's theorem. So it's a very interesting use of Hausdorff's axiom. Of Hausdorff's axiom. This is this use of Hausdorff axiom that is the T2. Okay, so now this is an important theorem in its own right. But now what we will use it from our point of view, we'll look at any questions to this proof. Sorry, are there any questions? So we'll use it to show that Borel sets, as we define them, are all countable unions. Countable unions are all in the sigma algebra generated by open sets. So, what do we do? What do we do is this? I have my Borel set. Yes, so I have my Borel set. I have, I can, for simplicity, let's say this Borel set A is Borel. So, this is F of So this is F of F, F going from F to a continuous injection. And this is a subset of N to N. So this, remember, for this fellow was branches through a tree. So this is for the combinatorics there. So these are branches through a tree. And then I will write. And then I will write. So, look, what I will try to, what I will consider is this: N T T. These are my basic set intersection T for T and T. This is what I will consider. Right, so these are, I have this tree, and I consider the cones inside of the tree. I will consider these sets. And then, so, what do I? Sets. And then, so, what do I have here is I do the following thing. I want to represent that set as these unions and so forth. So, what I will construct, this is a commonly occurring construction in descriptive set theory. I will produce certain sets. PMP will be just F of everything. So, NMP. And because I'm only working in T, I'll just write N T for these sets. So, this is something. T for these sets. So, this is some slight abuse of notation. NT is actually a set living in the end-to-end. I take its intersection with T. Let's just agree to abuse notation in this way. So, this is everything. So, I'll just take everything. And then I will construct set, I will tell you what these sets are. So, N Ti is contained in P Ti, which is contained in F of N T I. In F of NTI closure. PTI is included in PT and PTI intersection PTJ is empty if I not J. So if you have things like that, it would not be a problem in constructing just sets of this form. Constructing just sets of this form, just take simply P T I is equal to the image of N T I. But we want them, all these P T's, we want them in the Borel algebra, sigma algebra generated by open sets. So what I'm trying to do is this. I have my set A, and there is this injection. I transfer the combinatorics from F to A. So I look at sequences. I look at sequences of length one and I look at their images. So this is n zero, n one, n two. These are images of those under F. They stay disjoint because F is injective. That's the crucial point. And then from the previous theorem, the theorem, this losing theorem that I just stated, I can separate by a set in B of X. set in B of X n zero from n1. I can also separate it from n2 and continue. Taking the intersection of all these separating sets, I can find a single set that will separate, maybe use a different color, that will separate N0 from everybody else, from all these other sets, all the NIs. These other sets, all the ni's. I do the same thing for n1 and the same thing for n2. There may be some overlaps here, but no problem. I just disjointify. I keep the set around n0 as it was, and I subtract it from the set that I got for n1, making them disjoint. And then I subtract these two sets from what I got as n2, and I continue like this. So all these sets, all these green sets. So all these sets, all these green sets stay within B of X. They now become disjoint. And they all contain appropriate images of N T's. I also want them to be included in the closure of Fn0. This one should be, this green one should be included in the closure of the image of N0, the closure of N1, and so forth. This is not a problem. I just intersect the set that I got here, the green. intersect the set that I got here, the green set, with the closure. The closure is in the Borel sigma algebra generated by open set. It's an open set. It's a countable intersection of, it's a closed set, so it's a countable intersection of open sets. I take the intersection with the green set that I got before, and now I also have both this condition and that condition, and I have this condition. And I will repeat that procedure. I will repeat that procedure here inside of N0. Inside of N0, inside of N1, inside of N2, producing sets that additionally have this property at each level. So, is it clear? I just look at these disjoint images at level one, sequences of length one, I separate them from each other by sets in B of X using losing. Now, I look at the image of a set of length one, this splits up into images of appropriate sets of length. Appropriate sets of length two, I do the separation there. And I make sure that at the next level, the separation at level two is included in the separation of level one. And I continue like that. And then what happens is that if I do all of this, it turns out, it's quite easy to see that f of f is equal to the intersection over n union over t. Over t whose length is equal to n of pt that actually my set is if I look at all the separating set at level n, I take their unions for each and separately, and then I take the intersection over all n, I get precisely the image. So notice these sets are in B of X. This is countable union, this is countable union here, this is countable union. Is countable union here. This is countable intersection. So, this whole business is in B of X. So, I represented my F of F as an L S set in B of X. In proving this equality here, notice this is completely obvious, just from this here. To get the other inclusion, one needs to, I mean, there is a little trick that actually also. Is a little trick that actually also shows up quite a bit. And this trick is as follows. If I have an X in the intersection over N union over T, T length equal to N P T, what happens is for each N, there is a T such that X is in P T. So this T will So, this t will have length n. From the way this whole thing was constructed, because of this disjointness condition here, what must happen is that this, so Tn here, that Tn is included in Tn plus 1. It must be that if I have a sequence such that X is in Pt at level n plus 1, and I one and I have a sequence another t such that x is in p t prime at level where t prime is at level n t prime is extended by t this is easy to see from the disjointness conditions and as before all these i mean their union there is a single element in f that extends all this all these tns And then it's actually quite easy to see from this condition here that x must be f of this alpha. So let me not go there. This is just kind of a basic basic basic metric topology. So this is how we know that Borel sets, so continuous injective images of open sets are all sigma in the sigma algebra generated. In the sigma algebra generated by open sets. Okay. Okay, so now if we actually want equality here, so we have to prove something about this set. And this is again, so to prove this inclusion, we had to take a detour through Lusing's theorem. That is important in its own right. Now, to prove the other inclusion, this one, we have to go through again a small detour through theorem. Through a theorem due to Kuratovsky that is just important and useful in its own right. So, what's that theorem? So, okay, I have Borel sets. So, this is something that will differentiate. This is one of those things that will differentiate analytic sets from Borel's. So, what is a so what's happening here? So, I have Here. So I have a Borel set, and then what I can do in a subset of a Polish space, I can make the topology on this Polish space stronger. So I can find a new topology, tau on X, with the property that this tau is again Polish, so it's within the category that we live. But there is more open sense in this new topology tau. And actually, what happens is that the set A is tau, not only tau open, but it's both tau open and tau closed. So it's a tau clopen set. So I can make by changing the topology, making the topology stronger, I can make my miraculously, I can make my Borel set into the simplest possible set, namely a Kloppen set. Uh a cloppon set okay are there any questions here about uh about this the statement of this so this is obviously it can be useful because essentially this tells you that as long as you don't care about the particulars of a of a Polish topology on your space you can treat Borel sets as if they were closed and open at the same time it's very simple something like this is is false for analytic so This is false for analytic. So, okay, so how do we do it? Well, we just set up, we look at, we consider the class of subsets of X with let's call this star, with star. So these are all subsets for which there is a stronger Polish. There is a stronger Polish topology making them into clopenstols. Consider this class, call it, let's call it A. So A contains closed open sets. Why is that? So this, so let's look at this: is the X, here is the open set, A open. open we know i i we we proved it that i can introduce oops yeah that this set a with its topology inherited from x is actually a polish space this is a polish space because it's open now the complement here is closed It's closed. So it's also Polish with the topology that I have from the inherited from X. And I just take these two Polish spaces now and break all the relationship between them. I take their discrete union. So discrete union of A and X minus A. X minus a. This is Polish because discrete unions, countable discrete union of Polish spaces, are Polish. So that's Polish. And I made in that Polish space, I made my set clopen, which actually closed and opened. I just declared it to be clopen, and I checked here that it's legitimate. Okay, so is there any questions here? Okay, so what else do I need to prove here? Here is that okay. Open sets are in. I have to show that it's closed under complements. A is closed under complements. That's trivial, because if I have a set, I went to a topology, I made my set A closed and open, in the same topology, its complement is also closed and open. So no problem. No. So no problem. And then A closed under countable unions. Okay, how do we do it? Well, I have a n's. With each a n, I have tau n extending my topology, initial topology, call it sigma maybe. So this is the initial topology such that Such that a n is tau n open. Okay, but then but then tau and clopen actually, yeah, tau and clopen. Open is enough, clopen. But then take tau is the topology generated by By all these tau ns. All these tau n's. We checked, there was this argument with the product and the diagonal. This is a Polish topology because all tau n's are Polish and they contain, all of them contain sigma that's housed. Believe it's actually Polish. So that's a Polish topology. It has more open sets than each tau n. So each A n is clopen. A n is clopen in tau. So the union over n is open in tau. So the union is actually open in this Polish topology tau. And I ran again this trick that made open set into clopen set. So I enlarged this to a Polish topology tau prime such that this is done so that union over n a n. Union over n is a global in tau prime. By this trick from the beginning of the proof. So I check that this A is closed under countable unions. It's a sigma algebra. So A is a sigma algebra containing open sets. So B of X. B of x is included in A. So I made every set in the sigma algebra generated by open set, I made it into a clopen set using some topologies. These topologies differ. It's not one topology for all that works for all of them. That's impossible, if you think about it for a moment. Points would have to be Kloppen. But for each of them, I have a topology and I'm good. I like that. And I'm good. I like that. Any questions here to this proof? So, this uses all these properties of Polish spaces, this preservation of Polish spatial under various operations. Okay, so I made these Borel sets into very simple sets by changing topologies. And then I'll sigma algebra, elements of the sigma algebra. So now I have that I can prove as a corollary that elements. That elements of the sigma algebra generated by open sets, they are all Borel subsets of X according to my definition. Well, how? Proof. That's immediate, right? If I have A and B of X, then what I do is find tau, Polish, such that A is tau clopen. Polish on X. So let's take X and it has this topology sigma. So tau and tau contains Tau contains Sigma. This is the original Polish topology. Tau contains Sigma. But now I just look, consider A with tau restricted to A. This is Polish. This is Polish. And the identity function going from A with tau restricted to A to A with sorry A with sigma restricted to A, that's continuous because tau contains sigma and it's one to one. I mean, it's identical. It's one to one. And this one is. And this one is Polish. So I found a continuous function from this Polish space to x, x taken with sigma, of course, to x taken with sigma, whose image, this is a one-to-one function, is a. So I made a into a Borel set as we required. Yes, so is that clear? It's just take A, a set in the sigma algebra, make it. Set in the sigma algebra, make it into a Kloppen set, and then take A with the topology from that Klopen set as a Polish space, and we are done. Okay, so the main corollary now is that, so I have two inclusions, the sigma algebra generated by B, by X, by open subsets of X, it's all Borel sets, and also the other way around. Also, the other way around, all Borel sets, subsets of X are in the sigma algebra. So I do know now that Borel subsets of X are precisely the sigma algebra generated by open subsets of X. And it's also I put here, this is just an exercise, it is also equal to the smallest family of subsets of X that contains open sets and closed sets and disclosed under countable unions and intersections. I don't need actually to add complements. I don't need actually to add complements. The reason is you start with open sets, and then you notice that the complements of open sets are countable intersections. They are closed, so they are countable intersections of open sets. Therefore, both open and closed sets are here. And then if you start with a family closed under complements and you just close it under countable unions and countable intersections, you actually get the sigma algebra. So this is just. Algebra. So, this is just a small remark that is useful sometimes. And we will, yeah, so this is sometimes useful. So, notice there's some immediate benefit from it, from this thing here. For example, it's not completely obvious. If you look at our definition of open Borel sets, you can ask: are Borel sets closed under the complements? So, for us, remember Borel said was an injective continuous image of a Polish space. It's not obvious that the complement can also be represented like that. I mean, where would this other Polish space of which the complement is the one-to-one continuous injective image, where would it come from? But from this representation, it's immediate. It's a sigma algebra, so the complements are in. On the other hand, it follows that for elements of the sigma algebra, if I take a continuous Sigma algebra: If I take a continuous injective image of an element of the sigma algebra, it will also be in that sigma algebra. It will also be, the reason is, from our definition, continuous injective images of Borel sets are obviously Borel, because it's just composed of two injective functions, one that gives you the Borel set and the other one that is given to you. But it's not completely obvious that if you are within that sigma algebra, that continuous injective image. Sigma algebra that continues injective images keep you in a dead sigma algebra in another polished space to region up. But from now, this equivalence, I get this closure property. So this equivalence equality gives you kind of a lot of freedom with this with Borel sets. Where are we? Aha, okay. So some more coloraries. Let me just kind of, for emphasis. Father, can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes, sorry. This is the first time I see Bora cells get introduced first as like one-to-one images. Me too, me too. Thanks. What was your reason? Like, you wanted to give the extreme. Okay, I was thinking about what to do, and I, okay, you have to start with Polish spaces. Have to start with Polish spaces. And I thought, okay, let's erase all the prejudices from my mind. And then, okay, once all this is gone, what are the natural continuous functions and you have Polish spaces? What are the natural new sets that occur there? These are images. And then naturally, you just define these two. That's how I was thinking about it. Just, I mean, to be honest, I mean, also to do something. I mean, you know, what do you call it? Like equipartition of annoyance or something, so that not only people who don't know this stuff are annoyed, but also people who do know that stuff get a little bit. But it's, I mean, I think it's, this is just a joke, but I think it's kind of natural. If you just think about these Polish spaces and what are the new sets that are introduced in this category, this is how you would define them. And also, I noticed later. And also, I noticed later, you see, if you want to prove the equivalence with the usual stuff, you have to go through these things that I discussed with Mark: that I should do separation and I should do this Kuratowski stuff about topology change. So it's kind of naturally used here, these theorems that are kind of important in their own right. So that was the reason. It doesn't answer your question, it seems. Your question, it seems okay. All right. Any other questions? Okay, so we've so now let's just for emphasis, yeah, these two very important theorems here. Lusing theorem, disjoint analytic sets can be separated by Borel sets. And usually, this is used by if I have analytic sets that are disjoint, then they are separated by sets in the sigma algebra. Generated by sets in the sigma algebra, generated by open sets. That's the classical Lusian theorem and Susslin's theorem that follows from one. That's quite important. This gives you a precise relationship between analytic and Borel. This is a very important 1917, as it turns out, paper of Susie. So if I have a, notice if I have a, if I have a Borel set, so a set is Borel precisely when it and its complement. When it and its complement are analytic. So this means it is analytic and co-analytic. Its complement is analytic, so this makes the set analytic. Yes, so this is a precise relationship between Borel and analytic. So notice, why is that true? If I have a Borel set, it is analytic, because that's from the definition, from our definition, immediate. But now, if you take the complement of a Borel set, it's also Borel because Borel sets for. It's also Borel because Borel sets form a sigma algebra. Therefore, this complement is also Borel, therefore, it's also analytic. So, I check that Borel implies that it and its complement are analytic. Now, assume, now let's go in the other direction, assume that a set and its complement are both analytic, then from point one here, they can be separated by a Borel set. So, I have A and X minus A are analytic and. Minus A are analytic and of course disjoint. Therefore, this fellow is included in C, Borel. When C doesn't intersect the complement, that's the separation. But these two things simply mean A is C. Therefore, the analytic set was Borel. So this was proved by Sussin first and then losing, probably using a similar method, but then losing isolated. Method, but then losing isolated from it is more general. Okay, so this gives you an exact relationship between Borel and analytic. Aha, so I should say, wait a second, I have to finish in a moment, yes? Yes. I started five minutes late. I remember now. Oh, oh, that's right. Okay, yeah, then it has one letter. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, so now I said in the beginning we want. I said in the beginning we want to our sets, analytic and Borel, are defined externally as images of some continuous functions. Now we achieved one goal here of defining Borel sets internally to x, just it's the sigma algebra. Is there something like that for analytic sets? Okay, is there an internal definition for analytic set? Turns out there is. So this has to do with the so-called So, this has to do with the so-called Susslin's operation A. So, here is this operation A. So, I have an operation A. Let's just look here at this. What is the input? I have, so X is a Polish space, actually and arbitrarily satisfying. I have F S subsets of X indexed by finite sequences of natural numbers. So, I have all these F S, and I produce a new subset of X. A new subset of X denoted by A S F S. And I have to tell you when I put X inside of this subset, I put it precisely when there exists an infinite sequence of natural numbers such that the set X belongs to that intersection. What is it? So, if I have an infinite sequence alpha of natural numbers, I can look at its truncations. I can look at its truncations, finite truncations. These are finite sequences of natural numbers, of yeah, of natural numbers. Each of those gives me a set Fs. And then I look at, so I, each such alpha produces a sequence like this, and so forth. So my point, so I have given a point, I have to find such an alpha that my point will belong to the intersection of those. Will belong to the intersection of those of those x of those of those of those sequence, the intersection of the sequence. And there is a theorem, and again, so theorem, a set A is analytic if and only if it comes from applying the operation A to some family FS of closed sets. So I'm getting it from closed sets by applying operation A. Okay, and actually. Okay, and actually, to be truthful to history, this was the original definition of analytic sets due to losing. And so our definition is also some kind of transformation of it. So now this becomes a theorem. Now, Martin Elekesh tells me this is why they are called analytic. This is the reason why they are called analytic, this definition here. And the reason is, this is the union over alpha. A union over alpha intersection over n f alpha restricted to n. And this in the old notation is written like this. So it looks like a product and a sum, looks like an analytic function, except it's not a function, it's a set. So hence the name analytic. I'm not sure if this story is true, but supposedly this is where it came from. But supposedly, this is where it came from. Okay, so let me say a little bit about the proof of that theorem. Is that clear? Is this operation a it takes a little bit of time to get used to it. But let me ask if something is unclear. There is this quantifier here, right? I say there exists an alpha, given x, I have to find an alpha, an infinite sequence. An alpha, an infinite sequence such that x behaves in a particular way specified by that alpha with respect to this family of fs's. Okay, so where do these fs's come from if from our definition? Oh, okay. So they come from, let me let me maybe just do this, let me just tell you how to prove how an outline of this proof. How do I prove from analytic to this? Prove from analytic to this. So I have a function f going from n to n to a continuous surjection. How do I define the fs's? Well, I mean, you do the natural thing. Fs is equal to f of n s closure. And then you check that things work out. So you look at this combinatorial structure behind a Structure behind a. This is, of course, for S in N less than. Takes a little bit of proof, not much, to prove that this works. So just take the cone, this basic open set determined by this finite sequence, take its image, take its closure. These are closed, and then you check that A S F S is A. Going the other way, let me maybe, because I have it written, so let me say. So let me say, how does one go the other way around? That's also quite simple. One defines a subset of X cross n to n. This H is one puts X alpha inside of H, if and only if for each N, X is in F alpha restricted to N. And now what happens here? And now, what happens here? There's a kind of an interesting thing, it's mildly interesting. This set is closed. Why is this closed? Because one checks directly that if n is fixed, this set is closed. This is a set on two of pairs, x and alpha. It's closed essentially because f alpha restricted to n is closed. And then one And then one takes a countable, this quantifier says for all n, this must happen. So this corresponds to taking a countable intersection. So these are sets, these are, sorry, I misspoke. These are sets of three elements, depending on three elements, on three parameters, x, alpha, and m and then I take. And then I take, I so I can make out of it a set depending only on n, namely the set of all pairs x alpha, such that x alpha n fulfills this condition. And then I take the intersection over all n, this stays closed because intersections preserve closedness. So that's a closed set, and then one checks that A is the projection. That A is the projection on X of H. So notice H itself is a closed subset of a Polish space. Polish, Polish, product is Polish. So it's a closed subset of a Polish space. So H itself is a Polish space. Projection is a continuous map. So this is analytic because it's a continuous image of a Polish space. Image of a Polish space, and we are done here. Yes. So let me, okay, let me take one more minute. Let's just, okay. So, are there any questions to this proof? To this proof? So, it's kind of this is this is natural going down, is natural going up, it's not difficult either. So, essentially, it seems like, well, you didn't, okay, we do have some representation of an analytic set within X itself, but you didn't really do much. You are essentially just mimicking. Really, do much, you are essentially just mimicking F, what F does. But it's not the case. Operation A is very mild. So, for example, continuous images of measurable sets are not measurable. Operation A is very mild. It actually preserves all these notions like measurability, like having the Berke property. And hence, we get this theorem immediately that analytic sets are measurable with respect to any Borel probability measure, any Borel measure. Measure, any Borel measure, and they have the Bear property on any Polish space. And the reason for it is that Bear property sets and measurable sets are preserved under operation A and they contain closed sets. Closed sets are measurable and they have the Bare property. So if I take the closure of closed sets under operation A, I get analytic sets and I don't get out of the realm of measurability or having better property. Or having better property. So, operation is very mild like this. This is something very nice about it. It preserves all these regularity properties, while taking a continuous image does not. All right, I think I'm out of time, so thanks. Any questions? I think there's I think there is I think there is a question on Zoom. Hello, I have a short question if it's possible for me to ask. Yeah. In the definition of operation A. Operation A. Yeah, there it says X belongs to A sub S F S if and only if there exists a sequence such that that condition holds. But my question is, on the left-hand side of that implication, we have an S? Oh, okay. I see what you mean. And on the right-hand side, there's no S. Hand side, there's no s no, no, this is maybe this is this is like a uh what do you call it over s in n less than n. I just take maybe I shouldn't have written this is just notation, sorry about this, a applied to this family. It's simply I take the family of all F S's and I apply A to the family of F. So it's something like, let's say, the intersection over N A N, right? Over n a n, right? X belongs to the intersection if and only if, or the union. This is just notation. If and only if there exists an n, x in a n. So here there is no I C. That's the S. Maybe that's your question. This is the S. So I have a family indexed by various S's, and I would say A is in a certain set associated with that family, AFS. Family A AFS, if and only if there exists an alpha such that X belongs to a certain intersection. What is this intersection? F it belongs to each F sub S here, where S is equal to alpha restricted to N for every N. Right, that's much, much clearer. Yes, okay. Thank you very much. Yes, notation is a little misleading. It looks like, yes, it depends on S, it's just supposed to indicate here. Just supposed to indicate here that S is the index with respect to which we are doing the operation. Any other questions? So we have a coffee break for the next 15 minutes till 3:30.
