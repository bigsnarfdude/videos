This uh paper at this conference because um I don't know how many of you all were at like the virtual version of this conference a couple summers ago. And so I gave a talk about isolated points of odd degree on modular curves and Philip Niemann gave a talk about odd degree points coming from Q curves. And so this project is really sort of the combination of ideas from those previous papers that we presented on in the virtual version of this workshop. All right, but I want to start at the beginning, in particular, talk Start at the beginning, in particular, talking about what is a sporadic point, or more generally, what is an isolated point. So, definition. So, I want C over K to be a nice curve over a number field. Nice meaning smooth, projective, geometrically integral. And we're going to say that a closed point x X of degree D is sporadic if C has only finitely many points of degree at most D. So if C has only finitely many points Of degree at most d. So you could think about sporadic points or points of unusually low degree because they're one of only a finite collection of points of such low degree of the curve. So just to give an example, so this particular class of examples is due to Bar Classen. So they were studying points on families of Fermat or On families of Fermat curves. So if we have f sub n is defined by x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n, I want to view these as curves over q. And if I take n bigger than or equal to 7, then they showed that this curve has only finitely many points. of degree at most n minus 2. And so any point of degree less than or equal to n minus 2 on this curve f sub n is going to be a sporadic point because it's one of a finite collection of points of such low degree. All right, but more generally, maybe if you want a definition that's a little bit more connected to geometry, you could Geometry, you could introduce the notion of an isolated point. And so, basically, an isolated point is going to be a point of degree D that doesn't belong to an infinite family of degree D points parametrized by a geometric object. And so more formally, so we say X is isolated if under this natural map out from the desymmetric product of C into the Jacobian. So I want to make sure X is not coming from, say, an infinite family parametrized by the projective line. And so I can do that by saying there is no other k-rational point Y. So a K-rational point of just be symmetric product that has the same image of X. That has the same image of x under this map. Because if so, if there were such another point, then their difference would have been the divisor of a function of degree D, and then we would have an infinite family of degree D points just coming from taking the pre-image of rational points under this degree D map to P1. We don't want that to happen if we're considering our point to be isolated. But we also want to say an isolated point isn't parametrized by some. Isn't parametrized by some positive rank abelian variety, in particular, some positive rank abelian subvariety of the Jacobian. So we also want to say there is no positive rank abelian subvariety A in the Jacobian of our curve such that such that x plus a is contained in the image of phi. If this condition is satisfied, where a is some positive Rank abelian subvariety, then by taking all the pre-images of this collection, you would actually also have an infinite family of degree d points. And we want an isolated point not to come from, or not to belong to an infinite family of degree d points coming from a map to P1 or some kind of positive ranking. Or some kind of positive recognition of sub-variety. And so, just to give an example of a point that's isolated but not sporadic, so the terminology isn't completely established. You might hear sometimes maybe with hyper elliptic curves, people talk about like unexpected quadratic points or exceptional quadratic points. So, let's look at what I would be calling an isolated point on a hyper elliptic curve. You may have seen this in other contexts. And so, this example is to And so this example is to Brown and Niemann. They were studying quadratic points on certain hyperelliptic modular curves. And so if we have x naught of 48, this is y squared equals x to the 8 plus 14x to the fourth plus 1. And so we have this natural map, so p1 is the redo to map. map, xy 28, 71, that just sends xy to x. And so this map gives an infinite family of degree two points by just taking all the pre-images of the q rational points at the productive line. Hilbert's irreducibility tells us that infinitely often the pre-image will actually be a degree 2 point on x out of 48. And so this is a parametrized, this gives a parameterized family of quadratic. Gives a parameterized family of quadratic points. But there are other quadratic points on this modular curve that don't come from this map to P1. So for example, actually I think this is the rest, the complete classification of the quadratic points. We also have the points plus minus squared negative 1 comma 4 and plus minus squared negative 1 minus 4. So these don't come from this map to P1. This map to P1, and so these are isolated points of degree two. Degree two isolated points. And so we can see from the definition of this map that this isn't going to be coming from the pre-image of rational points of P1. So we have condition one will be satisfied. You might worry about condition two. You might worry about condition two, but this example was chosen to cheat a bit, and the Jacobian has ranked zero. So this is not going to be satisfied either because there's no positive rank of abelian subvariety of the Jacobian. Then we can ask a question. Yes. So in your definition, example, any phi or if there exists a phi, where... So this is the math where, so if we're thinking about this, is effective advisors to degree D. Maybe let me put myself in the case. Maybe let me put myself in the case simpler to describe. If I have a rational point on my curve, although this isn't necessary if you have a degree D point, you could do something more generally. This is just the map that sends an effective divisor of degree D to the divisor class. And if we have a degree D point, then we're getting the effective divisor is just taking the sum of Galois conjugates. So it is a particular, a sort of standard math. And it has the effect. Standard math. And it has the effect of if you have a degree D point on your curve, it's going to then become like a rational point on your desymmetric product. And so that makes it useful as well. Get a question? Is it possible that you could have a different kind of algebraic family of degree D points that aren't of type one or two here? That's a really great question. So it turns out if you have an infinite family of degree D An infinite family of degree D points, one of these two things actually would have to happen. So if I have an infinite family of degree D points, if the first condition doesn't happen, that would mean it sort of injects, all of your degree D points sort of inject into the rational points of your Jacobian. But then you have Fulton's theorem that says that the rational points, the image of this map, can be covered by like a finite union of these abelian varieties. And so if you have infinitely many. And so, if you have infinitely many points that are projecting on the rational points of some finite collection of above and subvarieties, one of them would have to have positive rank. So, yeah, if you have infinitely many degree D points, that forces either equality to hold at some point or there to be a positive rank of the Lionel subvariety whose translate is landing into image. Any other questions? I don't know where the eraser is. Oh, no, these erasers. And so if you're seeing this for the first time, we can think about these sporadic points and isolated points as maybe a natural generalization of the set of rational points of a curve, at least in the case where the curve has genus bigger than or equal to 2. So just note. Note if the genus of T is bigger than or equal to 2, then we know that there are only finitely many K rational points. In particular, any K rational point is going to be sporadic, but there might be additional sporadic points of higher degree. So this is contained in the set of sporadic points, which is the Which is then contained in the set of isolated points. And moreover, all of these sets are finite. So all sets are finite. That's essentially coming from Riemann-Rock theorem, this is Falting's theorem. You can show that either any curve C over and over. Any curve C over a number of field K has only finitely many isolated points in particular. All right, so that's the definition of an isolated point or sporadic point. But for the rest of this talk, we're really going to be focusing on points of this kind on families of modular curves. One of the reasons for that is, I mean, we know even just identifying these points can be a really hard question, and now I'm asking for an even stronger classification of Stronger classification of exceptional points in my curve. If we're in the case of a modular curve, we have a lot of extra structure that we can leverage. But there are also some useful applications. And so I want to just take a minute to try to sell you on the usefulness of investigating isolated points on modular curves. So isolated points on modular curves. Mondular curves, in particular, some applications. And so you could investigate sporadic points or isolated points on more general families of modular curves. But I'm going to be focusing on x1 of n and x0 of n, which are parametrizing elliptic curves with a distinguished point of order n or distinguished subgroup of order n, respectively. Of order and respectively. And so one of the sort of immediate applications is in computing torsion subgroups of elliptic curves. So classifying torsion subgroups of elliptic curves. So the classification is known for elliptic curves defined over number fields. Curves defined over number fields of degrees one, two, and three. The complete classification in degree three was actually just finished summer 2020 by Dereks Etrupolsky, Van Hoy, Morrow, and Sareth Brown. But for any higher degree, the classification is still incomplete, largely because we don't know whether or not these modular curves have sporadic points. So, for example, in degree four, we know the torsion subgroups that arise for elliptic curves infinitely. For elliptic curves infinitely often, but we don't know if those are actually all of the torted centers that arise. And so one of the first sort of open questions in this direction is whether or not there actually are any degree 4 sporadic points maybe on X1 of n. So there are any sporadic points on x1 of n. On xp of degree 4. So a dispratic point might correspond to a torsion subgroup that arises only finitely often. And those are the torsion subgroups that are sort of the hold up in this classification problem. And there is a sporadic point, which I'll mention in a bit, of degree 3, x1 of 21. There's this elliptic curve that fellow. Elliptic curve that Philip found that has a rational point of order 21 over a degree three extension. So there are sporadic points in degree three, but at least I don't know of any examples of sporadic points of degree four. And so this is one reason why you might care about sporadic points on modular curves. Moving away from the classification problem a bit, if you're more into forming kind of questions. Questions. So, Morell's uniform boundedness result gives us a uniformity result for the family of modular curves x1 of n. But you might wonder what we can say about the modular curves x0 of n. And so let's say in particular degree two points on this family of modular curves. So characterizing quadratic points in modular curves x0 event. And so the case in the modular curves x0 event, something pretty different happens in the next one event, because if you're over a number field that contains the CM field of a CM elliptic curve, then for any prime that splits in that field, your CM elliptic curve is going to have a P to the N isogeny for arbitrarily high n. High n. And so any sort of uniformity kind of question has to be just whether or not we can say something about the non-CM points, because the CM quadratic points are going to keep happening for n arbitrarily large. And so this is a question. Masor asked this question, I guess maybe it was last summer at a virtual conference, and he has some notes on his website writing up some history of it. History of it, but it was asked by others earlier, of course. And that's for n sufficiently large. Does every degree two point come from either a cusp or a semi-elliptic curve? Does every degree two point on x naught of n correspond to a To a cusp or a CM elliptic curve. And how is this related to isolated points or sporadic points? We know that for n sufficiently large, so for n bigger than 131, any quadratic point on x0 of n is going to be a sporadic point. It's one of only finitely many degree two points. Finitely many degree two points. So any quadratic point is sporadic. And that's because we know which of the modular curves x, naught of n are hyper elliptic or billiptic. And it turns out for degree two points, they essentially have to come from a mapped P1 or a positive hypothetical curve. And so if n is bigger than 131, you're not going to be hyper-elliptic. You're not going to be hyper-elliptic or bielliptic, so any quadratic point would have to be one of only finite events. So, in particular, they would be sporadic points. A lot of what I'll be talking about in this talk is actually about the modular curve x1 of n. But if n is big enough, if you have a quadratic point on x0 of n, that it's going to actually lift to a sporadic point on x1 of n as well. So maybe that's just another note. So a sporadic point. So a sproutic point on x0 of n gives rise to a stratic point on x1 event for n sufficiently large. If you're thinking about a sporadic point as a point of order n an unusually low degree. Point of order and an unusually low degree. I mean, it just sort of makes sense if we have a rational cyclic inisogeny and unusually low degree, well, it's sort of going to lift to a rational point of order and an unusually low degree once we push in and big enough. And so the last application that I will mention is a connection to Sayers Uniformity Conjecture, which is maybe a little less immediate than these applications that I've listed. And so as I'm writing this, I realize that I'm calling it Sarah's uniformity conjecture, but this was actually only raised as a question by Sarah. But others, including Mr. Sutterland and David Sabina, have formerly conjectured it. And David Femina had formerly conjectured it, so I would be calling it Sarah's uniformity conjecture for that reason. Conjecture. And so that is the following, that there exists a constant C such that for all non-SIM elliptic curves, E over Q, Q, the mod P Gala representation associated to E is surjective for primes bigger than C. So the mod P Gala representation of B is surjective for primes P bigger than C. They're going to then see. And so this was asked as a question by Sayre. So this is a question of Sayre from his 1972 paper. And we even have a guess as to what we think C might be. We think that it's in 37. And so there's a lot of partial progress towards this question. A lot of special cases have already been addressed. Of special cases have already been addressed, and a lot of computational evidence supports it as well. And so, how is this connecting to sporadic points on modular curves of the form x1 of n? So let me show you the sketch of this. So, let's suppose we have an elliptic curve E over Q whose image of the mod P-value representation is actually equal to the normalized. For the normalizer of the non-split proton. So, why is this coming up? So, we actually know due to recent work of Slafforin and Lamos from 2020 that for sufficiently large primes, if the image of your Gala representation is not surjective, that it actually must be equal to this particular subgroup of GL2Z Ma Pv. And so, let's suppose we had such an elliptic curve. So, you can show just by looking at the matrix representation of the normalizer, the normalization. Representation of the normalizer of the non-slip carton, that this elliptic curve, so E, attains two independent p isogenies, actually sort of an unusually low degree. So over a number field F of degree P plus 1. And so within the And so within the F-rational isogeny class of E, we can trade in those two independent p-isogenies for an elliptic curve that actually has an F-rational cyclic P squared sub. So there exists E prime over F in the geometric isogeny class. isogeny class, in fact, in the half isogeny class in this case, based on how I've set things up, in the half isogeny class of E with an F rational P squared isogeny. Because it's like if your middle elliptic curve has two independent p isogenies, you can sort of pass to the quotient by one and in composition with the And then composition with the dual isogeny is going to give you a rational cyclic P squared isogeny. And so if you have a rational cyclic P squared isogeny, that's going to, you can sort of trade that in for a rational point of order p squared, as long as you're willing to take a twist and an extension of degree at most phi of p squared over 2. So that means that this elliptic curve, so this attains a point on x1. On x1 of p squared, a degree at most, well, p plus 1 times that factor, which is essentially the degree of the map from x1 of p squared to x0 of p squared. So degree at most, p times p squared minus 1 over 2. And this is going to be a sporadic point for p sufficiently large. So this is sporadic. is sporadic for P sufficiently large. And so how could you show that? I mean you can actually show that for P sufficiently large that this is a half of Abramovich's lower bounds or like the cuconality of the curve x1 of p squared. And if you're less than one half times the gonality, then a result of Fry tells you that you're actually a sporadic. That you're actually a sporadic plane. And so, before we go on from this example, because this is related to something we'll talk about later, we actually can show, so maybe just note. So by work of Oslo Edar, so I 2022, provided he is, she only analyzes the normalized or the non-slipper. She only analyzes the normalized or the non-slip curtain case, I think, when prime is bigger than 7. So then E itself does not give a sporadic point on x1 of p squared. It does not give a sporadic point of x1 of p squared. And so you have this situation where And so you have this situation where your elliptic curve with rational J invariant, the one that we started with, it's not producing sporadic points. But if we move up in the geometric isogeny class of our elliptic curve, we actually save a factor of p in the degree of our point on the x1 of p squared. So e would not be giving us a sporadic point, but this new quotient, which is actually a q curve, does or would give us a sporadic point if such an example exists. And so we talk at the end. And so we talk at the end about Q curves. It is important to realize that you're not always going to be getting your optimal low-degree point by sticking with your elliptic curve with rational J invariant. You can actually get an improvement by moving up in the exogenous tower of your elliptic curve. All right, so this was to try to motivate you to care about spreadout points on modular curves. Were there any questions about these applications before we move on? Alright, so now we're going to zero in on what can we say about the elliptic curves producing sporadic points on these modular curves. And I'm going to keep track of these elliptic curves by calling their associated J invariant a sporadic J invariant, or an isolated J invariant. So this is on the stride. So definition. So we say that some J in X1, just like our copy of P1, is a sporadic J invariant or the isolated J invariant. Isolated J-invariant. If it's the image of a sporadic point on x, 1 of n for some positive integer n. So if it is the image of a sporadic point or alternatively isolated point. Our alternatively isolated point on x1 of n for some positive integer n. And so I had mentioned this famous example of a degree 3 sprouting point on X1 of 21. So if you have your laptop or something handy, if you wanted to see the actual Or something handy if you wanted to see the actual equation of this curve. So you can go to LMFTB, it's 162.c3 is the elliptic curve. So it gives rise to a degree 3 point on x1 of 21. And so this example of Timon first appeared on archive, I think, in like 2012. And so the J-invariant of this ellipse. And so the J invariant of this elliptic curve, since it's giving us a sporadic point, we're going to say it's a sporadic J invariant. So the J invariant of E, which is negative 3 squared times 5 to the 6th over 2 cubed, is a sporadic J invariant. And so one of the first projects that I did on this, which actually started at a Women in Numbers conference in 2007. Women in Numbers conference in 2017 at Vanf. So there's a lot of connections to Vanth in this talk. Is that if you assume Sergei uniformity conjecture, there are actually only finitely many sporadic J invariants in the rational numbers, or even more generally, isolated J invariants in the rational numbers. So theorem. So I call threshold awesome H star. Aslam Edgar, Ywan Liu, Francis Odmodu, and Bianca Varai. And so if we suppose there's uniformity conjecture holds. Then within the rationale, the rules of the Russian Then, within the rational numbers, there are only finitely many isolated J invariants, which implies there are only finitely many sporadic J invariants. So then, there exist only finitely many an isolated J and variant section. So, what we mean is that there are only finitely many elliptic curves with J-invariant and the rational numbers that give rise to an isolated point of some degree on some modular curve of the form x1 of n. And so anytime you think that maybe there's this finite set, you want to know, well, can I actually say something about it? Can I identify it? Can I explicitly say what the set of isolated J invariants are in the rational numbers? And so we do have examples of. We do have examples of J invariants that are isolated. So all CM J invariants are isolated. We also, here's an example of an isolated J invariant in the rational numbers. So we also have negative 3 squared times 5 to the 6th over 2 cubed is an isolated J invariant. And also, J invariant, and also because we have these sort of exceptional rational points on x0 of 37 associated to non-semolliptic curves, one of those elliptic curves actually gives you an isolated point on x1 of 37. So the J invariant of that elliptic curve is negative 7 times 11 cubed. All right. Non-CM isolated J and variant. So we think this set is most likely finite and that non-trivial. You know, there are a lot of examples, or we have examples, so it's not empty. And so a project that I worked on recently with my graduate student, David Gill, my colleague Jeremy Ross, who is also here, and my professor Watson. So we were able to classify the non-CM isolated J invariance if we restrict to considering isolated points of odd degree. It's a way to sort of get around having to use Sergei uniformity conjecture because if you had some elliptic curve whose mod P image landed in the normalized order non-split carton, the corresponding point of order P is going to be defined over E of n degree. So that's why we're not having to That's why we're not having to rely on Sayer's uniformity conjecture. So, the only non-CM J invariance corresponding to isolated points of odd degree on x, one of n. On x, 1 of n. Well, 3 is odd, so we have the J invariant from Phillips' elliptic curve. So our negative 3 squared times 5 to the 6 over 2 cubed. And we did find one other example of a non-CM isolated point of odd degree. So this 3 cubed times 13 over 2 squared. So this gives you a degree 9. So this gives you a degree 9 point on x1 of 28, which is isolated but not sporadic. And so that's why people hadn't noticed it before, because there were infinitely many degree 9 points. Why would you have zeroed it on this one in particular to see that it wasn't part of an infinite family of degree t points? And so this elliptic curve actually was identified in a computational project of Philip Nyman and Enrique Gonzalez-Jimez, but there was no reason to suspect that curve in particular would be isolated. Curve in particular would be isolated, but our argument is something that comes out from it. We were able to answer this question for the case of isolated points of odd degree, well, the question of characterizing the set of isolated J invariants in Q. And so you might want to start getting to a more general classification question. Yeah. Can you reiterate which M is still to? Yeah, sure. And so. Yeah, sure. And so we don't claim to have a complete classification of the n's corresponding to the J invariant. It's just once it's corresponding to a spratic point or isolated point on some x1 of n, it's automatically a sporadic J invariant. So this one we know gives a spratic point on x1 of 21. So in this case it's spradic, if that's also isolated. This one is giving us an isolated point on x1 of 28. So let me double check that it's 2028, yeah, degree 9.0 next one, 28. So it's isolated, but not sporadic. But, I mean, we don't know if this elliptic curve actually gives sporadic points on other examples of, or other, maybe there are other ends at which it's sporadic. But for this question, it's like, once it gives us a point of low degree, this is now a sporadic gene frequency. And so it would be nice to try to extend this to include at least certain even degree spread of points. And I think one possible next direction is maybe to look at the elliptic first, giving you a rational point on the X. Giving you a rational point on x0 of p for some kind p. So I'll explain why this is a neutral class. So, can we characterize elliptic curves over Q or with rational J invariant with a nontrivial P isogeny. The isogeny, which give rise to isolated or sabratic points, which give rise to isolated or spratic points. And just to be clear, like because I'm talking about degrees of points on the modular curve, I'm really Curve. I'm really saying elliptic curve over Q just as a way of fixing the J invariant needs to be rational and also to talk about where the P isogeny lives. But for a point on a modular curve, we're certainly willing to take a twist and use an equation that's no longer defined over the rational numbers. So perhaps it'd be better to talk about elliptic curves with rational j invariant, which give you a Q rational point on X side of P for some P. And the reason why, so this is connected to the case of odd degree, because To the case of odd degree, because a lot of what we were able to leverage in odd degree is that generally, not always, there are some exceptions, but generally, if you want a point of order p defined over a number field of odd degree for an elliptic curve with rational j invariant, generally that elliptic curve actually has to have an isogeny defined over the rational numbers. And so, we were able to leverage that isogeny connection a lot for this case. So, maybe just suppose we have the isogeny. So, maybe just suppose we have the isogeny connection at the start. And also, you know, we have this connection with Sarah's uniformity conjecture. For elliptic curves which possess a non-trivial p isogeny, work of Lemos tells us that actually Sarah's uniformity conjecture holds for that class of elliptic curves. So you're also sort of set up. We know unconditionally there are only finitely many, and so maybe you can try to compute it completely. Okay, so moving on to Q curves. On to Q-curves, which is the most recent piece of the story that I've been involved in. So, transitioning curves. And so let's include this definition. So an elliptic curve is a Q curve. curve if it's isogenous to its Gal log conjugates. So if it is isogenous and to be clear, I mean metrically isogenous, so isogenous over Q bar to its Dao R conjugates. And so we have a lot of examples of concurrency. A lot of examples of Q curves. So, if some authors like to omit CM elliptic curves from consideration, but if you're taking this to be your definition, then all CM elliptic curves are Q curves. Also elliptic curves with rational J invariants. And also in any elliptic curve that's geometrically isogenous to an elliptic curve with rational J invariant. What the curve is rational to the correctness of the corporate. So this is not an exhaustive list. There are other examples of Q curves, but these are similar to the kinds of elliptic curves that we've already been looking at. And I know a lot of times when people talk about Q curves, they are thinking, like, oh, well, these are the elliptic curves. Thinking, like, oh, well, these are the elliptic curves where number fields that are modular in terms of being quotients of j1 of n for some n. That's maybe not quite the best perspective for these kinds of questions because the problems that I've been looking at so far have been investigating elliptic curves with rational J invariant. And so for the purposes of this talk, it's probably better, you're probably better to think about a Q curve as just sort of like a natural generalization of the set of elliptic curves with rational J invariant. So if you've been investigating, So, if you've been investigating sporadic points associated to elliptic curves with rational J invariants, maybe it makes sense to investigate sporadic points associated to Q curves more generally. And so we're thinking about how elliptic curves over Q, well, this is contained in the set of elliptic curves. With J invariant in Q, and this is contained in the set of Q curves. So I'm thinking of this as just an extension of the class I was already studying. And so let's recall before that Sarah's uniformity conjecture actually implies implies that there are only finitely many sporadic J invariants in the rational numbers. So this implies there are finitely many sporadic J invariants in the rational numbers. All right, well what if there were only finitely many sporadic J invariants corresponding to Q curves? Well there actually aren't because all seems Actually, they aren't because all CM elliptic curves, under my definition, are Q curve. Any CM elliptic curve is going to give you a sprattered point. So, we need to rephrase that question and only talk about non-CMQ curves. So, however, if we had only finitely many sporadic J invariants corresponding to non-CMQ curves, so finitely many sporadic J invariants. J invariance associated to non-CM Q curves, then this would actually imply serious uniformity conjecture. And the reason for it is that that example that I spent a while on in the beginning, that if you had an elliptic curve, That if you had an elliptic curve whose image was equal to the normalizer of the non-split carton, well, for sufficiently large primes, that would actually give you a sporadic point. And so, if you had only finitely many sporadic points, that would mean there were only finitely many elliptic curves whose mod P image was equal to the normalizer of the non-split curtain. And so, actually, in fact, this is a little stronger even than what you would need. It's actually enough to show that they're only finitely any geometric ISO. All of the non-CMQ curves, they give you a sporadic. Q curves that give you a sporadic point, if you could show that those all belong to only finitely many geometric isogeny classes, that would also be enough to imply serious uniformity conjecture. And so perhaps the right perspective, instead of looking at it curve by curve, maybe you're better off looking at geometric isogeny class by geometric isogeny class. Does this isogeny class contain an elliptic curve that gives me a sprout at a point? And so we're able to get some progress in this direction again. Get some progress in this direction again by moving to the case of odd degrees. So this is always joint with the lambda. And so we show that all Non-CMQ curves giving rise to a sporadic point of odd degree let x1 of n for some n. So again, I'm looking at all of the modular curves x, 1, and n as n ranges through all positive integers, and I'm considering all of the sporadic points in odd degree of all of those, on all of those curves. If that sporadic point corresponds to a non-same Q curve, then that Q curve actually has to belong to one single isogeny class, namely that elliptic curve that gave us a degree 3 point on x1 of 21. So all of these NCMQ curves giving us CMQ curves giving us sporadic points of odd degree lie in the geometric isogeny class of the elliptic curve with J invariant negative 3 squared times 5 to the 6th over Q cubed. So essentially any non-CMQ curve that gives you a spratic. Q curve that gives you a sporadic point in x1 of n, you could realize as a quotient of the elliptic curve that Philip Nyman found that gives you a sporadic point of degree 3 on x1 of n. And as we saw before, this is a stronger classification than just looking at elliptic curves with rational J invariance, because we saw that you could actually get a point of lower degree maybe by moving up in the in the isogeny class of the elliptic curve. Yeah. So here and on the right side of the uh of the board. Side of the board. You also, you really mean that, or you mean up to Q bar is okay? So this would imply it, but you're right. You actually could have like the weaker thing and saying, actually, all of these sporadic non-CM2 curves, if they belong to only finitely many isogeny classes, you would also imply that. So this, I use this phrasing because it looks a little more like this phrasing, but this is much stronger than what you would need. You actually just need to show that Actually, just need to show that any non-ZMQ curve giving you a sporadic point on x1 of t squared belongs to one of finitely many isogeny classes. So this is much stronger than what you would need. I was just trying to match the setup of the first question. And so, sort of, getting back to the question from earlier, like, we're just saying. Earlier, like we're just saying that if you have a sporadic point, you're in this isogeny class, but we haven't said anything about whether or not there are additional examples, if there are infinitely many Q curves in this isogeny class that give you a sporadic point. We haven't done anything or said anything about that. And so more generally, you could ask, well, does there even exist, could it be class, or does there exist an isogeny class that contains? Disogeny class that contains infinitely many non-CM sporadic J invariants. So does there exist a non-CM isotony class containing infinitely many sporadic data variants. And so if you, within your geometric isogeny class, you have an elliptic curve that gives you a sporadic point in sufficiently low degree, then you can actually say the answer to this question is yes. But so far, the only examples that we have of these elliptic curves that give you these like super stratic points are like very low degree spratic points. points or like very low degree spratic points only are CM elliptic curves. And so this does happen within a CM isogeny class. You can have infinitely many J invariants of CM elliptic curves that correspond to sporadic points, but we don't know if that could happen in a non-CM isogeny class. All right, so in the time that I have left, I'm not going to sketch the details of the proof, but maybe just give you some big picture strategies that Like strategies that go into it and seeing how you could do something like this. So, the big ideas of the proof. And so, one crucial result is that when we're going to be able to do that So one crucial result is the one that Philip spoke about during the virtual version of this workshop a couple years ago. So by work of Cremona and Naiman from 2020, so if E is a non-CM Q curve defined over MR V. Defined over a number field F of odd degree. Then the elliptic curve is isogenous over F to an elliptic curve with rational J invariant. So then E is isogenous over F E prime is the J invariant in the rational number. In the rational numbers, which is good because we know a lot more about the image, the chaotic gala representation associated to elliptic curves over Q. And so we can try to leverage that to say something about what's going on with torsion points on the Q curve. And in particular, one of the things that we can use is that over F, the image of the mod P dollar representation associated to E. Representation associated to E and the image of the mod P Galois representation associated to E prime, which is this elliptic curve with rational J invariant, but it's probably like a twist of it maybe that's defined over F. These images actually have the same index in GL2ZP. So have the same index in GL2ZP. In DL2. And so, also, so this is sort of like a more concrete way to maybe use what you know about the image of the pietic Gala representation associated to an elliptic curve over Q. Well, this is maybe a twist of that curve, but you can still get some information about it in this case. And also, since we've restricted it to odd degree, likely. To an odd degree, likely the model of your elliptic curve over Q generally has a rational cyclic P isogeny. And so our classification of p-iadic images is much more complete in the case where our elliptic curve over Q has a P isogeny. And so you can use just this equality of indices to give you some lower bounds on the degree in which your Q curve can get a point of order P to the N. And so actually, this This index work itself and the classification of certain images of theatic Gala representations. This shows that there are no sporadic points of odd degree on x1 of p to the n corresponding to non-CMQ curve. And so, really, the bulk of the paper then is going from like, okay, powers of a particular prime to the general case. And so, what this means is that if you have a spratt point on x, 1 of n, the only way it could, morally, the only way that it can happen is actually if there's some unusual entanglement in the torsion point fields of this elliptic curve. So maybe the torsion point field of points of order p to the n and points of order 2 to the n. Of order p to the n and points of order q to the n for distinct primes q, or p and q, that those would have to have some unexpected overlap. And so stratic points on x, 1 of n associated to non-CMQ curves. CMQ curves must come from unexpected entanglement in torsion point fields. So from unusual entanglement, so larger than usual intersection between distinct prime-power torsion point fields, entanglement in their torsion point fields. in their coercional plate fields. But these J invariants, I mean, we're not controlling the field of definition of the J invariance of these Q curves. And so then really the big picture strategy is to show that this unusual entanglement of torsion point fields over here, if we pass through this isogeny, we want to try to show that your elliptic curve with rational J invariant would also have to have maybe Would also have to have maybe different but also unexpected entanglement in its torture point field. And so that's sort of the punchline: is you want to use misageny in step one to pass some amount of the unusual entanglement to eat. And so it's an air. And so since this elliptic curve is a twist of an elliptic curve, it's rational J invariant, it also can force some amount of unusual entanglement for an elliptic curve over Q. And so now we basically prove that we show implied cases of this unusual entanglement, implied cases do not deal with the same thing. not ideal stratic points of odd degrees. So one of the parts of the paper, you know, there's this collection of like 10 modular curves that are characterizing certain kinds of entanglement. And so we find the rational points on these curves, and then we show that any non-CM rational points, if we study that elliptic curve, we can show that. If we study that elliptic curve, we can show that within their isogeny class that there are no sporadic points, unless you're in the isogeny class of that particular curve in the theorem of state maps. All right, so that's the big picture overview of the strategy and the ideas involved. So I think I will stop there. Thank you all. Any questions for Adi? So let's say that instead of using the X0 and X, Y again, use the analogous covers of GMORA curves. Do you have any analogous results in that situation? I don't, but you certainly could ask the same kinds of questions, and it would be really interesting to investigate. Yeah, I just haven't done any work in that direction here. Well, there is an issue there that you cannot descend to Q because these curves don't have real points. You could take accumulator quotients. All right. Maybe it's obvious to everybody else, but I don't understand the use of the word entangle. Does that mean like you share all the subfields? Yeah, so it's like if we have P, Q distinct primes, we say that there's, well, there's some different definitions of entanglement, but I would say that there's entanglement if you Say that there's entanglement if you have sort of the Q adjoin, like E bracket P intersect, Q adjoin E bracket Q. If this like properly contains Q, there's sort of like more overlap. I mean, sometimes there's some amount of overlap that's explained by some cyclotomic field, but you know, there's going to be some piece of it. And so I would consider that to be not unusual entanglement if it's coming from roots of unity. And there's some. Roots of unity, and there's some recent work: Paris Daniels, Alvaro Lizano Robledo, and Jackson Morrow. And I think, under their definition, that would be like explained entanglement. But unusual entanglement would be where we don't really understand, there's no good reason why there should be overlap. We would sort of expect these to be linearly disjoint aside from things with roots of unity. Maybe you want to more generally say M and N relatively prime. You don't have to keep to. You don't have to keep to distinct crimes. But yeah, that's what I mean by entanglement. There's sort of unexpected overlap between torsion from fields. In that case, a follow-up because you single-out cyclotomic, is it known if any unexplained cyclotomic entanglements can happen? You really should ask like Harrison, Alfredo, and Jackson. So I do know that, I mean, a lot of the time, these field of definition, I mean, like, even the sporadic one. I mean, like, even this sporadic point on X1 of 21, I mean, it's what is it, the maximal real subfield of the ninth cyclotomic field where this is happening. And so, there's the thing. So, it may be that these cyclotomic fields actually have a larger role to play in sort of why these things can happen. But I don't know, I haven't looked at these papers trying to do a systematic study of entanglement. My recollection was. Of entanglement. My recollection was sort of like if it's coming from roots of unity in a way that we predict, that that was explained. But there could be maybe other ways where you could overlap with roots of unity that you wouldn't expect. Any further questions? I would like to stress that it should be possible for people who are participating through Zoom to also ask questions, which should appear as a disembodied voice in the room. Yeah, people watching already hear our questions. Hearing no other questions, let us thank Abby Aganda.
