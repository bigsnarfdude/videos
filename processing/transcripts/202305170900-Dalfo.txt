Welcome to the third day of our workshop. For me, it's a real pleasure because we are connected now with our webinar called Mirka Miller, in honor of Mirka Miller, webinar of Mirka Miller. We are connected. We used to have this session each Wednesday. I don't remember. Wednesday, I don't remember, each third Wednesday of each month, and this is the third Wednesday of May. And we are here, and we have now an interesting and special talk because the work has four co-authors, but we will have three speakers. We have a conduct day, and the speakers are from. The speakers are from the Polytechnical University of Catalunya, and our first speaker is Université of Jeda. Excuse me, because that was my name. I made a lot of relationship with this university, University of Jeda. And well, I introduce the first speaker only, and then you'll introduce one of them. And our first speaker is Monica Reyes, a Mexican student in Asia. Welcome, Monica. Thank you. Thanks for the presentation. Good morning. I'm going to talk about the Laplace spectra of topography of a cycle. And this is a joint work with Cristina Darfo, Michelangelo Chiol, and Arnaud Monce. I'm going to explain the first part. Part and what first of all, what is a token graph? Given a graph on n vertices and for given a k between 1 and n, the k token graph denoted by this is a graph in which the vertices correspond to configurations of k indistinguishable tokens placed at distinct vertices of k. For example, if we have c4, we can put We can put two tokens in these configurations. And these are all the configurations of two tokens. And two vertices of the token will be adjacent whenever one configuration can be erased from the other by moving one token along an edge from its current position to an unoccupied vertex. For example, if we have this token placed at a vertex 2 and we move to the vertex 2, Move to the vertex form, we have that these vertices are adjacent. And the same for the rest of the vertices are, for example, in the case of CIFOR, we have that the two token of CIFOR is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph 24. And the motivation to study token graphs is that they are used for solving some problems, like they. Some problems, like the isomorphism graph problem, modeling a system in quantum mechanics, error correcting code, and break code for combinations. And well, some known facts about the token graphs is that the one token is isomorphic to the original graph. And if we have a graph on n vertices and k from 1 to n minus 1 to n minus 1, the k token is isomorphic to the n minus k token. For example, in this case we have c token six and the one token is isomorphic to the five token and the two token is isomorphic to the four token. And if we have a k lesson, we have that the spectrum, the Laplacian spectrum of the k token is contained in Token is contained in the Laplacian spectrum of the big token. And this is special for the case of the Laplacian spectra, because, for example, with the adjacency spectra, it doesn't happen. And well, we are interested in knowing the structure of the token graphs of a cycle. And here we have some examples. And also, we are interested in knowing the spectrum, the laboratory. The spectra, the Laplace spectra of the token graph of cycles. And to know the La Preschenian spectra, we use regular or equitable partitions. And well, if we have a graph, a partition phi is a partition of the set of vertices such that for every i and j, there is an integer, v i j. integer Vik such that each vertex in one class of the partition has exactly Vik neighbors in the other class, regardless the choice of the vertex. And we define the quotient Laplacian matrix of a graph with respect to the partition like this. Then if we have a graph Then, if we have a graph and we have a precision, a part of the spectrum of the graph can be calculated by the Cauchy applushing matrix. Here we have an example. If we have this graph and the partition with these colors, we can calculate with the equation of Laisian metric a part of the spectrum of the original graph. Of the original graph. Applying this to the two tokens of cycles, we have that the two token of the cycle on n vertices, when n is equal to two, that is when n is seven, we have that the two token has the same values. And especially when especially when r is equal to mu minus one this element is the spectral variance and well here we have an example the two to n of C F and some partitions and for the case when N is off in this part the truth token of the cycle has this in value. Cycle has decent environments. But these are only a part of the spectrum of the two tokens, not in the complete spectrum. And to calculate the complete spectrum, we use the leaves. And we have a proof in a voltage assignment on the graph is a mapping from the set of edges. From the set of edges or art to the elements of the group, such that satisfy this condition. If we have the graph and the voltage assignment, we obtain a new graph, that is the leaf graph. In this example, we have the Peterson graph with the leaf of this graph with this voltage assignment in this probe in C file. And to the pair of the graph and the voltage assignment, we assign the Laplace and Bayes matrix, defined with T, where V of T is the diagonal of degrees matrix minus V of A, where V of A is equal to, is defined as this. And when following the results of the Coffee Hall antsigram, we obtain that the spectrum of the leaf is equal to the union of the spectrum of C, where C is in the set of n roots of unity. And B, V of zeta, is equal to this matrix that was introduced by the That was introduced by Daipho, Leol, Cilan, John Brian, and Milk and Mir. And when C is equal to 1, we obtain the Cauchy matrix of a regular proposition of the leaf. In 2022, Darfol, Fiol, Pablicova, and Siran proved that the two token of the cycle CN of the cycle Cn when n is equal to 2ν plus 1 is isomorphic to the leap of the path of new vertices with a loop at the end with this voltage assignment in the group CN and here we have the example of the two tokens of C9 that is equal to the width of this graph and And we can compute the whole spectrum of this lip with this matrix, where T is equal to the quote-haffe unit. Well, this is the case when N is of and the next question is what happens with N is even? And what Christina is going to talk about.
