For that, emotionally. Sorry. And so, yeah, the title is long also because of all the technicalities involved. And so, what I study in this work is a magnetic Schrodinger operator with a strong magnetic field. And the operator looks roughly like this. We have HB is the operator, which is H0 of B plus B times B. B plus B times V, where V is an electric potential, which in my case will just be taken to be smooth at compact support. And H0 of B is the magnetic field, the part of the operator that contains the magnetic field. And I'm taking the operator to have this form where we take the total dimension. we take the total dimension n to be strictly bigger than 2d where d is the well is this variable the dimension of the magnetic field and the mu j's called the electric charges and they're taken to be positive and so in well under some assumptions and a lot of technical conditions and after some Conditions and after some other technical conditions and considerations. And sorry, B is the strength of the magnetic field. And we take one over the square root of B to be the semi-classical parameter. So in this case, as we will see, we will study what happens when B goes off to infinity. So which this means that H becomes very small as it does in semi-classical analysis. And so And so there is some theory which I did not develop, I'm using, which says that the wave operators for the pair H0 of B, which I remind you, was this operator here in the middle without the potential V, without this part. So the wave operators for this pair H0. For this pair H0 of B and H of B, which are defined in a similar way as always as the strong limit in L2 on Rn of U of T time, well composed with U0 of minus T exist and are complete, where U of T and U 0 of T are the unitary groups of these operators, H and H zero. And so And so we can therefore define the scattering operator again in the usual way by setting it equal to W plus, well, the adjoint of W plus composed with W minus. These are the wave operators up here again. And so for positive, and again, here, maybe it's I imagine the people in the audience who That people in the audience who see how many details I'm omitting, and I'm aware that this is for a reason. So for a positive energy E, we can then also define another operator, which I will call S of E, B, which acts on L2 of R2D crossed with the sphere of dimension and sphere of dimension n minus 2d minus 1 and it is defined through this equation where f0 of e is if you want to think about well i suggest for those who are not familiar with the details of this setting to think of it as a version of the for um there is a little more to that again i'm omitting a ton of detail but A ton of detail, but as you all know the Fourier transform, it will be a good enough approximation to think of it as a version of the Fourier transform here. So this operator S of E is called the scattering matrix. And then we can define the scattering amplitude in this way. So this should be capital E, and I apologize. I, for some reason, I had computer. For some reason, I had computer problems and was not able to edit this file last night. So again, this is there is a coefficient here which I'm omitting, but roughly the scattering matrix minus the identity operator on this space here, L2 of R2D cross this sphere, is called the scattering amplitude that energy E. And this is the operator that I want to study. That I want to study in this talk. And so, what I want to study about this operator is its micro-local structure. And this is partially motivated by earlier work which I have done on the micro-local structure of the shrouding operator with compactly supported potential and with short-range potential. Short-range potential under various conditions, and also work I did with Jean-Fran√ßois Bouni and Thierry Ramon on the structure, microeconomic, the scattering amplitude at the maximum of the potential again for short-range potentials. And so motivated by So, motivated by these works, I wanted to study the microvocal structure of the scattering amplitude in this setting. And in all the previous settings, there was no magnetic field, but here, for the first time for me, there was a magnetic field. And so, that changed a lot of things. A lot of things were very, very different from the way they were in the previous settings. And so, even the, as I say, I want to study. As I say, I want to study the micro-local structure of the scattering amplitude, but even defining what that would mean in this case took some work. Because in all the previous cases, what I and my collaborators proved was that the scattering amplitude was a semi-classical Fourier operator. But in this case, as we will see, the structure was very different and it was. Was very different, and it was something well. Well, I had to create a new class of operators to characterize the structure of the scaring amplitude here. And so, I will try to give you, as I said, a very bird's, very much of a bird's eye view of what happened in this problem. And so, how do we study the micro-local structure of this operator here is the first. Operator here is the first question, even before we know what it is, even before I knew what it was. Well, again, there was a convenient representation of representation formula of the scattering amplitude, which you're seeing now on the screen. And now that looks very, very complicated, and it is, but I'm gonna just again give you a bird's eye view and point you only at the operators. Only the operators you need to quote-unquote worry about right now. But so let me briefly explain this formula. So, the important part is this middle term, which is an integral from zero to such to some large positive number T0 of the unitary group of P sub n. Now, what is P sub n? I have not defined, I will tell you in a moment, but They will tell you in a moment, but roughly you can think of it as our operator H, but it's not that. It's related. It comes from that operator, okay? But it's not that operator. But, you know, for the purposes of understanding the idea here, you can think of it as the operator H. And so outside of that, that integral is sandwiched on both sides by this commutator term. By these commutator terms, and chi1 and chi2 are some cutoff functions. I'm not going to go into that here. R1, R plus, some other operators. Again, I'm not going to go into that. F0 tilde is again a version of the Fourier transform, a little different from what I used in the slide before. U tilde is a metaplectic operator, which essentially Which essentially, well, essentially, for the purposes again of your just getting an idea of what's going on here, you can just think of it as a change of variables operator. What it does is it changes the variables. So it allows us to more or less remove the magnetic field, more or less, and work with an operator which doesn't have a magnetic field in it. And that's where this piece of band comes in. It's if you want. Comes in. It's if you want. Again, none of what I'm saying here is precise. So please, the experts in the audience know that I know that what I'm saying here is not precise, but that is because if I, because I only have 30 minutes and even with an hour, I won't lose everybody if I go into all the details. So this piece of band is not the previous operator H conjugated by this metaplectic operator, but you can think about it this way for the purposes of your. About it this way for the purposes of your understanding the main idea. So it's roughly the given operator H, but in the new variables that this metaplectic operator introduces. Okay, and so and then there is an error term, which is big O of H to some large power, which can be made arbitrarily large. Sorry. And so this is all complicated looking, but for the purposes of But for the purposes of studying the micro-local structure of the scattering amplitude, we more or less only need to worry about the micro-local structure of this operator, this unitary group. And so how do we study that? And again, some of the experts in the audience will anticipate how one would go about studying that. What we do is we construct the parametrics, which is Metrics, which is an approximation of sorts to this operator. And that is first done for small t. And that parametrix that we construct has a form like this. And so just observe again, so the experts anticipate and understand what this means. Other people who are not experts on this particular area, please just observe that this. Please just observe that this has this oscillatory term e to i over h times some function phi of t y z eta theta. Theta is the variable with respect to which we integrate here. And then there is some amplitude here, which is also a function of all these variables. And there's also this U prime. Sorry. So this is the kernel of this operator, well, of the parametrics. Well, of the parametrics, the approximation of this operator that we construct. And there is some theory constructed by other people before me that I was able to use here. There was, again, a lot of technicalities to take care of because of extra variables that appear in this case. So, nothing from previous theory transferred completely to this problem. Everything needed to be adjusted, which is okay. That's why this was. Is okay, that's why this was a problem worth doing. Well, one of the reasons. But so, what I want to emphasize here is the following: this parametrix is valid for small t. But in the representation of the scattering amplitude that we have here, as I said, we have t0, which is large. So, we have to find an approximation for large t. An approximation for large t. And this is where things became interesting. So first, let me say, sorry, what happened? Okay. Okay, so let me observe here that this is where things became interesting. This is where all this new stuff that I had to create happened. So in other in the In the earlier settings that I mentioned, that I had studied, because we didn't have the magnetic field, this type of parametrix was automatically a Fourier integral operator. But in this setting here, it is not that. It is a symbol in y theta. And for each y theta, it is a Fourier integral operator. It is a Fourier integral operator in the other variables, which z and z prime and theta is the variable with respect to which we integrate. And so this is where I had to first create that class of symbols. I'm calling it NHFIO-valued symbol. And symbols, most of you know, have to satisfy certain semi-norm estimates. So I need Norm estimates. So I needed the norm on this class of operators that, well, class of functions that take values in as FIOs. So there were things to worry about that so that this new class of operators both make sense in the context of the already existing theory and it can help me solve the problem. So there were things to worry about here. worry about here to to to think about how to define this properly so that it makes sense and another thing to notice is that and this is not clear from from the slides but in the problem uh this paramatrix uh as i said it's a symbol in y and the in the y and theta variables and symbols one quantizes as semi-classical um so differential operators and Operators and the quantization in this problem involved not the derivative h dy but h squared dy for reasons that are not clear from the slides but that you know come out of the work and so if one rescales here if instead of if we call h the new h squared then we have one over h here in the oscillator Over H here in the oscillatory term. And so this symbol becomes of class S one half, which means that with every derivative in y and theta, you lose a power of h to one half. And so as I said, going back to where I want to use this, which was sorry, which was right here. Was right here. I want to approximate this operator, but for large t, and this parametrix that I just showed you is for small t. So typically at this point, one would compose these operators and obtain an approximation to the operator for large t makes sense, right? It was always done before in the cases where there was no magnetic field. Magnetic field. But here, this was a challenge because these symbols of this class one half, one can compose them and one knows that they are again symbols of class one half, but one doesn't know what their structure looks like. And this is where I had to prove a result which turned out to be. Turned out to be, well, I'm calling it here, semi-classical result of independent interest, which said the following thing: that the composition of two such HFAO valued symbols of class S one-half under geometric assumptions on the families of Lagrangian sub-manifolds take quantized because FAOs are related to Lagrangian sub-manifolds, for those of you who may not be experts on this area. Experts on this area. I'm not going to details here, but so under geometric assumptions, if we compose two such symbols, we do indeed obtain an NFAO-valued symbol of this class S1 half, quantizing the composition of these two Lagrangian sub-manifolds that the original symbols quantized. And so, this was an interesting semi- An interesting semi-classical result that I had to prove because why is it interesting? So, as I said, sorry, in the 11th hour, I had some technical problems and I had to create this new slide. So, this result is interesting because for symbols of class S delta with delta between zero and one half, there is an explicit formula for the composition symbol, which does not hold when delta is one half. When delta is one half, and there is no explicit formula in the case when delta is one half, which is my case. So, well, from the existing theory at that time, I knew that the composition symbol is a symbol of class one half, but I didn't know if it was an HFIO and to what Lagrangian submanifold it was related as such. So, this was what I needed to prove. And so, Prove and so, and I did prove it. Actually, I should acknowledge Johannes Schollstrong helped me with a little hint. I asked him, I mean, the question came from me, from this work, not from him, but I asked him and he helped me. After I asked many experts and nobody could help me. Anyway, but I'm just saying it's not so obvious. I'm not saying anything bad about the experts. I'm just saying that this was not so obvious. And so, this was an interesting result of independent. An interesting result of independent interest that came out of this work, which was about the study of the scattering amplitude. And so, with that result, I could then compose these operators that were defined and valid suppose mod t. I could compose them enough times to get an approximation to this original integral that I needed for large t, for large enough t. T for large enough t and know that this operator also for large t is such a Nefoyol valued pseudo-differential operator. And so then using, well, these other operators on the two sides of this integral don't change the micro-local structure of this operator. They change some other things, but not the micro-local structure. But not the microlocal structure. And so this gives us that the scattering amplitude in this case is a semi-classical FAO-valued pseudo-differential operator, which is this new class of operators that I needed to create to characterize the structure of the scattering amplitude here. And so let's see one second. I just thought of mentioning. Just thought of mentioning something and I forgot, but sorry. Okay, so that was, oh, and yes, I was going to say that there is a, some of the experts in the audience are probably wondering, there is a non-trapping assumption here that I'm not explaining because the trajectories that we are looking at, the classical trajectories that we're looking at, That we're looking at depend on these extra variables y and eta. So the non-trapping assumption has to be uniform in y and eta in a sense and so on. So there are many details that I'm not explaining here. And I hope the experts in the audience know that I'm doing this on purpose and I do understand the details. But so I also, so in summary, I want to say that To say that the two important things that came out of this project was first to uncover this new microlocal structure of the scattering amplitude in this case and to define this new class of pseudo-differential symbols and operators. So again, these FOL-valued symbols, which when you quantize, they become FAO. Which, when you quantize, they become FVL-valued so differential operators. That's the only thing I thought of calling them. And as a kind of a side result of that was this semi-classical result of independent interest, because again, before that, nothing was known about the structure of the composition symbol of two symbols of class S1 half. The symbols of class S one half. And I don't know that without this work, anyone would have thought, oh, I wonder what the structure is when the symbols are HFIL valued. You know, I don't think that would have come up easily to anybody's mind. So I don't know. I mean, again, I'm not saying anything negative about anything. I'm just about anyone. I'm just saying that this was an interesting thing that came out of this problem. And so, And so, after that, using some earlier work, and again, I apologize that I wasn't able to edit my slides yesterday, so I'll just show you the result from the paper. So, after that, well, again, adapting some earlier work to this setting in the adaptation was not exactly trivial. Exactly trivial, not too hard, but also not too trivial, not trivial at all. One could explicitly find the micro-local expression, if you want, of the scattering amplitude in this case under another geometric assumption, which I'm not going to go into detail here, but it's an assumption on the classical trajectories, which again, I'm not. Which again, I'm not describing here. And some of you have seen that, some of you don't need to see it in a 30-minute talk, probably. So, but I just want to say, and as you see, there are a lot of sums, a lot of technicalities here, which I will not explain. But again, it just says that the operator has this form where the oscillatory term. The oscillatory term has this phase function as KL. Well, KL doesn't matter, this depends on the indices, which these are the classical actions along these non-trapped trajectories. And these symbols, the AKLs, admit asymptotic expansions in powers of H, as I say here. So this gives a more explicit. So, this gives a more explicit asymptotic expansion of the scattering amplitude under this assumption on the classical trajectories. And this partially recovers and generalizes a result of Laurent Michel from 2005, in which he proves such an expansion, but under more conditions and in a less general setting. In less general setting, so I'm not going to go into detail. And another thing to notice here is that, so, okay, so this is a miscreant. Perhaps we run out of time. That's okay, Michigan. Sorry, are you talking to me? Perhaps we are running out of time if that's okay, Michael. Okay, sorry. I thought I had two more minutes, but that's okay. That was maybe 30 plus 5 and that 25 plus 5. If you want to wrap up in two minutes? Yeah. Okay, I will. Yeah, I will wrap up in one sentence. Okay. Yeah. So the one thing I wanted to point out here is this term, this is the type of quantization that we have. That we have. So instead of the usual, say xh dx, here we have these kinds of terms in the quantization. And the proper way to define this really is through what is called the magnetic quantization, which is a theory developed by some Romanians and Marius Mantoyu and Uric and And I'm sorry, I forget the third name right now. A team of three Romanians developed the theory of magnetic quantization, and this is really what comes in here. So just wanted to point out that this theory comes into play here as well. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Well, we have time for each question. It's a question. Go ahead. I have a question. Have you considered using FBI transform techniques to understand this propagator at large times? Because if you use FBI transforms, it would run into caustics and you could avoid having to compose. Not in detail. I have not tried to do that in detail. A little. In detail, a little very tangentially. I might be wrong, but it seemed to me that this way. Well, I don't know. I mean, are you saying that it will be better? I mean, you might be right. I don't know. I don't know. It just might be a way to, you know, you can't account for costs on the FBI transplant side, so the icon inflation might not explode. You may not have to compose, but propagator at small times. Propagator at small times and get up to this large T naught. Okay, well, that sounds like a great idea. I'll think about it. Thank you. I had not done it. I just very tangentially, not in detail. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you all very much. Can you stop sharing? Yes, sorry. Anteri, are you there today? Hello, can you hear me? Dr. Kimuel, can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you all. Thank you. And are my slides showing and moving around for you all? Yes. Our next speaker is Ferric Klenhank from Michigan State University, and he would talk to us about decay rates for the dumping for the damped weight equation on the totals. Thank you. Before I begin, I just wanted to thank the organizers for putting on this excellent workshop and making it so easy to participate online and also for giving me an invitation to speak here. Giving me an invitation to speak here. So, I am going to talk about the damped wave equation on the tortoise, but first, just the damped wave equation. I'll consider mg, some Riemannian manifold with a metric g, and I'll fix a w, which is some bounded positive function. That's going to be my damping coefficient. And then the damped wave equation is just the normal wave equation, dt. The normal wave equation, dt squared u minus Laplacian u, but then I add in this w times dtu term that's damping. And I'm particularly interested in the Cauchy problem, so I specify some initial position and derivative data in H1 cross L2. I want to study the asymptotic behavior of this as t is going to infinity and the quantity of particular. And the quantity of particular interest is the energy. And this is given by the integral over the whole manifold of the gradient of u squared plus the time derivative of u squared. And this really is physically the energy of the system. If you think about u as being the displacement of a string or a drumhead from equilibrium, then these two terms are exactly the potential and kinetic energy. Potential and kinetic energy of that system. And so taking the time derivative of this energy and then integrating by parts and applying the equation, one gets that the time derivative of the energy is this integral minus integral of the damping coefficient times dtu squared. And since the damping is non-negative, that derivative is non-positive, and so the energy of the system. And so the energy of this system is non-increasing. And the natural question to ask is: when does there exist some rate r that's going to zero as t is going off to infinity, such that the energy of a solution at time t is controlled by the rate at that time multiplied by the initial energy. And I want that rate to hold for any initial data in H1 cross-l2. And when this happens, And when this happens, I'll call it uniform stabilization. So this result was shown by Rauch Taylor and James Ralston. And together, if the damping is taken to be continuous, then uniform stabilization occurs at an exponential rate if and only if the damping satisfies what's called the geometric control condition. What's called the geometric control condition. What that is, is the existence of some large constant t such that every geodesic, at least as long as t intersects the set where the damping is positive. So here I have some example manifolds. On the left-hand side, this guitar-looking string thing is meant to be a domain in R2 with a boundary, and the damped region is. And the damped region is a neighborhood of the boundary that I've shaded in purple. And every geodesic eventually will reach that damped region. So that satisfies the geometric control condition. And on the right-hand side, I have a picture of the sphere where the damping is, again, taken to be this purple region, and the damping is supported on the entire northern hemisphere and just a little bit of the southern hemisphere that also satisfies the geometric conditions. Also satisfies the geometric control condition. And so, you know, if you get bored of the talk at some point, you can think of your favorite manifold and then try to think about what kind of dampings will get you the geometric control condition or not. I'll also just mention that in partial joint work with Blake Keeler, we've been able to extend these results to slightly more general dampings. So if the damping is taken So, if the damping is taken to be a zeroth order pseudo-differential operator, or if the damping is time-dependent, then the geometric control condition implies exponential decay. I should really say the appropriate generalization of the geometric control condition implies exponential decay. But I won't focus on that. The focus of my talk is going to be on what happens when the geometric control condition does not hold. And so, something to note is that uniform stabilization is actually always automatically exponential because solutions of the damped wave equation have a semi-group structure. Basically, if you walk forward some fixed time until you've lost a fraction of your energy, you can just keep on walking forward that fixed time and you're always losing that same fraction of energy. Losing that same fraction of energy, and that turns into exponential decay. And so, without the geometric control condition, I need another kind of decay. I still want to ask for a rate that's going to zero as t goes off to infinity, but now my right-hand side is the h2 norm of the initial position data and the h1 norm of the initial derivative data. There's also this little one-half on the energy that's just there to Half on the energy. That's just there to make the powers and the norms work out correctly. But the really interesting change is this H2 and H1 on the right-hand side. And all I'm asking for there is one additional derivative of regularity from the initial data. And that's because the initial energy data, sorry, the initial energy really is just the H1 norm of the position data plus the L2 norm of the derivative data. Two norm of the derivative data. And so we've just increased the degree of Sobolev regularity here by one. And when this decay occurs, I'll say that the system is stable at this rate r of t. So it's a result due to Lebeau and then sharpened by Bjurk that this is actually the right kind of decay to look for. If the damping is bounded and the set on which the damping is And the set on which the damping is positive is open and non-empty, then the system is stable at some logarithmic rate. And that open and non-empty condition is really just a non-triviality condition. The damping is doing something, and already this is the right kind of decay to get. It's also sort of the best kind of decay that we can reasonably hope for. Lebeau shows that his result is sharp. Is sharp. If one takes the manifold to be the two-sphere, for example, with damping supported away from an equator, so here these blue regions are meant to be the support of the damping. The white region is undamped, and the red line is the equator around the circle. So that red equator never sees the damping, and there are solutions of the damped wave equation which decay no faster than that logarithmic rate. Than that logarithmic rate. And so on the sphere, it actually turns out that the geometry of this positive set totally determines the decay. Basically, you either have every geodesic meeting the damp region, or one geodesic doesn't. There's a little bit of a subtlety, but about having just perfectly the normal. Having just perfectly the northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere damped, but really it's it is just all down to geometry. Nothing else kind of happens once you've fixed the geometry of W. But now I want to shift focus over to the two-torus, where dampings can have identical support, but different decay rates. So from now on, my manifold is just going to be T2, and I'll start off with this result due to an othromonic. With this result due to Anatoman and Leito from 2014, they take this same non-triviality condition that Lebeau and Birk had, but they get an improvement. They get this rate of 1 over t to the 1 half for all solutions of the damped wave equation. They also, in this same paper, show a lower bound. They show that if the support of the damping does not satisfy the geometric control condition, then there are solutions. Control condition, then there are solutions decaying no faster than one over t. I want to clarify the distinction between the support satisfying the GCC or the positive set satisfying the GCC. So here I have two examples of the torus realized as a rectangle with its opposite edges identified. The left-hand rectangle here, again, the damping is supported. The damping is supported on these purple regions and it's zero on this white strip. And so this does not satisfy the GCC in either sense because there's all of those geodesics in the white strip that never encounter the damping. And so this is the case that Anantarman and Laeto are talking about, where there's like a whole family of undamped geodesics. The right-hand torus, this little white strip is meant to be just a single. Strip is meant to be just a single geodesic that's left undamped. And so this doesn't satisfy the full strength of the GCC because there is that single undamped geodesic. But taking the closure of that positive set does end up including the geodesic. And so the support of the damping does satisfy the geometric control condition on the right-hand side. If you want to learn more about that, there's an excellent paper by L√©oteau and Larry. Excellent paper by Leoteau and Lerner from 2017, where they explore this case in depth. But I want to focus on the left-hand case here, where there's this whole family of undamped geodesics. So I promised that we would get different decay rates. And so getting into that, continuing in the same paper of Ananterman and Laeto, they consider dampings with a sufficient number of With a sufficient number of L infinity derivatives, and also satisfying what I will call a derivative bound condition, and that I abbreviate dBc. This is the existence of some constants such that the absolute value of the gradient of the damping is controlled by one constant multiplied by w to the one minus epsilon. So, this is all hypothesis. Hypothesis, and then the conclusion that they draw is that the system is stable at some epsilon-dependent rate. Let me unpack this a little bit more. First of all, this derivative bound condition, it's non-trivial only near where w is zero. As soon as w is bounded below by some constant, you can take the constant c big enough, and then the condition. Big enough, and then the condition is just trivially satisfied. So the dbc is really saying something about how w turns on from zero. And what it's saying is that a smaller epsilon in the condition means a more gradual turn on from w. And what the result is then saying is that this more gradual turn-on corresponds to faster decay. A great example of this that they talk about in their paper is w vanishing like e to the minus 1 over x. This satisfies the derivative bound condition for any value of epsilon, and so gets decay arbitrarily close to 1 over t. And remember, that is the best possible rate that one can get when the support of the damping doesn't satisfy the GCC. On the other extreme, in an appendix to that paper written by Nanenmacher and then in later work by Stan, it was shown that if the damping is an indicator function on a strip, then the system is stable at this polynomial rate of 1 over t to the 2 thirds, and this rate is sharp. There are solutions decaying no faster than this. So, indeed, this does give the promised dampings. The promised dampings with identical support and different decay rates. You can take an indicator function on a strip or a damping that is turning on with that exponential rate on the strip, and there are different decay rates. To further clarify this and to give even more examples, I want to consider this damping W that depends only on one variable. So it's invariant in one direction on the torque. invariant in one direction on the torus. It's zero in between minus sigma and sigma and then turns on like the monomial x to the beta. So this is the formula for it and the graph down here is a picture of its cross section. And so this is a good example to study because when beta equals zero, this is exactly the case that Nanamasha and Stan were considering. John, we're considering. And when beta is positive, these all satisfy the derivative bound condition with different values of epsilon. They satisfy it with epsilon equal to 1 over beta. And so now I want to plot on this graph. On the horizontal axis, I have the different values of beta, the different exponents in this damping. And then on the vertical axis, I have the best possible decay. Best possible decay rates, alpha. And the way to read this graph is that these green bars are forbidden by the first results of an Anthromannin layout. So no matter what beta is, the decay is always faster than that one over root t, and it's never faster than one over t. So it doesn't sit in these green regions. And then the gold region, that's from the The gold region, that's from the derivative bound condition that Anantraman and Leito did, because when epsilon is equal to one over beta, their exponent of one over one plus four epsilon becomes beta over beta plus four. And so that crosses the line a half at beta equals four, and then comes down and saturates that lower bound as beta goes off to infinity. And so Infinity. And so, based on all of those results of Ananterman and Leoteau, the way to really read this chart is: given some value of beta, the possible the sort of permitted decay rates lie somewhere in this white region. So you pick a beta, and then it's somewhere in between these curves. Then in partial joint work with Kirill Dachev, we were studying W's of this form and we were able W's of this form, and we were able to show a beta, a different beta-dependent rate, but importantly, that this was the sharp rate, so that there are solutions decaying no faster than this rate. And I'll also mention that there's recent work by Chen Min-Sun, where he studies a generalization of this. He allows W to depend on both X and Y, but has the same turn-on profile. But putting this But putting this back on the graph from before, our result is essentially this purple curve here. It's saying, given some value of beta, we actually know exactly what the decay rate is. It's this minus beta plus 2 over beta plus 3. So that exactly agrees with the result of Naden, Masher, and Stan at beta equals zero. And then as beta goes off to infinity, that saturates the That saturates the lower bound of an on-throw monument leoto. And so, again, what we're seeing here is that somehow a more gradual turn on of the damping is corresponding to faster decay. But this does pose a question of what actually is governing this decay? Once the geometry is fixed, once we're locked into some strip where the damping is turning on, what's actually Damping is turning on, what's actually producing this sharp behavior? On the one hand, it's reasonable to expect that it's the derivative bound condition. There is the anon-thromon and Laito result that uses it, and all of those polynomial dampings satisfy the derivative bound condition. So that could be the thing that's driving this different behavior. But on the other hand, all of those polynomial damping All of those polynomial dampings also have different holder regularity. And there's actually nothing in any of the results that says it has to be the derivative bound condition. So it very well could be holder regularity. A good candidate for study to disambiguate this is to look at W vanishing like that exponential from before, but now multiplied by something which is rapidly oscillating. Is rapidly oscillating as it turns off. So, this green line is the vanishing profile for the damping. It's fitting underneath the exponential envelope, but it's oscillating more and more rapidly as it's turning off. And this is really the ideal candidate for study here because such a W can be taken smooth, but no matter what, it only satisfies the derivative bound condition with epsilon equal a half. condition with epsilon equal to a half. And so this has sort of decoupled those two conditions in a way that the polynomial damping was not able to do. And so I have a result on this as well. For w oscillatory as above and y invariant, then the system is stable at rate one over t to the four fifths. So unfortunately, this Unfortunately, this doesn't actually answer the question. If regularity was the more important thing, then one should be able to get decay for this damping arbitrarily close to 1 over t, because that's the rate you can get with e to the minus 1 over x, which is also smooth. And so all smooth things should have the same rate if regularity is most important. And then on the other hand, if the derivative bound condition Hand, if the derivative bound condition is most important, this rate of 1 over t to the 4/5ths should be sharp. It should be possible to show that there are solutions decaying no faster than this rate. And the reason for that is taking a polynomial w with beta equals 2 satisfies the derivative bound condition with the same value of epsilon, and it has such solutions. So, being able to either push past able to either push past this one over t to the four-fifths or show that it is the sharp rate would be evidence on one side or the other for this question of what actually is determining the rate. I also want to just briefly mention how these things are proved. Of course, we've already seen a couple of excellent talks about the damped wave equation that we're touching on this anyway. That we're touching on this anyway. So let me just recap in my setting. The way all of these results are shown is via resolvent estimates or the existence of quasi-modes for the associated stationary operator. So here, all of the dts have been replaced by IQs, and this is the operator one gets. And the key result is really this theorem due to Borachev and Tomilov that. To Borichev and Tomilov, that showed a sharp polynomial decay rate for quasi-modes under a certain resolvent estimate. So there's this sort of complicated relationship between decay at rate 1 over t to the alpha and this exponent in the resolvent estimate. On a more specific scale for these results, how are the resolvent estimates actually shown? They're proved either. Shown. They're proved either using commutator estimates or the multiplier method, which we also heard about earlier this week. And then any quasi-modes that are constructed are very explicitly using the particular form of the dampening, the fact that it turns on exactly like a polynomial where it does, and that it's zero on a strip. And then together, all of that stuff is combined using the implicit function theorem to build those quasimodes. Build those quasi-lines. So that's everything that I wanted to talk about today. So, thank you all so much for your attention. Excellent. Thanks very much. Any questions, comments? What about online? Is there any questions from the audience? Online, is there any question from the audience online? Oh, this is excellent. It was all very clear. Thank you very much for your presentation. And well, that's it for today. I hope you have a good session. Shall we? Thank you. Have a good evening. Thanks. Have a good evening all. Thanks. Have a good evening all. And I have something of them. Tomorrow we have to do the leak by Wayne. Yes, it's quite early either 10 or 10.30. That is all. Can we leave on spots? In the past, I've done it. In the past, I've taken things and put them there. Yes. Like my ex and. Yes, like the level by the level. So, can we? I have to go to the reception print buttons, yeah? And we can leave in the main reception, there is still a room there to store log X if you make form of marks.
