So, first of all, this is not changing. Hold on. Okay. So, first of all, I want to show you this impact picture just to have an idea of what is the muscle, what is the function of muscle. All of us can do this type of exercise in which you can tone your muscles. And all of us have in our minds that the main goal of muscle. Of muscle is to produce force. So, this is in normal conditions, right? But what happened when our body has about over 600 muscles? So it could be a really nice system to study. But the main point is to study the muscle not in normal conditions, but in an abnormal condition. So this is in which the force cannot be trained. Force cannot be transmitted into the body. And it exists some kind of diseases. In this particular picture, I want to show you the muscular dystrophies. So muscular dystrophies are a muscular progressive disease in which the force that is produced in muscle cannot reach to the tendons and the force is not produced properly. And the children that have And the children that have this kind of disease are a terminal disease, and the span of their age is about 15 to 20 years old. What is the main point of this? Well, even though the contractive apparatus that is inside the muscle is in well shape, the proteins that are inside this are not behaving correctly, especially with this disease. This is the dystrophy that it's not well behaving. In the pictures that I show you above, you can see the normal muscle and the adouce muscle, that is the pathological muscle. In the normal muscle, I think that you can see my pointer, the fibers are in a regular shape. The nuclei are surrounding the cells. Surrounding the cells compared to a dosen muscle, you can see a lot of holes. The size of the cells are diminished, are smaller, and there's also infiltration of lipids. So we can think that the force that is transmitted in the Duchenne muscle, it's not transmitted appropriately. So our main focus is to study this kind of disease, but in animals, In animal models. Well, this is not changing. Okay, so this is a better representation of what is happening. So we have the muscle, if we zoom in, there's a skeletal muscle fiber, and inside the skeletal muscle, there are a complex of proteins that are called customers. The main function of the customers is to transmit the force that is generated in the contracted lapara. It's generated in the contractive apparatus to the membrane and from the membrane to another cell and to another cell, ending to the tendon, and finally to be able to produce the force. Inside this complex of proteins are some others that are called, for example, dystrophine, desmine, and also cynamine, which are the ones that I will going to talk you right now. And especially how we study the biomechanical properties. Study the biomechanical properties of these proteins. The customers, this is an immunoflorescence picture that shows how the customers align in a skeletal muscle fiber. So as I told you, the customers transmit the force generated in the contractile apparatus in the actin and the myosin, and the force that is generated in here is transmitted across the cell membrane to the extracellular. Cell membrane to the extracellular matrix ending into the tendons. Another way in which the force can be transmitted is when the muscle is generated in the contractile apparatus, then it passes through another sarcomer and it ends in the tendons. So these are the two ways in which the force can be transmitted. But if there's a disruption of any of the proteins that are in this area, That are in this area, it causes a problem in the first transmission. The proteins that we want to study are the dystrophine, the cinnamine, and desmine. Cinnamine and desmine are cytoskeletal proteins compared to dystrophine, that is the anchor between the cytoskeleton and the sarcolema. In here, I show you the molecular weight of each of those. So, our main goal is to analyze the biomechanical. Is to analyze the biomechanical properties of the sarcolerma and the customers and the individual resulting from the absence and or the modifications of any customer protein. Why? Well, at the end of the talk, I will show you that this has a clinical goal. Why? Because most of the times when these type of persons that have this kind of disease go to the doctor or maybe The doctor, or maybe to the physiotherapist, the physiotherapist tells them to develop the same type of exercise. And I will show you that inside of the cells, they do not behave as all of the diseases. So these type of diseases have to be treated in different manner. So, well, in order to study the bio-mechanical properties, we use Mechanical properties, we use a device that is called the elastimeter. The elastimeter is a U-shaped manometer that is attached to a fiber. This is a fiber from dystrophic mice. These are transgenic mice that do not have dystrophine or do not have desmine or maybe cinnamon. So, after we isolate one single fiber attached to its tendons, we attach able. We attach a microfiber. If this is a manometer, we generate negative pressure. And when the negative pressure reaches the sarcolema, it generates a blood. If we increase the negative pressure, the size of the blood, it means the height of the blood will increase. So in this manner, we can measure the size of the blood at different conditions. Size of the blade at different conditions. And afterwards, we can calculate the pressure of the membrane, the stiffness, and the pressure at which the sarcolema breaks. We use some parameters, for example, the radio of curvature, the area of sphere, the force in order to be able to calculate the superficial tension, and the stiffness using. And the stiffness using really simple approximations, as for example, the simple harmonic oscillator, in order to calculate the stiffness. So, this is what it's happening inside the fiber. There are some tension lines in here, and what we calculate, it's the representation of a sphere, as I'm showing you with my pointer. When we develop all these equations, These equations, we are able to see, we are able to calculate the, as I told you, the force, the superficial tension, or the stiffness. This is a better scheme of what I have told you, in which we generate a bleb when we apply negative pressure. If the height increases, the height of the bleb does it as well, and also it exists a separation. It exists a separation between the sarcolema and the cytoskeleton. So, this is really important if we want to compare the different conditions of our animals that mimic what is happening in real life. I will show you a video in which I'm applied negative pressure and you can see how there's a discontinuity between the sarcolema and the cytoskeleton. This is really important for our experiments. So, in here, I'm showing you how we apply the negative pressure and the height of the blood, it increases. Analyzing the pictures and the videos, we can see when the 80% of the sarcolema appears and also the total separation of the sarcolemma. So, this is a total separation of the A total separation of the sarcolema. When we analyze, after doing several experiments, what we obtain is, for example, in here a comparison of different conditions of a wild type animal. It means that it's not altered. The MDX condition in which the dystrophy is absent, or when the desmine is absent. You can see You can see at the bottom of each picture the pressures that are applied with the manometer. If we focus in our first panel, the applied pressure 200 is about the same with the MDX condition. In here, at 141, the blood displacement is higher. It's higher compared to wild type, but in here there's a discontinuity between the sarcolema and the cytoskeleton. So it means that there's something happening with the protein that attaches the sarcolemma to the cytoskeleton. And if we remember, this protein is the dystrophy. I'm showing you another example of the Desmin animal, in which at a smaller pressure, 122, there's a discontinuity that is. There's a discontinuity that it's about the same of the MDX, but in the controlled animal that has all the proteins, you can easily reach higher pressures and there's any kind of discontinuity between in the system. There's a representation in the right panel of the graphs in which I show you the pressure versus the height and The height and in the altar systems that it's the MPX and the Desmin animal, the height of the bleb is higher and also the discontinuity, it means the sarcolemma, when the sarcolema deattaches from the cytoskeleton, it's more rapid compared to the wild type conditions. So, what does this mean? Well, so first of all, if these animals mimic what is happening in the human being that has any kind of these dystrophies, the fibers of these persons do not behave the same. And this is what we have showed to the clinicians. And also, what we have showed to them is that What we have shown to them is that in here I'm showing you a graph that represents how much we are stretching the fiber in microns and what is the pressure that it's been applied. So it means that if the clinician applies a lot of stretch into a specific muscle, the membrane will behave different. will behave different at the it depends on how it's stretched and also it depends on which is the system if it's an MDX animal or if it's a another type of animal so this is really important because the clinician cannot use the same type of exercise to all of the patients and here I'm showing you our results of the animals that do not have Of the animal that do not have cinnamon and the animal that do not have desmine. And in here, we can see that the pressure that is being applied to this system is less compared to the whale type. So it means that the membrane is already altered, as it happens in the desmin animal. There are different diseases that, as for example, desminopathy, synaminopathy, and the muscle. And the muscular dystrophy of Dushen, which is the worst of all of these three. So these do not resemble too much damage compared to the ones that do not have this truth. You can see at the bottom panel that the rupture of the membrane occurs in the Desmond animal at higher pressures. At higher pressures compared to the cinnamon. Then, once we knew this, we wanted to know more about the MDX animals and the MDX conditions. So here I'm showing you some fibers extracted, of course, from the animal, and these ones mimic the things that happen also in the human being. Also, in the human being, in which it exists, malformed fibers. What does it mean that instead of being an aligned and a continuous cell, it has some branches and also one of these branches do not reach the tendons. So it means that the force that is generated inside the fiber do not reach anything and the force developed is less compared to the wild type. Less compared to the wild type, and also this happens in human beings. The percentage of altered myufibers is too low, it's about 1%. But in this type of patients or in this type of animals, it's really important this 1% of force that is not well generated. We did the same type of experiments using the elastimeter in order to know which were the conditions in the branch fibers and in the branch. branch fibers and in the normal fibers. But first of all, I have to tell you that these are dissociated fibers. So these do not have the whole extracellular matrix. And in our graphs, first of all, I'm showing you the comparison of pressure between a dissected fiber, manually dissected fiber, and a dissociated fiber. So it means that the mechanical property... So it means that the mechanical properties change if we use a chemical in order to do a dissociation of the fibers or cell culture compared to the traditional method in which we manually isolate the fibers. So the percentage is about half of the produced of the tolerated pressure. So it's this is this result is really important because most of us we use the dissociate We use dissociated fibers or dissociated cells, and there's a problem that it's being present in the membrane, first of all, with the force. And later on, we did the same type of experiments in the MTX conditions, and the force generated in the sorry, the pressure that is tolerated in this type of fibers is about one-third. So. One-third. So, this is really an impact result in order to pay attention when we use dissociated or cultured cells, because mechanically it exists a change into it. So, once we did this with comparing the branch and the normal fibers and also the dissected and the dissociated fibers, then we wanted to know what was we wanted to know what was the stabilization time of the membrane at a constant pressure and it behaves as a viscoelastic system. We use a really simple system, the Vault Maxwell, in order to know which was the viscoelastic parameter and also the stiffness of the system. The system is composed by the customers, the sarcolema and the contracting apparatus. And the contractile apparatus, and it depends on the if the animal does not have dystrophine or cinnamon on this mine, the type of stiffness, the magnitude of the stiffness, and the magnitude of the viscosity that it's achieved. At the end of these experiments, we were able to see how the membrane in the dystrophic animals was damaged compared to the whale type that do not present. Whale type that do not present this type of damage. So it means that the proteins are in the plastic conditions, in a plastic state. Once we have this, we also wanted to know what was the contribution of some of the proteins that conform the costameric complex, especially the dystrophine, desmine, and cinnamon. For this, cinnamon for this we do it um we perform a viscoelastic system in order to know to put different values of the steel of the system and these are represented with the different proteins into us along elastic model that is composed by the biofilaments the costaments and the extracellular matrix so with this we were able to sorry were able to sorry so with this we were able to give a different value of stiffness and this will let us to um in case we do not have the animal that has that do not have any kind of protein with this we can do a prediction of what will happen to the membrane or to the costameric system we also did some measurements of different wild type strains Different wild type strains in order to know if there was a difference between the control strains. The LPP and the 129SV are wild-type strains of the Desmean animal. So in here, we showed that even though the strains are different, the magnitudes of the pressure, of the separation pressure, are the same. There's no difference biomechanically in the wild type animals. As we can see in this graph, we also achieved what was the slope in the same type of graphs, and these ones represent the coefficient of stiffness of the membrane. And in here, we have. And in here, we can see that the stiffer is the wild type, and the less stiff are the desmo or the ones that have dystrophic conditions. With this in mind, we calculate what was the time that the membrane reaches its stability. If we remember the proteins that we studied, that is desmine, cinnamine, and dystrophine. Cinnamine and dystrophine act as an anchor between the cytoskeleton and the membrane. So, in here, we can see that the animal that has all of its proteins achieved its stability in less time compared to the dystrophic conditions. And this was expected, why? Because the anchor do not exist, and the one that has the anchor. the one that has the anchor more damage is the MDX animal that is the worst conditions and here we show a table representing all of this data so up to now what we have is what we have also shown to the clinicians is that is that they cannot um treat the same in the same manner the different patients the ones that have the smooth Patients, the ones that have dysmenopathy or syneminopathy, or the ones that lack dystrophy. Why? Because the membrane of all of these patients behave in a different way. So instead of improving the muscle with the exercise that the clinicians apply to the patients, they are causing adamos. So far we have talked to some, at least with two hospitals that are doing some changes in their therapy. Are doing some changes in their therapy. So, also, after we studied what happened at the cellular level, we also studied what happened in the bone. Why? Because there's a crosstalk between the muscle and the bone. And at least with the animals that do not present the cinema, there's an evident absence of trabecular. Evident absence of trabecular in the bone with this type of animals. So this argument is more evident that with these results, there's a more evident argument to show the clinicians that the exercise that they have to put to the patients do not have to be the same. This was confirmed also by electronic microscope and also with fluorescent microscope with different proteins. And as we want to know what is happening at the biomechanical, in the biomechanical properties in the cellular and also in the tissue, in the organ and also in the animal level, we perform. In the animal level, we performed some torque measurements to know which was the torque that these animals can tolerate. And these are the graphs. This is the type of experiments that we perform. And in here, we can also confirm that the torque that is developed by the animal, by the dystrophic animal, it decreases. We also performed some contractive force measurements in order to corroborate our findings of the differences in the biomechanical properties. In this type of experiments, we apply electrostimulus to the muscle and it develops some force. So we were able So, we were able to compare what is happening in different species. And as we are also interested in knowing what is happening in the whole system, there are also these type of experiments that biomechanically showed that the animal, even though it behaves as a regular animal, it cannot run at the same pace. At the same pace compared to the wild-type animals. So, as a summary, it's really important to know what are the sarcolemal properties in order to know the decrease in force transmission. And of course, the study of the canobiological conditions in different type of situations is really important in order to. Really important in order to do a translation from science to the clinical aspect so the patients can be treated in a correct way. So thank you so much for your attention. And if you have any doubt, I'll be happy to answer you. Thanks.
