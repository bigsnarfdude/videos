Yeah, Carlos, please. So, first of all, let me thank the organizer for inviting me. It's a great pleasure to give a talk in this workshop. So, today we'll be talking about the singularity formation in the three-dimensional Gins-Perlando models of superconductivity, or more precisely, about the onset of vortex lines in this model. So this is joint work with Etienne Sandira and Silvia Selfati. Etienne Sandira and Silvia Selfati. So, let me briefly introduce what superconductivity is. So, this is a phenomenon that was discovered in 1911 by ONS. And superconductors are certain type of metals and alloys, which, when you cool them down, typically to a very low temperature, they lose their resistivity, which allows currents to circulate without dissipation. And one of the most striking features of this is the In pictures of it is the so-called Meissner effect, which here we have in a picture a magnet above a superconductor. The magnet produces an applied field, a magnetic field, and the superconductor expel it. And by doing so, it levitates about the magnet levitates about the superconductors. And this occurs when the intensity of the play field is not so large. And actually, And actually, the expulsion is you have a full expulsion if the intensity of the applied field is not so large. But if you start increasing the intensity of the applied field, there is a certain point when you reach what is so-called the first critical field. And the applied field, at that point, is going to start to penetrate the material and is going to do so via what are so the so-called The so-called vortices, which are similar to those in fluid mechanics, but they are quantized. And so these vortices correspond to normal phase regions. So in each of these vortices, the material behaves like a normal conductor. And these coexists, these two phases, the phase of the superconducting phase and the normal phase, coexist until you reach. Until you reach what is so-called the second critical field, when you lose completely the superconductivity in the bulk of the sample. So, there are two facts which are very important about vortices. The first one is that the higher the strength of the applied field, the more vortices there are. And the second one is that they repel each other while the external magnetic field confines them inside the sum. So, in the 1950s, Ginsburg. This Ginsburg proposes a model to describe this in a phenomenological way. So, this is the Ginsburg-Landau energy, which is very famous in physics and several Nobel Prizes were awarded for it. So, omega is going to represent the material, the superconducting material here, which is a bounded and simply connected domain in R3. U is U is the order parameter, so it's a function from omega to the complex plane, and which is important here is the modulus of U squared, which represents the density of superconducting Cooper pairs, which are responsible for superconductivity. So when the modulus of U is equal to one or close to one, you see then the superconducting phase, and where the modulus of U is close to zero, you see the normal phase. So A is a vector potential, W A is this. WA is this operator defined over there, and the Q represents the induced magnetic field in the sample. And Hx is going to represent the applied magnetic field. And we will assume that this applied magnetic field has this form. So it's a fixed vector field times which is normalized so that you have in HX the HX little F H X is going to represent the Little f hx is going to represent the intensity of the blight field. Epsilon here is the inverse of the Inspirono parameter, which is a material constant. And in this talk, it's going to be very, very small, which corresponds to the case of string type 2 superconductors. So the vortices are the main object of study in this model. And when epsilon goes to zero, they become codimension two singularities. So in 2D, you get points. So in 2D you get points, which cause at least an energy of which is as follows. So it's phi times d times log epsilon. D is going to be the degree of each of these vortices. And to just give you an idea, so u around the around a vortex, u is going to look like rho exponential like phi. So rho is going to be a function that is zero where the vortex is located. And at distance epsilon, which is typically the core size. Which is typically the core size, is going to go to one. So the value of the function is going to be one. And then if you compute this integral at a distance r times epsilon from the center of the vortex, then you get an integer. So this is a winding number of the function phi, and that's why we say that these vortices are quantized. The situation is much different in 3D because Much different in 3D because in 3D you get curves with a very non-regularity and they have to be understood in the framework, the framework of currents and using your geometric measure theory. So the cost is almost as in 2D, but you have to also add, multiply by the length of the curve. So something which I would like to remark here is that as soon as you reach the first cryptical field, which is of order log x. Which is of order log epsilon, the number of vortices is appropriately unbounded. So the analysis very close to this first critical field is very kind of difficult to be done. So these are the Jensfor-Landau equations, the Euler-Lagrange equations associated to the functional that I just showed you in two slides ago. And let me tell you that something which is very Tell you that something which is very important here is that all the physical quantities are gauge invariant. So if you make these transformations, which are called gauge transformations, so all the physically meaningful quantities are gauge invariants, such as the models of G square, the induced magnetic field, the energy itself, the free energy, which is defined as the Instrumentau energy, but without external magnetic field, and also the supercurrent. And also the supercurrent and the vorticity, which are quantities that are going to be very important. And when you take A to be zero here, the vorticity is just twice the Jacobian determinant of U. So it's not such a funny object. So here you have a picture of a vortex and actually what allows you to work with this model is the fact that as epsilon goes to zero, you get a vorticity concentration. You get vorticity concentration. So you have to imagine a vortex in 3D like a sort of tube. So in the middle of the tube, in the center, the modulus of U is zero. When you go at distance epsilon or constant epsilon, then the modulus of U is going to be close to one. The vorticity is concentrated in the center of the vortex. Around the vortex, you have superconducting currents. Superconducting currents circulating, and the fact that the vorticity is quantized is reflected in this computation. So, if you compute over this ball, the integral over this ball of mu of the vorticity, you get two pi times the degree of the map u over models of u. Okay, so mathematicians coming from non-linear analysis, Non-linear analysis got interested in the model in the 90s after the pioneering work of Petuel, Brasis, and Elani in 94. And they started analyzing the case without magnetic field because the full model is quite difficult to analyze. And this is a very complex value version of the Allington equation for model for phase transition. So this is the energy. So, this is the energy that they analyze in this work. And a crucial difference with the full model is that you don't observe in this simplified model all the phenomena that you can observe in superconductors. And one of the crucial observations here is that in the full model, you have to handle, to be able to handle with your tools in the analysis, an abundant number of vertices, which is not. Number of portices, which is not the case in this model. So, what has been proven to be very successful to analyze the full model, at least in 2D, is what is so-called a vortex approximation construction. So, as I told you before, what allows you to work with the model is that this is the fact that as epsilon goes to zero, the vorticity concentrates. So, you replace the vorticity. So, you replace the vorticity by a simpler object, which is just a sum of the deltas in the 2D case. This is sort of so-called a Jacobian or vorticity estimate. And coupled to that, you get a concentration of the energy. So, you can prove that the energy costs you at least pi times sum of the The degree of each of the vortices times log epsilon, which recovers the first estimate that I show you about the cost of each of these vortices. And you have an error which is due to the possible interaction between them. So this is called the bulk construction method. And this method only works in 2D. And using these two tools, so the first one was developed independently by Sandir and Jeff. Developed independently by Sandir and Gerard, and the second was popularized after Gerard's Honor in this work in 2002. Sandir and Serfati proved in a series of papers, they give a characterization of the behavior of global minimizers of the energy depending on the intensity of the applied field. So, what do you have in 2D? The situation is the following. So, you have a very precise estimate for the first critical field. So, the first critical field is just a So the first critical field is just a constant which depends on omega times log epsilon. And the error that you make is just a little of one as epsilon goes to zero. So it's a very precise estimate. You can prove that if the intensity of the applied field is below the first critical field, then there are no vortices and you have this Eisner effect that I told you in the first flight. As soon as you reach the first critical field, then the first vortex is going to appear in the First vortex is going to appear in this superconductor with degree plus one. And then, as you start increase and you start making increments of the type C times log log epsilon, then you are going to get two vortices, then three vortices, four vortices, and so on. So, if you go to the regime where the intensity of the applied field minus the first critical field is much, much larger than log-lock. Is much, much larger than log log epsilon, which is the increment that is written over here, then the number of vortices actually becomes unbounded. I told you before that a priori, as soon as you reach the first equivalent field, a priori, the number of vortices is unbounded. That's not the case, but you have to really make a delicate analysis around the first critical field to see that. But if you go beyond that, what you see is that the vortices are going to start. Are going to start arranging themselves in triangular or abricos of lattices. So you have this picture over here where you have two effects. One is the repulsion between the vortices and the other one is the confinement due to the external magnetic field. And the way they arrange themselves is depicted here in this figure. So what about 3D? So the problem is 3D is The problem in 3D is much harder due to the geometry since you have lines instead of just points. So, regarding the 3D problem, the first one to attack this problem was Rivier, and he did it in the case without magnetic field. So, basically, in that setting, you have to impose a boundary condition in order to induce vorticity. And he proved that. He proved that as epsilon goes to zero, you get minimizers of the energy under this boundary condition, are going to be the vorticity of the minimizer are going to converge to just a sum of straight lines, which is just, or more precisely, to a minimal connection, which is a concept which was introduced by Resisko and Liev. And results of the same type were proved in higher dimension, actually, also by Lynn Rivière and Berto-Besère. And virtual resistance on Orlandi. After that, in 2005, Alberti Valdo Norlandi provided a polyhedral approximation of the vorticity in 3D and higher, which is based on this famous theorem, the Federer-Fleming polyhedral deformation theorem. But it cannot be made epsilon quantitative in the sense that in order to use this estimate, you have to pass to the limit, you have to re-normalize the energy. You have to renormalize the energy and pass to the limit. You don't have an estimate like the one that I showed you before here that is valid at the epsilon level. You have to divide this by log epsilon and pass to the limit in order to have an estimate. And that is going to be important later on. So after that, Alama Rosara Montero provided a candidate for the first critical field in 3D in the case of the ball. And later on, Bal. And later on, Baldo Gerard, Orlandi, and Sonner, in a series of two papers, they used basically, they extended this work by Alberti, Baldo and Orlandi, and provided by a gamma convergence argument, the symptotic behavioral minimizers of the full three-dimensional Landau model. And by doing so, they obtained the leading order of the first 3D. The leading order of the first critical field in 3D for a general domain. And recently, during my PhD thesis, which I did under the supervision of Fetina and Silvia, I developed the first three-dimensional vortex approximation, which is epsilon quantitative. So, which is basically the analog of the result that you have over here, of the board construction method that only works in 2D. Method that only works in 2D. The Jacobian estimate you can make it work also in higher dimension, but this was only working in 2D. So I did a new construction which provided analogous of this result. And for the first time, it's valid in the three-dimensional setting. So let me, without going through all the technical details about this statement, but let me give you an idea what But let me give you an idea what you do. So, what you can prove is that the vorticity of a configuration UA, such that it satisfies a suitable upper bound, which allows for an abundant number of vertices anyway, is well approximated basically by the sum of lines. Okay, so instead of summing direct masses, you have a sum of lines in the sense of currents, but more important. Sense of currents. But more importantly, I have the analog of this ball construction. So you get an estimate for the energy, which reflects, is of the same type that you get in 2D. So you have here the full mass of mu epsilon. So you basically get pi times the multiplicity of the lines times the length of each of these lines. You sum over them times log epsilon. And you have, once again, an. And you have once again an error which is log-lock, which is due to the possible interaction between the lines. So, in order to provide an estimate for the first critical field, let me briefly describe what happens in 2D. So, you have, in order to provide this estimate, what you can do is to first find an approximation of the minor solution. This is the solution that you expect to have below the first critical. That you expect to have below the first critical field, the minimizer of the energy. For that, you just minimize the energy with U replaced by one. So you replace just U by one and minimize the energy in terms of A, and you are going to get an A0. So this is a special pair that you get. A0 is just the Navala perp of G0 and G0 is a function that satisfies this problem over here, this elliptical problem. Problem. By doing so, you can now split the energy. So, if you have now a configuration UA, the A part you split it like this. So, you use this special pay that comes from the minor solution plus A prime. And the energy of this pair, UA, is going to decouple in the following way. So, you will have this energy of this special pair of the Meister approximation. Approximation, then you have the free energy of u and a prime. So here you don't have anymore the external magnetic field, so you lose it here. So it's just a term that involves u and a prime. And then you have the vorticity acting on G naught, so this special function that appears, which is related to the minimizer of the energy. And that adds to a very small error. So now you can combine. So now you can combine the ball construction, the vorticity estimate with this energy splitting in order to derive that vortices are going to be favorable, energetically favorable, as soon as the intensity of the applied field is exactly like this. It's lambda omega times log epsilon, where lambda omega is one over two max over omega of g0. So, what happens if you go beyond the first critical field? Then, let me by simplicity assume that G0 has just a unique maximum point, P, and whose Hessian matrix, which I denote by minus P, is non-degenerate. So, what is going to happen is that you will have a sequence of values of this form, and as when the intensity of the applied field is going to be between Hn and Field is going to be between Hn and Hn plus 1, then you will have exactly n vortices of degree plus 1 at points A I epsilon, which are going to converge to P. But more importantly, if you scale the points by basically the square root of H exile, HX, they are going to converge to a minimizer of this renormalized energy. So in this renormalized energy, you have a Coulomb-type interaction. You have a Coulomb-type interaction and a potential term. So here you have the effect of the repulsion between the vortices because all they have degree plus one, so they repel each other, while here you have the confinement effect of this magnetic potential. Okay, so in order to get the analog in 3D of what I just described in the 2D two-dimensional case, well, you can Case? Well, you can sort of follow the same plan. So you first approximate the Meissner solution. So you instead of minimizing the energy with U equals one, you minimize among all configurations with modulus of U equals one. And then you are going to get a pair which is U0, A0. In particular, the models of U0 is equal to 1, obviously, and the vorticity associated with this guy is 0, just as in the case of. Is zero, just as in the case of in the 2D situation. So once again, you can split the energy and it's going to decouple in the same way as before. So you get the energy of this approximation of the Meissner solution, then you get the free energy of U prime A prime. Here, the only difference is that you have to split as well the U, not only A. So you split like this. So you rewrite U0 times U prime. So you get. times u prime so you get you get the the the the free energy of this guy minus the vorticity acting on a special vector field b naught which is the divergence free part of the host decomposition of a naught in omega and it's a it's a vector field which is in c01 sub t and sub t means that is normal on the boundary so the tangential part of v0 is zero on the on the boundary Euro is zero on the boundary. This is very important because this is exactly the space where the vorticity estimate holds. So it's very important since I want to use these epsilon level tools here. So the free energy bound, lower bound, and the abortivity estimate, it's very important that B0 lives in that space. So you do exactly the same as before, and what you get is the estimate, at least the main order. Estimate at least the main order of the first critical field, which is going to be a constant which depends on omega and the external field times log epsilon. But now the constant is much more complicated than before. It's one over two R0, where R naught is the supremum among lines of a ratio. So in this ratio, you have first the integral of B naught along gamma divided by the length of gamma. You have to take the supreme. You have to take the supremum of that quantity and you get the constant that the right constant for the first critical field. So, in particular, you have to understand, as I told you before, in the two-dimensional case, you have to understand how this function G naught behaves, what the maximum point for G0. Here, you will have to understand how this optimality problem among lines. Among lines, which is much more complicated than the one that I showed you before. So, Bazo Gerard, Orlandi, and Sonner, in their work, via this gamma convergence argument, what they managed to show is the following. So it's a sort of a weak characterization of the first critical field that at least gives you the, that actually gives you the main order of the first critical field, but up to an error which is. But up to an error which is little of log epsilon. So basically, what they show is that you have a sequence of minimizers of the info-Landau energy and you take the vorticity and you normalize by log epsilon, then as epsilon goes to zero, you get zero if hx divided by log epsilon is strictly less than this constant that I showed you before, or you get a non-zero limit if this ratio is largerly. Ratio is larger than this constant. So, this gives you a weak characterization of the first critical field. And then, and that's because they have to pass to the limit. They have to pass to the limit in their methods. But if you don't pass to the limit, you can get a stronger characterization. So, what you can prove is the following: so, you have a bounce from above and below for the first critical field. From above, you get the main order plus. From above, you get the main order plus just a constant, and from below, you have a constant times log-log of epsilon. This error over here is due to the log-log epsilon term in the lower bound that I show you in the 3D epsilon level estimates, that you can actually remove after on. But that's the first estimate you can prove, which is already a bit better than this one over here. But more importantly, you can prove that if you are below this value, But if you are below this value, then the global minimizer of the energy is the modulus of u epsilon is going to converge to one as epsilon goes to zero. So it tells you that you don't have fortices. But if you are above this value over here, then upseron is going indeed to have fortices. The u of siren is going to vanish in the sample. So after that, if you want to go beyond that and try to understand the interaction between these vortices and the onset of vortex lines in this model, then you have to understand this ratio problem that I told you before. So for that, you have to introduce a non-degeneracy condition. And in the two-dimensional case, you have a maximizer of G-naught, and then you say, okay, I have a non-degenerate maximizer. non-degenerate maximizer and then I prove something that regarded to I mean I proved that the vortices are going to converge properly escape to a renormalized energy here is going to be the same but of course the the non-derived condition is much more difficult than the previous one than you're just maximizing a function so the the condition is the following so you are going to assume that there is a special line for which you uh that this ratio which is maybe i can Which is maybe I can show you to you before once again. So, this ratio over here that achieves the ratio, okay? That achieves the supremum. And so you have that is the first condition. And the second one is that it's non-degenerate in this sense. So if you take the ratio of gamma naught minus the ratio of gamma, the ratio is just this quantity that we are optimizing, then this is going to be larger. Then this is going to be larger or equal than a certain constant times the minimum between basically the distance between gamma and gamma naught in a suitable weak norm to the power n. Okay, and this the first result that we have with Tien and Sylvia is that this special condition holds in the case of the ball, which is the only case where you can actually compute p-naught explicitly, or at least in which there is an explicit computation. There is an explicit computation for it. So, in the case of the ball, and when H0X, the applied field is just zeta hat, then you can explicitly compute B naught. And then the gamma naught is just going to be the vertical diameter. Seen as a one current with multiplicity one and oriented and having the same orientation as single hat. And in this case, the n over here is equal to two. So the non-degeneracy condition. Two. So the non-degeneracy condition holds as well, and with n equals two. So this problem of this ratio problem that I told you before, we like to call it the isoflux problem because of the following reasons. So here we are in the case of the ball, gamma naught is the maximizer for this the malady problem. And since B naught is Since B naught is normal on the boundary, so it doesn't have a tangent component there, then you can close gamma naught using this line over here. And then you can write this integral as the flux of K L of B naught in this surface. So you have the flux over this surface, and you can do the same for any curve or any competitor. Any competitor, and then the problem reduces to sort of maximizing the flux divided by length. So that's why we call it the isoflux probe. So, well, using this non-degeneracy condition, what we can prove is the following: that when you go to a little above the first critical field, so you have the main order. Field so that you have the main order plus a constant times log log epsilon. Just in 2D, you have that the global minimizer is going to have a bounded portico. So, even though a priori the number of cortices is unbounded, it's not the case. If you are slightly above the first critical field, then the number of vertices of the minimizer is going to be bounded. And actually, you can prove a much stronger result in the sense that we will have. In the sense that we will have a renormalized energy for the curves. So, using this result, what we can prove immediately is that the first critical, a better estimate for the first critical field. So, we can renew this. Let me show you the previous slide over here. Where was it? Yes, here. So, in the lower bound, we had an error which was log-log error in this estimate for the first critical field. Estimate for the first critical field that we can now remove with this knowing that the vorticity is bounded. Because once you know that the vorticity is bounded, then the lower bound that you can produce has an error which is much smaller, it's just a constant. And actually, if you work a little harder, we hope to get a little of one as an error, exactly as in the 2D case. But more importantly, we get a random. importantly we get a renormalized energy for the for the limiting curves so that is going to reflect and and so you have a competition between several terms so you have in the one in one part you have the length of the curves you have the repulsion of the vortices these vortex lines and you have a magnetic confinement so there are related results in the case without magnetic field which were proved by the pin and kovalchik and very recently by contraras and girard By Contreras and Gerard, which are this is a very nice paper, where they have these two effects. So, the length of the curves and also the repulsion between the vertices. So, this is completely new, and this is due to the fact that in the full model, you have this magnetic confinement due to the external field. So, basically, this is the picture that we get. So, in the case of the ball, this is gamma naught. The vortices are going to start appearing. Vortices are going to start appearing very close to the optimum for this ratio problem, so for gamma naughts. So they are depicted here. And the typical distance from the axis is of the order of one over square root of log epsilon, just as in the 2D case. So they are going to start appearing here. First, you have one, then you have two lines, then three, then four, and so on. And so basically, this is the statement. This is the statement of this result, the analog of the 2D result that I showed you before. So, in the case of at least in the case of the ball, we can actually prove it in a general domain under some conditions about the geometry of the domain. And the statement is the following. So, basically, the vorticity of a minimizer when you are slightly above the first critical field is going to be very Going to be very well approximated by a sum of certain lines which are very close. They look like gamma naughts. They basically look like gamma naught. And if you make a horizontal blow-up by this scale, c times square root of log epsilon, then these scaled lines are going to converge uniformly to H1 graphs. These H1 graphs you can write like this. You can write like this, and the ui's over here, which are the deviations from the axis from the gamma naught, are going to minimize this 3D interaction energy. So in these two papers that I told you about before, the paper by Italpino and Kovalci can also contrast the art, they have basically this term over here: so the logarithmic report between the vertices and the length. And the length of the curves. These are the two terms that are there. And then you have other terms basically due. So, this one over here is due to the magnetic confinement, so the external field, which is accounted by this B naught over there. And there is another term over here, which is due to the geometry close to the endpoints of gamma naught. So, here you have the second fundamental form of Of the boundary on the endpoints of this special curve gamut. So basically, the picture, and this is the last slide, so basically the picture that we have both in 2D and 3D by now is the following. So below the first critical field, you have what is so called the Meissner solution. You have no vortices. Then, as you reach the first critical field, you will have only. First critical field, you will have only one solution, one vortex solution, then you will have two vortices solution, then three vortices solution, four vortices solution, and they and basically they are going to meet the vortices are going to minimize this renormalized energy that is written here. So I think that's all. So I will stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Carlos, for the interest. You, Carlos, for the interesting talk. Are there any questions, remarks? Hello? Hi, Maniel. Yeah. Hi, can you hear me? Sorry, I don't have Carlos. No, very nice talk, very interesting. You mentioned that you needed some special geometric conditions in the domain for the general case. What type of conditions were those? What type of conditions were those? Well, it's not much. I mean, at least in the case, it's more related to provide this an optimizer for this object over here. Because this object over here is kind of very complicated to be analyzed. So the only case where we have precise conditions is the case of the ball, but we can write this. But we can write these conditions in a general domain, but only can prove that it holds in, for instance, in a convex domain and so on. But those conditions are non-local or are of the non-local type? Yes, yes, okay, okay. They are local. Yes, exactly. But it is a non-degeneracy, some type of non-degeneracy on this. Exactly. Yes, it's a type of non-degeneracy for this kind of object. For this kind of object, when you have a maximizer for this kind of object and you have a non-degeneracy for that, which is much more precise than this one over here. I see. Maybe I missed something, but the law of interaction between these lines is I mean, cannot really be described by by an ODE, right? It's something more complicated. So you have interactions. Yeah. I don't think so. Yeah. Okay, so we got classes. Yes, yes, I think it's much more complicated than that. I mean, you have this interaction over here, and at least, I mean, so far we haven't seen how to deal with this. I mean, how to disturb interaction. In the other case, you have ODs, right? When you have just these two terms. Yeah, that's right. So does V of gamma i play the role of the differential operators or something? Yeah. Yeah. They correspond to layers, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, so yeah, so it makes sense. Yeah, so it could be related. Yeah, I see. And concerning critical points that are not minimizers, any results or any idea? For instance, I mean, for this result, we don't have to actually assume that you have a minimizer. You just have to assume an upper bound for the energy. The energy, and so this is going to apply for any critical field which satisfies this upper bound. And but then, I mean, from the we are interested in the physical interpretation of the model, so we are just looking for minimizers up to the moment. Yeah, I see, but also local minimizers, right? Right, local minimizers, yes, because actually in this picture you see that the solution, for instance, here, what I what they actually prove in one paper is that the Actually, prove in one paper is that the here you have a global solution is a global minimizer, but then it remains a local minimizer. Oh, I see. The other guys remain local minimizers. Yes, so I prove it for this branch, but not for the other ones. The other ones, I think, are kind of very minimized, something like the, I don't know, envolving, they have this thing. Have you seen the envelope, yes? The envelope, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay, uh, any more questions? All right, okay, so if no, let's uh thank Carlos and all the speakers in this morning for the nice and interesting talk, and we'll. Talks and we'll continue our
