Hi, thanks. I feel like I've done more than my fair share of talking this meeting. Let's see. So I'm going to talk about how do you figure out if a barbell is non-trivial. So this I'll pick up from the previous presentation, but I'll try not to demand that you remember everything I said. Everything I said. So I'll backtrack a little bit. So we'll go back to Dane. So diff m that denotes the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold that restricted the identity on the boundary, if there is any. And I want to talk about Dane twists. So consider the bundle projection map from S1 cross D1 down to D1 by forgetting the S1 factor. The subgroup of fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms of S1 cross D1. It has a homomorphism. Cross D1. It has the homotopy type of the loop space of dif of S1. So you might want to, you could save this as five of preserving, put a pi upstairs. So it has a homotopy type of loop S1, which is integers. I guess to complete some commutative diagrams, in dimension one, pseudoisotopy implies isotopy, so you could erase that upper pi and it. For pi, and you would also have a homotopy equivalence. So a diffeomorphism of S1 cross D1, that's the identity on the boundary, is a type of pseudo-isentopy. Yeah, anyhow, so these diffeomorphisms, I call them model Dane twists, and that's sort of one picture right there. And so Dane's strategy for studying diffeomorphism groups of two manifolds is you embed your model Dane twists. is you embed your model Dane twist in your two manifold, and then you embed your annulus in a two manifold and you extend the model Dane twist by taking the identity and that's a Dane twist in the surface, so it's an element of the orientation preserving diffeomorphism group of the surface. And one of the theorems that Dane proved is that this group is finitely generated by such Dane twists. And so that's the generator. So that's the generators, and to distinguish, you know, to say this diffeomorphism is different than that diffeomorphism, he looked at the action of the mapping class group on the fundamental group of the surface, and that's how he distinguished. So I want to sort of describe an analogy to this process. So we'll have generators analogous to dane twists, and we'll have to do, you know, we'll have to have them act on something. Unfortunately, we don't have something quite as pleasant. Unfortunately, we don't have something quite as pleasant as the fundamental group of the surface. So our Dane twist is going to be a family of maps. So maps from an iterated loop space on the sphere to a thing that we call a barbell manifold. This barbell manifold is the boundary connect sum of two trivial disk bundles. So one over an I-sphere, one over a J-sphere. You could also view this as the trivial component. Sorry, the The exterior of a trivial two-component string link in Euclidean space. I guess the complement of an n minus i minus 1 and a n minus j minus 1 dimensional string link. So it's like a mixed dimensional string link. And so where Dane used the fundamental group as the method to, you know, the technique, the object that distinguished these mapping classes. Distinguish these mapping classes. We're going to use something that I, so we're going to use a variation on an idea of serifs. So, serf had a homotopy equivalence between diff of an n-dimensional disk and the loop space on embeddings of a codimension one disk. So, we're going to use that idea, but we won't use codimension one objects. We'll use higher codimension objects. So, let me tell you about SERF's scanning map, because I don't think it's as well known as it should be. So, I'll just say. As it should be. So I'll just sort of walk you through roughly the proof of Serf's homotopy equivalence. So I claim that there's a homotopy equivalence of this form, and I want to give you a picture for what that map is. So there's this... Is there any dimensions here? Yeah, it works in any dimension. Yeah, it's kind of beautiful. So these are embeddings of the codimension one disk that are a standard inclusion on the boundary. And so the idea is you So you take you take an end disk and you think of this codimension one subdisc. And you ask, how does the diffeomorphism move this codimension one subdisk? So that gives you an embedding of the subdisk in the ambient disk. Disk. So the fiber of this map is literally the diffeomorphisms of the end disk that are the identity on the boundary and the identity on this sub disk. So it's diffeomorphisms of this upper half disk and this disjoint lower half disk. So it's essentially, you know, up to a straightening of the corners argument, it's two copies of diff dn. Then there's this other interesting feature that when you take a diffhimoline That when you take a diffimorphism of the n disk and you restrict it to this n minus 1 disk, well, what you can do is you can, the whole diff of dn, it has the same homotopy type as diff of a smaller sub-disc. You can just sort of shrink the support of the diffeomorphism and you can move the disk wherever you want. Unfortunately, you can't shrink it to nothing. That would be the Alexander trick. You can shrink it a bit. And so I could shrink the And so I could shrink the support of the diffeomorphisms to be either above or below, and then they're not moving this disk at all. And so that map from the total space of the fibromyalgia to the base space, you don't see this very often, but it's null homotopic. How did Zerf know that dn minus 1 split dn into a giving off? Yeah, yeah, right, yeah. Oh, right, right, there's no exotic disks or anything coming up here, yeah. Yeah, so the fiber bundle, it's null homotopic. So you've got this interesting feature where you've got there's the fiber inclusion, two copies of diff dn into diff dn. Well, so you can Well, so you can look at that inclusion, and so what you can do is, well, for that map, I can do a homotopy of that map where I shrink the upper disk and the lower disk to be two small disks, and then I push them to overlap, and when I do that, I do group multiplication. So, this fiber inclusion is homotopic to the group multiplication map. So, the fiber of this map is The fiber of this map has the homotopy type of dif dn. So, if you put those two things together, that null homotopy and this homotopy, the fiber of this map, it has a homotopy type of loops of the embeddings of the base space and also of div dn. And if you play around with SARE sort of models for homotopy fibers, like the kind of thing you see in the The kind of thing you see in the construction of serious spectral sequences and all that stuff, like Posnikov systems, that kind of stuff you see in grad courses, you get a map from DiffDN to the embedding space, loops of the embedding space, and the map is literally this. You have an interval sitting below the disk, you've got orthogonal projection out of the interval, and you just look at the fibers in that disk. Fibers in that disk, and for that one-parameter family of fibers, you ask what does the diffeomorphism do to it? And so you get this one-parameter family of embeddings of this codimension one disk. And you have to, I mean, you have to play around with the models a little bit. And if you're very careful, you can see that what you're doing is you're translating them all to the origins of the proper embeddings of codimension one disks. But the map is just literally scan over, and you get all these. Scan over, and you get all these embeddings. So now, what we're going to do is sort of an analogous construction for the scanning is like in your ball that you do either it's left or right or it's top to bottom? You can do it any way you want. And they're all homotopic. I guess, yeah, they're all homotopic. But in this picture, it's. Yeah, in this picture, we. Yeah, in this picture it would be like this. Yeah. Yeah, so what I want to do is set up an analogous scanning operation that we're going to use for barbell diffimorphisms. But to get a sense for what kind of scanning you might want to try, well, just basically the scanning we choose is just the scanning that we can find an interpretation. Can find an interpretation for. We're restricted to what we can find an interpretation for. And so what we do is we think of this barbell manifold as fibring over a disk. So some terminology. So in this boundary connect sum, the disk that separates the sum ends, we call it the mid-ball, and the disks that are complementary to the The disks that are complementary to the spherical sum ends, right? The fibers of these disk bundles, we call them co-chores. So there's a red and a purple co-chore in that picture. And yeah, so here's the idea. So if you say i is less than or equal to j, well, one of them has to be less than or equal to the other. So let's say it's i. So this barbell manifold, it will sort of fibers over an n minus j minus 1 disc. J minus one disc. And so here's a 113 barbell. And so the idea is: well, there's the 112 barbell, which is a twice punctured disc across the interval. These are almost diffeomorphic up to rounding the corners. So literally, there's a projection map from the IJN barbell down to this disc. The fibers all have the homotopy type of S1 wedge, sorry, SI wedge SJ. And in the interior of the base disk, that dn minus j minus 1, they're diffeomorphic to the ij, j plus 1 barbell. So that's the interpretation, sort of fibering that we have. So we look at the fiber-preserving subgroup of diffeomorphisms. So, diffeomorphisms of the barbell manifold that give you little commutative diagrams with that fiber projection map. Again, in the literature. Again, in literature in the 70s, these would be called the horizontal diffimorphisms. So we say upper pi, just like what we did with Dane twists. And so that fiber-preserving barbell diffeomorphism group, it's a iterated loop space on the diffeomorphisms of the fiber. And so, what we want to do is get a little bit of a description of that, if you want. A little bit of a description of that diffeomorphism group of the fiber. So, my claim is that it has the homotopy type of diff of a sphere cross-disk, cross a loop space of embeddings of a disk into the same sphere cross-disk. And the idea is the diffeomorphism group of sphere cross-disk, you restrict those diffeomorphisms to you've got this. You've got to just take a ball in that sphere across disk. You can restrict those diffeomorphisms to that ball. That gives you an embedding of ball in sphere across disk. The same kind of argument as before, this map is a locally trivial fiber model, but it's also null homotopic because these diffeomorphisms, you can shrink their support to be disjoint from the ball. And the fiber is this barbell manifold, which is a once-unctured copy. Which is a once-unctured copy of that. So, since this is null, you've got a map from the loop space of this embedding space into there. You can sort of pull the vibration back. So, you have loop of embeddings to here, to there. And all the homotopy groups of this loop of this embedding space inject into that diffeomorphism group. So, that embedding space, it has. That embedding space has a homotopy type of a sphere across an orthogonal group. Basically, the embeddings, you can just linearize them. You can sort of shrink them down until they're approximately linear and then do a straight line homotopy. And so we put all that together. There's the fiber-preserving diffeomorphism group. It's this iterated loop space on this lower-dimensional barbell manifold. And diff of this lower-dimensional barbell manifold is the product of. The product of a diffimorphism group we don't know much about, and this loop of this embedding space that we're familiar with. So, this fiber-preserving diffimorphism group, it's this iterated loop space on this sphere bundle, and then there's this iterated loop space on the sphere and orthogonal groups. So that's the family that we want, that we call the bar-bell diffeomorphism family. So, the way to think of it is these fibers are punctured. Are punctured disk bundles over spheres. So, how do you get a diffeomorphism of that? If you take a loop of one of those balls in that manifold, it gives you a diffeomorphism of that punctured manifold, which is the fiber. So if you have extra loop parameters, you can use them in the, you can just plot them in that trivial fiber bundle structure. Just like how you can take a loop of diff of S1 and turn it into a diff. diff of S1 and turn it into a diffeomorphism of an annulus. So that's the key idea. So when I plus J is greater than or equal to N, the first non-trivial homotopy group of this iterated loop space is in dimension I plus J minus N, and that's pi I SI, which is the integers. So that we usually just call the Barbell diffeomorphism. And it's a cute fact that this loop iterated It's a cute fact that this loop, iterated loop space, turns out to be a retract of this whole diffeomorphism group. It's an entertaining argument. I won't give you the argument now, but it's a... So this was a factor of the fiber-preserving subgroup, but if you remove the fiber-preserving subgroup, it's still a retractor term. It's curiosity. Sorry, can I just slide out of 10 bits? So you say this gives the barbell thing off. This gives A barbell. A really of a pi zero of diff of B N I J? I mean, I'm just having trouble with the indices. And in terms of homotopy groups of diff of B N ij, what homotopy groups are we talking about? So this, what happened there? So, yeah, in dimension pi, so i plus j minus n, right, so it's, it's, so it's going to be in So it's going to be in dimension I plus J minus N of this diffeomorphism group, though. I plus J minus N of the homotopy group. Yeah, so it's a family. Yeah, yeah, so, right. But I've already used the term diffeomorphism, barbell diffeomorphism families of maybe I should say the first J or two and N is four, then. Exactly. Yeah. All right. Yeah, yeah. So this is in. Yeah, so this is a mapping class. This is an isotopic class of diffeomorphism when I plus J is N. Right, and so I think it's really, you know, so yesterday I gave a different description of this family. Well, actually, I think I just gave a description of this family in the I plus J's end case yesterday. But the it's I think it's really instructive to work through examples. So when n is two and i and j is one, this is this is the diff of a disk fixing two sub discs. That would be called the framed pure braid group on two strands. And this is a diffeomorphism where you the two balls, the two strands go around each other. The two strands go around each other, and you keep the framings of the balls. And when you do that, you're keeping the framings of the balls parallel the whole time. So in the language of dane twists, it would be the composite of three dane twists around curves parallel to the three boundary curves. So the signs are a homology. You get that kind of picture. Kind of picture. So these cohorts, if you look through the middle, it's blue, red, blue, red. It's a pattern we're going to see a lot of. So these barbell manifolds, when I and J are co-dimension 2, what you can do is you just embed the barbell in a manifold so that you have these sort of simple linking of the bar. Of the bar, and then you can have the bar do stuff in the manifold in between. So that gives you a map from the integers to the n minus fourth homotopy group or the diffimorphism group of the manifold. This is the one we'll talk about today. And when i plus j is n, you can do this hop-flinking phenomena, provided you're in dimension 6 or higher. So you take it i minus 1. So you take an I minus 1 sphere, you embed it in the manifold in a tubular neighborhood, you embed the I-sphere so that the bundle projection is the suspension of the HOP vibration. And then you have a complementary J-sphere, so that the I-sphere and the I-men's one sphere in the J-sphere link. So the I-sphere and the J-sphere is the Hoplink, you could call it. And those give And those give, turns out these give the Hatcher-Wagner, like the null pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphisms of a circle across disk in these high dimensions. And in dimension five, you do this, the 2,2,5 barbell. And in dimension five, two-series simple link, they do this like boring linking, like surgery diagrams. Surgery diagrams. And you connect them by a strand that goes around the circle factor as many times as you like. And so the barbell diffimorphism family is a map from the third loop space of S2. And interestingly enough, pi 0 of that is the integers. So this gives you a map from the integers to these diffeomorphism groups. And it turns out this gives you an infinitely generated subgroup of pi 0 dfs1 cross d4. At present, I Press D4. At present, I only have a map out of here to a Maurent polynomial ring with Z2 coefficients. I suspect my invariant is just not strong enough, and you can maybe do it integrally instead of mod2. We're still trying to find a way of doing, getting an integer invariant that detects these diffeomorphisms, but there is that. Yeah, and so the And so in the i plus j's n case, there's this rather beautiful interpretation of the barbell diffeomorphism as a, like as a mapping class of the barbell manifold, where the co-cores, they get re-embedded in this way so that when you slice through the mid-ball, you get a J minus one sphere and an I minus one sphere. Remember that's an N minus one disk, and they're a standard linking pair. They're a standard linking pair. So the image is these sort of linked co-chores, and the pre-image is just a slightly different version of that linking. It's like basically a mirror image. So these diffeomorphisms are very close, but not quite isotopic to their inverses. And I'm not sure I can. I guess this is a phenomenon with Dane twists. Dane twists, their inverses look a lot like themselves. Okay, so this INJ co-dimension 2 case is the one I want to show you the sketch of the argument for. It's one of the more subtle cases. The other cases, in a sense, well, there's some. In a sense, well, there's some easier arguments for them. Yeah, so that map, it's into the fiber-preserving diffeomorphism group. So we could replace that with loops on the lower-dimensional bar belt, loops on diff of the lower-dimensional bar belt. And that is the, so that map is obtained by taking this, remove a loop from both sides. Remove a loop from both sides, and there's a map of this form where you just slide one puncture around the manifold and take the induced diffeomorphism. So, this map, you take the loop space of it and get to that map. So, you can sort of simulate what the, fiber by fiber, what this barbell diffimorphism looks like by just taking the two punctures, sliding one around the other in various different ways, and looking at what happens. And looking at what happens. And so the interesting thing is the co-cores, when you're sliding around sort of in the equatorial picture, the co-cores do exactly what they did in the two-dimensional case, where you have this alternating pattern in that sort of equatorial plane. But then if you have one puncture orbit higher, Monpuncture orbit higher or lower, you start getting the cochorus pushing off that equatorial punk. Yeah, okay, so there's a homomorphism. This is where we start to get insight for like, how are you going to define an invariant? So the n minus fourth homotopy group of this barbell diffeomorphism group is a map to the integers so that the composite of So, that the composite of the barbell diffeomorphism family with this invariant, it's an isomorphism of the integers. And the idea is that mid-ball, you fiber it by parallel intervals, and you take pairs of points on those parallel intervals, they're oriented intervals. So, you take pairs of points, t1 less than t2, on those parallel intervals, and you ask You ask F of T1, is it on this co-core? And F of T2, is it on that co-chore? And depending on which, you've got a lot of options for what direction you choose to fiber this midball in. And depending on what you do, if you fiber it in directions so that you get that are parallel to that equatorial motion, then it turns out. Motion, then you turns out you get exactly three pairs, T1, T2, of this form, and they don't all have the same sign. And you can also vibrate in a way so that you get exactly one. You sort of change the direction so that it's far from being equatorial. So can this be stated in terms of calculating intersections and configurations basically? Exactly, yes, yeah. Yes, yeah. So this is an intersection number on the induced map of a configuration space of two points. Exactly. Yeah, so yeah, it's all the dimensions just work out just perfectly so that this is a genuine transverse intersection and you can compute the signs of the matrix. So now I just want to reinterpret that a little bit. So that fibring of the mid-bulb by parallel intervals. Of the mid-ball by parallel intervals. So it induces this scanning map from diff of the barbell manifold to the n minus second loop space, iterated loop space of embeddings of an interval in that barbell manifold. And so when you take that scanning map, now we apply the n minus fourth homotopy group to both sides. And that gets us to the 2n minus 6th homotopy group of embeddings of an interval. And so this you can compute. So, this you can compute. I haven't computed this homotopy group exactly, but there is a copy of the integers, like a split copy of the integers in it, that's detected by this double-point computation. And so one of the ways you can sort of phrase this is when you take this map, so it'd be pi 2n. Pi 2n minus 6. So that's an n minus 3 disk across an n minus 3 disk in that embedding space. So you can sort of picture that family of embeddings that are induced by the barbell family as so, you know, often when you scan through, the diffeomorphism family does nothing to that embedded interval, but so there's this central region. But so there's this central region where what you've done is you've taken that straight line embedding and you've curled it up. You've done a, I guess, like a full twist on the central strand. And then as you progress in this box, what you're doing is you're grabbing two of the strands on the right, and you're sliding them around that puncture. them around that puncture for this direction. And for that direction, you're grabbing two of the strands on the left and rotating them around that puncture. And then when you get to the ends, so this is where you're done rotating the red around. So you're only rotating the blue around. But if you're only rotating the blue around, you can undo this little hook there, because you don't have any obstruction. Because you don't have any obstruction, you're not going around over there. You can just whip this back to the point where your motion is not doing anything to those two strands anymore. You've got all these canonical null homotopies you can tack on to the ends. And so that's what that Arbell diffeomorphism family is doing to this family of intervals. And this is sort of the direct analogy to what a Dane twist does. A-twist does. Anyhow, so that's the insight for how are we going to define an invariant of barbell diffeomorphism in S1 across the disk. So the idea is, you know, you've got this map from pi n minus 4 of diff of the barbell manifold to pi n minus 4 of the diff of some manifold. So the idea is, provided m has a suitable fiber structure, like say m is a lower dimensional manifold across an interval. Manifold across an interval, you just sort of look at all those embedded intervals and see what happens to them. Provided you can, you're only, you know, this insight, this previous insight, right, has to do with, we know what the barbell diffimorphism is, you run through the bar. This doesn't tell you what happens as you scan over here, but it does tell you what happens when you run through the bar. So, provided you have some structure like that where Some structure like that where you're only scanning through the embedded bar, you can determine what embedded intervals you get. So, in the case of the n minus fourth homotopy group of diff of S1 cross a disk, we're going to use point cross disk, and we're going to scan through that. So there'll be, so think of that as a n minus 2 parameter family of embedded intervals. So, n minus 4 plus n minus 2 is 2n minus 6. 2n minus 6. So we get a 2n minus 6 parameter family of embedded intervals, and that is our variation of serf scanning construction that we're going to use. So we have to know, we have to figure out what the 2n minus 6 homotopy group of the vectors of an interval in a circle across disk is. I don't know what it is exactly, but I know how to extract invariance from it. And I want to tell you a little bit about there are tools for this. There are tools for this. So, embedding spaces, provided the co-dimension of the domain manifold versus the target manifold, provided that's three or larger, which is our situation, there's a nice tool. So it was originally developed by Serif, Patrick Quinn, Hafliger, Dax, and then sort of significantly later, Tom Goodwilly, and then Weiss. And then Weiss and Klein extended these tools to what's called the embedding calculus. So I just want to, I'm just going to, yeah. I'm slightly losing track now. A minute ago you told us this map to Z out of something that looked similar to this. Yeah, so that... Forgetting the difference. So we were in a situation where we had the barbell manifold and we were taking the mid-ball and we were scanning through it. And we are scanning through it by intervals. So if this is a B I J N, that's a D n minus 1. So we're getting a map from diff of this barbell manifold to the n minus second loop space of embeddings of an interval into the barbell manifold. By scanning through. Okay, and now all the code in the And now all uncoded in the citamet is replaced by. Exactly. So now we've replaced the barbell by a circle cross disc, and we are scanning, we're only scanning through one of the disc fibers. This one is harder to compute. This one, yeah, it's so the invariant we needed here, it's actually, I think the invariant, the integer invariant we need. I think the invariant, the integer invariant we got here was really just, so it was a double-point computation. But I think because we're asking about intersections with the co-chor here and the intersections of the co-chor there, I think actually it's even extractable. At this level, it's even extractable from the space of immersions that invariant, I believe. So it's like the first stage of the Taylor Tower or a type 0 Bacilli of invariant at the level. Zero Basilia vinbury at the level of the barbell memory. And we have to go to the third stage of the Taylor Tower or Type II Basilia Vinbury for this. Yeah, so it's two stages more complicated. It's a little unfortunate that, you know, It's a little unfortunate that this embedding calculus, in principle, a fantastic tool in the sense that you know that it contains all the information of the embedding spaces that it applies to, but there's very little in the way of actual computation using this tool. Usually, the tool is applied more passively for, like, I don't know, maybe like a historical argument, like Serk. Like a historical argument, like the SARE spectral sequence, it was used primarily for SAR C-theory. The modern version is localization, I guess. But it was used for closure arguments, like if I take a fiber bundle with the base and the fiber in this class of space, the total space is also in that class of space. The homotopy groups are finally generated or something like that, right? The more often than not, More often than not, embedding calculus is used for that kind of general nonsense statement rather than concrete computations. So there's not a lot of concrete computations in the literature that you can sort of use as an example. More often than not, you if there is a concrete computation in the literature, it it uses only the first stage or the second stage, almost never goes to the third stage or beyond. Goes to the third stage or beyond. So, yeah, so there's not a lot of, and all the inspiration that I have for these computations came from my work with Dev Sinha and Misha Polyak's work on Polyak-Durro invariance. That was the primary insights that inspired these computations. So I'm just going to briefly tell you a little bit about what the machine is, like the language that they use anyhow. So in the embedding calculus, you study maps out of the embedding space to Tk. It's called the kth stage of the embedded calculus or the Taylor Tower. And it has this. And it has this nice phenomenon. It is a tower in that there's a map from the kth stage that k minus first. You get all these commutative diagrams. These maps to the kth stage are called the kth evaluation maps. And these are, in principle, they're very much like that Palais theorem about maps from diffeomorphisms to embedding spaces. Morphisms to embedding spaces. What you are doing is you are, in constructing this map, you are sampling these embeddings in a bunch of different disks. So I'll give you a bit more of a sense for what that means exactly. So the main theorem of Goodwilly, Weiss, and Klein is that this kth evaluation map has a certain connectivity, meaning the homotopy fibers are, they have a range of trivial homotopy groups. Homotopy groups. So it's k times n minus m minus 2 plus 1 minus m connected. And these bounds are known to be pretty good. You can see because of that n minus m minus 2. When you're in co-dimension 2, this is saying nothing. And so these conductivity estimates all come from Tom Goodrilly's dissertation, which were, his dissertation was about the His dissertation was about the homotopy type of pseudo-isotopy embedding spaces and giving conductivity estimates for those. Anyhow, so if you study this subject, there's tons of different models for how to work with this, like how to do something like computations with it. And I'm going to use the model that looks the most sort of Pele-like. So the case. So, the kth stage of embeddings of, now we're just at an interval, interval into a manifold with boundary conditions. It has the space of maps from a configuration space of k points in an interval to k points in the manifold. There's a prime here, meaning the points have velocity vectors attached to them that are not allowed to be zero. The square brackets around n means we're not looking at the regular configuration space, we're looking. Regular configuration space, we're looking at something called a Fulton-McPherson compactified configuration space. So points are allowed to collide, but when they collide, you record the directions that they collide. Yeah, and the prime means, yeah, there's unit tangent vectors attached or non-zero tangent vectors attached. These maps from this configuration space to that configuration space are supposed to be strata preserving. So the strata of these compactive The strata of these compactified configuration space are the co-dimension zero strata is where all the points are macroscopically distinct. Then there's a co-dimension one strata where two points were likely to collide, the co-dimension three strata where three points are likely to collide, and so on. And there's details, the dimension of the strata, there's also issues with the rate of convergence of planes. With, like, the rate of convergence of points when you have three points all colliding to the same point. Anyway, it's a little bit fussy. We tend to demand that the points in the interval are ordered, so like the T1 comes before, T2 comes before, T3, and so on. The maps are aligned, meaning that your points have vectors attached to them, so when they collide, their direction vectors have to be pointing in the same direction. Same direction. And the point here is that the map from the embedding space to this mapping space comes from just evaluating your embedding on k distinct points and also appending. The velocity vectors are going to be the derivative of that embedding. The partial derivative. And yeah, so the right, so that's what the map should look like that, at least sort of macroscoped. That's what the What the that's the mapping space model that Dev set up, which is this is the most sort of concrete and with you know with the homotopy theory suppressed as much as possible. Yeah, so this is, you know, we don't need any of these theorems in this work. The point of this is that this theorem is telling us. That this theorem is telling us where to look to find invariants. If you need homotopy groups to arrange, well, then you have to make k sufficiently large. So, oh, I suppose I should say, right? So this is mapping, this is a mapping space from a compactified configuration space of points in an interval. Well, distinct points in an interval, that's like an open simplex, right? So when you compactify, you've got. Right? So, when you compactify, you've got some kind of boundary strata on a simplex. It turns out that this is called the associahedron or the stash of polytope. So it looks like a standard simplex, but you've just blown up some of the strata a little bit. And yeah, so another way of looking at this is this mapping space maps from basically a glorified simplex into configuration. Simplex into configuration space in the manifold. So this is, when you're mapping a disk into a manifold so that the boundary is going to a subspace, that would be called the relative homotopy group. We're mapping a disk into a manifold and the disk boundary, different parts are going to different places. This is a multi-relative homotopy group. So if you want to compute this, you have to compute multi-relative homotopy groups. So you have to know how to compute. Homotopy groups, you have to know how to compute homotopy groups of configuration spaces. So I just want to tell you a little bit about homotopy groups and configuration spaces. So they're dominated by things called whitehead products. So if you have a map from a sphere to a space, or a bunch of spheres to a space, you can take the wedge of the two, so that's a map from the wedge of the two domains into the space. And then the whitehead product, what is that? The way to think about it. What is that? The way to think of it is: I could take the product of the K1 sphere and the K2 sphere, so SK1 crossed SK2, and its standard CW decomposition, it has, that'll be the lower dimensional skeleton, and then you're attaching a K1 plus K2-dimensional cell to that. And so the boundary of that is a K1 plus K2 minus one-dimensional sphere. So that's. Sphere. So that cell has an attaching map. So this wedge, you precompose it with the attaching map for that top-dimensional cell, and that's the whitehead product. So you want to be careful to get the signs and all that, but that's what the whitehead product is. So it's a map from a product of homotopy groups to add the dimensions minus one. Minus one. And it satisfies some properties. It's bilinear over the integers. It's this funny graded symmetric. It's got this graded symmetric property. And it satisfies something that's sort of like a graded Jacobi identity, like the Jacobi identity for Lie groups and vector fields. So anyhow, so it satisfies a bunch of properties. And so this is called a something like a graded Lie algebra. Call something like a graded Lie algebra or something like that. Or anyhow. So I want to compute homotopy groups of wedges of spheres. And the pleasant way to do it that's geometric is using the Pontryagin construction. So often people learn about the Pontryagin construction for computing pi 3 of S2. For pi 3 of S2, there's like equivalent of. You know, it's like Guillermo and Pollock or Milner's book. What do you do? You've got the base point, so take a point of S2 that's different from the base point of S2, and so you've got your base map from the three-sphere to the two-sphere. You take the pre-image of that point that's not the base point, provided it's a transverse intersection, you get a framed link in the three-sphere, and that link has this sort of framing number associated to it, and that's the And that's the invariant of the embedding. So, well, what happens when you take a wedge of spheres? Well, you take points that are not the wedge point, which is our base point. And so given a map from a sphere to a wedge of two spheres, you take the pre-image of these points that are not the wedge point, and that gives you disjoint framed manifolds of very. Disjoint framed manifolds of various dimensions. So in this case, framed curves and frame points in the plane. And well, with pi2 of S1 wedge S2, it's a Laurent polynomial ring. How do you figure out which element of the Laurent polynomial ring you're in? Well, that point has got a sine, and it's nested in a certain number of oriented circles. You count the oriented depth you are, and so it's the sine times t to the k, where k is the oriented depth. K is oriented depth. And so you add up all of those monomials, and that's the isomorphism with this polynomial. But while we're at it, how about pi 3 of S2 wedge S2? So it turns out it's three copies of the integers. How do you determine those integers? You take these two points that are not the wedge point. You make that map transverse. And you take their pre-image, and you get a two-component-framed link. Component framed links. There is the linking number of the green and the red links, and then there's the framing number of the green link and the framing number of the red link. And that's the isomorphism. This is something that doesn't get talked about often enough. And there's a vast generalization of this called the Hilton-Milner theorem. The rational homotopy groups of a wedge of spheres, it's freely generated on the rational homotopy group. Generated on the rational homotopy groups of the sum n's with respect to the white head bracket structure. And I think this is a, I think somebody should reprove the Hilton-Millner theorem from this frame cohortism perspective. I would encourage anyone to try to do it. I think this would be a fantastic thing to read through using this sort of geometric point of view. I tell this to homotopy theorists, and they're all. I tell this to homotopy theorists and they're all they're all dismissive. But uh the yeah, so uh so when we get to configuration spaces of points in a manifold, so the the Palais, right, the configuration spaces are embedding spaces of disjoint points. Uh so you can forget one of the points in the configuration space and you get a mapped to a configuration of less points. Uh and the fiber it has a homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. Uh Spheres. So, and moreover, this bundle is split. So, the homotopy groups of this are just the direct sum of the homotopy groups of all the fibers for all these various projection maps. And so you get the homotopy groups of the nth homotopy group of CK of this manifold, are just the direct sum of the nth homotopy groups of all those fibers. Fibers, if those are rationally generated by whitehead products, so the whole thing is rationally generated by whitehead products. And yeah, so the generators of the fundamental group I'm going to call Ti, because you can go around the circle factor a bunch of times. And then the next, the n minus first homotropy group, so those were the higher dimensional spheres, and that wedge that wedge. Spheres in that wedge product. So those generators come from point J going around point I, but not going around the S1 direction. Yeah, so the N minus first homotopy group of this configuration space is generated by all these translates, so that's the fundamental group acting on the higher homotopy groups. All these translates of the Wij elements, and if you're careful, and you know, the pre- If you're careful, and you know, the previous isomorphism tells you what the primitive generators are, but you know, but in this slightly different language, you can check that these are the only relations between those generators. So some of the interesting ones, well, Wij and WJI, they're related by a sign, you know, i going around j versus j going around i. And if you translate a Wij where Translate a Wij where the index of the translation is not listed, it does nothing because those points aren't moving. But if you translate ones that are listed, then you get something. Yeah, so then the 2n minus third homotopy group, this is the one we're going to really need. So it's rationally generated by the whitehead products of the Wijs and it translates. And then there's these relations. You can translate a whitehead product. You can translate a whitehead product that comes from translating bits. Then, brackets are zero if there's no common indices. And then, if you have a single common index, you have this sort of cyclic permutation relation. That turns out to be the only relations. How am I doing for time? That was the last time. Is it? Okay. Well, you're right at 50 minutes from the time. Okay, sorry. Well, so I'm going to just quickly say a few more things. So, so So, to finish this, we have to figure out what that multi-relative homotopy group is. And then, not only once you know it, you have to know, okay, I've got something in this multi-relative homotopy group. How do I determine which element it is? So that Pontryagin construction, like the frame cohortism construction, there's a nice language adapted to configuration spaces where you look at collinear. Collinear triples of points. So here I'm passing to the C3 of a circle across disk. Its universal cover is going to be an open subspace of C3 of R cross disk. And so I wind up looking at certain spaces of collinear triples, and they detect various white-hand brackets. So let's see. And C. And well, there's some technical issues with co-horizontal manifolds. So those are pairs where pairs of points in C2, pairs of points in the circle cross disk, so that the translation vector from one to the other is a fixed direction in the in the disk, a fixed direction in the disk direction. So they're they're overtop each other in the S1 direction. Overtop each other in the S1 direction. So we're using this language. So when you have an element of the homotopy of the embedding space, you look at the, so this is the second stage of the Taylor Tower. It turns out these maps of the second stage of the Taylor Tower, while they may not always be null, when you restrict them to the boundary of that, you know, this is a triangle, when you restrict it to the boundary, When we search the boundary, it turns out there is a canonical null homotopy of those maps. And this is an adaptation of an old argument of Tom Goodwillies. So, what you do is at the second stage, you can canonically close off these maps to get maps of spheres, and that gives you an invariant. And we call it the W2 invariant, because it's the second invariant we came across. And then, when you go to the next stage, the stage. And when you go to the next stage, the stage that we're really interested in, the 2n minus 6 homotopy group, so we go to the third stage, and the map on the boundary now may not be null, but we do know you can compute and check that it is a, at this level, because we're doing 2n minus 6 homotopy group, it turns out to be a torsion invariant. So some multiple of it can be capped off by null homotopies. And so then you have to ask. And then, so then you have to ask: well, depending on what null homotopy choice you make, how are you going to affect the homotopy class of the closed-off map? You get some relations, play around for a while, and you get a pile of relations that look like this. And da da da da da. And okay, so I'm doing more relation computations. And the key relation that we get is this thing that we call the hexagon relation. Hexagon relation. Yeah. And so, you know, and this is true for any alpha and beta, any integer alpha and beta. And so we get a map from the 2n minus 6 homotopy group of this embedding space to the rationals tensor, this 2n minus 3rd homotopy group of the configuration space, modulo, all these hexagon relations, and we call that the W3. And we called out the W3 invariant. And it took us a long time to sort out. We were making tons of mistakes originally in computing this invariant, but it took us several months. We finally got to the point where we could both compute this invariant. And the formalism that I use in computing it, we're using these collinear triples. And there's sort of a really beautiful argument. It's an adaptation of a Misha-Polyak argument where intersecting with Where intersecting with this collinear triple manifold is almost, but not quite the same as looking at pairs of co-horizontal manifolds. It's a really delicate argument that sort of is really beautiful because you don't get a literal cobordism between these manifolds and the disjoint union of those manifolds. In particular, these manifolds are not disjoint, but there's just enough transversality going on that you can extract an invariant out of this. On that you can extract an invariant out of this. So you play around, you start computing, and we look at these implanted barbells and you start checking for these co-horizontal pairs, and you insert it. So these are what the co-horizontal pairs look like at the second stage. Signs. You insert attachment to no homotopies. attached to the no homotopies and you've got all these framed you've got these framed spheres and it turns out they're all they're all either unlinked or just standard linking pairs of spheres and you can compute the signs so it's it's a bit of work but eventually that's the other eventually you get to this w3 of the delta k's is uh this funny polynomial invariant and uh so you get a lot of these delta k's are Lot of these delta k's are linearly independent, and that's roughly the form of the argument. Right, sorry for taking too long. Questions? Posting these slides? Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, if we want to put it on the burst page, we can, or I can just put them up on a Dropbox or email them to someone. I think they're about like I think I think they're they're about like five megabytes because of some of the pictures. So they're a little bit on the large side, but any questions? I have a question for Ryan. I mean everyone can leave if if uh if you're uh yeah, waiting for a couple. Yeah, waiting for property. So is it true that what you're basically dealing with these relations that only the D1 differential in the spectral sequence contributes? Which spectral sequence are you talking about? Well, for the towers, or whatever groups of the towers. But so I guess I've maybe I know a bunch of I know a bunch of spectral sequences, but I guess they're all kind of closely related. But for example, for spectral speech, I don't think we're not really proving anything very general about the spectral sequence. We're just extracting one invariant, right? invariant right that's still i i'm not i'm not claiming to have computed the the the 2n minus 6 homotopy group group the positive like work sorry uh i i'm not i'm not computing the 2n minus 6 homotopy group exactly i'm just i'm just computing an image of it um yeah but i think you are computing like the kernel from the you know from t3 to t2 uh you have a kernel which is a quotient of uh you know some Of some cool thing or something? I'm not sure we got everything. I think we might be off by, we might be missing like one queue. I think we can maybe extract a little more. I'm not sure if we're getting the whole kernel. I mean, isn't that like that corresponding to the fact that you were taking this forgetting data from Cn to Cnx minus one? Yeah, yeah, but I but I I guess I think I think uh we we are yeah, we're taking that forgetful map, but we haven't claimed to have captured everything in the kernel yet. I think we might be missing uh one copy of Q. So what what is so what is the statement then, that uh your quotient by these relations is a subgroup order?
