So the motivation uh physicists introduced January's model was they want to uh generalize Maxwell theory. So in Maxwell theory, uh central feature is a so-called U1 page feature. And the physicists, their idea is that in order to generalize this maximum theory, you need to generalize this symmetry. So so they want to consider general symmetries. And uh to allow general symmetries, uh what yeah and we also realize is that uh you have to replace the vectors he also imagine. To replace the vectors used in Maxwell theory by the algebra value one form. So here we book the algebra model symmetry. And also the linear equation in Maxwell theory should be replaced by nonlinear ones. And after like half century of study, now Yang-Mill's model is the fundamental framework for elementary physicists. For example, maybe you saw this picture somewhere on the internet, it's so-called the standard model for all the elementary. The standard model for all the elementary particles. And this is basically Yamlow theorem. The Yango theorem is different for instance of the B group coupled with Fermi. So let's define, before we define the theory, let's recall the general principle. So classical physics is usually defined by an action functional. So here you have an action functional S, and maybe you want to minimize this. And maybe you want to minimize this action functional and delegate the order of the Grand G equations. And then when we quantize such a classical model, the usual way to quantize this is to define this cast integral or functional integral, where we formally do the integral of some observables of interest against this this measure. This measure is e to the to the action function. Okay, so this is formal because this is an infinite dimensional measure. This is an infinite-dimensional version. Also, before we define the Young-Hills, I'm going to specify the action functional for the Young-Hills model in the next one. Before that, as I said, we need to fix Liboop. For today, you can just think of Liboop as n by n unitary matrices. And small g is the algebra of this boop. Okay, so unitary matrix, the corresponding Lie algebra is the school Hermitian matrices. Let's also recall that the related, so by Lie algebra we mean that there is an exponential map from the Lie algebra to the book. Like in later algebra, we learned that the exponential of school Hermitian matrix is always unitary matrix. Okay, so what's the action functional for the Yamios? Depending on if you're a discrete person, But depending on if you're a discrete person or continuous person, there's the lattice yamios and minimum yamios. So here, lattice yamios, so we have a lattice. Okay, in some sense, this is a very natural model. In a sense, if you like random matrices, this will be a collection of random matrices which are coupled. And if you like statistical physics, this will be just a spin model, except that the spins take a value of matrices. That the sphinx take a value in matrices. Okay, so how to define that? So for every edge xy, we have a legou element that's the spin, which is called qxy. So qxy is like a matrix, unitary matrix. And so we have a field, right? So we have a legoup value field defined on all the edges, each edge. We have a unit term matrix. And then with this field q, With this field q, the action function of energy belong is defined by the sum over p. So p is a square which has four edges. And for each p, we take the product of the four unitary matrix along this square p. Okay, so and then we take the trace, a number, complex and real part of the tree. Complex real part of the trees. So that's our Yamios action functional. And now we can define a measure, which is E to the action functional times the Harr measure. So the product HAR measure over all the edges. So sorry, you said S is real valued or complex valued? S should be real valued. So in the case of unitary matrix, we should have a real part. I forgot to write. Real part of the treatise. real hard to trace. So a crucial property is a symmetry, it's a so-called gauge invariance. It says that take any function on the lattice, which take a value in the Libook, and we do this gate transformation which maps Qn Qxy matrix to this new matrix. This new matrix. So you can check the action functional as the environment under this baseline condition. Because so here, you multiply 2xy on the right by gy inverse, and multiply this on the left by gy, so they cancel. So the whole thing is a static computation by gx. So the trace is invariant. Okay. Okay. Now, continue Yamiel's model. The field is a so-called Lie algebra line in the one form. So it's one form and D components. Just like there, you have D directions of edges. And each component here, Ai, is a function taking value in the algebra. So it's a matrix-valued function. And then the functionality is defined. Functional is defined by the L2 of the so-called curvature F, and curvature is defined in the following way. So it's like a curve, linear term is like a curve of this one form A, and the nonlinear term is the B bracket of the activity. Okay, so the measure is defined by exponential distribution. There's also a gauging invariance. So again, take any luck values. So again, take any boot value function g. We define the bit transformation in the following way. So this maps to this one form to the new one form. Also still take a value in the big algebra you can check. And then you can actually check this functional s is the environment under this big transformation. So sorry, can you give us some hint how that Can you give us some hint how the lattice model approximates the continuous model? Like the space q, how does that look like? Yeah, that's a good question. Of course, physics first defined a continuous model, and since this measure is completely formal, later they came up with the lattice-younger model, finally lattice, this is a well-defined measure. And okay, as you asked, actually, one funny thing. Actually, one funny thing here is that in the continuum, the field takes a value in the d algebra, but in the other lattice take a value in the d boo. And there's a reason for this, which is, okay, so if you want to discretize, a naive discretization would be finite difference, right? So just replace the derivative by finite difference, right? So we can put everything under lattice. But it turns out that this naive discretization would break. Naive disputation will break the PHC image. So if you just do the finite difference disputation, there's no PHC invariance anymore. And then they realize that you have to take a value in the group in order to preserve such a signature. And then as in the previous slide, the relation between the group and the algebra is the following. You should think of the Q as Of the q has the exponential of epsilon A, where epsilon is a lattice space. So that's the kind of relation between. So if you replace each other cube by e to the eight, then basically you have a product of 4e to the 8. Well, then there's a thinker cable host or formula which tells you how to model. Hustle formula which tells you how to multiply four makes easy four. So the leading order, so if you multiply four, this guy, the leading order is e to the sum of those eight, that the sum of those four a would approximate this term. And then the next term would be the v bracket of the a. That gave you this term. So, oh, so but uh essentially you are computing the whole anomaly around some little loop, right? Yes, curvature is something like the whole only around a very small loop, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so as I said, this is indeed a generalization of Maxwell equation. So if a group is U1 at dimension four, then the so-called curvature doesn't have the nonlinear type. Curvature doesn't have the nonlinear term, just the curl. Actually, now since it's a two-form, F is two-form, 4D has six components, three components correspond to electric, three correspond to magnetic field. Okay, so the theme of this workshop is geometry. So, this model has a geometric meaning, actually, independently discovered by geometry. So the field A here corresponds to the so-called connection on bundles. So by connection, connection means you want to specify a way to take derivative bundles. So usually maybe I can explain this on the lattice. So suppose you want to take the derivative of some function phi, but on the lattice, you just say phi. is just okay that's a phiy minus phi x that's a derivative but if phi is a is a section of a bundle there's no canonical way to compare phi y with phi x and that's what the connection does so connection means here as I said each edge we have this kind of rotation q so you have to first rotate the phi y after that compare with the phi x that's that's connection okay so this is Okay, so this is called a covariant derivative using this connection Q. Continuum covariant derivative also defined like that. So, and then the curvature measures some sort of a non-flatness of this connection. And therefore, this L2, this Yamius functional, is a very natural functional to consider because it's you just ask how flat is the connection. How flat this connection. So, in the special case of parameter zero, then this is a flat connection. So, okay, another notion in Yamio theory is observable. So, actually, the most interesting quantity to look at in Yamio theory is not the field itself, not A or Q, but is some quantity which is. But it's some quantity which is environment under the transformation. What is that? So on the lattice, so okay, so a particular example is so-called Wilson loop. It's defined as following. So on the lattice, let's suppose we have a loop. So our x1 back to x1. Then we multiply the field q, the matrix q along all the edges. Along all the edges, and then take the trace. So, this is called a well-suit loop. What's important here is this gauge environment, right? So, under the gauge transformation I defined in previous slides, this whole quantity is the environment. So, the continuum analog of this is exactly holonomy, trace of holonomy. So, basically, take a look, gamma. Take a loop, gamma, and you compute the holonomy defined by this ODE. So here you start with identity, and then you do sort of a parallel translation back to this point, and this gives you a group element. And that's called Holonomy gamma. This ODE, the meaning is. This ODE, the meaning is, okay, so if you first time you see this, if you pretend there's no H on the right-hand side, then this H is the line T wall of this one along the curved line. So this will give you a Li-algebra value element, but what this H does is, in some sense, exponentiate this curve from the Li-algebra of the Li-group. So um um so yeah, so we're going to um um be interested in the wells loops. Um let me mention there's a special case. So as I said, the measure this measure is in general formal and it's important but very hard to make sense. But the special case. But the special case is 2D. In 2D, the Yamio theory is actually well-defined and measuring continuum, and it's actually an integral model. What's special in 2D is that if you only want to compute correlation functions of gating environmental observables such as Wazolo, then you are free to change to the nice page plus the observable to the gate environment. So here in 2D, especially there's a nice page. Actually, there's a nice gauge which says that you can find a gauge, at least on the plane, you can find a gauge transformation which turns this one four by so 2D. Now you have only two components. You can turn this to, you can basically make the first component to zero. This is called axial gauge. It's uh reasonable right because the gauge transformation you have uh you have a function, which essentially you use this degree this one degree freedom to c to q. One degree of freedom to kill this degree of freedom. But if you can make your right form in this form, then the curvature here, so now in 2D you only have one component which is F12. This F12 is simply just E1A2. Because the bracket, B bracket, nonlinear term is B1, A2, but now A1 and 0. So if the current So if the curvature is linear, then the action functional is a quadratic. So this becomes a Gaussian vector. There are different ways to understand what spectral needs. Okay, but actually the problem sounds actually is more non-trivial than it sounds because even if you can make the measure to be non to d redulcent, they uh will also look. The gaji are observed also as the final meaning. Observables are still highly non-minimum. And it's very interesting that this in 2D, this integral, in the sense that many correlation functions have exact formulas. Let's give you an example. Suppose you look at a well-supposed loop of a simple loop. Simple loop just means there's no intersection, circle or something. Then the excitation exactly equals to the exponential of the area enclosed by the loop. Of the area enclosed by the loop. And there are also formulas for more general loops, like a loop intersect with cells many times, and figure eight, one with several these kind of components. And they also have exact formulas. Otherwise it's a error low. Uh yeah. Okay, so this has been studied by any liquid for U1? Any liquid. So there are some formulas on surface, not just on. Okay. Another thing that's important here is the Wilson loops. You have Loops, you have all different loops. And the Wilson loops for all different loops actually have very interesting reversions. For example, so this is a loop. The Wilson loop excitation for this loop is somehow related with slightly deformed loop. For example, Deform a loop. For example, you can deform, you can larger or something. The recursion looks like the derivative of the excitation-Wilson loop with respect to the area enclosed by a loop, is equal to the excitation-Wilson result. Okay, so that's one example of such recursion. So, in some sense, the Wilson loop is related. So the working loop is related with slightly deformed loops. And if the loop has self-intersections, then the recursions are more interesting. We have a figure 8, and the Wilson loop expectation for that is you're going to have terms such as, so in recursion, you have terms such as split this whole loop into two. Into two and the product of the two additions. So there are some reverses that you can use under name Deijer-Schröder equation or McKinkle-Mignal equation or Waster-Loop equation, but in this. So for example, this formula you can even prove using this retraction. Because as I said, every derivative of that is equal to The error derivative of that is equal to zero. So the expectation must be equal to that. Okay, that's 2D test. So summarize, so in 2D, the Amiel's measure is well defined. And the lattice, in any dimension, is also well defined. So you can study the lattice model. There are many topics to study. You can try to prove the loop equations, the recursions. Recursions. You can also, so if you n, you can set n to infinity and study much n linear linear questions, random matrices. You can also, on the lattice, you can study like a decay called the two-point correlation decay. The so-called vast gap problem is the two-point correlation should decay specifically. And also, yeah, there's some duality or some relation with the strength. Or some relation with the string theory branded surface models. But in 3D and 4D in continuum, the measure is not so. So what's the difficulty? So what's the difficulty to make sense and study this formal measure, especially in 3D? There are various difficulties. I want to mention six difficulties here. So, first one is a small-scale singularity. It's a problem, it's a so-called ultra-valid problem for all the low-quantified theories. So, even your measure is a Gaussian measure, quadratics, a Gaussian free field. We know that this Gaussian free field is supported on spatial distributions of the dimension 2 or 100. So, almost surely this field should be. Surely this field should be C alpha with negative alpha. So this means, right, so in the Yamiels model, there are also some nonlinear non-quadrality terms in the action, such as debractic. So such product will not have any classical meaning when the A is a distribution. You cannot multiply distribution. So this is a small-scale singularity problem, also related with ultra-linear divergence. Also related with ultraviolet divergence, quantum field theory has related with dominization and so on. And we also want to make sense of the Wilson loop observable, KG environment observable. So that was the definition of the Wilson loop observable, a holonomy. So as I said, even if you didn't have the H here, If you didn't have the h here, then essentially you have to make sense of the line debour of one form along this curve gap. But in general, there's no notion, there's no way to integrate a distribution along curves. Distribution, you cannot, distribution means it doesn't have a point-wise value. You cannot evaluate that point, you can also not integrate along the curve. You can integrate distribution over a domain. That's essentially a definition of distribution. But you cannot integrate along a low-dimensional sub-manifold. Okay. And then another issue here is about the gauge symmetry, actually. So I said the formal measure look like that, like that, but actually that's not the right way to write it. That's not the right way to write a Young-Hills measure, even at formal level. Because the measure should actually be a measure defined on a quotient space. So here I wrote this formal notation, which is the space of the field, and I model out the quotient of this equivalence condition. Otherwise, you have infinite-dimensional Bayesian transformation, and the measured as environment-conditioned transformation cannot be normalized or simplified. So, in the smooth setting, we understand, so we define the gate equivalence in this way. But what does this mean in the singular setting? So, now A is a distribution LSA. How do we make sense of such transformation? That's another issue. Related with this sort of quotient, right? So, this quotient. Sort of quotient, right? So this quotient space has very complicated geometry structure because the gauge transformation is highly nonlinear and so on. So one way to deal with this issue is a so-called gauge fixing. So gauge fixing basically means you sort of select a representative element from each equivalent class. In other words, you find a cross-section. Section. In the simplest case, in a abelian case, maybe you know how the Haus decomposition or Haus decomposition. So each equilibrium class, you can find an element which is divergence-free. That's the so-called Coulomb condition. But in the non-believing case, this issue becomes more subtle. There's a paper by Singer who proved that. Would prove that actually on the sphere, it cannot, there's no continuous way to fix a pitch. So there's no continuous way to select a representative element which sort of intersects each equivalent class once or only once. If you prove that it's not a cross-function. Okay, there are many such issues here. I must move on. Large Um large field problem, um, this means that there are there are some other non-Gaussian quantum field theories, non-Gaussian measures in Qimechen, which are simpler than Yamiel's. For example, this is so-called sine-4 theory, this is so-called Liuville theory. In these simpler models, they have a nice tail. At least formally, these measures have a nice tail. You can see when the phi is large, the probability gets. Phi is large, the probability gets small, but there's negative size because it's also negative positive. This is very important if you want to integrate size. Make sure it's integral. But such a stability mechanism is totally unclear for Young. If you write down the Young-Mill section functional, you just don't see this mechanism. Okay. So also the question is not just to make sense of measure. sense of measure. After one makes sense of the met try to define a measure, one also have to sort of verify some basic properties, some symmetry properties, for example, which are required to be upon a theory of theory. And also there are long distance questions. So I mentioned small scale problems. Also there are large scale problems, inferior problems. For example, I already mentioned already mentioned mass gap, which means how the correlation decay. And so-called quark confinement is related with if you take a huge gross loop, then whether the expectation of this decay like the dimension of the area of the loop or or parameter of the loop. Okay, so um people often study this on the on the on the lattice. This is on the lattice, isolated equity from small scale. Okay, so now I can maybe speak about our stochastic colonization result. So in one sentence, we prove that on 2D and 3D torus, we can address, okay, and there's remote qualization, we can address the first three. We can address the first three questions. So, small scale and the meaning of gauging environments observable. So, more precisely, our papers roughly two parts. Deterministic part, we construct a space of the fields A. Okay, so space of singular Li algebra value one four. Well, for this space is different from all the other classified solar bes of spaces, but they can be embedded into the standard besoff spaces with a negative index. And on this new space, we do have a notion of gauge equivalence and the gauge environment observables. So that's the first part. So that's the first part. Second part, we study so-called stochastic colonization or Langevine dynamic. I'll define this in the next slides. And in this setting, we can solve the small-scale similarity question. So we can make sense of the dynamic for a short time. As gauge invariant observables, are they Wilson-loop functionals or are they something else? They're Wilson-loop functionals. For okay, in 3D, in 2D is really Wilson-loop functionals. In 3D, it's Wilson loop for regularized field. And the regularization is quite delicate, actually. But it still gives the environment of the sort of simple. And okay, so also actually here So actually here not only we get a local solution, a short-lived solution of the stress quantization, but we also show that solution has an important gauge environment property. This allows us to project the solution to the quotient space. Here the quotient space is constructed in the first part. In the first part, we have a notion of the equivalence, so we can define a quotient space. It's a topological space. So um so what is the categorization? Um so yesterday w w we we we um we heard a lot of we heard several talks about this. So in finite dimension um this gradient flow driven by front emotion will converge to this environment measure in T o So stochastic organization is just infinite dimensional analog. Formally we can also write down this Formally, we can also write down this infinite dimensional dynamic, replace the Browning motion by spacetime y noise C. So, formally, the measure should be environment measure for that. So, this means if we can make sense, make rigorous sense of this dynamic and try to send time to infinity and get a limiting measure, that will give a meaning to this formulation. Formal measure. So this turns the question of making sense of the measure to a question of solving this has been. So yeah, so Gaussian space-time Y noise just means it's your correlated singular field. So before I explain the cast quantization for Yale Meals, I should say This works for a simpler model. This is the phi 4 model. And the stochastic quantization equation, right, so the gradient of this action is plus phi minus phi cubed. And stochastic quantization for this, especially in 3D, has been very successful. So Mark and Clayer first construct a local solution. So the solution. So, the solution should be understood in a renormalized sense. Renormalization means we first regularize this circuit, so some sort of refunction, whatever. And then before we remove this regularization, we should add this renormalization constant, C is low, which is divergent when it's not go to zero. But with this divergent constant, this solution phi is low. Phi is long. The phi is long will converge to a non-trivial limit as it goes to zero. So in some sense, this addressed the small-scale similarity problem via this minimalization and regularity structure. And then the two groups. So here in this paper, they managed to construct a global solution for a long time. Solution for a long time and also prove that the solution has a time-independent bound, as time-codes infinity. This allows us to use the so-called Greyloft of the Lugov argument. Essentially, it says that once you have a time-dependent bound of the solution, you can send time to infinity and get a different measure. And there's also a different approach. You don't start, so here is You don't start, so here you start with the arbitrary initial condition and goes to time. But here, they actually might be a simpler approach. So you just start with a lattice. Eventually, you want to send the lattice to continue. But on the lattice, you look at a stationary solution to the discrete SPD. This would be a finite-dimensional ST, perfectly well-defined. And then they try to show. And then they try to show that since this is a stationary solution, at every fixed time, the law is just the discrete version of this measure. Then they show that this law is tight as lattice facing range. Yeah, they can do an infinite volume. Also, uh Also, uh verify the axioms. So, in this global constructions, one addressed a large field problem. So, as I said, in the measure, you can see when the fine is large, the probability is small. This mechanism is very important when they study the SPD because faux amounts to say this is a minus sign. So, once you have minus phi cube, it's not hard to have sign. It's not hard to have some global control because once phi is large, once sort of the normal phi is large, then this some damping term, we immediately damp phi back to zero. So that's why phi is always at the control. But there's no such mechanism for ya mills. For ya-mills, the For young miles, the SPD looks like this. So can see I is independent of the algebra value of my noise. The nonlinear terms, V brackets, ABA and AQ. Yeah, let's just skip this remark. Basically, the motivation that Paris so Paris and Wu was first who who who who defined the who introduced formalization. Actually, there are motivations to study. Their motivations to study young hosts because in this framework, somehow instead of a global case fixing, which sometimes causes problems, you only need to do a local HTML. Anyway, again, this equation is formal in two and three dimensions, and our first result is n-local solutions using regular functions. So this is only local. As I said, when time is large, the large field problem would still show up. This still remains to be other species. But for okay, so yeah, so maybe just a few words about dimensions of why we consider two and three dimension. So the basic idea of a regular structure is to give a meaning to such a normalized SPD. Normalized SPD, one has to first construct a finite collection of perturbative objects. Those perturbative objects are basically defined by some sort of decalation. They start from by noise, which is a Daussian object, and then you sort of basically iterate, you do some decal division, you generate more and more fertility objects. But the main theorem in regular structures says that The theorem in regular structure says that there's a continuous map from this finite collection of the object to the solution. So once you show that these perturbative, these finitely many perturbative objects converge, then you have a limited solution. So in 2D, there are something like three or four perturbative objects, and in 3D, there are hundreds of them, and 4D, there are anything many of them. So that's somehow one reason that in 4D, this theory is not working at all. So okay, so that was the first result, but for YAMIS, it's more interesting than something like 5.4 because we still need to address the gate signature. So this is just one page which explains our result about its symmetry. So I already mentioned that we construct a so this is That we construct a, so this is a deterministic construction. We construct a new space which can be embedded into the classical Vessel space with index minus one half point, such that there's a notion of a gauge environment observable on S and a notion of gauge equivalence on S. So, how do we do that? So actually, I didn't write here in 2D, in 2D, we can actually define the Wilson loop observable for each singular element. But in 3D, there's no way to define line degrees for such a singular, so there's no way to do a line degree for such a singular platform. Instead, we consider, so we try to. So, we try to regularize this one form. So, here A is a Li algebra one form, and it's singular. So, the first thing we do is we consider a gauge environment regularization called A delta. So, A delta is smooth or positive delta. And what do I mean by gauge environment regularization? So, in principle, you can just regularize A by some article, say, for a chunk of. Some have to say, free truncation or something. But here we define A delta via the deterministic Yamius heat flow. That's just the Yamius flow without the noise. And since it's a heat flow, we know that heat flow has regularization properties. So that's why for every positive delta, A delta is smooth. Smooth. And the sincere Yam-Mills flow is gauge environment. This means that if you have A and A bar, they're gauge equivalent in a small sense, then after this regularization by YAML's heat flow, they're still gauge equivalent. So this idea of using YAML's heat flow to do some organization actually go back to Actually, go back to Carla, Muslim Rose. So then, as I said, you have this gauge environmental property for this levelization. This means that if these two smooth, right, so suppose they are smooth and a gauge equivalent, then we know that they are after levelization they are still gauge equivalent. But now we try to go back, right we try to define gauge equivalence for two simpler objects. For two singular objects in this way. So we say now if A and A bar are two distributions, right? The distributions, there are no classical meaning of gauge equivalence, but we define that there are gauge equivalents if, after such regularization, there are gauge equivalents. We can show that this doesn't depend on the choice of Dao. This gives a notion of gauge equivalence, and we can also Gauge equivalence and we can also define Wilson-Loop observable. So it's defined as usual, but it replaces singular A by the regulars. Okay, so that's the deterministic construction. And then we have a quotient space, S quotient out. And now I want to show that the solution of this SPDE has an important gauge covariant property. So this means that this is based on all the field A and these are the orbital gauge covalent classes. Now, gauge covariant property of the dynamic says the following. If you start with two initial conditions, which are gauge equivalent, Which are gauge equivalent, and after time t, the two solutions are still gauge equivalent in law. What's interesting here is that we show, so this is the renormalization constant, 3D diverged like one over Hips law, but we show that there is actually a finite shift of this renormalization constant, such that the solution is H covariant. Okay, so this finite shift is actually unique. So, in some sense, there's a one-parameter family of solutions, just like Intel calculus analysis. For SDE, we have a one-dimensional family where you have epochs, knowledge, and other solutions. But among this one-party family, there's a unique one which is quite equal. So this gauge covariance is very important because it allows us to project a solution. Allow us to project a solution to the quotient space. Because it just means that the solution doesn't depend on which representative element you choose from this initial orbit project. Okay. So that was our result in 3D. Let's come back to 2D, right? So recall that in 2D. 2D, right? So recall that in 2D the measure is well defined and also lattice any dimensional coefficients. Okay, so just maybe one more method. So but even in 2D continuum or on the lattice, actually we can prove many interesting properties of the Young-Bells measure using the dynamic. Okay, so for example, in 2D, we show that the 2D Young-Bills measure in the sense of the vehicle driver. Measure in the sense of the vehicle driver is indeed the uniquely invariant measure for our Young Neils test. So, this gives a new colorization of 2D Young Neils in terms of the uniquely invariant measure. And this colorization has many applications. For example, we can show that the 2D Young measure has a universality property. Many different lattice marksman. Approximations, you heard about Rosen, Milan, Manten, many other approximations, they converge to the same universal limit. Because we can show that the we can study the dynamic for these lattice models, and we can argue that their limit is always the environment measure for the Yamios of the head. And since the environment measure is unique, Is unique, their limit must be universal. On the lattice, we can also use the dynamic to prove various properties. So this is the lattice dynamic in the UN case. So it's a V value S D. Okay, so this is related with the talks on Monday, I think. So here P is a So here P is a, so on every edge, there is a B group value run motion. So we can use this dynamic to, for example, reproof master loop equation of the lattice, learning strategy. Just prove very simple. Just, you know, you have this dynamic for the Q, and then if you don't prove for some recursion of the Wolf's loop, you just need to apply the intolerable formula to the Wolfson loop, and then just substitute this equation. And you immediately see this sort of deformation and so on. And we can also prove like the logos of inequality and some mixing property of the dynamic. This can give us some information about the correlation detail. So for the mascot, at least for a small beta. To summarize To summarize, in 3D we still haven't constructed a global solution. So it would be nice to obtain some strong bond on the solution AT at Targe. If you can do that, then maybe you can send time to infinity, finally construct a 3D out of structure. So our construction continuum is on torus. It would be nice to extend to R3. 10 to R3 and prove the correlation decay in continuum. So now the correlation decay, we can only prove that it is for small beta. It would be nice to do that for large beta. And if anything can be said in fully, it'd be great. Okay, I'll stop here. Thank you. So masterful survey, if I may say. It's really yeah. Are there any questions? So there's a lot of effort being made to make sense of these really rough dynamics on the large time scale, but if you want to make sense of time infinity, could you just first regularize past that dynamics to infinity, then take away the regularization of the noise, and then make sense of the angles to measure that way? I mean, this might be naive, but you don't have to spend so much time. You don't have to spend so much time dealing with rough SPEs. You just say, well, this is a nice, smoother version of the noise. I'd let time go to infinity. I have some compactness or whatever. And then take the regularization. And then this is the angle metric. So the, yeah, so you can do that for regularized by handing. But the problem is the sort of long time estimate or bump, whatever, is not going to be uniform with the regularization. So when you pass to the single lid um all the all the bounds you get. Uh actually for the in the smooth setting like in geometry uh there are already many results uh which study like global solution. Well for detonation like but in smooth setting um you think yeah even in 4D um you can get global solution. So so in two dimensions you had this nice result that you have this unique invariant measure. Yes. Is this useful when you want to study long-time existence and convergence? Yeah, so okay, so right, so that's exactly what we do, right? So we, in this paper, In this paper, we actually construct a long-time dynamic using the environment measure. Because in 2D, you already have an environment measure. Then there is an argument by Jean-Morgan, which allows you to use the environment measure to construct a global solution. Oh, so yes. So we can use the environment measure to to get a global bundle. Oh, I see, because when you stated your result, it sh look like short term and not long term existence. Long-time existence. But in two dimensions, you have long-time existence. It's beta dimensions. Yeah, in 2D, we have a long time. In 2D, we have a long time because we have the environment measure to use. And you're also asking the uniqueness of this maybe. So here the uniqueness follows from a paper of Martin Haier and Jonathan Martin. They have a general framework for uniqueness of environment measures for simplicity. Yeah, so this paper combines many. Yeah, so this paper combines many different techniques. Yeah, thank you for a beautiful talk. Very interesting. Is there any work on, in the continuum setting, in dimension three, about the large n limit, u n n goes to infinity? Well, I was thinking of continuum case. Is there any kind of large n limit? Is there any kind of large end limit? In two dimensions, of course, there's a lot of work about the large end limit. It's pretty well understood. If you do it in three dimensions, I know Chatterjee has some things and some of his co-authors about large end limit on the lattice, but is there any way to do any of a continuum theory? Yeah, so large N problem for 3D continuum. For 3D continuum, would be, yeah, there's no result, but that would be very interesting. Any like physics-type conjectures or something as to what you would expect in that limit? Yeah, I don't know. But on the lattice, in any dimension, the larger limit is a bit messy because actually can be can be proven using the log sober for the dimension. Log Soberlift. Once you have a log sober lift, you can compute the variance of the Wilson loop. And then you can see as n goes to infinity, the variance goes to zero. This tells you the large n limit is deterministic. Looks obvious about the variance. Can I ask a basic question about the beginning? So, in two dimensions, you have this formula that the Wilson loop is. You have this formula that the Wilson loop that's just. Hello, yes. Someone on Zoom is asking a question. Yeah. Was it Jonathan? Oh, Lena Jonathan, but I don't think he was asking a question. Len did have a question, but it is not yet complete. It's not yet complete. Okay, so then I asked my answers. Okay, so you have that development loop, just as given by the enclosed area. But I'm also a bit surprised that this doesn't depend on the level. Like when you take the trace, shouldn't you dimensionalize? Something like this, then the formulas start to become a depend on the. But when the loop is simple, why doesn't it depend on the leaf or like when you take the price, you should at least see that? Like when you paint the price, you should at least see the dimension of what it's like. It may be specific to UN. At least it's like that, exactly like that for UN. Not just U1, but UN for any N. And it really is exactly like that. And there's some identity that gives you exactly that area for all N, for UN. So maybe that depends on the normalization. That depends on the normalization. Yeah, yeah, you have to of course normalize it the right way so that the constant in the exponent doesn't depend on n. Oh, yeah, if you change the inner product of the algebra or something, then of course maybe you get a area some constant or something.
