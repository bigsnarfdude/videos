I can convey my message correctly. So we have been discussing anesthesis and the formation of loops in vascular networks. And I'm going to try and show a little bit about a bubble that takes into account the role of the PCU in that. So as we know, vessel networks need to form an estimated formational groups in order to function, and the tissue in principle should play an essential role. In principle, should play an essential role in driving this anastomosis. So, what are the possible mechanisms for anastomosis? So, we have been hearing several different mechanisms, and one would be like touching. So, the tip cells of a growing vessel can extend their phyllopodia. The phyllopodia can touch other endothelial cells, they can feel it, they can pull, they can just merge that. So, that's certainly a valid mechanism. Mechanism. Another one is that the tip cells, when they migrate, they exert forces, and when they exert forces, they deform the tissue. And other cells can sense this deformation and then can migrate in the direction of that deformation. That occurs normally when you place cells in a 3D substrate. The cells can feel each other's forces and they can migrate in that direction as well. This is not something that. As well. This is not something that I'm going to speak about. We have done a model about this. This is an angiogenesis model that takes into account just forces deformations and just elastic tissue. And you can see that, for example, here when this one goes, the other one feels and merges. So they merge face to face. That's the same thing happened there. And so this is something that happens. I'm showing DQ this because this model creates really pretty. Because this model creates really pretty pictures and not as pretty as the ones I'm going to show you in the rest of the talk. Is it published? Sorry? Is it published? Can I read at all? It's not. I'm writing it down. I have everything done. I just have to post. But I can tell you all about it. Very nice. Anyway, what I'm going to explore here is this last one. What about the VEGF that is produced by epoxic cells? Can the VEGF serve as a guiding mechanism for the As a guiding mechanism for the vessels to merge. And what some indications do we have about that? For example, when you have wound healing, cells like macrophages, immune cells, they play a very important role in the formation of endostomosis. Here we have two pictures. Let me see if I can put this image here. You see here a vessel that is growing. Those are the macrophages. And the macrophages go to the place where the anostomosis will be. They exert forces, they produce EUGF, and they guide the formation. Produce EGF and they guide the formation of anostomosis. You can see that here as well. This is a neutrophil, it goes away, but then this macrophage stays there. Some macrophages just zoom by, but some place where the anostomosis is, macrophages will stay there. Okay, so this is what happens in wound healing. Perhaps when a tissue is developing, something similar could happen driven by the tissue cells. Anyway, so also another important thing that blood vessel cells have to have, blood vessels, Blood vessels have to have, blood vessel networks, is they should be resilient in this way. For example, I will explain what I have here. So this is the result of an experiment where they are able to change, for a blood vessel that is growing, they are able to change the proliferation rate of the endothelial cell. The endothelial cells, okay? The proliferation rate of the blood vessel cells. They do that in two different ways. This is by a chemical, and here is by doing a knockout in cells, so in the deuterial cells. So this knockout knocks out a protein from the glycolytic pathway, which is this PFPFP3, which leads to a slower proliferation of the endothelial cell. Proliferation of the endothelial cells. And so the total number of endothelial cells in the network decreases, but the number of vessels is still the same. And what happens is that the vessels become with a larger lumen, but the number of vessels is the same. So the idea is that when you play with the proliferation rate, when you play with the velocity that the cells migrate, The cells migrate, that should not influence so much the type of network that you have. And so, because the type of network is performing a function, and that function is to irrigate the cells. And so, it should be resilient to these kind of changes if the cells migrate a bit less or if the cells colliflate a little bit more. So, what is the model that I'm going to show? This is a model that has. That has tip cells and stock cells. So, the tip cells will be the leading cells at the front. The tip cells are special, they have hylopodia, they follow the gradients of the EGF, they degrade the extracellular matrix, they construct a path, they do not pull the freight, they migrate in front, and they are followed by stock cells. Of course, this is a very dynamic process, but what we are doing is that we are going to put in front of our growing vessels an agent-based component to describe these thick cells and a continuous component to describe. And a continuous component to describe the stock cells. So I'm going to move a little bit fast on the model, and if you want more details, I can give you. So the model is a phase-field model coupled with an agent-based model. So we have a vessel. The vessel is identified by a phase, by a field, which is equal to one inside the vessel, equals to minus one outside. And we have a bunch of cells, and these cells are identified by a field, which is psi, which is equal to one. By a field, which is psi, which is equal to 1 inside and minus 1 outside. We have free energy, and that free energy, what says is that stabilizes the vessels, stabilizes the cells, and introduces a repulsion. So it means that the cells occupy space and the vessels have to go around the cells. Then we have a proliferation rate for a vessel, and we have an equation for the VEGF, for the endogenic factor. For the endogenic factor. The angiogenic factor diffuses, is produced by the tissue cells. I'm writing here tumor because of my second part of the talk. And then it can be degraded, it can be consumed by the capillaries or by the vessels, and it can be consumed or degraded by anti-VEGF, which I'm not going to consider for the first part of the talk, but I'm going to focus. My diffusion constant depends on the type of VEGF. VEGF comes in two different isoforms. So we can have light isoforms. So, we can have light isoforms where the VGF diffuses, and you can have heavy isoforms that they are bound to the matrix. And so, for the light isoforms, my diffusion coefficient is a constant. For the heavy isoforms, my diffusion coefficient will increase with the isoform concentration. So, if you have a little bit of it, it will get all bound to the matrix. If you have a lot of it, it can be zero. Then, the tip cell is introduced whenever we have concentration of EGF larger than a cathode. Have a concentration of EGF larger than a cutoff, it moves with the gradient of EGF, and they cannot be neighbors. So, if you have a TIP cell at some point, the neighboring cell or close by there won't be a TIP cell. So, this is auto-inhibition that occurs for TIP cells. So, we have two important parameters: one parameter that will regulate conflation, and another parameter that will regulate chemotaxis. So, how pretty can our networks Can our networks come out? So they look like that. So, there will be a bunch of sources of EGF. VGF goes to the vessel and then it sprouts the first pit cells. The pit cells keep on going and then you have second sprouts and there it goes. Here I don't have cells. Here I have cells. So here you see that the vessels just go around the cells. Just go around the cells. Now, we have vessels, we have cells, and we want to see what is the influence of the cells in driving anesthomose formation. And for that, I'm going to put two different rules for the protection of EEGF by these cells. So, what are those two rules? One is to say that these cells, what they're doing, they are pushing the vascular network, they are just promoting the development of the network. Another rule is. Another rule is to say that the cells really want to form an ostomosis, really want to be irregular. So, what we do is the following: this, my rule one, is the one that makes sense. Is that my cell will be producing VEGF until it will have flow passing nearby. So, as the blood vessels grow, we are calculating the flow all throughout network. And whenever we have flow nearby a cell, then that cell will stop producing the UGF. Stop producing the UGF. This one is the MyRule2, is where the cells simply drive the growth of the vasculature, occupy space, so the vessels have to find a pathway between the cells. But so they are not so much important with uh concerned with making anastomosis. So in this case, whenever a s uh a vessel is nearby a cell, the cell will start producing uh angiogenic function. So here is just vessels grow growing and occupying space, and this one the cell will demand to be irrigated. So only when we have the erastomosis, the cell will stop using EGF. So what do we have? We clearly obtain more anastomosis for the rule one than for the rule two. So this is a typical case. We have the vessels growing or the We have the vessels growing, growing, growing. Here, for the rule two, the cells do not force anastomosis. Whenever a blood vessel passes nearby, the cell is happy and stops producing EGF. And so here, this is in two dimensions. So whenever denosomosis are farmed very often, and sometimes we have blood flow going like that, but that's just fortuitous, so it happens sometimes. Here that that's not the case. With rule one, That's not the case. With rule one, the cells, you need to form an estimosis for the cell to produce VEGF, and so you form lots of loops. So we are plotting the density of anesthomosis as a function of the proliferation rate. We are plotting the density of branches as a function of the proliferation rate. And we see that here for the rule one, which is this one at the top, we have many more omostomosis than on the other case. And we see that the See that the network is much more stable. So, for example, here we have, well, here the number of anastomosis can increase by over a factor of 10 when I vary the proliferation rate within this range. The number of branches can also vary by a factor of 5 or so when I vary with the proliferation rate, but within this range as well. But the same does not happen when I have. The same does not happen when I have vulnerable, when I have one, things are much more stable. If you don't see this so well, this is much more clear when I vary the tip cell velocity. Here, when I vary the tip cell velocity, from tip cells that are very small to quite large, the density of anesthetics are flat, the density of branches are almost flat, and with WOL1, the variation is huge. So it's over 20 times. So the production of endogenic. So, the production of endiogenic factors by repoxic cells is enabled to promote the vessel anostomosis in two dimensions, and the network morphology has an increased resilience towards variation on endothelial cells proliferation and tip cell velocity. Now, we see that the cells determine where the network behaves. So, in this case, here, if we start organizing the cells in If we start organizing the cells in different ways, so I put here cells organized. So before I had cells randomly distributed, and here I have cells organized like that. With my rule one, where I have a bunch of cells, I will have many vessels. And then when the vessels cross this gap, I have only a few number of vessels. And then we have also a high density of vessels where we have more cells, like that. So the. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The vessels will determine the deaths of your vessels. It's not just determined by the pollutration rate or by the cell velocity, it is the distribution of epoxic cells that determine the deaths of your vessels. If I do with rule two, when I calculated the density of vessels here, the density of vessels there, and the density of vessels there is approximately 6. Now, what happens in three dimensions? When we go to three dimensions, When we go to three dimensions, we can do exactly the same thing. It's a bit more work, especially to calculate the flow here. But this is an initial vessel, then the sprouts all throughout to the sides. And then this is with rule two, with rule one I have more vessels. I can quantify that. And here, the important thing is the density of anesthomosis, the number of anesthemosis. Here, the most density, when I value The nostalgia density, when I vary the proliferation rate, or when I vary the tip cell velocity, if I have rule 2, I pretty much don't have an ostemosis. So this is the situation where the vessels are growing, the vessels are growing, but they just miss each other. But when the epoxic cells are there, when the epoxic cells, they will produce VEGF until you have the formation of loops, then the number of anastomosis is quite large. Nestomosis is quite large, and I can have very high anastomosis. So, the tissue cells are an important role in that aspect. Good, I have five minutes. Okay, so then we try to use this model to apply to different systems. And one example of an application that we did was to try and see how different ways of delivering antiegogenic. Of delivering anti-agenic drugs can affect the development of blood vessels. And so, this is a situation where we are collaborating with a group in Bragen, in Portugal, where they inject glioblastoma cells into a zebra fish and they observe that when they do that, in the glioblastoma model, they have a very large Model, they have a very large vascularization, and then they are trying to do different ways of tackling that vascularization, of diminishing that vascularization. And so, what they do is the following. So, they put anti-VEGF, so anti-VEGF is called Bevas Isumar. Sometimes I write by Beva, but I like to say Bevas is Umar. It's also Avastin, it's the same thing. And they compare two different ways of delivering Bevasizumar. They do it by just injecting or mixing in the Or mixing in the solution with the cells, or they do it by inserting it into nanoparticles. And they observe that here, the vascularization index, this is the gliobostomonormal, this is where they have the free verbacism map in the system, and so you have less vascularization. But when you have verbosism map in the nanoparticles, you have even less vascularization. And we are trying to understand what is happening fluorescently. Why the nanoparticles can decrease more. White millennial particles can decrease more than the reverse polarization. And what happens is that this is when the wavazismab is in the particles, in this case the tumor cells, they integrate the wevasizumab themselves. You see that here, the number of pavasizomab positive cells, when you have the breval seismab in the stroma, you have a small amount. Stroma, you have a small amount of it, but when it is in the nanoparticles, delivered by nanoparticles, the venous systemab is integrated in the cells. And here you see that they will have less VEGF. So their production of VEGF is lower. So the difference between the mechanism between the when we give verbasismab in these nano capsules is that it decreases the production rate of the Of the tumor cells, while when we put the anti-VEGF in the tissue, it just tries and binds the VEGF at least in the tissue itself. Okay, so my question is, how does the vascularization and DEGF bioavailability difference in both situations? So, in this case, what we did compared We did compare was both situations. We compared the situation, I still have two minutes. We compared the situation where we have the parapatismab, so the production of EEGF decreased. And so when I have the production of EEGF decreased by the cells, so here is 15%, 20%, 25%, what we can see, it's like we have little pockets of EEGF. It's like we have little pockets of VEGF in the tissue. And so the vessels sometimes, when they are growing, they find a region without much VEGF because it's all full of little pockets because the cells are decreasing their proliferation rate randomly. And that is why we have a slower vascularization. On the other hand, when we have free verseismab in the tissue, what we observe is that Observe is that as we increase the concentration, we observe a very drastic decrease in the number of vessels. But whenever metazizumab is cleared out of the tissue, for example, by process that may occur in the tissue that clears the chemical out, that I want. So, when that happens, the vessels recover very fast. And so, that would be the difference. So, in this case, I need to maintain a very high concentration of my A very high concentration of gregaracomab to hinder the vascularization. On the other situation, the gregaracillumab has to be integrated with the cells and that will hinder the vascularization by themselves. So, I'll jump that and I will go to my conclusion. Good in time. So, I have here from first part that my tissue morphology determines my vascular network. The tissue and also the immune cells increase of inflammation will drive LNS models information in vascular morphology. And for the second part, And for the second part, I compared what happens when you give anti-VEGF to the tissue or nano-encapsulated. And in this case, it affects the VEGF secretion by the tumor cells. Even though make pockets of high VEGF levels may exist, the vessel reduction can be large and sustainable and ten. So, with that, I would like to thank my co-operators. So, this is my group. I'm from Coimbra, so I have to take the pictures. So, in the development of the model, there were many people, Uhenu is here. Most of the work, especially the 3D part, was done by Mauricio. And finally, I have here some questions for discussions. You may have with me, or you may ask these questions, right? So, these are the things that I want to note. I would like to know what other cells' arrangements could create vasculatures that could be interesting to explore. How can I make things more realistic in other ways? And what interesting vasculatures can I have? What things can I? Can I have? What things can I extend the model? What other mechanisms could be interesting to write? And what other biological questions can the model answer? Our page is here. It's biologicalmodelling.com. It has pictures of our paths. So with that, I thank you. Yeah. Very nice. Thank you very much. I will add so much about the model. So about the model, so because it's the self-changing invasion speed and the overall polarity of the tissue will depend on the tip cell lens. So how do you fix the tip cell number? Okay, so what happens is whenever the VEGF concentration reaches a summit threshold, a new tip cell will appear. And so the only thing And so what the only thing that happens is that tip cells cannot be neighbors. So whenever I have a tip cell, that rules out a tip cell appearing nearby. It's nearby along the vessel, so it's complicated. Which means overall higher VEGF will lead to overall larger velocities and more like... Higher production of VEGF will lead to more concentration of pip cells. And in that situation, the tissue is absolutely safe. The tissue is absolutely essential. Because if you have the high concentration of EGF, if you have some vessels, the tip cells come all throughout that vessel and they will grow in parallel for the high concentration of EGF. And then the tissue will have to require for the anastomosis to be forming. If you don't put the tissue, you just get a parallel thing. But this is in this model. So what happens in real life is that when you have the concentration of VEGF being very high, Concentration of the EGF being very high. The cells do not, they have troubles in defining which are the tip cells and which are the strong cells, and they may be a bit stuck there. So things could have even less cascolization when the concentration of the jet is very high. Just a quick yes or no question. A curiosity, but do you have anastomosis if you neglect the effect of the tissue? Yeah, well, I showed you. So if I neglect the effect of the tissue in this way, what I was showing in my Google Tool, I have some anastomosis. I have some anastomosis in 3D, some anastomosis in 2D, a little bit more, because 2D is easy to make anastomosis. But the tissue, when I have a cell, the cell is producing a VAGF, and it will produce VAGF until it gets irrigated. And so the But it's not a necessary condition. Okay, okay. Nice, very cool. Very nice. And what could be a simple mechanism to understand for rule one? Because I have a conference understanding of route two. Or what about rule one? So these sprouting vessels are dead and they are not good. So why cells should suffer good? So what happens is that the tissue cells have one protein which is called if an alpha, and whenever there's no oxygen, And whenever there's no oxygen, that protein increases its levels and regulates its response towards epoxy. And so only when the cells are irrigated, a normal cell, only when a cell is irrigated, those levels go down and their production of EGF goes up. Typically that should be it. So my rule one said that only after there is a loop formed, the blood is flowing. Formed, the blood is flowing, and the cell is available. The flow is key. But you didn't talk about checking out. Thank you.
