And applications, hello everyone. Uh, how is the weather in uh banff? Any snow? Lots a lot of snow. That's good. So, uh, I mean, I will talk about some applications of Quantum homology to virational geometry. So now I will not discuss the tools. So to what tools are involved, I refer you to the talk of Maxim Kunsevich, who he gave today in Simon's form. Today, in Simon's Foundation. So, we will just discuss some applications of his talk. And the point that I would like to make is that already in the case of cubics, this is cubic hyper surfaces, it is a very It is a very interesting application, but already, of course, there are many other applications to in different in many more examples. So, I mean, when I was very little, if you can imagine, so I mean, I was told the following story that Story that Pluto tried to teach Aristotle and gave him the following story: that if you cut both heads of the Hedra, then four more appear. If you cut four, eight more appears. And then Pluto asked the result of what happens next. Aristotle, what happens next? Well, Aristotle said, Well, if you cut eight, 16 appear. And the answer is no, the header actually dies. And the point of the story is if you repeat one thing many times, you can actually bore everyone to death. So now, with the risk of killing the hydra, I'll talk to you about the cubics and And so, of course, cubics are the next hypersurfaces after quadrics. And for quadrics, we all know they are all rational due to the fact that projection of one point gives you a one-to-one correspondence between Cn and the quadratics. So, already for cubics in dimension one, that's certainly not the case, but if you make it singular, If you make it singular, of course, you get this one-to-one map to C, and the singular cubic in any dimension becomes rational. So, this is the curse of the cubic from another point since all these methods that we know by the generations do not apply to them. And let's go over the cubics. We start with the two-dimensional one, and of course. And of course, if the two-dimensional cubic is defined over the complex numbers, we do know that it's rational. But if it's defined over algebraically non-closed field such that the Picar is equal to two, for example, then this cubic header structure of a conic bundle, and so this is a vibration over. And so this is a vibration over P1 with a certain number of singular fibers, which are given by the following formula. So number of the formula that belongs to Max Neutral, so that x minus C, where C is the number of the singular fibers, it's equal to K square. So in this case, K square is equal to 3, so we have 5 singular fibers. And it is And it is an old result of Manning's that actually, if you consider the linear system 2KB, where B is the base of the Konig bundle plus C, and so this system is not empty, then this Konig bundle is not rational. So, in this particular case, I mean, 2 times K is minus 4, but we have 5 singular fibers. C is the number of the singular fibers, so this is all of 1. Singular fiber. So, this is all of one, or P1 is certainly not empty linear system. So, no matter that over the complex numbers, this two-dimensional cubic is rational over a field such that Picard is equal to two, this two-dimensional cubic is not rational. So, moving along, we'll go to the case where the dimension of this cubic is three. So, of course. Extreme. So, of course, this is a classical result of Clemens and Griffiths, which tells us that smooth three-dimensional cubic is not rational. And the invariant that they use is the intermediate Jacobian, which is H21 mod the dual of H3. But actually, what they are using. They are using clearly is that singularities of the kettle divisor in this particular case, which are parametrizing the certain linear systems with bigger than expected homology, is too small. So in fact, the way this is computed is that you go to the intermediate Jacobian being Konig bundle and then using the fact that the intermediate Using the fact that the intermediate Jacobian is a prime variety associated with this conic bundle, you compute this singularity. So now you can look at this example from a different point of view. In fact, you can study so-called Plan Dog-Niensburg model, which is given by the equation x plus y plus z plus one over xyz x plus y plus z plus one. Plus one third power over xyz is equal to w and then this is so-called Lando Ginsburg model and so it has a structure of vibration of a catary surfaces, open catering surfaces with two singular fibers which are with ordinary double points and one very very singular fiber which has six components which intersect. Components which intersect in an open book configuration. So now, since the Picard group of this three-dimensional cubic, the smooth one, is Z, then this vandal Ginsburg vibration of K3 surfaces consists of K3 surfaces of Picar 19, and therefore the second transcendental part of the second homology group of the central. Homologic group of the central fiber of the compactified central fiber of this vibration is C3. So the monogramy around the central fiber acts on this Moji group and its monogram is given by the following matrix where epsilon is third root of unity. And a theorem says that in this case when X is two-dimensional funnel with X is three-dimensional funnel with P car z and which is not p3. Monodromy being strictly unipotent corresponds to the fact that x is rational. So since that's not the case in the case of cubic, we know that it's not rational. Now, of course, this is a theorem which is proven by just computing all these Lando-Ginsburg models and computing their monodrome. Ginsburg models and computing their monodromies and comparing with classification of funnels. So, in a way, it's a rather stupid proof. But I mean, I've been always interested to actually understand if there isn't a meaning behind this observation. And so, what we will do in the rest of the talk, I mean, so we will actually put all these things together, namely this. All these things together, namely this B-side and then the jump loss in the singularities of the theta divisor and this monogramy. And so we will try to construct new invariants which take us a little bit further. So of course what we know in this case also that the derived category of the Category of the smooth three-dimensional cubic has the following semi-orthogonal decomposition where alpha is a fractional collaboral category with the serfdom in power 3 equal to shim by 5. So now what we want to play with is the following observation. Let's start with a very simple example. Example. So if I take P2 blown up in a point, so this storage variety is represented by the following polytope. And now blowing down this exceptional divisor, and in fact, the whole vibrational geometry. Virational geometry of the historic variety is led by a so-called Kerici flow. In other words, the singularity of the Kerici flow precisely corresponds to these exceptional divisors. So in this particular case, of course, this Keller-Ricci flow is rather simple. So the fact that you blow down this exceptional curve amounts to collapsing the It's polytope, and so out of P2 blown up in one point, you get a polytope corresponding to the P2. So the moment map becomes a triangle this time. And of course, by mirror symmetry, we do know that this corresponds to the fact that, so the P2 blank, blown, blown up. Blown up in one point, yes, Lando-Ginsburg model with four singular fibers. And so, this blowdown of the exceptional correction described by Kiri-Ricci flow on the P-side amounts to the fact that the fourth law point in the singular point in this Lando-Ginsburg model moves to infinity. So, now, since I mean, the mirror symmetry is proved in this case, this we understand very well, but it's not proven in general, and so we. So we are kind of reluctant to use it for virational applications. So instead of trying to look what's happening in the London-Ginsburg model, so we will actually try to put the A and B side together. So now, meaning we want to consider the homology of our smooth projective variety. Smooth projective variety, and then impose on it whatever information we can get from the A side. And so this location of the single fibers is directed by nothing else but by the eigenvalues of quantum multiplication by the canonical divisor. So we want to impose these conditions on the cohomojo on the B-side and so create. Side and so create a new horse structure of certain type, which so Max calls F bundles, and then really work with this F bundles on the P side as with new horse structure. So it's a usual horse structure on the funnel enhanced with certain connection. Of course, I mean, it would be very interesting to develop. And it would be very interesting to develop this new type of horse structure with all kinds of things that we know from the classical host theory, like the generation formulas and how these things become behave in family and so on and so on. And just for a small part of this, I'll be discussing today, but of course, it's a big program which is worth pursuing since I'm sure that. Since I'm sure that it will lead to many other applications. So now, as I said, the Lando-Ginsburg model of the three-dimensional cubics looks like that. So we have three singular fibers, one very singular, and one just ordinary double points. And we have a horse diamond of the following form: 11551. And it definitely looks like a definitely looks like a horse diamond of a curve blown up in a sorry for horse diamond of p3 blown up in a curve of genus five and then a certain particular case quadric that contains it blow down but that can be recorded as a splitting of the homology Splitting of the homology in three pieces, homology of x, x lambda 0, x lambda, sorry, h lambda 0, h lambda 1, and h lambda 2. So the pieces lambda 2 and lambda 1 correspond to the homology H0 and H6. And then this piece 1551 corresponds to the eigenvalue lambda 0. This is the eigenvalue of the quantum multiplication by k. By K. And so that is the third piece. So we have this splitting, and the certain blow of formula claims that this predict actually is a virational invariant. By this, I mean that if I add additional, if I do additional blobs, this piece of the homology. Piece of the homology do not interact with the new pieces that get added by these blow-ups. So in fact, probably a better way to think about this is as false. So we consider our category and then we consider the Fubinius manifold associated with it. And then over this Fubinius manifold, we have the Comojev, our variety. Of our variety enhanced with a connection, and so we will see what this connection is in a second. So, this gives us a Higgs bundle, and then the spectral curve of this Higgs bundle consists of many components, but one of them is definitely this one, which corresponds to the quantum multiplication by K. And so that's one component, and this component is not interacting with other. Not interacting with the other components. So we have this irreducible component corresponding to this piece and others. So in particular, this component is virational invariant. So meaning it doesn't interact with the things of with the blobs in collimation two and five. So in case of dimension four cubic, Four cubic, we know that the mode is split like that. So we have one and one and H0 and H8, and then we have something that is very similar to module of a K3 surface. So in fact, we have 21 in this central point, sorry, this central part of the Central part of the of the horse diamond and our splitting of the homology takes the following form. So there are four pieces. Three of them correspond to splitting of correspond to this H0 H8 and then one corresponds to this piece which we have here and then lambda zero. And then lambda zero corresponds to this piece of topology in the center. So of course, if we go to the Lando-Ginsburg model, so it consists of four singular fibers. So three of them are ordinary Java points for this three-dimensional collabiat, and then we have one which is Which is very single. So now, I mean, so this falls from this blow formula is that, so this piece is actually, so that this splitting is operational invariant. So now, if you want to apply this observation. Apply this observation to four-dimensional cubic and get generic four-dimensional cubic and get some non-rationality. So we just need to observe that this 12021 cannot come from any algebraic surface, any algebraic curve, and certainly not from a point. So that it doesn't come from a point in a curve is rather clear since. Is rather clear since this piece 120211 cannot come from them, but it could come from a surface. Certainly it cannot come from rational elliptic surface. It could be only K3 surface or surface of general type. So now it cannot be a complicated, sorry, it cannot be a algebraic because. Algebraic commutative K3 surface since this piece has deformation 20 and K3 surfaces have deformation 19. And it cannot come from a surface of general type since all these species they carry non-commutative force structure. Namely, besides the force structure, there is a pairing. And so for surface of general type, this pairing is non-symmetric and the ones that we get here is actually symmetric. Actually, symmetric, so that's the way we want to conclude that this four-dimensional cubic generic one is motor. But that wasn't what I wanted to discuss today. What I would like to discuss is different invariants, so they have to do with the solutions of the The differential equation which I have written here. So it's d du plus u in power minus two times k plus u in power of minus one times g. So k here is the quantum matrix of the quantum multiplication of by canonical class and G is a certain operator of grading. Operator of grading. So now the proof of the fact that this printing is operational invariant actually can be, I mean, it's done in the following way, that you show that this connection is gauge equivalent to a connection with the following splitting and that. That produces the fact that indeed we have such a spectral colouring, as I have mentioned. And so that's how we get that the splitting is a virational invariant. So this numbers lambda one, lambda zero, lambda one, lambda two, and so on, we call the quantum spectrum. So the statement is that the quantum spectrum. Statement is that the quantum spectrum is variational invariance, namely, it doesn't interact with the other multiplications when you can get by blow-ups and blow-downs. But let's briefly see how this works in the case of three-dimensional cubic. So, as before, I mentioned we have the following splitting and then Following splitting, and then we also have this splitting of the derived category where the so-called Griffiths component has the following cell functor. Now, this share functor induces an action on the first piece, and so I mean, the share functor in this case is S in power 3 is equal to shift by 5. And so degree 5 thirds. And that cannot be a surf anger of luminous surface of smooth luminous. Surface, a smooth remote surface, then therefore this three-dimensional cubic cannot be obtained by blowing up of P3 in such a curve. So different proof of a well-known fact. So, I mean, the same argument works for other funnels. I mean, if you assume this globe theorem. Now, so what we would like to So, what we would like to do is to look a little bit deeper in this equation. So, we would like to look at the symptoms of its solutions. So, now this equation actually has solutions of the type Solutions of the type u empower delta one times some exponents. And so this delta one to delta n, the symptoms of the solutions of this equation, but instead of looking at the occupies, so we look at this connection only restricted to the piece H. Only restricted to the piece H lambda zero, which is well defined. If we have a funnel, all funnels have this splitting. So we restrict our connection, or if you like, our solutions, or if you like, our Higgs bundles only over the one of these pieces, H lambda zero, and we will consider only the asymptotics related to this piece. Piece. So now, if the blow-up conjecture is correct, and in the case of final manifolds, we get that this asymptotics are actually vibrational invariant. And in fact, in the case of So, in the case of three-dimensional cubic, in fact, for any final hypersurface, the formula that gives you this is dimension of x minus 2 times n minus d over d. So in the case of three-dimensional cubic d is 3, so n is equal to 5. So, if you compute, so the dimension of is 3, so if you compute this, you get 5 thirds. You get five-thirds. So, one can easily show that if we have some manifold x, which is obtained by blowing up Pn in Y, then the delta of the blown up thing is exactly equal to the dimension of Y. And so, in the case of three-dimensional cubic, so we have five-thirds. Uh, so we have five-thirds, and so that's certainly bigger than uh one. So, um, once again, if the blob formula is correct, we get that this delta one, this asymptotics, uh, being by rational invariant, uh, bigger than one, tells us that this cannot be rational since the number that we get here is bigger than one. Than one. So now the proof depends on so-called property of upper semicontinuity of this spectra, a property well established in the case of usual singularity theory, but which requires a little bit of work in the case of this non-commutative spectra. So we will call this delta one, delta n, this name, this is asymptotic non-commutative. This name is asymptotic non-commutative spectra. So now this result is different than the results that already exist for hypersurfaces. So in particular, there is a theorem of Schreier saying that if D is bigger than logarithm of 2 of n minus 2 plus 2, then this thing is rational. So, and in fact, Schreier's result is for very general. Very general fun of such a form, and I mean the result that I'm discussing here is actually not for very general, but for every smooth hyper surface with this property. So, I mean, it also gives you the case of the quadrics in P6, as you can imagine, which is not taken by. It's not taken by the above method of Schreier. So, this non-community spectrum, really, the asymptotics actually are related to other spectra, and that gives you a way of computing them. So, I mean, you can relate them to asymptotics of the Lando-Ginsburg model, but as I mean, so. I mean, so singular vibration, and so you can compute the steam spectrum of the singularity, or not steam respector of the singularity. So, you can also think of your function as a function in a fine space, and therefore this is a cone with very big singularity at zero. And so, for this singularity, you can compute the Arnold Timbridge spectrum, and it is also related to the non-community. Non-commutative spectrum, and of course, you have the quantum differential equation of given tau, it also has some two symptoms related to this non-commutative spectrum. So now there are some other realization of this, four other realizations of this spectra, but I won't discuss them today. So let's return to the two-dimensional cubic we have started with and And try to see how this spectra can help us handle this case. So, what I'm saying is that I'm trying to say here that we are getting invariants which are applicable even over fields which are not algebraic. Which are not algebraically closed. So it is well known that the multiplication of by k in the quantum cosmology corresponds to multiplication by the superpotential in the Jacobian ring. And now assume that the Picard is equal to Z. Go to that for the two-dimensional cubic, but if you go to the corresponding module, Lando-Winsburg model, this would mean that the deformation of this F, of this singularity, are going to be just some power of this polynomial F. And if you do that, they are going to be surviving, and so. And so, if you deform, you have similar singularities, which would mean that if you try to deform, you cannot really simplify them. So, mind you, if you are over the complex number and Picard is big, namely seven, sorry, this is seven, then what you are going to. Then, what you are going to get is that under with these deformations, your singularity is going to completely morsify, and you are just going to get ordinary double points after this morsification. But since here Picar is Z, it's not possible to do this mossification, and so if you compute using Compute using the theory of Bernstein cytopolynomials, you get the delta in this case is equal to five thirds. And so now if this is morcifiable, it was going to be equal to zero. So that's a different way to prove that this two-dimensional cube. Two-dimensional cubic over this field, which is not algebraically close, precari equal to z is not rational. So, similarly, in the same way, you can actually get that the cubic surface with which I have started, which get a structure of a conic bundle, namely Picard was equal to Z2. In this case, In this case, delta is equal to four-thirds, and as in the case above, you conclude that it is actually not rational. So now let me return a little bit to the three-dimensional cubic and And in our discussion, we saw that, I mean, there is an argument of proving its non-rationality by looking at the singularity of the theater devisor, namely certain burn side and certain notes. Sets associated with the tether divisor, and there was another argument based on monodromy. So now the idea of the things that we are doing is putting both these sites in one. In other words, what would like we would like to do is to combine the This monodromy and the Bruneuter losse to get some interesting invariants, and indeed that is possible to do. So we borrow some ideas from Colar and Lipgover. So, I mean, the point here is that. And the point here is that what you could do is to consider Lando Ginsburg models, or if you like, you can consider varieties where you split in a canonical way the canonical divisor. I mean, an example of this is, of course, P3, where the canonical divisor is minus 4H, and so anti-canonical divisor. 4h and so anti-canonical divisor can be split as a 2h plus 2h. And so this actually gives you a Lando-Ginsburg model, which depends on two potentials. So they have a map to C2 instead with the fiber and elliptic curve. And so now what we want to do is to not to use the quantum spectrum as a Quantum spectrum as a invariant, but we would like to use the this curve of degeneration in C2 as an invariant. Of course, we don't want to use the Lando-Ginsburg model. We would like to work directly with what is happening on the A side. And in this case, we are going to use a theory which is developed. Theory, which is developed by many people, Puro, Simpson, Liebgober. And it has to do with well, I mean, what you could do is either consider X minus these divisors or better off. Or better off take a finite covering grammified divisors. And so in this case, you can consider and define something which is called multi-spectra. So instead of this numbers that we discussed in the symptotic case, you can actually define the following thing. So take the The non-abelian homology associated with U for some covering. So, this is H1 of U with coefficients in C star. So, now there is something in this local system. So, these are local systems that we are parametrizing. And so, there is some set which is defined as a subset where hi of this local system actually is not zero. So, it here. Actually, it is not zero, so we have this jumping. So, this jump laws are very well understood in this case. They are just tori and also they are tori, which sit so they have central translation from the zero, and so this translation from zero is precisely equal to the monodromy. Is precisely equal to the monodromy. So now this structure is very much studied and so gives you some neutral polygon structure. And so this is called the phases of quasi-adjunction. And so these phases of quasi-adjunction are giving you a rather rich structure, in particular some of this non-community spectral, which I mentioned is included, but this is really much richer. Is really much richer, and you can also compute what is it if you consider a manifold being blown up. So, that if all clean, and of course, if the blow-up formula is correct, gives you a new way to gives you a series of new invariants to apply in order to study non-rationality. So, it seems to suggest that. So it seems to suggest that at least the generic five-dimensional cubic is not rational, but once again, this is very speculative for me. So, since all this theory has to be properly developed, so it applies to other cubics and certainly gives some intriguing results. So, what is would be more interesting is what is the More interesting is what is the geometric meaning of this in the case of asymptotic equation or if like non-community spectrum, what is the geometric meaning of these numbers, delta one to delta n? So how can they be defined in terms of the information coming from the category? And what is Uh, what is the meaning of this neutron polygons that we have here for a multi-potential or reflect multi-spectral situation? So, I mean, if I mean, one can actually conjecture that this is giving you, in a way, a canonical filtration of your category. And so this filtration is, in a way birational. Filtration is in a way by rational invariant, but so I don't know once again how to geometrically define these subcategories. So I mean in the case of and this can be worked out and so this is just giving a new reading I mean I mean the case of a n for And for one and two-dimensional, and this can be worked out, and so it has some connection with the work of Oblon Co Ferchende. So, in particular, so you have a connection between this filtration of subcategories, self-identification of the cubic scheme of this curve, and then this asymptotics, which I have mentioned, which in this Which I have mentioned, which in this particular case can be interpreted as asymptotics of the central charge for certain limiting stability conditions. So I would like to propose that similar things should hold in other cases. So you have some stability spectrum and also filtration that comes from it by analogy with the case of AN, but this is, of course. But this is, of course, speculation. So, understanding what this is the geometric meaning of these other numbers and how they relate to the categories is quite challenging problem. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Any questions? It's on, yeah. So, for the middle. Yeah, it's all so the middle. Um, I'll take it here. Um, what I didn't fully understand is, um, so you were saying somehow that the Haunch structure in the middle of the cubic fourth fold should be a birational invariant. And so, if it's not a K3 structure of a, the structure of a hot. The whole structure of a K3, then it's it cannot be rational. Is that correct? Did I understand this correctly? So, I mean, this is for generic cubic once again. So, for generic cubic, this whole structure has 20 dimensional space of deformations and therefore cannot come from a commutative K3. Of course, there are K3s which actually this deformation Actually, this deformation, this piece of the whole structure is 19-dimensional space of deformations, and these are precisely some of these commutative K trees that so this is a commutative K3 and this precisely corresponds to the this rational cubic surfaces that we know. So we cannot obviously prove rationality, that's not what this is designed to do. I mean, it's something To do, I mean, it's something that is an obstacle to operationality. Right. No, my question was: so, let's say you knew that it is that you have a cubic fourfold whose Hodge structure in the middle is not that of a K3. How do you deduce from that that the cubic is not rational? So, I mean, once again, so this species. once again so this pieces this h lambda zero h lambda and so on so this are by rational invariant so if it's rational so this whole structure should come by blowing up from things in co-dimension two and higher oh i see and each time you blow up in co-dimension two inter you introduce the odd structure of that out to The odd structure of that algebraic variety that you blew up, right? That's what you have. Yeah, I see. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Let's thank Lomil again. Thank you. That's it for today.
