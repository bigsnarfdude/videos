Thanks for showing up for joining. So I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this beautiful conference and also for giving me the opportunity to give a talk. So this is a purely algebraic subject. So the context is that we're interested in computing things like the K-theory of groupings or quote-unquote theory of groupings or the old theory of rings. So, just very briefly, if you don't know, explain what this is about. So, this is a ring, maybe just a discrete ring. This is a group, then we call a group ring. And I should write k-theories in the invariant of rings that classifies, roughly speaking, finitely generated projective modules up to group completion. Okay, so that's an object for study, which is part of geometric elements. The quote-de-grid theory, so this is a similar version of this algebra. So this is a similar version of algebraic K-theory, but it deals with Hermitian forms rather than just modules. So you're looking at finally generated modules equipped with a Hermitian form. Okay, and to make sense to say what a Hermitian form is, maybe the ring should have an evolution. So we should specify an evolution or at least have some coefficients which are suitable. Notion of duality so we can really talk about emission forms. Okay. And then of course there are also different types of emission forms, like symmetric type or quadratic type or something in between. Run time or something in between. And so there are some decorations here, which I think we are suggest for this purpose of this motivation part. And then also, I should say, depending on the kind of decoration we use, maybe this interpretation as group completion stuff is an accurate. So I mean there's a few more things to be said, but roughly speaking, it's about a classification of emission forms of the group retrieval. Okay? And then there's this L-theory, and this is also about. Theory and this is also about remission forms, but not on modules but over chain complexes. And there's a notion of cobaltism for these. And so this is the classification of these formation forms over chain complexes of the cobalt. Okay? And these variants show up, especially in the classification of manifolds of models persistent. Okay, so I think it's fair to say that it's a difficult problem to compute these, and one strategy that has proved to be One strategy that has proved to be quite successful is to find some kind of approximation of these objects from the left, which is some kind of excisive type, so it's easier to compute, and then to explain what the difference is. So, good idea. I mean one of the best examples that a strategy works is the Ferrari-Scholes conjecture. So it says that we can formulate it for K here, but we can also formulate all the other versions. So we might try to approximate it by some equivalent cohomology degree. So they take homology of a classifying space of specific subgroups of G with coefficients K of R. Okay, so this should be this should be a spectrum over the orbit category and it should send some R H okay and then we have Okay. And then we are taking the homology of this classifying space, so that's the classifying space of virtually cyclic subgroups. So the subgroups that are cyclic up to finite extension. And so this assembles kind of the k-theories of RH's for the virtually cyclic subgroups in a way that's computable by excision. And so quite often, this isn't the conjecture that it's always an equivalence, we don't know that, but quite often we know it's true. Often we know it's true, and in these cases, we compute these objects by kind of assembling it from easy objects of this kind of the ancient version C. Okay, so this idea might excite what's initiative. So the virtual cyclic subgroups basically come in three types. Say the finite subgroups. So the finite. So, a finite type, okay. Then there's virtually cyclic subgroups that subject onto the infinite cyclic group. And there's a type of virtual cyclic subgroups that surject onto the infinite dihedral group. So, in this recall, this is just a semi-product of C. This is a cyclic group of order 2. Cyclic group of order 2x by minus 1. And the geometry. And the geometric way of thinking about this is the isometries of the integers. And we have isometries by translation. These are the Z here. And then we have isometries by reflection and this is MO2. And then we see that if we conjugate translation by one with a reflection, it's a translation by minus one. So that nicely fits. And a different way of writing this is as a free product of two fitting groups. As a free product of the two fitting groups of order two, where the two generators here are the reflection, maybe around one integer, and then there's also reflections half integers, so that will also fix the integers, and these are the two generators. Okay, and this being said, I mean, I hope this motivates it interesting to compute these two as specific major examples. Great examples, and of course, these are kind of the easier to focus on it. Okay. Of course, I mean, this is a very old and classic fact. People have tried to compute K-theory and L-theory, maybe not so much putting theory because the funnel is well not there, but to compute K-theory and L-theory of groupings over Z and over T infinity. And let me just summarize some of the results. You just have L theory. So we might be interested in computing the quadratic L theory of R. So quadratic means it's about quadratic forms. So that's just the wrong polynomial ring. And it turns out that one has an assembly map. So I can again use kind of this strategy to approximate by something. And the sum thing is the homology of the circle, of which this is the fundamental proof with coefficients in R. And so we see the L theory of R and a shifted copy of the L theory of R. Copy of the L the R. And so secretly, I'm here taking the Kahooni localizer in our theory, and we find a map here. And this is an equivalent so that the shame is splitting. Yes, I was mumbling that, but maybe it was not loud enough. So there's this there's different versions of L theory, and yeah, I think the probably localized thing, so that's the equation mindset. Hope you look at that sort of thing, so that's the question by technically. So, on the whole talk, all of these variants are code? Yes, I guess so. Okay, and order. In this case, we can again try to find some kind of homological approximation. Epsilon larger, yes. Yes, thanks for the comments. I tried to do my best and please continue to remind me if I forget again. So, we can again try to approximate by some more homological term, and so this is. And so, this is probably a good idea to decomposition. So, this suggests that we should approximate this by the L-theory of grouping over C2 and another copy. And this taking short already is R. And so we have some homological approximation of this kind. Of this kind. And it's a fact that this is always split bonon. So it's not an equivalence, but it's split bonon. And it has a profile which people call a union group and so-called union groups. So that's called hell. And so this is kind of a homological approximation, but this time there's an error term. These are the unil groups. May I ask a homological question? I've heard that term unil for 35 years now or so, but I don't know what the U in U nil is referring to. You and who know is referring to. Does anybody know? Unitary, I believe. Where is unitary? I mean, forms is about unitary matrices rather than TLN. I believe, is this correct? But L groups are from the special unitary. Okay. So it's result of this kind. And then there are. Kind. And then it turns out that these union groups, which are kind of error terms, are related to the error terms over Z, but not here, because here there are no error terms. But there's a different way of writing down the L C of a group ring here, because as I said, we're talking about emission forms, so we need to specify maybe an evolution on the string. And so Z has two empty automorphisms. One is given by taking sending. Taking sending n to minus n, and the other one is just the identity. It just gives us two different evolutions on this term. So we might also try to compute the L-theory of this other involution in terms of some homological approximation. And so this is due to Vanitsky. So let me write it here. So, and here make it clear, like this. Clear like this. So, if I don't write anything, usually it's common to take the group ring and take the involution of the group ring, which is induced by the canonical anti-automorphism of the group, so G to G inverse. But that's not always the case. So, I mean, this is the other case. So, there's again some kind of homological approximation, which takes the form. So, this time, So this time we just have two copies of the L theory of R mapping to the L theory of Rz. And this is again some kind of homological approximation. And this time there's an error term. And the error terms that arise here are precisely those up to a factor of two. So there's two error terms which are equal to each other. And they are both given by this one. So that's so that there is such a split monomorphism in the description of the of the fibers into Ralitski and then together with Connolly we prove that error terms are the same up to a factor of two. And this is the Neolin theorem from the title of my talk. It relates kind of error terms of homological approximations for these two groups. So there's this group here, and there's an error term, and there's this group here, and there's an error term in the creation of the factor of two. This is what people call the helium spring. And there's the question? The question? I was wondering what twice means. Two copies, two direct sum copies, yeah. And actually, so there's a similar result in K-theory. I mean, K-theory, evolution doesn't play a role. So we only have two of the three. One and three are kind of the same. And we have some thing here, it has an error term, and there's an error term, and there's also an Okay, so the goal of this talk is to find a generalization of this to quote-unquote theory, which is theory, which kind of combines K-theoretic and L-theoretic information. And at the same time, also generalizes to kind of more general setup, where maybe you can have a good rings instead of sort of one ring, so ring spectra instead of discrete rings and stuff of that kind. Okay, yeah? And I understand correctly that for regular few. I understand correctly that for regular theory, the unique banished by the section? No. I mean, not in L-theory. I mean, no, the uni groups over Z, for instance, so they also compute just the Ernst Sherman for R equals. Computers the Ernold term for R equals C. And this is done by comparing to the symmetric theory where they vanish. Well, number one and number two look like assembly maps to me, but number three doesn't look like assembly. We come to that. So I mean this is one of the things, I guess. Okay, so I come back to what I was saying before. So we are also going to reprove these theorems with the modern techniques. And I mean, at least to me, it seems that things get. At least to me, it seems that things get cleaner and simpler. For instance, you can clearly see that this is some kind of homological approximation, which is really not so visible in this formulation. Like that, yeah? I mean, generally, I mean, as you can see here, kind of T infinity is a quotient of C in some sense. But it's a Homotopy theoretic sense, so I mean the more Homer topy theoretic framework can help with these questions, I guess. More questions? More questions? Okay, then I should briefly review setup for quote-unquote theory and K-theory and L-theory. Oh yes, so our result also reproves everything for K-theory and L-theory. And they relate by something that isn't cost control. Who is V? Ah, good question. So yeah, so So I let me write before the sign. So I'm hesitating a bit because act is the actual formulation of the results. I guess, I mean, are not at the moment you to me, but I mean, we have spent lots of time talking about it. And so does it that Jim Davies came to see at some point in Augsburg and he spent quite some time and LPR SUA, who is my PhD student, also involved in that. So I guess in the end, he's not John Paper. Guessing this is okay, but um, so if there's anything about the formulations, no, I kind of find the responsive guy, I guess. Okay. Yeah, thanks. So, I should spend a few minutes explaining the framework of good debit theory that we're working in at the risk of. We're working in at the risk of boring some of you, I guess, but I hope still that others find it interesting. So, the framework we're working in is this framework of quantity categories. So, quantari categories. Can you read that over there? Or is it true? Yeah, okay. So, quantari category is a stable and thin category C. And what about the functor which we call copper? Well, functor, contravariant functor from C to the Hallikov spectra satisfy certain axioms. And so maybe let me not try to explain it further, but discuss an example. So good example of a stable energy category is let me take three derived. Let's take three derived categories. So this is about chain complexes, a finite chain complex of finitely generated free modules. And there's some notion of homotopy, chain homotopy, and this forms a homotopy theory, which is kind of forms this infinity category. So that's a stable infinity category. And so this functor copper, once you think of this, so this takes now as a chain complex, it gives us a spectrum. But like not because we already know what is what a quadratic or Hermitian form is, but kind of by definition, copa of C would be the spectrum of Hermitian forms and complex. Okay? C is the spectrum. One more question. So these what did you need terms? Um you said that it is activated. You say that in calculated in examples for in what sense? I mean it's call it Z Z Z and then you see N. So it's a proprietary picture and it's zero. And it's zero quadratic. So these are the error terms that occur here. It's zero and zero and I guess it's infinite and it's some group. I I don't even know it's precisely known, but it's of exponent 4 and it's not trivial. Have you thought about Have you thought about improving these kinds of not by now? Yeah. I mean, I think there's probably little little to add to that, except for kind of I mean this is basically you compare quadratic to symmetric which Andrew could do and then makes a computation symmetric case. Okay, you say well we can kind of do present the kind of computation in a cleaner form or something like that. But I mean these are classical rings More questions? Okay, so let's come back. We have this derived category chain complexes with the notion of chain homotopy. And then we have, well, depending on what type of emission form we think about, we have different such coppers. So standard choice, I guess, would be copper of such a chain complex C. It's like, well, we take So R should to talk about remission forms. Maybe it's a good idea to stick R deal with the resolution. Okay, then R becomes the module of a R tensor R by multiplication by ring elements from the left and conjugation. Ring elements from the left and conjugation by look at ring elements from the right, then we can look about form from here to here. So, this is what people call remission forms, and then we can mod out of the C2x, which comes from here and flip here. And so, this is a, this was what we would call the homotopy quadratic forms. So, this is the one that appears. Or we could also, I mean, we don't even need to. Also, I mean, we don't even need to assume that R is something with evolution. It would be good enough to have coefficients which have such an R tensor R module structure, and it's good to send evolution. So, we can also look at something like that and this is a model. Call this module, invertible modular evolution over R. So this is the kind of object that we need to be able to write down something like this. So it needs to have an R and the R action, and it needs to have a duality, which fits the two R actions. And then we need some invertibility condition to make this really important correctly. From current category. And this has to do that. I mean, this is not just about transmission form, but it's actually about unimaginative ambition forms, that is. You're able to say that something is not known as a conventional form. And so there are other examples. So this could be really quadratic forms in the homotopy third sense on chain complexes. If you want to be closer to algebra, I mean we might look at the genuine form. Might look at the genuine file, for example. And so, it is then a function spectra. And so, this is kind of universally extended from functional projective R modules, spectra, which are really groups. So, there's some kind of extension process here, and over Here, and over productive R modules, we just can talk about classical quadratic forms, which are those form abedian groups which you can do at spectra. And they take this tension, so this would give us a general quadratic form. So it's really precise. So this one sets P should off and then actual actual Actual quotients, so the actual T2 quotient of this abelian group. What kind of extension is this? You can't extension quotient. Yeah, there's non-abelian. I mean, there's a unique quadratic extension of this functor. Non-abelian project. What is the F in DF again? Sorry? What is the F in the DF? Free. We're looking at free chain complexes, chain of free modules. We might also look at chain complex of projective modules. Better if you include crotch R into D F in my control. Ah, thanks. Thanks. Good point. Okay. And there's also symmetric versions, for instance, where 20 of x parts here and x parts here. So it's a good model, place conversion. It's symmetric connection model. Okay. Okay, so this is our basic input and I explained some basic examples of interest. Now I need to explain that such a thing is a duality. So it's one paris that you automatically inherit the duality from this function copper. Functor copper and so to explain this. So we can extract from this function copper a cross effect. So that's now a bi functor, bilinear functor. So here you secretly that proba is pointed, so then this is the retract of this. So then this is the retract of this, and we can form the quotient. This is kind of the deviation of the linear. And by the axioms on copper, which I didn't write down, this is a y-exact functor, y-exact in each variable. And it may or may not be represented by t. And part of the axioms here is that it is represented by t. And this gives us a functor the copper of From C or to C. So everything is encoded in this. And in our examples, we can try to see what it is. I mean, if you make the computation, then you see that this cross effect of this functor here is functor, is the same expression, but without this. So we're looking just at bilinear forms and not. By linear forms and not which are no symmetry of project position. And it turns out that duality, I mean, you can almost use of them in our example. Duality R O R sends So home R from C into our coefficient module. And because the coefficient module is an R tensor R module, this has a residual R action object. So that's the usual duality, right? I mean, this is how this is R, and it's just maybe R is commutative, then this is just a usual duality there we have. And now, in this setup of concurrency categories, we can form these functors here. So cut P is a category of bonkery. Category of Bonkarie categories, I roughly try to indicate what a Bonkarie category is. There's a notion of morphism of Bonkarie categories, which takes part in this definition of this category cut piece. So what is a morphism? A morphism is just a morphism of the underlying categories, together with a rule on how to assign forms from one object to forms over the image object. And then you need some condition that this remains duality preserving. That this remains to relative to certain. And this forms this category here. And so on this level, we can form these three factors. And in our example, we just get back what we had here. So K-theory does not really does not depend on the copper, it just depends on C and you see Prince K-theory of R. K theory of R and L theory, the free version. So maybe, I mean, yeah, these are for the experts. This is the one where I cannot see our power quadratic. That's the Hanitsky's quadratic L theory. To get the variance you restrict the input category. You restrict the input category. So I think there are two things which you should not try to confuse. One is when you talk about free and projective, so that's the input datum. And there's other decorations like the S, which we cannot view at the, I mean, we cannot try down something here to get the L S version, so the simple version of L3. So that's possible. So that's a difficult process. But yeah, if this answers a question. What's the output output in that category? Which of the one of the classical L theories, like L P? I'm talking about the L theory input. Aha, so probably I was just contradicting myself. So I said we always take the fully parry I mean we took always the localizing thing and then it doesn't matter whether we write f or p up and it's l minus infinity. And it's L minus infinity. And it's the non-connective state. So you don't get the decorated versions out of this or something like that. Yeah, we can recover that. So it's kind of built in the machine, but I mean, it's not. Yes. I mean, everything is in the end encoded, and we can extract it. But I mean, not just plugging this into this function. There is a function where you can there is ordinary Ethereum you can plug in projective Yes, or the perfect derived category, then we get projected and then put it in other invariant digital constructors. This communicating signal said, get n minus infinity. Yes. Okay. Interpolate between all of those. Yes, but we cannot do simple. That's what I was trying to say. We can still extract it, but not by plugging in a certain category to this function. And since I said at the beginning, I always want to get this. Said at the beginning, I always want to look at this Karubi variant things. So this does not see I default in completion. L minus M to be functional, the difference between F and P. I'm going with flow. And it does, I should put some names. So, this is Quills K theory, right? This is Hanitsky's Paul theory, and this is Louis, like this. And then we can do it theory. And now we should take the genuine quadratic thing to get Kahui's quote-unquote theory. So Kahui has a definite quote-unquote theory. I mean, it's just a group completion. It will mimic queries construction. It's a group completion. But I'm not media. And so this is an awful project to find this and explain this equipment. And so there's another paper which I have to talk and it's also part of my. Okay. So, in this sense, we recover these classical theories here by plugging in these Poincaré Kaliosin factors. Okay, and now we kind of begin this world. So now we want to form group rings, right? And group rings, I mean it's a ring-theoretic construction. I mean it's a ring theoretic construction, which we now have to replace by a category theoretic construction. Of course, tensoring, which we also could use or I might offer, work. So tensoring is like a categorical analog of passing from a ring to the proof ring. Passing from a ring to the proof ring. Okay, so the input is a stable. Let's first start with stable finte case and I figure category. And then we may form, well we'd like to form the product, which is not a good idea because it is not stable, okay. For instance, For instance, if I might be just S0, then C times S0 is just two copies of C, which is not stable. For instance, we cannot take the direct sum of an object here with an object here. So, but there's a universal way of fixing this, and this is what the tensor constructor is about. So, there's a universal function. Constructor is about. So there's a universal functor which is exact in this variable for each i, which makes this extra infinity category, and this functions universal with this property. So this is entering. It wants to do this, but it cannot. So we just kind of universally fix this. Okay. What would you get out of this, bro? Yes. C plus. So here it suffers kind of performing the access various sums. And so maybe it's a good idea to discuss another example. So we would like to take V times Vt. I mean, here this problem of not having direct sun disappears because Vg only has one object. But still, it's not a stable category. And it's tensoring, and you can look at Tom spaces. So I think that so Tom spaces, well, I mean, let me explain. Let me explain what so this only has one object which is called star so this is star com C C D and then I function so I take kind of a cool. Group ring over this whole thing. But of course, I mean, yeah, that's what it is. Maybe the following notation is a check, suggestive to emphasize the analogy of group rings, and then you can already kind of see what the composition is, right? I mean, we have so these are we think of this maybe as like formal linear combination of group elements with morphisms as coefficients and then uh composition is what we need to be. Composition is what we need to be. Yeah, we multiply the group elements and compost and composition. Okay, so from this formula we derive that derived category of R and we tensor with BG. So that's equivalent to the derived case of the group. Derived case of the grouping. Yeah. And here it's important that we take three modules because, I mean, kind of the functor from here to here is essentially surjective. You cannot get more objects that you already had here. And this is why we cannot, I mean, if we have projective modules over R, we don't get all projective modules over RG. That's just the logic one. Okay. So this is tensor construction, and there's also a mission version of that. And now we need some more talk. What exactly is this construction or do you fix? Or do you fix one such example? This construction, what a universal property is? So this is stable. Functa is exact. So for each fixed i, object i, the functor from here to here is exact. And it's universal as that property. Thank you. And here we see that doing this construction for BG kind of increases the morphism by G. Okay. If we have such a functor, a radic functor, functory category, we can also universally extend this to the functor under. On this tensor construction, and it may or may not be Poincaré. I mean, this is a functor, but it may or may not have the properties of being Poincaré, but sometimes it's Poinkery and then we get a new Poincaré category. I is Poincaré. Sometimes, for instance, I mean Sometimes, for instance, I mean if I is a group I so if we plug in PG, we get a new Poincaré category and this gives us a new Poincaré structure on this here. And actually, if this is a group height, then we can express this. So, let me write down a couple points. Then this C x copper x we can write as the co-limit of the constant diagram over x. So the way of thinking about it is just to take the co-limit of the constant object. Okay, let's see what this gives in our example of interest. Example of interest in our example so R the quadratic thing and take the tensor with B G. Well, it's R G as we already discussed. And the quadratic functor, so maybe let's take some M, would be the quadratic functor, coefficient M G. And for genuine quadratic functions, it may or may not be true that a similar equation holds. So G, if I put here G then. Have to put here Genering quadratic. I can ask whether this is the Chenring quadratic. And sometimes it's true, sometimes not. Okay, and so I should say how this is, what is the evolution on MG? Well, it's the Kubring evolution that we evolution well M by M G bar is M bar G plus. is M bar G plus. Ah, and then I wanted to mention that this Feral-Chaus conjecture for the K-theory of groupings has a generalization of the K-theory of this tensor construction. So we can take with our function. We have our functor, which may be K-theory, or L-theory. And we take the tensor construction over orbit category and virtual cyclic subgroups. So this is evaluate C, we first take the tensor with virtual cyclic subgroups, evaluate our function on that, and there's a function there, C of E G. And this is sometimes like And this is sometimes like quite often a trajectory, always. So, this is a generalization of the Caucasus projections, categorical setup. So, the names here are, I guess, the I guess. So they did they proved that the Ferris conjecture for K-theory and this I continued with this and discussed the version of putting well discussed version of Putin theory. Okay, so this provides further motivation to study this kind of object. Okay. In part four of the Neinhorse project, we study the Grotoni-Bit theory of the tensor with BZ. So we're studying the case G equals infinite cyclic group in part four, which is not yet too minimal. We study G equals T. G equals C. And we compute the K theory, or putting with theory, or L theory. C equals E. And so in this case, yes, again, a homological approximation. Yeah, I need a bit more space to the left. So, the homological approximation, I think it's fairly easy to see what this is. It's commuting the tensor construction with applying the functor. So, that's precisely the assembly map. Here it's kind of transparent that I mean we can either apply the tensor inside or outside it as a method of comparison map. So, that's the assembly map, and this is flit bono, and the fiber has an expression in terms of some new categories. Categories. F is GW. F is GW. So I mean this works for all functions, set-functional localization theorem and GW is kind of or maybe some you can apply K theory also here or other things. So this is split mono and the And the arrow term is expressed as the Counter-V theory of the hyperbolic category of some category nil C, which is associated to C. So that's a stable infinity category. For every stable infinity category, we can universally make it a to Poincaré category. I mean, it's a free or equivalently the co-free Poincaré category generated from this table thing category. And we can write down this expression that's done. Or that's the theorem, then this is the error term of this hypothetical error solution. And in particular, if you apply to L theory, so this applies to any functor having these properties, in particular L theory, the L theory of hyperbolic theory, which is zero, so in this case the arrow term is zero. And then it's an equivalence, it's just affected L C. It's just effectively L C dimension and hyperbolic categories from it. And this way we recover the chain isn't splitting. Yes. Okay, so what I want to do now is discuss the case of the infinite dihedral group and relate it to the case of the kinetic geek group but with a different evolution. So we should discuss how we get the different evolution of this construction, yeah. And so let me recall, I mean generally Oh, it's that you have a duality just anti-comphomorphism of order two, then well, whenever we take such a coefficient module for emission forms, so a module with module with involution over r, then we can form Then we can form MG, and this inherits the structure of a modulus evolution. And we need to see what the evolution is. Well, it's the formula I just wrote down, I guess. It's still there. Yes, it's this formula, but right now the evolution is generally just G bar rather than just G versus in a specific case. Okay, and so we need a categorical analog of that construction. Okay. Okay, and to do this, we can observe that we can tensor such a Poincaré category not only over spaces but also over genuine spaces, categorical analog. So there's a category. So, it's a category of genuine C2 spaces. So, this is the genuine C2 spaces describes the homotopy theory of topological C2 spaces up to equivariant GCW complexes, I should say, up to equivariant fivalance. And so, the things that we need to remember according to M. The things that we need to remember according to MDO theorem is the homotropy types of underlying space and the homotopy type of fixed point and the evolution in a just in a homotropic gradient way. So the definition is functors on the orbit category of C2 pre-G on the orbit category, so it has spaces. So this category is rather small, right? That's G mod 1. Is rather small, right? That's G mod1 and that's G mod G, and that's a C2 action here, and it's a morphism here. And then a pre-sheaflow, we have some space here, which is kind of the homogeneous type of fixed spikes. And then we have a space here, which is an equation compatible. So that's a general situation. Space. And now to write down such a functor, I just need to prescribe it on the base category of the pre-sheaf and then extend on the inverse. And then extend it to a certain way. So I just need to know where these two options, I mean, what this diagram is sent to. And well, this diagram here is sent to the hyperbolic category of C, and here sent to C. And so if C is a quantary handier, it says a canonic evolution, C2 action, and Okay, and things are in such a way that if I have just a space, I mean a space I can always consider as a tendency to space by taking a constant diagram. And if I plug in the constant diagram into this construction, I just get a functoric. Ah, and I should remark. So the underlying category, so Poincaré category is a category with a functor and the underlying category of this tensor ring, the x, only depends on the underlying space of x and the underlying duality, so the duality on this table. So, the duality on this tensor ring only depends on the duality on the space x, but not on the x by x. Only depends on the C2x. Right, so we have kind of three layers here: we have the underlying category, then we have the duality which is encoded by copper, but copper is even more. Is encoded by copper, but copper is even more information. So there are three layers. And these three layers are reflected by the three layers of such a space. Well, we have the underlying number of each time of the space, and you have the quality on the space, and then the general refinement. Okay. Now let's put this together. If I have now a group with a duality, then the classifying space of the group admits a genuine refinement. G, let's say B G, we can do as a space generated C2 space. So the duality on G induces a C2 action on the classifying space. And I mean, sorry, the easiest way is to. So the easiest way is to say that it's a classifying space you can write down, I mean, functorial topological space with a C2 action. And this has an underlying genuine C2 how much of the time. What are the fixed points? The fixed points, I mean, yeah. Well, I take the fixed points of G under the duality and then I'm not out. G action, where I G action where I act by conjugation, by this. I mean, conjugation in the sense from left with G and from right with G bar. G equals X, and I can change all its fixes. Okay, and then let's take C. I mean, C has two dualities. One is just inversion, the usual duality that any group has, and that's S1 as constant Chenins. As constant chaining space, then I can take the other duality, which is the identity, and I can take it as sigma representation sphere. So the S1 with this action topological space with C2 action and this is chain Z2 space that expands are just two points. Okay, and now I can. Okay, and now we can compute what happens if we plug in these pieces here. And our running example was derived category and some quadratic or genuine quadratic functor. And if I tensor this with a category of Guanity in this sense, then I get back, well, the underlying. Then I get back, well, the underlying category only sees the underlying space, so this is again RG modules. And now it turns out that in this case, we're getting quadratic or changing quadratic emg all the time. So this construction also gives us the changing things. And now the duality on empty is, of course, vital intelligence. Is that something doesn't preserve the genuine thing? Now it does what's the difference? Is it general? No. I mean, even if we take the standard velocity on G, this genuine classified space might have different fixed points. As the formula here already tells us. But if G has so if you take if we take G with the usual duality, then the fixed points are the elements of all the two. And if G has elements of all the two. G has elements of all the two. And this is and yeah. So this also proves that the genuine functor is preserved by the ordinary tensor if GS no elements for at all. Okay, so let me state the results. So we take a whole bunch localizing functor stable infinity category. Okay, and so things to keep in mind is W, but I mean, as already before, we can also take K No. And then we have fiber sequences. So, I first treat the case of the tensor with S1, which we have already discussed and is not new, but I mean we have a slightly kind of different description, which of course in the end will turn out to be the same. But the terms that arise look different at first sight. We take the tensor, so it's just FOC plus suspension of F of C, okay? And here we And here we have an error term which I call, let me take again F of hyperbolic, so I articulate this in this form of some category NIL C C C okay so F Okay, so F. So this recovers kind of the old fiber sequence, which you've already seen from slightly different formulations. So the categories that arise are slightly different. But I mean, I write it so that it kind of becomes uniform with the other two cases. I'm going to write that off. So here let's look at F of C as sigma. So again, starting with B Z with the other involution. So again, So again, there's an assembly map which takes this form. And if you think about it, this is F of C plus sigma F of C shifted by 1. So we can shift the Poincaré structure just by 1. We apply suspension to copper. So this gives a new Poincaré structure, and then we get this decomposition of the stone. And so then we just finish. And so let me just finish writing down the theorem. So we have a map which goes from here to m which covers the open case. So there we get just L of R plus L of R. And because, I mean, and the ball is an invariant function, it turns out that I mean sigma and one here it cancels off. And the error term is ah, the error term? I mean, underlying it's, yeah, just put up the error term. So we have two. So we have two basically the same category here, but the duality is different. And this twice. The other thing I did is I don't want to write F hip of hip C. Uh yes, I guess I want, because this category is big, it contains only two copies of C. I have an inclusion of hip C into that. And just the way I have to go through that. And just a way have to go to that fault. Yes, so this is bigger as a category with you considering an architecture. Yes, F. So again, curb C maps into Neil. I apply F and I take twice that. So this category has an intrinsic concrete structure. I can apply F to that. Okay? And then And there's a third one. So we might try to compute that. And well, we might approximate it in the way we have discussed by writing T infinity as a free product of C2 and C2. So this can only convert from here, and there's an error term, and the error term is precise. There's an error term, and the error term is precisely one of the two columns of that. So that's the new theorem saying that F E C C C divided by F C is also a fiber sequence. And it shows that the fiber of this homological approximation is just one copy. I mean, these the fiber of this homological approximation is two copies. Okay, I should stop. I think so. Okay, I should stop. Thanks for watching. Thank you. Further questions to all of them? What is nil C C C? Yes. Can you make nil C D E? So let me explain that. And aha, so I mean, and maybe I just can make some comments also. So Nil C C C, that's an explicit description we're looking at. Explicit description, we're looking at the fund category. Again, maybe first puzzle: what are the three variables? I mean, here at the moment, it's just a formal notation, I think. But I mean, as you can see, I mean, much of the work here is to say something on the difference between these things. So, this has to do with, I mean, we can write this as a push-out, and then it's a push-out canonical map from F of the push-out. Yeah? And so, my PhDs. And so my PhD student, Andreas Huber, is kind of working on a general theory for that. Okay, so that's one comment where you can describe put outs of conquering categories in a good way, and then you get some general error terms. And it's like this is a specific case of that where we don't rely on this big theory. I guess we can just make outward arguments. But it boils down to the same thing in the end. So this is maybe one of the comments I want to make. And I can still write down this category if you're interested. Down this category if you're interested in. And I should also make a comment that Marcus, I mean, he has addressed a similar question with Tave on pushouts of stable infinity categories. So this is kind of contained in here. And so this is, but the method is quite different, I think. Not quite different, but it's different from the one that has this one uplift. Yeah. Yeah. In the classical theory, there was a Classical theory. There was a connection between these two calculations by recognizing that the group ring of the infinite cyclic group sits inside the group ring of the infinite dihydra group. That's a quadratic extension. And when you take the involution on the big one and conjugate it, you get the trivial involution on the cyclic curve. So there's something called a twisted transfer. So this theorem then would be a special case of a proof. Yes, but I mean actually the proof is even simpler. So we needn't consider transfer here at all. Yes. Given by something like... Yes, so I mean we can go down by passing to quotients and going up by stating transfers. That answers your question. So I mean you wonder how this relates to this? So it should be kind of induced by a certain map or something like that? Yes. And I mean there's obviously Yes, and I mean there's obviously a map from so we can take C2 quotients. Ah, and I've worked on some it's good that we discussed this. I forgot something, some important fact actually. So here the quadratic structure is a different one, and it's only the same if this is quadratic. So here we take always the quadratic. Here we take always the quadratic. Doesn't matter, I guess. Doesn't matter. I guess you will take always the quadratic function on this category, no matter what this is here. So this fiber here is independent of the linear part. And in the quadratic case, it agrees with this. So sorry, I was running out of time. I tried to make it fast and forgot to mention this. So that's an important fact. So, I mean, if you want to go from here to here, you should take quotients. But I mean, as sigma, we cannot take a quotient and go to sigma. But in the I mean in the Kanitsky setting there is a well-defined map from S sigma to infinity and this includes a map from here to here which is the map and you can also go back using a transfer. Answers your question? Any questions for Wolko? Well just a very naive question. So the map one is a kind of the right-hand arrow is an assembly map of An arrow is an assembly map of sorts, right? Is it wrong to think of the map in two, the corresponding, as sort of like taking homology, the assembly map where you take homology with twisted coefficients in some sense? The circle is given a twisted coefficient system in the homology theory, in sort of like F of C. So maybe, but in a genuine sense, I mean this is genuine D2 homotopy theory. Right, right, right. But it's like a twisted coefficient. Maybe, yes, yeah. Maybe yes, yeah. I guess I mean it's a honorological chart. Yeah, you decompose this into objects, assembled topics, but it's a decided to make an image of sensors. So it's like a it's sort of a twisted version of assembly now. Yes. Well I think thank you all for having good.
