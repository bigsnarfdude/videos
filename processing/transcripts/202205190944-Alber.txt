Okay, can you see it? Yeah, all right, thank you. So basically, I'm going to talk about two projects. One is recent. Another project on Sudamonuserichinoza, we worked with a lab of Joshua Schrout from the University of Notre Dame, with a focus on explaining how models can be. Explaining how models can be calibrated using specific experimental data and what kind of predictions can be made using models. I'll try to give some examples. So I'll talk about specific models which couple multi-scale cell-based models of bacterial motion and then with some models coupling with some models of fluid and fungi growth. So let me start with Sidomon. So let me start with Pseudomonas a reginosa. And we were working with a strain which is kind of similar to one which can be found in patients, actually which causes so much problem in hospitals. It's four times drug resistant nowadays. We're running experiments at Notre Dame. So this one wasn't taken from a patient. So, but behavior is Behavior is very similar in this strain. So, first thing to mention about Pseudomonas regimosa, and we studied swarming of Pseudomonas aeroginosa on agar. Its behavior depends on whether or not agar is soft or hard. So, it depends on the amount of water present in agar. And as you can see, the differences in how it spreads. It spreads and with enough what actually develops this fungus, and that's what we kind of studied in detail. And we kind of tried to show that bacteria actually takes into account physics. What we noticed initially in experiments is on soft agar with enough water, where we realized that. Uh, where we realized that uh, after iniculation, the colony grows to a certain size and then it kind of spills out through fungus. You can see them in this experimental images. And what's interesting that bacteria kind of lags, most of it, behind, and then it starts propagating in rings. And you see it kind of this fungus spilled out, and then secondary fungal. Out, and then secondary fingers are formed. And then they get populated by bacteria and they go all the way to the tips. And we call them fingernails. And then the process repeats itself. It's a very actually efficient way to colonize surface or colonize organ, and so on. They go in all possible directions. And they use actually the control amount of kind of surface tension. Kind of surface tension of the fingernails, let's put it this way. So, let me mention a quorum sensing mechanism for this bacteria. So they're called Ram lipids. And these REM lipids can be also viewed as very small particles. So they accumulate on the surface of water and then they change surface tension. So let me just get through these images very carefully. So initially, Images very carefully. So, initially, after inoculation, not much happens. Bacteria just sits there, they divide if they have enough nutrient, and then they start producing this remlipids, quorum sensing. And that's very well studied in Pseudomonas eriginosa. And then these remlipids are used to extract water from the substrate. So you see that the blob of water goes up over the colony. Over the colony. It's very small initially, and then it spills out. These fingers are formed, and then that they propagate very quickly. So, what we focused on was kind of developing a model which would based on macro scale, as much as we were able to do that. And then we were trying to match our simulations with micro-scale data, like average speed of propagation of bacteria. Also, we wanted to. Also, we wanted to figure out the mechanism of formation of the wave and wave propagation. So, the monster gymosa has matility mechanism based on flagellated motion. So they're elongated. At the same time, they kind of have pili4, which play very important role in propagation of mixabacteria, the same pili. Just till this specific study, people Till this specific study, people thought that these pilates were just hanging there. They're very long. Bacteria wasn't observed to use them kind of actively as opposed to mixer. There, PLI4 is one of the main motility mechanisms, social motility. Here, just hanging. There, if you look at the bacteria, it kind of hairy. So, we figured out that sometimes being hairy is kind of... Sometimes being here is kind of important. So, this is the description of a multi-scale model. So, we developed so-called sub-cell element model for individual bacteria. Bacteria can be stretched, can bend, and also we introduced pili as a specific kind of distance from bacteria when they kind of might align if they overlap through that. If they overlap through that zone, and actually they might slow down even. And then this was coupled, and we assumed that bacteria would move with the same velocity. And we tracked them in experiments, and this is what they do. This bacteria doesn't reverse under conditions we considered swimming conditions. There is no chemotaxis involved. And so we developed thin film approximation for Navier stocks to model what happens at Talks to model what happens at the fingernails, where the layer of water is very thin. And the results were published in two papers indicated here. And also, we also kind of had a sub-model of diffusion of quantum sensing signaling. All right. So, these are basic equations. Are basic equations. H represents the height of a very thin layer of water, and we take into account so-called Marangoni-driven instability, which was observed before in physics. If you just take two types of oil and put one of them on top of the other, it spills out with fingering. But what's important here, it's not a liquid, right? It's a liquid suspension, bacteria moving. liquid suspension bacteria moving fluid and which is even more interesting they produce they extract fluid themselves by using ramblickers so and this is a squorum sensing model and the model for bacteria involves representations of each bacteria using a certain number of nodes connected by springs adhesivity if they get too close to each other is represented by certain potential Represented by certain potentials, Morse potentials, equations describing motion of individual nodes, Langerian equations. Again, come from physics. And these are the different forces employed. And there is a motor force kind of representing action of a flood cell. So the basic sub-cell element model was introduced in our paper in 2009 and the one for The one for flagellated bacteria was introduced in 2011. All right, and this is what we figured out. We made prediction about level of alignment of bacteria in different parts of population. So, and which tried for different levels of alignment. And the mechanism is based on kind of PI4. So, we kind of assumed that bacteria would get close. Assume that bacteria would get close to each other, the PLI4 would just get entangled with each other for two neighboring bacteria, which would slow them down or keep them aligned for a certain period of time. So PLI4 are not actively appirated by bacteria, but they're kind of passive. But there are quite a few of them all over the body of a bacteria. So we took this into account. We're able to reproduce the right concentration of the wave and actually velocity. Of the wave and actually velocity of wave propagation, and also got the same rate and length of all this fingering, so on. So, and we tested the level of alignment. We predicted in different parts of the cell. So, A, B, and C on top, there's a simulation, kind of pictures. C is liquid with some concentration of cells, and B, I think it's a REM lipid. It's a REM lipid, and A, it's just a combination of several components. And sure enough, in this finger, so close to the level of alignment orientation correlation measure we used actually is the highest. So region two, yeah, let's look at like so in the center, which is this kind of brownish one. Kind of brownish one, the level of alignment is pretty low. And region four, it's a blue one, it's pretty high in magenta. So that was a kind of confirmation, expansion creation of prediction, and we suggested mechanism for wave propagation and film grain. Okay, and then we started decided to look more into Philippe, and we started playing with July 4, we started playing with different Newtons. So, this is a collaboration with Joshua Schrout's lab at the University of Notre Dame. I should have mentioned this from the start. It was funded by R01, NIH RO1 grant. So, in his lab, he and his students were able to get, we call this bacteria super swarmer. So, we were able to show, well, to study them, but bacteria without pillars. Study them, but bacteria without pili. Of course, they also had mutants with pili partially extended or like smaller pili, and we looked at them as well. But the difference between wild type and superswarance without pili is very pronounced. So you're looking at this kind of colonies, and you see that you see the sphinders here on the left, wild type, and superswamas, they go all the way. And supersworms, they go all the way, populate the whole area. So we looked at levels of alignment and wild type, they kind of keep distance between themselves. You don't see Pili, but they are there, actually keeping them apart. So it takes them time to align and move forward. And the super swarmers actually just shoot out. And so this comparison level of alive. This comparison level of alignment between wild type and mutants without pili, and we mixed them up. We just wanted to see which one is going to win. And winning means getting close to the kind of faster to the boundary of the population, because they're depleting nutrients very fast. So the first who gets to the boundary actually wins and survives and so on. So some buttons. So, some mutants are in green, and wild type is in red. And you see that at the swamp edge. And we looked at the different mixtures, right? 1 to 10 and 1 to 1. So, 1 to 1, actually, they win, no question about that. They take over the edge. You see the green cells, and they're very well aligned there because they can get close to each other. And here, one to 10, still they kind of dominate it. So, so what? All right, so we decided to see how they would respond to an antibiotic, all right. And this experiment with wild type, and this is kind of a group of supersilomas. So the fact that they have P L I without obvious kind of function was a puzzling question, because everything is a result of evolution, right? Everything is a result of evolution, right? Why bacteria with PLI4 prevail, and that might this might provide a partial explanation. So in our simulations, actually, if you expose them to antibiotics, and we took into account kind of slowdown of bacteria in that case, they start using the API4. They kind of hold hands, okay? Hold hands, okay, and they stop and they don't die, the wild type, at least for this specific toxin. Super swamps, they jump in and actually go in and populate the whole area and die. You see, they reached the toxic agent and so on. Of course, what happens actually they slow down and that they've been around. I think that this bacteria have been around for like a billion years. Like a billion years, they experienced toxins before. So they scan the genome, find the right response, and if they're given enough time. So ability to slow down, not to run too fast, actually saves them. They have enough time to figure out how to deal with it. And super swarmers, yes, they get to the food fast. They die every time they get exposed to toxic. To toxins. So, this is our explanation based on the role of PI4, which is not obvious. So, this multi-scale model was multi-scale, right? Because we looked at what individual bacteria does and how it does it. But we didn't look into like subcellular processes on the modeling side. And recently, well, recently, over the last two years, we've been Two years. We've been involved in a project with PNNL and other labs from DUE Department of Energy and studying interaction between fungi and bacteria. And we developed models at smaller scales, and I'm going to talk about this very soon. And we basically looked at two types of interactions. Types of interactions, so two examples of interactions. So fungi Asperlagos medilans and bacterium bacillus subtilis. And also the main focus of our research is on Lacaria baikala and bacterium Pseudomonas florescens. And I'll tell you more about it. So this bacterium fungi, of course, live in soil, and there is kind of There is kind of in a symbiotic relationship, and they actually help each other to prosper. And the way I have on this slide, so bacteria supplies thamium, and that actually helps hyphae to grow individual parts of fungi. And then fungi produces another chemical, threhalose, which is helpful to bacteria. Actually, it's a nutrient. So there is a chemotaxis involved. So that there is a chemotaxis involved for this bacteria. And what it's even more interesting for what bacterias actually they oscillate. So way back we looked at oscillations of mixa bacteria and in our group. And of course there were quite a few very interesting talks in this conference on oscillations of mixa. I'm talking about oscillation of these two bacteria. And I'm going to show that. And I'm going to show that. So these experimental movies from this paper published in 2020 in Life Science Alliance, where they tracked individual bacteria bacillus moving along functions. They oscillate. If you look at one of them, it changes direction of motion, and the question is. And the question is: why it's beneficial for them. And then that's like microscale. And on the right, you see the whole network growing, I mean, fungi growing, and it's populated by bacteria. Bacteria is very active, kind of moves all over, and it aggregates certain parts of the developing network. And what's important about function networks to understand it's a leading kind of It's a leading kind of population of cells and they grow at the tips, but at the same time they branch. And branching mechanism biologically is not very well studied. So in our model, we kind of looked at experimental data and we have a probability distribution function of having a branching point for a specific high, specific moment and time of its growth. Of its growth. So let's talk about this fungi. And this is how it looks in the experiment. And we grow them. Our collaborators, of course, are growing them. Grow in agar and in fluid. And later we would like to extend our studies to soil. And soil is a very interesting environment because there might be enough liquid there for bacteria to move actively. To move actively. But if there is not enough liquid, then fungi kind of grows in all possible directions and it might actually grow in the direction of a specific kind of colony of this bacteria. How they do it? It's not quite clear. Well, partially because bacteria produces certain chemicals which fungi needs to prosper and vice versa. So you see, we look at very high resolution. You see, we look at very high-resolution images, so you can see individual hyphae and how they branch, and then we will kind of go kind of move away from it and take like macro-scale pictures, and we can look at like rate of spreading of the whole population. This is a simulation. We have a 2D model at this point, which can be extended to 3D, and this is a detailed diagram of. Detailed diagram of actually metabolically driven growth model and branching model for hyphae, individual hyphae, and for the fungi. And let me just mention the metabolic part of the model. That's the novelty of the model, basically. So we use Michaelis-Menton-Monad equation type. And monad equation type representation for uptake of nutrients, glucose in this case, which is absorbed from the environment. So we talked about three different types of environment, right? And then we use similar presentation for internal metabolism. And we assume that 10% of the glucose is used to produce cell wall materials, which is driving growth at the tip. Growth at the tip, but there is a transport part. You need to transport this glucose or products of glucose, sell wall materials, production-based components to the keep. And so there are some other kind of sub-models discussed on this slide. So I mentioned that they get transported, they can get transported. They can get transported through cytoplasmic streaming and increase in volume due to the tip formation. All right, so this is a simulation. You see that individual, well, first of all, you start with very simple geometry and then topology changes, right? So more and more branches are formed and it's interesting, branches. It's interesting, branches can get close to each other. They never link for fungi. But then we spend a lot of time kind of getting it to work for a very large number of hyphers and just taking into account how they compete for course when they get too close to each other. And the way we calibrate the model, it's by looking at the very edge, the experimental snapshot I showed you. We have movies and looking at the movie. Have movies and looking at the rate of kind of growth of the whole network as well. So, next step for us is coupling model for bacteria. And model for bacteria is similar to what we used for pseudomonocerigenosa initially. And we made some assumptions. I'm going to show some simulation just for the time being. Just for the time being, so we assume that fungi growth rate is much slower than motion of bacteria. But we're going to take into account chemotactic motion of bacteria. In this simulation, we assume that Rehalus, which is kind of chemotractant nutrient for bacteria, is produced alone, homogeneously alone each hyphae. Along each hyphere. And then we assume a presence of liquid layer near the network. And this is run by a very simplified model of metabolic activity in bacteria. And that's another kind of novelty in the model for us. We take into account what the surface tension and low viscosity close to high term. So these are experimental movies which we use for calibration. So on the left, So on the left, there is no fungi and there is no chemotractant. But you see that bacteria actually reverse the direction of their motion. They've been tracked. And you can just look at your favorite bacteria and they stop and start moving in the opposite direction. And the way they do it, they start kind of propelling launchellum in an opposite direction, basically. So this movie is what they do in the presence of a Do in the presence of presence of a fungi, so it's not growing. So, where initial simulations are related to very short periods of time, but they you see they get on top of fungi and they're attracted to it. So, tracking individual bacteria and say looking at frequency of the oscillations. Oscillations, in many cases, it's an indication of chemotactic motion. Motion, even without presence of a chemotractant. But model initially needs to be calibrated using that kind of situation. Reversal, this is what they do, takes a lot of energy. They reverse because they basically usually kind of expose to chemotractant. So, mixer uses the same components for the For their reversal as other bacteria, chemotactic bacteria. So, mix is not exactly chemotactic, but it does reverse. So, presumably way back, they were chemotactic, but then they kind of rewired these components for a different function. And that was discussed in some talks, right? They form these clusters and it helps them to stay together, they're called packs, and they move together. Packs and they move together and they resolve also traffic jams inside of highly packed colony using these reversals. Here, there is a chematant present, and this is how they find fine fungi. And they reverse. Okay, so that's the basic model. It was first introduced in this 2020 paper by this group and lambda star. And lambda star is a frequency of reversals. Lambda zero is reversal rate in the absence of any chemicals. So that's the one we calibrated by just looking at this movie here, by tracking dozens, if not hundreds of bacteria. And then we were able to match it to experimental data. So usually track hundreds of bacteria and then we track maybe another hundred. And we track maybe another hundred. So the first kind of data is used for calibration. The second one, we're kind of double-checking whether we predict it right under certain conditions. Okay, so this is our simulation. So you see fungi there, and fungi is producing chemotractant everywhere, and bacteria kind of starts moving. Starts moving mostly along. But keep in mind that fungi is kind of enveloped in film film, water. And the difference in viscosity between like medium and this area close to fungi plays a difference as well. And they can aggregate on fungi, start moving around, and it becomes kind of motion, one-dimensional motion on a In 2G, because they're moving mostly along hyphere, and then they accumulate. And they accumulate at the branch points and the tips. And we're comparing outcomes of these simulations with what we see in the experiment. So once again, you see taxing to the high-phase in the liquid environment with some assumptions we made, and taxing alone high-fear. So, we recently introduced a real chematactic network with metabolic components for individual bacteria. And this is what it is and how we represent it. There is a logistic function representation for certain responses. So, it's a receptor module and adaptation module. And so, you see all the different components inside of a cell here. Inside of a cell here. And that kind of model, once again, I want to reference what was introduced first in this paper. We just adjusted it to our model. So we kind of put different components together and were able to calibrate the coupling and looked at the whole outcome. So this is a simulation of the case. The case with a metabolic chemotactic network present, and here we assumed that production of chemotractant is dominated by production at the tips. Biologists really don't know, but it's one of the hypotheses we are testing. And actually, I do aggregate at certain points. And we're kind of testing the level of aggregation on the simulations. Simulations. Last thing I want to mention is we recently kind of realized that Sidamona Seriginoza, and this is a paper, recent paper in PNAS, actually can use their flagellum in a more sophisticated way, as opposed to just rotating it one direction, the opposite direction. They actually can wrap it up along the body. Along the body of a bacteria. And this is Pseudomonas originosa. And we're testing kind of this extension of hematactic motion in our simulations to see why would this be beneficial for pseudomonas aerogenosa. So in this talk, I gave several examples how we try to use experimental data to calibrate the model and at the same time actually how to make predictions and test them in experiments. Experiment. So, future work involves modeling bacteria in liquid on agar and in soil, and actually developing metabolism sub-model and calibrator. Thank you. Excellent remarks, and maybe I'll start with a question. So, Marika, Ruben is talking in. Marka, really nice talk in general all aspects of it. So I was wondering, like, sort of you think that you are trying to incorporate like also molecular details in your model, like metabolism, like molecular model metaxis and stuff. So I'm trying to understand the motivation for that. Is this complexity for the sake of complexity just because you can? Or were there particular failures of more phenomenological model that motivated you to go deeper? To go deeper. And on the reverse side of it, do you have enough sort of molecular data or enough parameters measured by experimental collaborators to really constrain those more sophisticated models inside of your model? So the first part of the question, the answer is this is funded by the Department of Energy. So Department of Energy is interested in new Is interested in new types of energy. So they want to grow a specific type of crop for ethanol or other purposes. And kind of encouraging bacteria to interact more with fungi needs to be considered in the symbiosis with the roots of plants. So if you stimulate fungi, then using bacteria, you can just inject bacteria there, for example, and you know. There, for example, and you know how much bacteria you need to use and provide a certain environment, and the crop is going to grow better. The second answer, calibration. So, molecular calibration is not easy. So, we set up the whole bunch of experiments at Oak Ridge National Lab. I just want to mention that. So, it's a lab of Dale. It's a lab of Dale Pelletea. Well, we kind of in liquid we introduce different levels of hematant and we try to calibrate activity of the bacteria. So do they move fast or do they reverse fast and so on. So we're kind of changing levels of nutrient and we hope to be able to calibrate model that way. And then, so we have like we'll be collecting data for very small. Collecting data for very small changes. So we're looking at sensitivity of our model to signaling, let's put it this way, in controlled experiments. We also hope to kind of to couple what we developed for liquid and agar cases with kind of general setup developed for roots, soil, bacterium, fungi developed at Lawrence Bettle. Developed at Lawrence Bethlehem Lab. So computationally, they are superb using supercomputers. We're using computers at DOE, of course, but still we're getting into detail of this specific symbios and it will be hopefully coupled with the growth of a large network in soil. So that's a real interest to you, actually. So, Mark, I have a question that's kind of follow up on this question. So, if you can go to this slide, I believe it's 23. I think that's kind of related. I'm also very curious as well. The lotion is that, so the level of details of the model in terms of the collective function that you care about. So thank you very much. Yes. Yeah, I thought the simulation is fascinating. So one of the questions I was having when I was looking at this slide is the scale, for example, the number of bacteria. The length scale of these patterns is not, I guess, if I think about the bacteria size as a measure, this is on the order of. This is on the order of hundreds of microns, the overall simulation. So, is that the length scale? If you mentioned some of the collective function of the fungi and bacterial symbiosis for some of the plant function. So, is the scale of these dynamics generating some behavior that's critical for the collective function of this microbial community? Right. Right. So, so this setup is only for calibrating the model. Okay. So, and this is a reasonable number of bacteria we observe on this part of a kind of network we grow in experiments. It will be scaled for like tens of thousands of bacteria on big GPU clusters, hopefully with the help from Lawrence Berkeley group. Berkeley group. This is for studying for calibrating signaling sensitivity. Let's put it this way. And mechanisms involving fluid, microfluid. So number is reasonable. And there is a question of coarse graining. So sub-cell element, it's a coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation. So we're also looking at how many nodes to use for each bacteria. To use for each bacteria, and that's an important kind of scaling question on the modeling side. But once again, this is just for kind of calibrating model kind of locally, but then that hopefully this will be rescaled, introduced in a bigger computational environment. Yes. So for the collective output, so what are the metrics of this dynamics that are most directly relevant to Relevant to the overall function. So, I understand this is calibrating of the model. As it loaded, this is super time-consuming. Even you have to use like supercomputers to do these simulations. Right. But for this simulation, next step is just to couple it with a model for growing fungi. Okay. So, bacteria kind of being close or on moving along fungi results in themselves. Fungi results in them supplying certain chemicals which helps fungi to grow. So if they accumulate at branch point or accumulate at the tip point, that has a very pronounced impact on the rate of growth. And that's what we hope to do. We might want to produce some mutants, which would be faster or would produce more of the same signaling. More of the same signaling. We just don't want kind of to introduce a little monster which would just get out of sync with fungi. So at this point, we're kind of testing that as well. But the goal is to see how they benefit each other. And we're going to introduce, of course, division into the model. And we've done it before, pseudomonas are genuine. Pseudomonas areigin was a also we're kind of on scientific side we're interested why why actually reversals are important now when they settle to move along hyphere they actually jam very in a way very similar to what was observed in mixobacteria and in order to unjam they need to go and then maybe just that and then they can bypass each other we see traffic jams all the time in experimental models Thank you very much. And let's thank both speakers of the morning again and go for some lucky.
