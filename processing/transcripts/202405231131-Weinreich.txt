Because I've learned a lot. I really feel like the level of discourse this week has been superb. I want to share a new work of ours, which feels kind of simple, but also kind of important. I would say our contribution is largely synthetic. But in Brandon's language, I think it's maybe an exciting instrument with which to examine a whole suite of biological phenomena that I find very interesting. Phenomena that I find very confusing. I'm particularly excited because many, many people in this room have worked on many of the things I'm going to talk about. So let me begin by kind of breaking down the title and then we'll go from there. Setting the stage. What does my title mean? Noise for me is our random fluctuations in some quantity over time. Phenotypic noise are random fluctuations in some organismal property over time. Dismal property over time. And although noise is random, its statistical structure can be influenced by genetics. So I'm interested in how natural selection regards genetic alternatives that influence the statistical structure of phenotypic noise. And borrowing or extending previous usage, I'm going to define these as modifier allegs. I'm trying to convince you that what we all had thought modifier alleles are can actually be described this way, and it opens up some new domains. Up some new domains. I want to also just take a moment and point out that when I say statistical structure, I don't only mean the variance on some scalar quantity. So for example, the evolution of pleiotropy, statistic, which if you think of mutations as generating noise, then the noise has multiple dimensions and that structure is well within squarely in the scope of language. And you understand that kind of And if you're interested in that kind of work, in my view, Richard Watson at Southampton has really done some gorgeous groundbreaking work. I'm going to motivate the talk with two examples, one of which probably needs no introduction, Rich Lensky's long-term evolution experiments. So in 1988, Rich started 12 replicate populations of E. coli. He grew them in glucose-limited media. He diluted them 100fold, continuous, or acolytes continue to dilute them 100fold every day. Glucose-limited media. Glucose-limited media and asexual bacteria. That's really important. So, here are the demography. Here's the demography within one day. It takes about seven generations to recover from 100-fold drop. This has been going on since 1988. That's about 12,000 transfers, 75,000 plus generations. What happened? Well, fitness went up. We shouldn't be surprised. Darwin told us it would. And I want to point out, though, that fitness starts out by going up pretty quickly. Starts out by going up pretty quickly, and then it's slow. There's a lot of opportunities for adaptation early on. It's a new environment. Somehow, things are slowing down. What else happened? Mutation rate went up. So this is Paul Slingowski's landmark nature paper. What he did was to measure mutation rate in all 12 populations along with the ancestors at 10,000 generations. He used a fluctuation test against two different assays. And so these are the populations. So these are the populations, and what you can see is that three of the 12 have elevated mutation rates, and each of those assays went up by between 10 and 100 of the assay. More recently, Ben Good, when he was with Michael, sequenced 1500 strains out of this experiment along every lineage at suitably spaced intervals. And he did a lot, a lot, a lot of work. This is an early figure from the paper of Times, the x-axis. Y is the number of mutations. Y is the number of mutations relative to the ancestor in each of the 12 populations. So the slope of these lines is something about the mutation rate, selection going on as well, but roughly it's the mutation rate. And so you can see that by 40,000 generations, six of the 12 replica populations had decreased the mutation rate. These are the same data, but he's expanded the y-axis. This is a max of 100. This is a max of 3,000. You can't even see the non-mutators. But here are the six mutators. Non-mutators, but here are the six mutators. And what I want you to notice is that for most of them, the slope goes up and then slows down again. So we see the evolution of increased mutation rate and then the evolution of reduced mutation rate. And this actually is very much like Jon's a naive reading of what happened experimentally. Jon describes this. Why did mutation rate go up? Why did it go down? Because of indirect selection or second-order selection? What happens is because. Not a selection, what happens is because these are asexual populations, the mutator can produces, that particular cell discovers a mutation rate, increasing mutation, and its progeny may have beneficial mutations. And because the system is asexual, selection acting on the correlated, statistically associated beneficial mutation increases and brings the mutator with it. So that's shown here. Time goes from top to bottom. Each row is a generation, each line is an individual. Generation each line is an individual. So, this individual has a mutation that increases its mutation rate, and there's some possibility that its offspring will have a beneficial mutation in the same genome. I don't mean to suggest that mutators have higher beneficial mutation rates. Most of the offspring are gandilatriase mutations. They're swept out of population. But selection is a sieve that's very, very good. So, we're entitled to focus on the rare occurrence when the mutator has a beneficial mutation, modulo drift to all the beneficial. Modulo drift while the beneficial mutation is rare, it's going to increase and carry the mutator with it. And so we say beneficial mutation drives mutators to fixation by genetic hitchhiking, or I would say the directly selected beneficial mutation drives mutators to fixation by indirect or second-order selection, mediated by this permanent statistical association between the mutator and the beneficial mutation. The same mechanism works just as well in reverse. So now we can regard the red dot as an anti-mutator. The red dot is an anti-mutator, a new mutation that has a lower mutation rate, and the green boxes are all the wild-type alleles that didn't get mutated, while the high mutation rate neighbors, forever in, were getting killed. So, yeah, vignette number one. The next vignette is quite different, and it's something that I hadn't really appreciated to be a system that can fit into the same framework, but I think it is. And that has to do with noise in gene expression. To do with noise in gene expression, so these are data from Olin Seelamber when he was a postdoc with Mark Ackerman, two names we should add to the list. XX, so what Olin did was he took about 1800 of the native E. coli promoters and he bolted them to a green fluorescent protein gene. And then he could watch each member of this library, ensembles the cells for each member of the library, and measure the distribution of fluorescence. And that's what's shown here. Oh, I bet it's this one. So, for example, this promoter called Bro has fairly low expression and very tight distribution of expression levels. The x-axis is expression level, the y-axis is density. This one has higher expression and really wide distribution of expressions across genetically identical cells. These are all the data for 1800 promoters. Now, the x-axis is the mean and the y-axis is standard deviation. The y-axis is standard deviation. The two quantities are positively correlated. What I find interesting is there are lots of pairs of promoters that have the same mean expression, but different variances of expression. This is another example of heritable control of phenotypic nodes. And now you may all be thinking, but almost all of you, because Gunnar wrote the key paper, indirect selection can generalize to your thinking, but there's no statistical, no permanent statistical association. Happily, Gunnar wrote. Happily, Una wrote this paper. Una wrote this paper when she was with Josh, in which she considered a simple simulation, the two allele model, A-bearing, big A-bearing parents faithfully transmit their phenotype to offspring. So here's the phenotype, which is, let's say, fitness. Little A-bearing parents faithfully transmit their phenotype to offspring with probability P, which calls the memory. But with probability 1 minus P, they transmit a new phenotype. Speed, they transmit a new phenotype drawn from some distribution like this. Okay, so what happens? She did thousands of simulations. She injects a single little A varying individual into a population that's otherwise big A, and she lets it run until it's fixed or lost. The x-axis is the memory parameter P, the y-axis is the fixation probability real. These are finite stochastic populations, so the benchmark is the reciprocal of the population size. That's the probability of the thing you fix. Size that's the probability the thing would fix if it's neutral. And in fact, there are a very strong signal of indirect selection favoring the high-noise little a allele. It goes up with persistence. So when persistence is one, we're back to permanent association, but it works very well for much more modest levels of persistence. And it goes up with widths of the distribution. So putting the kind of So, putting the kind of Snigowski-Garish Sturdovet model together for mutators, which have a permanent association with this kind of work, we can kind of imagine this phase space, the rate of noise production on the x-axis, the persistence time of association on the y-axis. There are the asexual mutators. Here's ONA's paper, fills in the gaps. On Monday, Oren pointed out that indirect selection can work with no persistence ifsoever. Work with no persistence if selection is stronger than fitness proportion. So here's a nice paper where it uses truncation selection and you don't need any persistence, these jackpot fields. So you can see where we're going. You can see where we're going from the first slide. I want to now kind of start with this sort of synthetic idea that we feel we can articulate. The first point we want to make is that there are two classes of modifier loss. Of modifier loci, we would suggest there are two classes of modifier loci: those that act during the reproductive process and those that act during the developmental process. And the first or the zeroth question that one would like to ask, given some evidence of noise, some system is, is it heritable? So, here is the thought experiment or experiment experiment you might want to do for any genetic. Do for any genetically, any genetic influence on noise during reproduction. You take one individual, you let it reproduce a bunch of times, you get out the offspring, you sequence their genomes, sequence their mitochondria, you make an inventory of every mRNA, the state of every ribosome, all the proteins, you get all the genetics, all the epigenetics, the methylation, all that stuff, and you make a distribution. And this individual has got some putative modifier of the oblique. Putative modifier allele big A. Here's one with a putative little A modifier allele in the same exercise. The distribution looks different. That means there is genetic control on the structure of phenotypic noise. And the one on the left, we would describe as a high-noise allele, and the one on the right is a low-noise allele. And here's a laundry list of things that we've all thought about that are examples of this. I gave you mutation rate, of course, recombination rate, sexual versus asexual recombination, ploidy. Combination. Ploidy, this includes the kind of work that Sally's group has done asking what proportion of a life of the lifetime should an organism spend in the haploid phase. Segregation distortion is here. Epistasis and dominance is here. Non-genetic inheritance. I should say, I should preface each of these with modifier of, modifier of segregation distortion, modifier of epistasis, modifier of non-gelamic inheritance. Is that right? Inheritance. Is that all? Genetic influence on noise during experiment, a slightly different experiment. Now I get a whole bunch of individuals that are genetically identical at the zygotic stage. This is a twin study. I recently heard a paper from a student of Patrick Phillips, in which they examined hundreds of genetically identical sea elephant swarms and measured all these fitness traits. It was just organs. This is what they did. They've got these zygotes, they let them go to adulthood, and they measure their fingerprints. Measure their fingers. You do the experiment on another allele, you do the same experiment. This distribution is somehow noisier. This one is less more entropy. This one is less noisy. And here are some examples of this. Gene expression noise, which I've already shown you. Protein promiscuity, like the kind of work that Shelly Copley pioneered, the same protein can find to multiple partners. Protein can find to multiple partners in a kind of promiscuous or way. Fold switching, which is an idea that's been advocated by Lauren Porter, where the same protein has two comparably stable states that have different physiological activities, transcriptional and translational error rates. Robustness, that's both environmental robustness and genetic robustness, can be under genetic control. Diversified bethedging, which is kind of the other side of robustness. Like, either I'm Robustness. Like, either I'm really locked in and I'm robust, or I'm kind of all over the place, which can be beneficial. It's a form of reverse like that hedging. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability to sense signals from the environment, migration, et cetera. So I should say though, that I want to say though, that this partitioning is probably not ironclad at the hot pool the other night. Um, hot hot cool the other night, uh, Johan tried to convince me that migration is really a modifier of reproduction, not a modifier of development, and he might be right. And Sally's work, completely, Sally's work in particular on how much of the life cycle should be spent on a hyperplicate phase kind of breaks the framework entirely. And nor are these examples mutually exclusive. So Jan's thesis was on stress-induced mutagenesis. Was on stress-induced mutagenesis. That's a sensor, that's plasticity in mutation rate. You can bolt these together and maybe look for new combinations that either we've already recognized or haven't even mentioned. So now let's try to pull these threads together and develop a toy model of what the population genetics of phenotypic noise might look like. So, thanks very much to Troy for showing. So, thanks very much to Troy for showing us this figure this morning. This is, I think, not going to be particularly controversial. This is meant to be the frequency distribution or density of selection coefficients acting on new phenotypes relative to the most common phenotype. So, other things being equal, you might expect that there'll be a few phenotypic variants, few variants that are induced by noise, phenotypic variants that are induced by noise that are beneficial, but most of them can be coupled serious. Most of them are going to be calculus, but organs are pretty high, pretty advanced, pretty adapted. So, on average, I suggest, and I'm not rocking anybody's world, that indirect selection will disfavor high-noise alleles, regardless of the system. On the other hand, indirect selection will occasionally favor high-noise alleles because occasionally there'll be some opportunity and it doesn't even need to be permanently associated. The high-noise allele will get a little. The high noise allele will get a little bit of a lift. Oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to explicitly articulate a really beautiful piece of Juana's results. When we think about a beneficial mutation being pushed to fixation, there's a growing lineage, and every member of that lineage enjoys the advantage. But when it's not with this shorter persistence time, there's a growing lineage of high-noise alleles, but only a few of them in any one generation are enjoying the advantage. Are enjoying the advantage. Their children are going to resample the phenotype and may well be SOL, but their cousin will have the opportunity to resample phenotype so that the way that this thing spreads through the population in a kind of genealogical way, who's getting the winds is dispersed over that reach. The balance between these effects depends on phenotypic distance optimum. This is where the reduction principle lives. The reduction principle lives. If the organism is on the optimum, you don't want any nonprofits. But the distance from the optimum will, in turn, be sensitive to the rate at which the environment is changing. So depending on where your politics are on that question, you may find this more or less interesting, or you may find that you might imagine that your intellectual get more traction on high notes. So here's my Joanna moment. I gave this talk last fall. I gave this talk last fall, and she said, Dan, this is in the appendix of Altan 1942. It is. He writes: Intense competition favors variable response to the environment rather than high average response. And then he does something that we can't do today. Were it not so, I expect the world to be a much younger place than it is. Okay, so it's all repetitive. It's all repetitive. I actually, how am I doing on time? I do want to claim at least one genuine novelty, which comes from my student Eugene Raines, who was studying the evolution of mutation rate. And what Eugene discovered is that this asymmetry, this asymmetry, means that indirect selection or second order selection that's favoring the high motor wheel has a different sensitivity. Wheel has a different sensitivity to population size than does indirect selection that's acting against the high north. So I won't spend a lot of time, but this is the key result. Population size on the x-axis. Y-axis is the normalized probability fixation. So this is the neutral benchmark. And high noise alleles can fix by drift, but that gets harder as population size goes up because that noise is important to detect it. Up because that noise is more detected by natural selection. High noise alleles, and this isn't totally asexual, sorry, there's no permanent association. High noise alleles can fix by hitchhiking, but they start out at this tremendous disadvantage relative to a neutral mutation because, in speaking of mutator terms, the beneficial mutation rate is like 1%, let's say, of what the neutral mutation rate is. So they're getting killed at small population sizes. Eventually, though, they'll. Eventually, though, they'll and we call this sign inversion. It's to me, anytime something happens that's bizarre and heterodox, I get excited. I don't know of too many other cases where the response is a population size that's not monotonic response. Although, I posit it'll be true for every modifier. Okay, last thing, I would like to develop a cookbook that lets me go out in nature and find a system that of phenotypic noise and try. That of phenotypic noise and try to figure out why do we see the amount of noise we see. First thing we better consider is mutational bias. And this is also actually, this is another Hectitre who pointed me in the direction of this literature. The first thing we need to do is think about mutational bias. It's not a symmetric mutational model. In some systems, it's probably easier to increase mutation rate and just break the proofreading apparatus. So mutational bias probably pushes in the direction. Bias probably pushes in the direction toward high-noise alleles. On the other hand, it's probably, it seems to be easier to go from sexuals to asexuals mutationally. Asexuals are the low-noise allele. So the polarity here is going to be system dependent. We need to think about direct selection acting on the energetic costs. So the two examples I just gave you have the same characteristic. More accurate proofreading is costly, but asexual reproduction is But asexual reproduction is sexual reproduction is also possible. So you can go in both directions. Direct selection acting on correlated consequences. So higher mutation rate maybe shortens the time to look at the genome, which maybe is rate limiting in some microbes. It doesn't even matter what the quality doesn't immediately at least matter what the quality of the genome is. And then finally comes the question of indirect selection. So an exemplar of this kind of work is Mike Lynch. Of this kind of work is Mike Lynch's drift barrier hypothesis. So, Mike's looked at the mutation rates across all of life. There's a range of population size, you know, it's 10 to the 8th, whatever. And the correlation between population size and mutation rate is very strong. Negative large population species that live in large populations have lower mutation rate, presumably because indirect selection is favoring the lower mutation rate because most mutations are deleterious, but selection is weaker in smaller populations. Weaker in smaller populations. Okay, to summarize, I define modifier theory as the population genetics of alleles that heritably influence phenotypic noise. Indirect selection acts on modifier alleles via direct selection on realized phenotype. Another hat tip to join on, I guess. The amount of phenotypic noise in the species may reflect mutational bias, direct selection, and indirect selection. There's lots to do. Okay? I'm just going to close and touch on the theme of education. On the theme of education and outreach, that the society is also committed to, and oh, acknowledge my co-authors and some funding and close with another project of interest perhaps to some of you, which is my new textbook in population genetics. Thanks to several of you in the room who gave me really excellent feedback on the manuscript. My kind of pedagogical motivation was to capitalize on opportunities that math provides. Math is a wonderfully extensible language that you use. Extensible language that you use to teach. But you don't have to know the math to get the biology. If you're interested, ask your library to buy a copy. If you want a copy on your desk, I'll send you one for free. Whatever. There's a rattom list on the MIT Press website. Don't send your students into the book without sending you a copy. That's my feel. I've already given all my things. I know, yeah. Yes, so still, for the evolution of the gene expression, noise. Yeah. The matters of the arguments are still linked to environmental variability or genetic variability. Still, we see so much noise. So we see so much noise within go away fast. I didn't understand the first piece of what you said. So most of the reasoning why we explained there's so much question points is still related to arguments about environmental selective differences or in Or in environmental variability, then the gene expression diversity becomes adaptive, or some mutational argument of, I guess, there's genetic diversity that explains the variability. But in isogenic individuals, stuff suggests that there is failing and that there is. Failing, and then there is so much noise, it doesn't seem to cool away. But so, I mean, you're doing the key experiment, I think, which is to regulate the kind of noise and see what kind of genetic response there is on the control of that noise, right? I would say the reason why, I mean, putting aside genetic variability, like genetic polymorphism, which is not this at all, but. But imprecisions somehow in moving from the newborn's genome to the phenotype in any particular realization. Sounds like what you're saying is why is it out there in nature? And my answer is because environments are variable, indeed. I don't think we're in the reduction principle regime. Am I speaking to your question? Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm just puzzling why, because it's. why because it's such a huge amount and so why is so why is so inefficient recipe that's like the fascinating question for me but i guess i would dis i would be willing to take the argument that that noise is not an inefficiency but i want a cookbook joanna has a study where she took the lynch Where she took the Lynch premise that noise should go down working on translational noise, right? Transcriptional noise. So she has a paper where they said, well, if transcriptional errors, mistranslation, transcriptional error. Yeah, which is which is noise. Yeah, sure. You can tell me what the noise is expression. Okay, right, right. And in E. coli, whose population size is larger than. Whose population size is larger than these? Noise, transcriptional error rate is higher. Why? Like, we need to. Well, she's actually working on the cookbook, but this is an example of, that's why I said lots of work to do. That helps. Other questions? We just have. All right, let's thank Daniel Scan. All right, we're a little bit late this morning, so maybe let's just start the afternoon by that work.
