I'm sure you would have pronounced it perfectly. Thank you very much, organizers for the opportunity for me to speak here, to be here. So my title is Group Actions on Our Buildings. This was because I sort of gave a preliminary title, an abstract. But actually, what I'm going to talk about is two specific questions. So, one is on local global fixed points. Global fixed point theorem for groups acting on buildings, and the second one is a tips alternative for groups acting on buildings. And specifically in the context of our buildings. So I will, as I don't assume everybody knows what buildings are, I will start with buildings. I will start with simplicial buildings. These are the more commonly studied ones. They were originally introduced to study linear algebraic groups, to provide a geometric context for them. And they are simplicial complexes, which are a union. Which are a union of uh subcomplexes, and these are called uh apartments. And there are three uh axioms: the apartments are Coxker complexes. We already saw a couple in Anne's talk. The second axiom tells you that you have lots of apartments. So whenever you have two points, then there is an apartment containing them. And the third axiom tells you that you have lots of automorphisms, namely, if you have two apartments A and A prime, and you A prime, and you take simplexes A and B in their intersection. This might be empty simplexes, so this also works if the apartments are disjoint. Then there is a isomorphism from A to A prime. People were right that these boards are not at the right height between A and B So the right height. Point-wise. Okay, so basically, it's a union of Coxer complexes. There are a lot of them, and there are a lot of examples I'm going to work with. One of them is the A2Tilda Oxster complex. So it's a tessellation of the plane by equilateral triangles. Triangles. So this is the Coxter complex for the 333 group. And one thing which we might use, well, which we will use later, is that if you look around the vertex, if I look in the link, I see a hexagon here, or I should see a hexagon, at least. I forgot something, but I should have drawn it here. I see a hexagon. So this is then a Coxster complex of type A2. So in the Dinking diagram, you can put your The Dinking diagram, can you put your finger on a vertex, you get the corresponding spherical Coxer complex. And so the Euclidean building is a lot of these things glued together in a suitable way. They arise algebraically, for example from SL3 over the Beadix. So now I want to say the difference with our building. So B So the one-dimensional R buildings or the R trees, which I think most of you are familiar with. And so the difference between the R building and the simplicial building is that here you have a discrete translation group and it branches at discrete points. So typically, if another apartment comes in, it will, for instance, like have a half space. It will, for instance, like have a half space in common and then it will branch off here. But it can only do that at discrete points. With the R building, you allow your translations. Translation group can be even the full isometry group or any kind of isometric subgroup of the translations. And they have a metric definition. So typically you give yourself a metric space X together with a family A of injections from Rn into this space. From Rn into this space. So these are your, these Rns will be your apartments, which are mapped in. And they are subject to a couple of axioms, which are quite long. So I will just give a description. So we have injections. So A is this Rn. They inject into X in a way In a way compatible with W. So, W is the isometry group here, which consists of the isometries which fix this, together with the translation, which might be a non-discrete subgroup. You need to do that. These injections need to be compatible, and that will allow you to define the distance. If you map these things in, you can talk about the distance in an apartment, and because you set it up, you can define a distance in the building because it will be independent. In the building, because it will be independent of the apartment at the points of container. Yes. What are this very graphic A and that's a family of injections? And X is a metric space. This is Rn. Yeah, like it's Rn with this which you're going to map in, this apartment. I don't want to write it all out because it's going to take me too long. Any two points are contained in an apartment. That's a reminiscence from before, so like that you can define a distance and then there are two more axioms which are a little bit more technical. I will omit them, I will not reuse them. But the main thing to remember is that it can branch in discrete places. And so here. And so here. Does it have to be the same Rn? Could it be R2 and R4? No, no, it has to be the same one. Here, you can also view this as a metric space, and these are metrically complete. For instance, the Davis organization. So here there are a couple of issues, so they are not necessarily Metrically complete. And you might say, well, who cares? R trees are not necessarily metrically complete either. I can take the metric completion. It stays in R tree. No big deal. But here, you need to be careful. The metric completion is not necessarily An R building. So that's a complication. So you really need to do something. And I will talk about that later, how you deal with that. Okay, I think that's... Let's see if I forgot something. Probably did. No. Okay, I'll start then with two. Is there some kind of Is there some kind of projection like well? Yeah, the fifth one is a retraction. You can express it in several ways, but one of them is saying that you have retraction on two apartments, which is distance non-increasing. I should have known if I didn't write it out. In the end, you would ask anyway. Local to global expansion. Exponent theorems. So if you have group G, we have seen this a couple of times this week, but I repeated if you have group G acting on a space X such that every element of G fixes a point. Is there a global fixed point? So that's a question that you can ask for many groups, many spaces. But I will focus on the case of groups acting on two-dimensional buildings. So then you can say why 2D? Why not all? Why not all dimensions? Well, 1D are threes, and Pilter already showed us the proof on Monday. And if the dimension is greater than or equal to 3, the buildings are all of algebraic origin. They are Bruhaditz buildings, and the groups that act on them are reductive groups. Or reductive groups. And there is a paper, beautiful paper by Anne Pavot. So, Bruhatit's buildings are described in terms of not necessarily discrete valuations, and she proves this theorem algebraically using these valuations. It's six, seven pages. It's nice to read. So, therefore, we look at 2D. And in 2D, buildings are not necessarily of algebraic nature. So, our methods will have to be geometric. So, I first learned about this question. So I first learned about this question from Pierre Manuel Capras, and it was also he who sent me an email one day, and the title was, Have You Seen This? And it was in the morning, and I opened it, and there was the result by Pyotr and Damian, which and Sergei Norin, so I'll write down the theorem. So they prove that the answer to this question is yes, where X is a zero primal complex. Complex, they do more than this, but I'll put rational angles and g is finally generated. So they have three conditions. It's either this, that, or that. But for me, here rational angles. Simplicial buildings fulfill these conditions because rational angles is basic. Um it's sort of like these ones here. It's sort of like these ones here, ion three, etc. So simplicial buildings fulfill these conditions. In particular, they prove this for two-dimensional simplicial buildings. Now I will just, as I said, they have other conditions under which it also holds. And I think they say that they think you can probably omit these conditions. So then our result, so this is a result. Uh by myself, instructor and uh N and our result uh says yes X possibly not discrete. So what I mean by that any R building Of type A to tilde or C to tilde. So there are four types of two-dimensional, A1 tilde cross A1 tilde, but that's a product of threes that's known. And then there's A to tilde, C to tilde, and G to tilde. It's a very good reason why we don't do G to tilde, it's quite this is the biggest time sink ever. Always we thought we were close and then, well, we were. Gross and then, well, we were. Maybe we are, but we never managed to do it. And I will tell you why. It's maybe, I need to keep an eye on my time, but anyway, so the methods are quite different. So NOP, they use Elliot's theorem. A result by Maser on periodic trajectories in rational periods, and results by Baumann and Brin on finally for finally closed geodesics. So these are their methods. Our methods are quite different. So they are living Theoretic with some Gazira thing, and we also use some ultra-products. I will say more about that in a minute. I mean, I'm at least very much an end user, so I can apply this, but it still feels a bit like black magic to me. And then, lastly, recently, here I'm by By Comantin de Barce, Jean-Liquir, and me. So we are also working on it. We have proved this alternative. And so we have proved this for reproved this for A to tilde, which is separable. And let's repeat the I'll say more about that if I have time at the end. And the methods are yet again different. The methods use random walks, which Valentine LeBach worked on in his PhD thesis. And actually, here we find, you can reverse this. You can say if there's no global fixed point, I find a hyperbolic element. Here we find a Here we find a special kind of hyperbolic element. Um but I should move on because I'm already behind uh schedule. Okay, so I'll say a few things about the pro of the result with Anand Kun. Proof strategy, first step reductions. So we're gonna put this some slightly simpler situation. The first reduction is that we're gonna assume that every vertex Assume that every vertex is special. Somewhat non-pedagogically, I just erased the thing where I could explain that easily. So here, all these vertices here, where the three things intersected, they are special. That's where you see the full symmetry group. But if you assume that you have all the translations, you might as well just assume that the other lines are here. The only thing that is different is that in these points it does not branch. These points it does not branch. And so, if you look at the local building, here these buildings will be thick, meaning that there will be different things branching. And here, it will not branch, so the building will be thin, but it will have the same type. And this facilitates life, you then always get the same type, and you don't have to use the word special all of them. That's a standard trick, it's in Parot's paper, for example. So, yeah, if you want to learn about these art buildings, I highly recommend the paper by Anne Parot. The original paper is in French. The original paper is in French, but Anne and I, and a student of mine, we translated it to English, and so an English version has appeared last year. Every verge is special. Secondly, we may assume X is complete, which seems strange because I just put some effort into telling you that I cannot do that. So why can we do that? It's because you can put X inside the ultra-product. Inside the ultra product of X. If you don't know that, then just ultra product. And the ultra product, this is still a building and it is metrically complete. Okay, all good and well, but you might say, well, hang on a minute, you find a fixed point here, maybe, but that's not what you were asked to find a fixed point here. It's not the same. Okay, first attempt, you say, well, if I have. Attempt, you say, well, if I have a fixed point, then I have bounded orbits. If you have bounded orbits here, you have bounded orbits there. So now you might be tempted to apply the Bruhatitz fixed point theorem. So I'll write that down. Brunha-Titz. And you will immediately see what. And you will immediately see what the problem is. So that is if G acts on X metrically complete at zero with bounded orbits, then G has a fixed point. Then G has a fixed point. But I can't apply it because there was the whole point. It wasn't that fixed point. Luckily for us, Streiber, so on the quotes, he has an extension of the V T theorem for G finitely generated acting on a building. So if it's not just a Katzero space, but it is a building, and your group is. Space, but it is a building and your group is finally generated, then having bounded orbits here still due to this point. So, this allows me to do this reduction. Okay, this hinges on kids' center conjecture and stuff, if anybody knows that. Okay, and then the third reduction is a mild one. You may assume that G is type preserver. Once I'm in the middle, G is type-preserving. Once I'm in a metrically complete setting, the type-preserving subgroup of G has a finite index in the group. So if you find a fixed point for the type-preserving finite index subgroup, then you can now apply to have its fixed point theorem on the nose when you find the fixed point. So these are the reductions. Okay. About the strategy? I might shorten this bit so that I can tell you something about this alternative. So the strategy is very reminiscent of the strategy that was used for trees. When Pyotr explained the strategy, what did he do? He took pixel point sets. You took fixed point sets, and then if they were disjoint, then he told us, well, you get a hyperbolic outlet. And hence, these fixed point sets are not disjoint, and then you can inductively, on the generators, get a fixed point. So we are going to do the same thing. We're going to assume that we have finally generated subgroups GA and GB. Finally, generated subgroups GA and GB of D, which have non-empty fixed point sets, and that these non-empty fixed point sets are disjoint. And then we're going to construct a hyperbolic element. And once we can do that, then we just apply this with the first generator, and then the first one, the second one, and so on, and then we will be done. So we need to now, from this picture, need to construct a hyperbolic element. So, first remark. First remark, well, remark, no proposition is that the distance the distance between these fixed-point sets is realized. So, this a priori is an infimum. You need to show that you can find two points, such as distance realized. It's surprisingly hard. Realized. It's surprisingly hard to do that. You need to use panel trees. It takes a few pages to do this and took us a very long time to do it. And in the beginning, we hadn't realized even that this had to be done. So that's the first step. And then what you do is this. You take these balls and you take the two points. That realize the minimal distance. And now you can look around this point X. I told you in the simplicial case, if I looked around the vertex, I got a spherical building. This remains true in the R building setting. You just have to be a bit more careful because it's non-disclosed, you need to work with germs, but it's just technicalities. Around this point, you will have a spherical building. And so in particular, And so, in particular, this thing is coming in. This is, let's say, I'll call this x, I'll call this a1, a0. This is the point where a, this is the thing, the germ representing the segment A0, A1. I can look at the closest panel, B. So there will be a panel which is close. And now what we do is is we show I'll explain for C to tilde that's by far the easiest we show that there exists a G1 in which fixes A1 an element which fixes A1 and which can map this panel to an opposite it's mapped to an opposite It's mapped to an opposite. And then you send this out. Now I'll become like vague to the point of it being maybe slightly farcical, but you have this, you get here a point A2. Again, you can find the closest panel. You find an element which maps this to an opposite. This time an element G2 which fixes this point A2 and And the idea is that the composition of G2 and G1 is a translation. And so I then define the next point inductively by applying this G to it, conjugating it, and apply this thing over and over again. So then a lot of work goes into sort of proving that this naive or maybe this strategy that that works. Or maybe this strategy that works. So, how do I know that I can find such an element that maps to an optic panel? How do I know that it's going to go further all the time? So, we then show G is hyperbolic. The way we do that is using dose amount functions. What we do is we Do is we two consecutive of these things. We can show that you can get them in an apartment, which is a copy of the Euclidean space. We have a point ψ here, which we construct as the end of a ray. And then we show that you can, we set this up, that there's a partial array here. And we can show that in every step, you can find an apartment where you find two parallel walls with psi at its end point. With psi at its endpoint, namely this one and now the next one, and then this one and the next one. And so that what you do then, every two consecutive ones are in an apartment. In an apartment, you can look at Boosemont functions, which is this measure of distance from infinity in some sense. And in R2, they are sort of constant on the vertical lines. So if you can show that in every step you increase your Buzzermann function and your Buzelmann function becomes infinite, And your Busoman function becomes infinite, then this element will have to be hyperbolic. That's the idea. Now you might say, well, hang on a minute. You're using maybe Bouzuman function first with this ray, and then with that ray. I mean, these are different Bouzemann functions. How can you tie them together? But the point is that if you have parallel rays, then Bouzemann functions differ by a constant. So all we care about is that it gets bigger. So it doesn't matter at the different Bouzemann. So it doesn't matter at a different Buzzuman function. So in every step, bigger, bigger, bigger. And this is the hyperbolic element. I mean, read the paper for details. I'll say just one word about how you find this panel. For C2 tilde, so for C2 tilde, the local building is C2, and that's the incidence. C2, and that's the incidence graph of a generalized quadrangle. The generalized quadrangle is a structure where you're not allowed to have triangles. So you have points and lines, and whenever you have a point not on the line, there is a unique line that hits it. So we claim that in C2, either you can map a panel to an opposite, or you can find something very close which is fixed. I'll illustrate it. I take my panel to be aligned. I take my panel to be a line, without loss of generality, it's dual anyway. Okay, first case, the line is fixed by everything in G. Then I'm done, then I have found something which is fixed and close, and that's not possible because x wasn't supposed to be the closest, and this is close by, I would find a closer point. Okay, now assume that L is not fixed. Well, if L gets mapped onto LG, which doesn't intersect L, Which doesn't intersect L, that's exactly what it means to be opposite. Then I'm also done. Then I have found this thing. So the remaining possibility is that this thing intersects, LG. But now I look at other elements. The moment I find an element that does this, I have a triangle. I just told you you're not allowed to have triangles. So the only remaining possibility is that they all go through this point. But then this point is the panel close to X, which can. Is the panel close to X, which gets fixed? Again, not possible. For A to tilde, you can find a similar, slightly more complicated lemma, because their opposite panels have different type. And we assume that the action is type-preserving, so you kind of put things out of place by 2 pi on 3, and then you need to show in the next step that you can put it back in. And for G to tilde, this strategy collapses. So in G to tilde, we were unable to find a lemma where you have a dichotomy of either finding something close. Dichotomy of either finding something closed which is fixed or something which maps to an object. We have many, many local lemmas for D2 tilde, none of which is useful. Okay, is there anything else I want to say about this proof? No, I should use the remaining minutes to say a few words about the TITS alternative.  This alternative for buildings this time is only going to be to type A to tilde. And I need to start once again with Damian and Pilter. So P is finally generated, acting on 2D0 complex almost freely, which means that there is a bound on the size of the finite vertex stabilizer. So they do not just finite, but there's a bound on this size. Size, then G is virtually Z virtually Z2 or contains a non-abelian triple. So now recent results. So now recent result, we are like in the process of finishing the write-up again with Valentin and Jean with Marie which proves a similar theorem in the for non-discrete buildings. For non-discrete buildings. So let X be a separable, metrically complete. And we actually think that we can remove these two conditions by making some reductions. But I would like to write it down very carefully first before making some claims. But note that, for instance, if you're building a simplicial, this is automatic. If you're building a simplicial and open finite, this is also automatic. Is in the shallow open fire, this is also automatic. Okay, the building of type A to tilde G countable group acting non-elementary, and I'll tell you in a second what that means. By isometries on X, then G contains a non-abeliate free group. And so, non-elementary, you are elementary if you either You are elementary if you either keep a flat invariant or if you have a finite orbit on X union the boundary of X. So this is the result and I'll maybe finish up with so the reason we came on to work on this, I was visiting IHUS like a couple years ago and I started talking to Jean and I had seen a paper by Jean and Had seen a paper by Jean and Natalia and Frederick Matthias for Kaisero complexes. And they used some techniques on random box and stuff, which I definitely don't know much about. But kind of suggested to Jean if you had a similar theorem for buildings, then I think there is a kind of geometric strategy that will work. And he said, oh, well, my student is about to finish this Ethereum. So in principle, this was done quickly, but then of course, as always, it takes a very long time to. It takes a very long time to write it up. So the theorem we are using, which follows from Coratin's work, is that X be central metrically complete type A to tilde. And I need to definitely learn more about these methods for the moment, like a lot of ForenTask paper, Forentas is separate paper. Paper, for antennas separate paper. It's a bit of a black box for me. I would like to know more. Separate building of type A to tilde. Let mu be a symmetric. These details are not important for the talk here. It's mainly just that you see what kind of maths goes into this theorem. Symmetric and admissible probability. Probability measure on G, which is a locally compact second countable group, and suppose that G acts on X non-elementary. non-elementary by isometries, then the probability that Zn, I'll tell you what Zn is in a second, is a strongly regular hyperbolic element tends to one as tends to one as n goes to infinity where Z then is the random walk associated with mu. So this is very technical but the point is that you will get a hyperbolic element but not just one you will get like overwhelmingly many of them and not just a hyperbolic element you get Hyperbolic elements, we get strongly regular hyperbolic elements. What does that mean? This is the only thing I can draw reasonably well. I mean, Kevin's being quite close to drawing. Okay. Strongly regular, that means that it's not an isometry whose axis are like a wall. It's something which is in general position. And you, yeah. In our proof, In our proof with An and Kuhn, we get a hyperbolic isometry, but I don't see immediately how to prove that it's strongly regular. With this method, you get that it's strongly regular. That means, in particular, that the min set is just one apartment. And the fact that you have so many of them, what that allows you to do is to find two of them such that everything is pairwise opposite, and then you can apply a ping-pong argument to get this. On argument to get this alternative. So once you have this, theorem A and theorem B follow fairly readily. But this is a little bit of work from Orantin's original thesis. And I think that's enough. Thank you. Questions? So there are no assumptions on the point stabilizers. No. Maybe you shouldn't I missed what why doesn't your first proof work for D2? Ah um it's because I have this I had this global lemma here where like for the quadrangle I could either fix something close, which I'm not allowed to do because this X was already the closest point, or I could find something which maps the panel to an opposite. So what you want to avoid in the So what you want to avoid in the in the strategy, so I have this kind of like and I constructed G1, G2 such that G pushes this to the right. If you cannot find a local lemma that maps your panels to an opposite, then what might happen is that you get something like this. You start to turn by 2 pi on 3. So it's basically because in a hexagon, you can turn over 2 pi on 3. And yeah, the underlying reason. Yeah, the underlying reason why it doesn't work is fairly modest. And then we had these increasingly complicated strategies of like, okay, I turn my 2π and 3, I bring it back, and then, but we were always just kicking the can down the road. The problem always came back under a different guys. But so yeah, this is open. If you can find a good local lemma, the rest of the project should go through without too much difficulty. So the height point that you produce is always just G1, G2? Yeah, in our strategy here, yeah, it's G1, G2. Yeah, we tried G1, G2, up to G6, I think. So Didn't have an understand that commutate or something. Yeah. Doesn't work. Yeah, we tried many things, but I still believe that it should be possible to find the right kind of lemma. Be possible to find the right kind of lemma, but I will not be the one that's going to find it, that's for sure. Any more questions?
