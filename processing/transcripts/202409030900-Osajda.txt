Hello everyone! Welcome back to the second day for our first speaker, Serena Zaida, who will be telling us about drilling hyperwork groups. Thank you, Alex. So of course, thanks to the organizers. Okay, so titan is drilling hyperwork groups. There is an extensive list of co-authors, so Daniel Robes, Peter Hassin. So Daniel Rhodes, Peter Hysinski, Jason Manu, Alex Sister, and Jamaica Walsh. So as you know, many of the controls are here. So if you have particularly difficult questions, you refer to them. I didn't know, so picking this topic, I didn't know that they would be here. I don't know how to feel about this. My feelings will depend on their collaborations. Okay, so I will start. Okay, so I will start. Okay, I will start before reading, I will start with motivations. So the main motivations come from Canon's conjecture. So Canon's conjecture. I will abbreviate it as CC. So it states that if you have a normal hyperbolic group, the hyperbolic group Here it means gromo-hyperbolic with gromo-boundary homeomorphic to S2, two-dimensional sphere, is virtually plane here, meaning This means that this is I1 of closed hyperbolic manifold, hyperbolic in the sense that this curvature is minus one. So portion of hyperbolic three-dimensional space. I mean virtual. Okay, so this is Cameron's conjecture. This is open and And there is related relative version. So Tora relatively hyperbolic. Okay, relative. Carbon conjecture. So this is about relatively hyperbolic groups. Hyperbolic groups, as we saw yesterday motives talk, but I will remind them. So let GP be a relatively hyperbolic prior. I will explain what I will remind it once again. Hyperbolic group curve with baudic boundary. So, this is the counterpart of Gromov boundary for relatively hyperbolic groups. I will explain in a moment. SQ, so bounded boundary homeomorphic to two-dimensional skew. Then, ah, okay. Ah, okay. And we assume that T this is hambled group or single group for us is that is isomorphic to z squared. Then G is Kleiner. And here it means that he is virtually a fundamental group of Of uh similar but not closed but finite volume uh hyperbolic manifold and this I will abbreviate as TRCC so let me tell you what what's the boundary boundary okay uh so grammar boundary I believe I do not need to explain If I do not need to explain, so once again, this is a set of equivalence classes of geodesic rays. Module of the finite Hausdorff relation. So bounding boundary is actually the Gromov boundary of some hyperbolic space related to this hyperbolic, relatively hyperbolic pair. So this will be, so here I will explain it using another definition of. Explain it using another definition of relative hyperbolicity. So we say that G is a relatively hyperbolic parameter. If there is an action of G on a hyperbolic space, so this is hyperbolic, droma hyperbolic. A droma fiber body preserving a family F of horribles like sub I mean those are the preimages of Pre-images of intervals from infinity to something of horror functions, so like distance functions from the points at the boundary of this one, such that G acts geometrically, so co-compactly and properly on the On the complement of this family. So just remove these horribles from Y. And plus P is the stabilizer, is a stabilizer of of a horrible. Well I mean it's isomorphic to stabilizers of horror holes in in F. Of horribles in F. So here is an example. So such fundamental group of finite volume hyperbolic manifold acts on H3. So this, okay, so what's the picture? So the picture is this. This white guy is a white mother sphere, like glass sphere, okay, which is the boundary of a Juan Carre model of H3, so inside is H3, so H3 without this glass ball. And then there are these baby spheres, small ones, attached to the white one. So there, you know, there are, I mean, baby spheres. So there you know there are I mean baby spheres are suck these mother spheres and it's suggestively don't feel but those are points, these are points, okay? And now, and there are plenty of them. This is very funny. So there are plenty of them. And now, if you remove these balls, okay, so there are paraboles. Those guys are in fact paraboles. So in this one can remote, if you take this diagram. If you take this, the other like half-space quantum model, then four ball is just, I mean, these four skills, the blue guys, are, for example, attached at the infinity, are just planes, right? And then flats, and then horrible is what's about the flat. So inside of the horrible so inside here are really horrible, and now if you remove these horrible themes. I mean, integral of them, then your action of this finite volume manifold will be geometric. It's not geometric on the whole H3, because the stabilizers of this point are actually, the stabilizer of this point is actually the whole parabolic. So you should think that this, you know, this is z square here. Square here acting. Yeah, but if you remove them, then you have a geometric action. Okay? Does it make sense? And so basically this picture will be a picture that we will work in, but with some coarsification or something. Okay, you will see. But this is the picture that we should have in mind. And now, ah, I didn't say. Ah, I didn't say. So the Belgium boundary boundary is exactly the boundary of this space. So the Gromov boundary, this is hyperbolic space, its Gromov boundary is called the Baudit boundary of this pair. So in this case, you know, I mean, so in this case, really the bounded boundary of this relatively hyperbolic. Of this relatively hyperbolic group is sphere, it's two-dimensional sphere. However, and this will be important for our approach, what we will do. However, of course, if you start with a group, you just start with a plane group, you may have some model of this group. So, model of this group should be something like, for example, that the group acts geometrically on. So, inside, in fact, you only see the complement of the form. The complement of the horrible balls, right? And then somehow you should, and so you do not have this nice geometry of A3, the whole hyperbolic geometry. So you should somehow know how to feel in these parabolics. And this is what we will do. I mean, we should, you know, here the picture is nice because we kind of know where to start. We start with I3 and then we remove the horrible, but we go, we go, in fact, the other. We'll go in fact the other way around. Because we'll start with a group and something will be missing we'll have to find those keys, right? Okay. Does it make sense? Okay, so now what about these two conjectures? I want to appeal to your emotions and feelings. So if I understand our feelings Are that TRCC, so the Toran version should be easier, or maybe I will not go this far, I will say that it will be, or should be, feels less hopeless. This is I just realized that there is two words. So So, then CC. And this is what the talk is about to some extent. We want to go in this direction, but maybe it's easier to solve TRCC than CC. So, how to relate them? So, half of the authors here made some work. Made some work previously. So maybe I will just use the first letters. So Daniel and Jason and Alex, they showed that actually Canon conjecture implies the torrent relatively relative Canon conjecture. So Conjecture. So meaning that the Canon conjecture is true, then the total relatively hydrobolic Kamin's conjecture is true. So they did it using Dane feeling, group theoretic Dane feeling. And you know, we are very close to drilling, right? Here is drilling, here is feeling. And this is true, I guess. Fill. And this is true, really. So now we want to go the other direction. So you need first more outdoors, and then you need new tools. And here is... So what we do, and this is corollary, so I will start my talk with corollary. And this is corollary, I don't know, of the theorem, maybe the corollary of a title. So corollary. And here is that toral relative canon conjecture implies Canon conjecture, well, in the residual finite case. So it means So it means that if you have a relatively finite hyperbolic group and you know the torrel's conjecture is true, then this group has the skew boundary, then this group is clinic, mutually clinate. Do you need TRCC for all relative equivalent groups or for all relative climate relative groups? Uh so so uh okay, so I will present the proof of this. So uh yeah. Um um yeah we didn't check residual finiteness of what we construct in a signal. So ah I I mean th this this is not a word I believe. So I tried to make it a word. So I tried to make it a word, but I don't know this much English. I don't know. So this is also not a word. But for me, it seems like a word. So then I found computer. I mean, I saw there it is unscrubbed and computer says no. First uh but but but it said that that there are I mean the only the the only word that it produced were four letters for Produced where four letters were. So you need to get rid of two letters. And then I realized that there is one letter that you cannot get rid of. And this made me very happy. For the first time, I thought important counter. So, okay, anyway. This is just a side remote. This is not important for me, either. Okay. So here is. So here is okay. And yeah, so so so here is where we come to to the final and so we use it using we prove it using drilling. So this is the finally whatever drilling is and this is so this is some tool that we introduce. Okay so so let me just say a word like in words and a very Say a word like in words, and then they come to show you. So, what's the point? I mean, so from canon conjecture to relatively canon conjecture, I mean, how you prove that there is some implication? Well, you take, okay, maybe I didn't. So, you take some hyperbolic group, and then you want to apply somehow relatively hyperbolic version of Kannada conjecture to this group. So, you need to produce a relatively hyperbolic group out of this, right? So, this is exactly what we need. So, here Is exactly what we need. So, here, that Dane feeling takes the relatively hyperbolic group and makes it and produces out of it in some controlled way hyperbolic. So we go the other way around. So, here is an example, the first example of drilling that is, I mean, that was known. This is quite standard. The example that is, well, drilling indeed, right? So, this is about This is about building a neighborhood of or just or just geodesic loop in a free manifold. So I wanted to prepare this picture, but I have no time. So we have this, so take a free manifold. So this is my schematic picture of free manifolds. So that's uh I propose it through my default. Hyperbolic three manifold. Take a geodesic loop inside. So here is a geodesic loop inside. So let's call it K. This is geodesic loop. I should have some names. So the manifold itself is M. M3. This is just a closed. This is just a closed negatively curved manifold. I mean a hydroponic manifold. And then what you can do is that you can remove this loops. So you can think about a fundamental group of this manifold minus k. And this happens to be a relatively hyperbolic group. And relative to, so in this case, this set of parabolics is exactly z square. And this can be seen that, I mean, instead of removing this loop, you can also remove the neighborhood, like tubular neighborhood of this, right? And the fundamental group of this. The fundamental group of this tubular neighborhood is this z square. Okay? And this is drilling. And this is actual drilling. It is called drilling, right? I mean, because you drill. So this is a drilling. Yeah. So from the fundamental group of M3, which is hyperbolic, you get the relatively hyperbolic. You get the relatively hyperbolic group by this process. And by the way, this is, of course, this picture is related to the other picture. And we will use this relation later also. So this is, say one, this is two. So if you, I mean, okay, I I should say it was a picture. So this picture with removed neighborhood, tubular neighborhood, and this picture with removed uh insides of babies. Inside some babies, you have a cover, right? So this will be the cover of this. And actually this group will act geometrically on one. So this is how you can see that this is relatively hyperbody group with this parable. Parable. So now I want to formalize it. So let me give you a formal definition of what we call dreaming. Okay. And we will see how it works in this example. So let G be a hyperbolic group and GP hyperbolic element such that this is the maximal abelian subgroup. In this case, it's cyclic, of course. So a dreaming for us of G along along G along this element. Along this element is a relatively hyperbolic R G is a new group. Together with a normal subgroup of T Of T and identification P over N with the sepic subgroup and such that This G quotiented out by normal closure of in G naught, and this is normally P of this end is isomorphic to G itself. And with quotient, with the quotient, this quotient identifying P over n with g. Okay, so okay, and this is just a formal definition, but you should think about this example. So what is here? What so g is of course, so this will be this will be g hat. Hat. G is of course fundamental group of our manifold to start with. P is Z square. Now G is the class of K of this geodesic. And now N is the class of M Of M where M is this meridian here. So this is how you should think about this tree. But I don't know. But I think having this picture and relation to this picture is enough. You will see. But basically, it's what we do. Okay, any questions at this point? If it exists, is it unique? Yeah, existence is something that we don't know, for sure. What about? There's always trivial. Yeah, there are some trivial yeah, there are some trivial versions, but but actually we will I will state the theorem now. So yeah. Keep going. I will state the theorem and in the theorem we want some In the theorem, we want some additional properties of dream that are crafted towards this implication. Okay? Okay, so now I will state the main theorem. It's it's yeah. It's a bit technical, I mean but I think you might survive. You might survive. Oh, I might survive. Okay, so here's our main theorem and oh, I say theorem. This is the same number as in the paper. By the way, there is a prep. So this is this not word. And we say that if you have X hyperbolic graph so simply we I mean yeah I mean for us you know for us we will work in the graph will be usually the I mean we can start with the K graph of hyperbolic group or any graph in usually compact. So I'm state it in this generality, we state it in this generality We state it in this general state with the Gromov boundary to sphere. So then we say that for every hyperbolic isometry G G of X with axis L there exists a constant, so this constant will depend on the hyperbolicity constant and other constant connected to hyperbolicity of X such that such that the following happens. So this will be a This would be a there would be some implication here, so suppose we have a isometric group, I mean subgroup of isometric group, such that G acts freely and co-compactly. On X and second for every H outside G, and this L and its and its translate H times L are Are sigma apart, meaning a distance sigma or more. So under this assumption, then we have the conclusion then there exists a drilling So drilling is a hyperbolic fur. So GNU is a hyperbolic part of G along this G such that I need to move to the other blackboard so you assume that small g belongs to large g uh small g uh Yes Yeah Yes with the following cabinets so GP is GP is relatively hyperbolic. Yeah, with P with P a billion so this happens when G preserves Preserves. So this is if and only if G preserve the orientation on the boundary, which is sphere, or fine bottom group and second And second, the Baudic boundary of G is two-dimensional sphere. So, this is our additional property that we want. So, in this case, I mean, so in this case. This case, I mean, so in this case, there exists drilling, non-trill one. And then, okay, I should maybe mention one more property that I will use in a moment also. So in addition, G is torsion free if and only if G is okay. Okay, so that's so that's so that's the main that's the main theorem. So this is the theorem that interesting drillings and drillings that are related to Canon's conjecture exist in the setting of Canon's conjecture. Any questions? I I I think I I have to erase the the fear. I'm sorry. So that's right with Olga. We've got with Olga, that's fine. Three of you, all of three of you. Sign them. You've got that space on the right. They keep the whole thing. Yeah, I mean, I need to keep it. And I hope the other speakers will keep it as well. What? Do you have other boundaries? I guess it's reached as well. Okay, so first of all, we are okay. Okay, there is no definition. We are drilling out this subgroup. There is a drilling along this. And a lot of, I mean, what we do, how we construct this drilling, allows probably to drill out other things in other situations. So also with other boundaries. But so this is, if I understand there is ongoing work around Daniel. Daniel. So, but but but yeah, but but we needed this statement for our purposes. I don't know if I need to comment on other founders at all. Not sure I need later on that sigma depends on the space I'm not on the road. Sigma depends on the space. Well, yes, so so sigma Yes, so so so sigma yeah so sigma depends on the space but actually so how we will do it and so what what we will do is that yes I mean I will I I mean that there is a lot of constant and I would like I mean this is the main And I would like, I mean, this is the main purpose of this paper is our constants. So I probably want to say finite. But you do need that in order to apply residual finite. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But I will not explain this in detail. Okay, so I'm erasing the theory. I will erase from the beginning so you can still read it. Okay, so now actually I want to show you the proof of the corollary. So I want to show you how from this theorem it follows that the relative Canon conjecture, so Torah's relative Canon conjecture implies Canon conjecture. Conjecture for residual defining groups. So now the proof of tora relative canon conjecture implies Canon conjecture. And here is how it goes. So you take G is a hyperbolic group. So I want to prove the Canon conjecture. So with boundary S2 and then And then we take a subgroup, so and we moreover we assume that this is residually finite. So then we have a finite index subgroup such that the following happens. So this is torsion free. So you want torsion free preserves orientation. From the boundary. Okay, the boundary of a group, and actually immediately here I take that this is boundary of x, so where x is some graph on which is drawback. So for example, x is k graph of g with some given generating set. So torsion 3 preserves orientation, and moreover, Orientation, moreover, such that access, yeah, I should say Ggether with G maximal subgroup, maximal cyclic subgroup Maximal cyclic and such that the And such that the I mean G preserve orientation on G and such that access of G are I mean copies of axes of G, copies of axis of G are sigma part apart sigma part so this is the sigma coming from let's say. Coming from, let's say, x. So there is something to comment, maybe, here. So, torsion free is okay because there are finitely many finite conjugacy classes of finite subgroups. And here, that you can make the axis sigma apart comes from the fact that in this in the residual finite case, maximum abelian subgroup are separated. So you can. So, you can separate them. So, you already have this finite index subgroup such that it happens. And now we will work with this subgroup. So, by theorem A, you have that there is a drilling. So, you get this drilling. Of G one along G. And now we observe that, okay, such that moreover, such that let me write it to be the boundary is as two, so this is Baudi boundary and for over P. For over P, this P is infinite C square, and G1 can be identified with this G1 module, the normal closure of G. Identify what we wanted to identify. Wanted to identify as in the definition of dueling. And then so then you use, oh my god, okay. And also you have that you also have that if G1 because G1 is torsion free, then actually G1 height is torsion free. And hence G1 Hart is the fundamental group of, or virtually fundamental group of finite volume manifold. And then what you claim is that by Dane feeling Of this manifold, you've got G1. So, and this Deinfining of this manifold is, of course, the hyperbolic manifold. So, this is Pi 1 of Deinfilling. And of M3, and this is neutrally like the coronary. I'm sorry, I didn't prove anything else, so I didn't show you how the drink works really. But roughly, it works as in the classical case. As in the classical case, the fact that you have to do some course stuff. So, I mean, there is room for questions then for the three co-authors. So, thank you very much. Are there questions for that? We don't need uh residual inquiry. Residually finite. So, I mean, so, yeah. So, this goes to the proof. I mean, so how you think, how you obtain this picture from this one is that how we do it is actually work in universal cover of this of M3. So, in universal cover of M3, you see So, universal cover of M3 is some hyperbolic space, and in this, those blue guys are geodesics. And now, so similarly, in our proof, I mean, this is to represent the group G itself and with sphere boundary, and here you have access. And here you have access, so so group meaning like a k graph, and then you have access. Axis are some combinatorial access, in fact, maybe of element G. And then what we want to do is that we want really to remove some neighborhood of this guy. So we want to remove some bananas like this. And I mean, how much we remove, I mean, how big are these bananas? You know, in smooth case, I mean, in topological case, you can make it arbitrarily small. Topological case, you can make it arbitrarily small because there is fine topology, fine geometry. But here we have only this combinatorial setting, so we really want to remove actually big neighborhoods of this axis. So we don't want them to interact. So we want that the bananas are kind of even far away. So they are big. We control how big they should be with the They should be with the constants of the hyperbolic space inside. So we need that, we have this choice of separating the blue guys as far as we want, and this is where we need the search to draw finite ones. I mean, in what you wrote there, you used it when you produced G1, which was file as an extension, right? That's why it's that's the way it was. Moral questions? Questions? And we'll start again in five minutes.
