I de la conference all presenters difficult of the familiar conference for many text and within. Daniel Las Vizmeros, Tequinos Visita de La Quinapuda University of Science and Technology in Jeda, and Deep Learning Sprati Provision for Trans Wildlife. But this was So, here we have a little bit of what the group for this track here are members the first two, somos members have vaccinated accessories of the user professor, and also a collaboration with two professors. Well, I think this point is professor, and Luigi Lombardo que son two logos. That are two yolks that have the moment working basically in Rome in different parts of India, Nepal, and other parts. So, I will say what we do, and they can do the collaborations with the people who do not consider working in statistical work. So, you are working on it, and we can see that other scientific. Scientific science is a pass that we think are mathematical or that are statistical. Because many technology neuronal shock and many work very much scientific, and the statistics and mathematics, because as you know, Mathematics, because all can be normal. All can be a normal distribution, and all can be a regression. When I say a concept that can be done extremely, it is that we have these techniques that we apply in our application. Here many people have the photo, and that's. I think it is in the photo, and professors or postdocs in ours, but entry what we have a year and a half in the case. We have all the people, Australia, of China, of Saudi, this company of Philippines. So, also work with other countries, it is concordar in a moment that in this case, and one as if. Well, the motivation of this work is the work. In momentum, when I was doing my personal name, well, for that, the notices, one for these migrants, in the piece of Australia. So, these amenities of the But also this news and local, in peso de jarcenizas, in the recipes, and more Chile. So, yes, imagine the cantida demo that has to be parameterized in the Obel or continent, well, of the Pacific and the noticeably of today, also the Sorita queen in Oaxaca in what mendries do the una delayer, not the sidondo despelmente. And a little numbers that we are observing here in Mexico is that 153, we can observe more than 100 conditions of my. So, three queues in this yoke. So, this is something that we have a natural phenomenon in their principles, we decide the incendios and provocados for natural nature, but affordably the majority of them observando presente their provocado for the human beings. So, we do as if there are torment electricity, and I know that you will procure things, it is more than ah, that. The more pagan cigars, or something, so provocative in it. One of the electricity transforms, also provocado than many parts of the world. This is not the limit to Australia. And Oaxaca, also living many years, in the past in Canada, that also affected us not only of Canada, if not affected what you are. Here, we are loving the Australia, who wear in the Miles, working on it. And what we want to do in this sense is to make a point with the theory of extremes with what metropolitan deep learning metropolitan. So, y also. So, y also use what we understand the neuronal graphics for implementing the end of the current values extremes. In this case, as regressions in a spacial process. But what is there more and more extended? And we have a And we have a porous case extreme of a queue propaganda. This does not impact, we don't ecology and not the human ecology. So, some can be a pass very extreme, rapidly. And especially if you have climate conditions that benefit. Or something that has a very good thing and a nice thing, but if there are a lot of people And there are a lot of secrets, and we have no idea in two days. That to cultivate, so that controls. Or not what we have their time, and there are queer natural lines, etc. So, here we have their neuronal graphs with distributions of what we have generalized for this distribution. Generalized parent distributions who are the generalized distributed distribution is a distribution of what specific distribution. And imagine their cuando defines a number in the surface that part of this pace, but it will be very much here or in this case of our ecosystem. So, there are There are studied one articles to mention that they have not focused in this porria unumbrancy, and not only focus in the distribution of the bulk and colour of digital. So, we can trap the distribution of the extremes, and not only the colours of the para usamos unnevo, no. So, we're not legal because we compare them, but in the cual este, imagine, but basically, what we have the incendios for the stalls of juniors 2005 to 2005: these images that are basically. We are basically collected by different scientific collections in Australia and government system in the system, using satellites, and also the capture to make the devastation of the insects in the moment. So, obviously, the capture and satellite depending on technology for this so we have a baseline diverse in the The cual, the heredity, if you have here as a code very good. So, there we go. There can be more approximation of the daughter to lugarize where we have exactly maps, the incendios. So, there are garlands and this is that for the 15 cosmos point, with latitude, latitude. So, what we want to do is that if we laugh at the technical majority, the map can be a grid and cuadrites, and verdundan affections in these affections, and age of affectation depending on my grid, the migrant. Here, if a jar of service and tomorrow. And tomorrow, more natural figures of what Australia here we are, and decisions that the city population and municipal division for Australia, our division. In the same population to determine what we are doing ourselves. So, here where we are, because they are citadels, where the Australian population is more than many people, the opportunity to 500 poquito mejor. Well, if you don't perfect, I think, and I'm going to, but here we have all these maps, and there are no. Incentives, mapados, and they are where we have registration more incendios. We have many concentrated in this part of the surface, and in this area, also, there is very passion what we do in many luggages because we have migrants because there is a publisher in this area, where there are people. So, that's what we see what we live, the job, or the. Because the government has not lost data. What do we say? When we carry how when we go into the data, we have to have initiative, which is pagano, that is more, where, and. And what is here, but when you jump the bases of data here, one of the first things, other enlightenment, so if you have a work with a manual that we don't know, the same as I think. So, here we have no consideration, but if we have models if we are considering how. Here, a little bit more with respect to how the polygons, and we see that polygons very quickly. So, where are we going to see the cities of the world? I simply celebrate, but this time, also here we have here one very great place because we also have a ecological reason. So, the population density. So, the population and peculiarities. And if it was the cases, we can see the public Australia. You have many living lives. And how we understand the population to terminate the decided one of these polygons that we have or basically in this decision to create polygon. La forma comotale decided as logic, what is that, more encoder variables of geology? The change of latitude of altitude in the polygones, and when studying our cuando. But if it is what they told the maño y also the division of what our municipalities in Australia is a base. So, there is a vase from the location of the pandemic and also the policy. So, that's for junta. Claro, who are great and also in our project. Well, we have studied here, aquímos estar estudiando raqui que promedio dema de uncendio vasados en que tenemos el aría que mába y tamen en number 1es que protocol na na. Procaro needs are to have a ríc or queen to see that the media could be expansion of the insects and we have a study that is temporal. We do not have a vision in the map with evolution through the messes. Travel meetings. So, here, like the end, and here studying the insects, like the very great things, we are going to expansion of incendio with data. So, what is the first vista pre-analysis, and possibly we have areas where in fact, very important, and the same time there is a place where there are, and that is point. Servendos, and that is another point very important. We have the transport of seros in our vased. That is good because that significant thing is not uncending all the messes. So, and it is more because when you study with 23% of your data, with a passage of experiment and 2% of data per day, So, we want to see the image, I want to take the image of the incendio, and progress. But, no, we have historical immigration in some. So, today this part of the time, but more for a studio. So, we have a process of this variable or if Wi-Fi radially spread that basically this variable in that. For a little bit more of what we are observing from the data, like we have studied the colour pesada, who is the comportamento of this series of time, like the colour. So, we are currently 5%, and the 9%. So, we So we can recover this distribution of these extremes and distribute. So that we have three predictors here including what longitudinal y entry is what the NDVI is age of what is the We are saludable es la vegetation in this political vegetable. So, we are altogether saluda more verbal, we are vaccinated negatively, when we have many people, in this room, much of the reason. So, we have to understand the temperature, environmental, the precipitation, the evaporation. Evaporation and the two directions what you see in Norte and this. This component obeyed one different medicine, and we are working with minimum and maximum minimum, not a promise of these variables, because we are considering what we are studying for a mesh. So we have a porosity variables that are very important. And also what the pending and the aspect of these polygones. This is more spacial information in this nobical information. And the people because also depending on the creative science, but the simple mountain and tutorial is a direction of the direction. So there are the possibility that the base of the mountain. Possibility that the base of the mountain or mountain seventh. So, to this week, the aspect to have this possibility of ten moments. This is not two variables that we have in 2000. They are in the temperature, we can see that one very ten Australia and the vegetation. And the vegetation is very important because here are more incentives. Or something here that is certainly not the vaccine. But if these affections because of a point, a point without the children, I'll say much that we have bushfires incidents because they have more complexity that comes from. So, So, if you have a secar, and there are children, there is part of the toddler. We are a little bit of what I have theory of extremes here that we have mathematical that are justified, but for the study of study, here as the Here, however, that passes when we have central limits. When you have a confusion of variables, and if you observe the infinite observation, you can see that this goes in the normal distribution. But it passes that in luggage to collect all the variables and collect the maximum collection. That passes with this distribution, the moment that has many observations. So, this is what studies theory extremes. There we have also extremes where we can also certainly see that distribution convergence the maximum and the minimum in this case distribution is color pesada as well as gumbo, weibo, and freshette depending on how it is. If you have a distribution, what is more tutorial is your media, so we can see that the media distribution is here, this promise. So, if I took a look at the medication of the alturas of all people, I could say that the alturas of all forms of normal form, or many. No, no, I don't know. Two metros, so if you are accumulated in this son, okay? But if I study that are arrived at the two metros, that is more people have very bad. So, you cannot decide that with probability, you can see people more than. But if I can study the altars, I can study when we have a number, when you have more than 5 millimeters of Jubas. So, if I want to see these distributions, So here what is what I understand a model that regression limits, where we have to transcover to study this scholars. To study these scholars, not only the media, and what passes much with this type of distributions is that there are statistical functions that function, very complicated when studying interactions. My peen dimensions to have expressions. Simply can have approximations that are much statistic. That is a lot of statistics, but also developers extremes a vendor that you want to do. The functions that final function with the permutations, it is that they have no challenge, and the lights. So, we have limited focus or consider focus interactions, many independences. And their name is very much. And the Games allows distributions like gamma betas that are distributions that are distributed. So, no cuenta is difficult. One of these parallels in the dimension is gamma. Gamma tier no, it's like models multiple models with distribution different distributions to the normal distribution. I think here we are using this machine learning to move the dimension. So, we are regarding linear extremes that we have. And I obviously don't, I believe that work with these anteslap in the case of patches in the middle, that we also have normal to studiar in Jubias, in Swiss. So, I have no problem that is their model, I can't. Models don't include a space. Time is to have the mental time. Or in the work that I collaborate in 2005, features and users, if optimizar convolutional para capture this structure, but opportunities when when TNNs work in a grid, it is not working with Gráfica. So the models here have. The models here in these people of targets don't structure spacial structure of the data structure. So these are the MLPs, also encapsulate this structure spacial structure, and the deep learnings do not allow exploring a more documentary structure in the space. So we will aller, and we have to say, not the convolutional. The neuronal convulsion, we are saying that most of a capture and images will explain for cuadritos and recovery for media operations within the cooperation. So, here we are that have three tumors in this component of three colors, so we have. So, you are recovering from the tonnes verdes, a little information, and the vasculus with what you have done other scholars. So, to cooperate, operate, depending on what studio, if they are a major, much more, but that is the most important thing. That is the most important thing. But when we have a convolutional engrafing, what our basically parts is that has a structure of a view to define our vertices, in cabinet in this case, polygon cases, in the central polygonal center, to determine if it were to understand if there is a connection dependency between the different polygons. So, if you can maintain this structure of anti-domino and processes in the normal, if only convolutions, and all totally what we have in the graphic, here if we can have two objectives, you can understand the graphic that describes your data, you can also understand your data, or Or want to see the two queries as well for data. What is much of that capacity positional tengas because a moment that speaks where we pass for this major work of data that we study the data and comportamento de las colas or query a graphic. So So, how tiences have yo filing? What is what we want to do this graphic obviously consistent of our vertices? And our matrix adjacency, you can see this matrix basically, if existing no. If existing as tradition, if there are connections between different things, if we have yet not immediately poner one, so everybody understands a well. What? If this completes, what we are suggesting, we have a We have a completely connected system, although all the connections are allowed here. Now, if we have all our connections, we have in the same place, when I have what I say, it is probable because we are coming all the time, no. Or have a person of one, but I know the documentary, I could put a peso. So, I left the force of these connections. So, I levasando the force of these connections every totally connected, which is what we understand all of one, all we can include also. How have different things between the changes of temperature of a diaper? Also, this. Because today the comportament of the data and today we are queuing, we do. This is the project that the insect applies to the car, they are very certain, but no passing, no passing. It is going to have a lack in this incendio applause of the car, or whatever you are. Carmen loving this pocket for all. So, we can incorporate this and here we are as we are studying the distribution, we have understanding the parameters in this case and model and these parameters, these formulas of parameters. So, we have our process temporal and spatial where the observations and the They are observación and the discovery that studiamos. Here, what we want to study is this distribution that is what is happening in life that I observe this in medium. Or that you have to change and all the variables. So, what we want to do is that in this case is parametric and function of this parameters. That also changes. And then we have many seros. So, you don't have to say that the series, and we have a part positive in misdata. Here, we can see a currency incendiary. So, that is a passive, first, we have a logistic reason where we study that passing a vendor effectively uncending, but But most variables. And one of the parts, and the problem, not a problem. No, no, no, that is more sixty observing a polygon. In the second part, we can study that pass data that observes a whole debate, or that are great of these incendios. And this can be congregated in this distribution. So, if I think that no observe incendio, so we will see. That is not there, and that is my distribution and cabo. But one of these porria ya needs this combination where considering if there are unique units, and how affect the distribution of the distribution. And here, we have the distribution generalization of distribution. So, how do we? So, how momentum is we have a confund of allators that the same distribution also studies the maximum of these variables and I can see that for the probability, no problem in the maximum. This is for a number of raids, if I condition a number or I can have convergent distribution to this type of distributions. And there are these generalizations. And there is also generalized. Here, depending on the value of the value, it is what I say if you have a distribution of colours, a distribution of color, or aimed at exponential. That also is studied in the case of this. I think a graphic, but now here we are very much critical, in the moment that your study. So, in 2008, all yes, papa, well, that two in the military is an extension of the distribution of generalizables. Generalizabas here basically, if not here in the velvet with the expression, agree on a cap. So, that allows us to flexibility to study the study of all the distribution and the importance of that and not have what selection or selection. That is what we passed many problems when you study a queer term. If not, the sufficiently. Sino laws the sufficient notinos the convergence sobro using because many variants level and also independent valor is what type of colours study. So the job of this can have an estimation. Un inferencia directa deposar estudión la cola digera al cento de la distribution a la con la pasada. Osi do not mías que estar estimando los perceived allos. In the moment that you pass the data, obviously, forma interest, you can say the cooperation capas, and if you have all the parameters for this distribution. No, si tenemos a number. Si two six numbral uno y topo la tú. Number one, and all the results for this number, you can have results to have this very confusing, when the parameters of this first number, you can have results for this. What passed is that people study the selection of when it has the practice of a number of 25%, a context of 25%. So, you have 50%. 5%. So, 105% of data to estimate your parameters. So, we have data that have more values, more escape, and all that. So, I pero que que no, se dio el caso en norgas, muchos años when quiero na ser projecto de los delta works nos when Netherlands signo. Signo yes opportunamente. And that is very important in the process of the Netherlands, as I said, and velocity. So, determined in services and control of Diago, but in the moment that they want to construct what we have here. And so, we have a vegetables. So, you have to be the diet so that I resist millions here in more queer resistance because they don't only have to go. Because not only this function that styles the facilities to bear mathematics and engineers in work in the project, but if you have information between two parameters, that is complicated can 500 have configurability in these parameters. Exactly. And I also information for estimates for the past. Yes, a parameter that, for example, written that paradigm for our capital así. How wearing this. So, we have a moment tomorrow decision of jarling visas. But we agree. So, this is the results that you live for. But in the moment that we have two solas, we have a cluster that goes there, pens. So, we limit our distance. Limitarnos acertos distances of connections between the polygones, that justify, do not want to expense that affection. So, we have to also consider what we want to have influenced the world, there are no sellers, between us, the effectiveness for the enisas, but not necessarily the pace there. So, how do we? So we are going to different deltas, almost different values for respondents, so that we have resulted in ourselves. Here we are vegetarian channels for our neuronal and also the distance here of the distance and three different layers for our layers.  That's in those messes. Yes. Because the most kilometers. So we want to see that. Yes, we have a number of fabric. We are not very connected. Vamos a very connected, we're going to jar 2, and there we go. Because we also have the same con the channels, also like a mejor mejor, a menor for these data. Here we are and want to, I think. But if you want to see and evolutionando, there is no packet of where it has an interest, also discover. Because you will change your comment and change antito luerde estar estudión del 10 esta estudión otra augmente. Chambi a loto. Here we are midiendo lo quendreción Ause, the vas la purbas para lo queen esción la probability. The probability is more like our goodness of fitness that we have our model for the data. So, here if we are linear, what I want: this identity is that my model, if all the points here are identified, is that my goodness for the data that I'm going to do. Uh-huh. No, this similar. No, these data, but when we are the convulsionadas, we have when we have. If you want to revision the project, the publication will not bend that because the important thing, you know, dynamic movement, all my fiction, a lot of critical projects, to be much modifications now for this publication when we go. Publicación cuando nosaro unla redivisions, los comentarios, pueno más como era more flexible yada delumento, que esamos la grafica. I think there are good, tabien, te queemos, no, how que average numerito máxico cousas para estás, because chami enjas parameters chami a porovicación y tiempo. So, we say that they are the connections between the nodes, we decide, and the idea that the pasta. No, if I interior interrelation, The anterior reproduction has to consider the area to give these results. These areas are using to estimate the project. Mientras que para para say que aquíposos queamos visos para lo que venda siendo intensidad, los incendios, losamos como proportional because a polygon a que lenes puedes pander na cabas madam de que polygodondo dondo estas considerando.  No, we actualized because governmental difference of the cases like the public medicine that goes and fields. Here I am and that one day, incendios of 20 cats, in 2010, and we are 200. And if you vaspo, how are they different? It is how corrects in Mexico passes so much in this table that one idira is fascinating, but the words that can be rapid. I think the aquí, because different infections are simply a hotel, when infected, when hospitalized, here can see that they have a jacket because also when people are. But also when people were the cabinet, there is no trick that is completely actualized. It's like the senses. Elano passed.  Yes, because the market is that this is a variable of the world that I can decide to linear queue and welcome. Oaxaca, and you're going to because the city of Oaxaca. So, we have this. How these cities to see that in these people? In the una region, we have yet not like it. But we are now. I think it seems much commentaries erosion of this una cajita negra, nothing else, and how decisions are. For that, there are some. For that, one is a very great, notified computational, but if a portion is here, as we are doing the decisions, their models are tedious to decir, which varies the queen or if you don't. So, here we are that we have deep learning important features that are deeply different and here various. Here various quantifications of how they are tomando or what you see models like the parallel of your model. One of them, the paradel is aggregated that variables are more important, or the model can be used that variables are the important variables for this tomato. In this case, the question of the So units when the gradient divided by the interior, you add qualifications of what variables are the most important para cada one of your groups. Tus the gracias here accumulamos, and if you want, because we don't want to give everything else, because here are capturing the significance that many of them are important to yourself, and what we're saying. But also, we see that for our models of pesada, the verbs that have more influence in the violence in the direction, as the temperature. Temperature. So, here we know that it is all accumulated, the miles of polygonos, in all the time. So, this mejor several more energy of 200 que paso que variable was that affected quivering as paso, how several in this moment. So, this also can divide irrigation as study for us. Because this calculas, Because this los calculas or if you para tienbu padada polygon, aquí lo cumula, we más para tenera si conimas que infinar de noso model. Well, how are you in what we are traveling here? We see a model for the areas that we have in this way. And we have a square methodology semi-parametric method of rirational model with graphics, convolutional graphics. Graphicas convolutional y puzzles that one of the things that generalize for it, the distribution of our advantages to these observations or models like nebulaes. So, also one of the things that can be worked the first time to accumulate a former queue una quadricula and more. And we have to be a studio to try to see a graphic of comportamenta. So, we have a sique novel. Look at our name. Evaluating the proportionality for the nos polygonos. And this reverse tomand consideration of the polygonal, that we have convolutional. But first, But the first thing that como enlarges how this was what we are in these unidos, all the critics that you work in this, obviously, unidentified, you learn, and a lot of observations, but that's good because when we para claim, and everything and there we are. But that all variants to tune in, but we can't. And also. And also capture dependencies in space, because here we have predictions for tomorrow. So, if I do the most, but not predictions, my model is independent, because we don't have luck, I don't know, in the variables. I think that's important. Well, I think there are questions. Thank you, Mataria. Namas na idea, how is the idea? I think one thing like that. I think that very extremely, and simply like that capture all these things that are variable, we have this 2000s, we're going to see 50, not the river, 5cones. So, as you simply want to be very great to see to see if you regulate it, so the principle will be a process of two days in the cluster. Twos dias in the cluster? But the cluster when you? When you look at the cluster, pues period number of TPUs that want to do it. So when I prepare one, so when you post this noise, they don't have 500. And we have 50%. In a GPU or something. Mira, when we tunement, not necessarily more than 20 and 20 times, to us because one of the things that I have a list of lists, and in when I have the idea that you have a That has the media that you decided, it was in the list. So, I think traditional access to computers descriptors. When we publish what we are valid, and we are delaying forests, we are computing descriptors and models and The words that we do not trend away the mandate confrontation, but I think it is more basic. Yo, basic, but we are not going to be able to do it. Because the final space doesn't have to be a little bit different, but when we are independent, however, What is that here? The regression for all, no? Y can have a role of these areas. What I can have a capacity is in the observation. So, I don't know if you can see in this area, in our puedo decir devida como entre in. Devido como entre in other polygonos riesgo because variables have the same temperature, have also polygonal have the toddlers variables that the image of the here, if you want, I have these observations for temperature, ten toddler maximum, and promote. So, what do you say here? Is that the parameters? So, if you can see what these areas for the escover. Exactly, because I don't have the podcast of the north. And this idea adapted other directions. And there is something that works the decision of the region and the evaluation of these convictions. So, we have what? Because what is Predecir because what organized organizations are all the data all observations so that is also and that all forms of clusters and all that observations. That observations and observations do not loquitate the north and loquitada of the surface, or if one is interesting, and I think all that participants are all. And we have to predict the number or the number, and the distribution of the project that is the distribution for different people. But everything here has here in Australia, as a very, and here is here in the And here is here in the city. In champion, they are a dos who delay the right, the right climate for climate change, and of the totally different. So, here can be all the incendios, and here we have incendios. So, if you have consideration, so we are a model value with a structure of covariance, covariance, and Our matrix coverings have a triangulation. Technical, but basically the connections between us are covering it. But obviously, when the convolutional links are triumphant because the area, you are not very, and that passes from the cuadrites that consider. As we have a cuadrito, 50, ya metros? And when we are tuning for this project in our project, but if we work with a little ya constraint, the blanks as if it were. The challenge, all the clusters of cows, si, toddler. The cows see, but if it tends to be difficult, we can collaboration with the people who are peroxidas that the collaboration with cows is very sensitive. Maurice commented that when you talk about the test, we don't have to cows. So I will cash all the departments that are. So I decided. So I decided to varias in the visit. Because you have the visit the accessories, we are clustering, but this is the supercomputer. And my personality is established in many clusters, using the supercomputer. If you lose, I'm going to put it to the end. And there's a significant, so that's my cluster. No, no, no, no.
