First we will go to some basic things, maybe a bit faster. So this will be about topological dynamics in model theory, but first some basic notions of topological dynamics. So in this talk, G is an infinite group and thirdly A is a G algebra or it's a Boolean algebra of subsets of G. The G algebra means they disclose under left translation. And because it is And because it is close under left translations, left translations by elements of G induces the action of G on the stone space of A that I will refer to as the space of time. And next, for having such a G flow, then S of A becomes a G flow, meaning the G activated by homomorphisms. And then for every element of G, the terminal search, the homomorphism of G. Thus, the homo morphism of this space well that these homohomorphism applied to P is just g dot p and then you look at the family of these homo morphism, which is a subset of the space of types from s of a to s of a with the topology of pointwise convergence and they took its closure. This set inside is a group under composition, but its topological closure. But topological closure, usually it's not a group anymore. And then it is a semi-group called E of S of A, a semi-group called the A semi-group of S of A. This is also a G flow, like this. And this G flow is like of some importance in topological dynamics because it explains in algebraic way the structure of the original flow S of A. So, in particular, minimal So, in particular, minimal sub-flows of E of S of A. Okay, this semi-group is semi-grouped composition. The operation is composition. And the minimal sub-flows of E of S of A has exactly the minimal left ideas I of this semi-group. Left ideas meaning close under left multiplication by elements of this semi-group. And then, this meanwhile, left ideas have an algebraic structure of the An algebraic structure of their own. Namely, we first define the set of eigenpotents. The set of enzymes Q, this semi-group such as Q squared equals U. This is the set of ideal potents. And every minimal left idea contains some eigenpotent. And for an eigenpotent in I, when you look at the set UI, it is contained in I, and it is a group. It is an elis group of L sub A. Of S of A. And each group of this form inside E of S of A are isomorphic. So it is a canonical object, unique up to isomorphics, and that's why we denote it by A or E of A. Next, well what we will be trying to calculate these groups, end groups. Added groups. But these AID groups live in the A semi-group. And this object is not so nice model theoretical. It is better to look it in a different way. Namely, and for this, we need some additional notions. Namely, first for N and P, a type in A, we define dp from A to P of G. Namely, dp of U is simply the set of G in G, such as the G inverse U belongs to P. This may be. Belongs to P. This may be regarded as a Hussom disquantifier or as a convolution in some way. And then this function dp from A to P of G is a G homomorphism, a homomorphism of G algebras. It respects translation by elements of G. And then we say that this algebra A is declosed if and only if. If and only if it is closed under any of the functions dp, where p ranges over the types over n. And in the next slide, I will explain why this is important. Next, we say that an algebra A is a G algebra A is generic. If empty element of this algebra is generic, meaning that finitely many electrons. Meaning that finitely many left translations cover G. And then we say that a set A, subset A of G, is strongly generic, if the G algebra generated by A is generic. Now regarding declosed algebras, every algebra A has the smallest super G algebra that is declosed. It is called declosure. And this is written here. So this declosure. written here. So this declosure A of D is the algebra generated by the union of all the images of A under the functions dp. It is called the declosure of A. And important examples of declosures are first of all declosed algebras are first of all the algebra of all subsets of G. And then for us modern theorists maybe more important the algebra when you have a group G definable in M G, definable in n, then we look at the algebra of external definable subsets of G. Good enough. That is the traces on G of the. Yes. Declosure contains A, right? Speak louder. D-closure contains A. Yes, declosure of A contains A. Because when P is the time concentrated in the neutral concentrated in the neutral element, then DP. Neutral element, then dt is identity. And examples of declosed algebras are the algebra of all subsets in the algebra of external definable subsets of G, meaning that there are traces on G of sets definable in the monster model. And why declosed algebras are important? Assume that A is a declosed G algebra, then first of all, for every type P, For every type P in S of A, this function DP is an endomorphism of the G algebra A. So we get a function D from this space of times S of A to the set to the semi-group of endomorphism over A, mapping P to D P. And then this function D isomorphism, is an isomorphism of semi-groups. And on the right-hand side, And on the right hand side is composition, the operation, and on the left hand side the induced operation star is defined as follows. P star q, where p and q are types in the s of a, u belongs to p star q, even only z q u belongs to p. Now, why is it so important? Because it turns out that the same, this, this semi-group, S of A star, with star, is also isomorphic. with star is also isomorphic with the L semi-group of S of L, like that. And the isomorphism marks P to the left translation by P in the semi-group S of L. Like this. Well, this... So, okay, so if we want to, this is true for declosed algebras, but looking at algebra, arbitrary algebra, it turns out that any semi-closed That any semigroup of S of A is isomorphic to the stone space of the D-closure of A with this star operation, defined like here. And the isomorphism maps P to L P from S of A to A defined by the same formula like here. So, if you are interested, if you are interested in this L7. interested in this every semi-group and in particular in its every subgroups, these minimal left ideas and so on, that instead of looking at functions that are somehow elusive, so it is better to look at this semi-group, which is like the use, the space of ultrafilters in some algebra, provided we know what AD is. This is not only what AD is, what's a declosure AD. What A what the declosure A D of A is. And then, well, so there is some obstacle in general. Like calculating any semi-group is not easy. And in particular, in topological dynamics, they don't do it. Instead, they characterize so-called universal minimal ambiguities. And then, usually, unless it is one point, Unless it is one point, and then the group is called extremely amenable. It is usually very complicated, and the only thing they can say is like non-metrizable. And so, this is an achievement then. But for us, in model theory, maybe like the objects, the groups there, the elis groups, this this minimal ambit is a union, disjoint union of Ellis groups, isomorphic elis groups. So they have algebraic parts. Of algebraic functions. They are canonical groups related to our original group. So, what is the algebraic nature of these groups? How they are related to the group we started with. It is a mystery. No one knows, really. There are some connections, but we can try to approach this problem more in theoretical. In which way? By localizing. Just like in Sabil's theory, when instead of looking at global type, When instead of looking at global types, look at local types, local ranks, and then this explains the law. So, this is the idea. Oh, localization. Suppose we have a G algebra A and then a family, directed family, directed inclusion of G sub algebras of A such that this algebra is a union, directed union of this family. Then, when you Then, when you take the declosures of A and A, then the A up D is also a directive union of these declosures of A. And so, in particular, the space of ultrafilters over A D is a projective limit of the spaces of types of in other I I A I D. And moreover, assume that I is a minimal left idea in S I S of I D. And u is an eigenpotent in I, then when you look at the projection to the level of algebra, then ui, the intersection of u with this algebra AID, is an idempotent in S of A I D, and II, the restriction of the elements of I to the sub-algebra AID, is a minimal n I do LS S I D. And A is good, UI, at the top. UI at the top top level is the projective limit of the edge groups UII. So it is written here again: Elites group of A is the projective limit of the Elise groups of AI. So, if possibly, if we describe some like small else groups of some small subgroups Ai of A, then this tells us what the elis groups of the whole algebra A is. Algebra A. So, this is one way to approach it. And another way is such that in modern theory, we are interested in phenomena that are related directly to mathematical reality and not involving the set-theoretical byproducts, noise. And so that's why we focus on, for example, on definable sets in a structure, not arbitrary sets, unless there are sets. Sets, unless there are sets of parameters, but these are just things. Okay, so this happened also, like, for example, in ominimality. In ominimality, we consider just tame topology. So, this was a great achievement, like the distinction between arbitrary function and definable function, which behaves much more naturally, much more nicely, just like original people in the 16th century or 17th century intended. And so, on the other hand, there are several results already calculating Ellis groups in model theory for groups definable in models, but usually these calculations depend on some additional assumptions, like for example definable amenability, where the group, this Alice group, is isomorphic to 0 by 0, 0, and some things like that. So, because it is not known. Because the it is not known, not clear how the Ellis group is really constructed. There is a lot of ineffectiveness in the construction of the Ellis group. So on the other hand, we want to understand what the Ellis group is in some specific model-theoretic examples, and we are looking with Aaron for some properties that would just be more complic like more general than the the stable fields and then still. The stable pins and that still allow us to calculate X groups. And we came up with such properties in topological groups. So now this is pure topological groups. And this will be applied to minimality, right? Okay? So let's assume these are topological groups, not necessarily households. And then recall, well, let's. And recall, well, let SPP or SPP of G consists, this is the family of subsets A of G that differs from an open set by a normal dense set. So if N were assumed to be meager, then it would mean that A have the bell property. So here we say that A like Z has Az have strong bare property, S B. So this is an algebra, G algebra of subsets of G. Of subsets of G. And the main theorem of ours is that this algebra, G algebra is declosed, declosed, but not in all the, not in all groups, but only some cases. The first case is where the topology on G is a profinite group topology, meaning that it is generated by concepts of Generated by concepts of subgroups of finite index. This does not mean that the group G is compact. For example, when you look at the Fulstenberg topology on the additive group of integers, it is not compact. And this is just this profinite topology. The second case in which SBP is closed is when the topology on G is compact. When the topology on G is compact, then this algebra SBP is closed. And the third case is Third case is where the topological G is pre-compact, meaning third, and remember this does not mean the general half-tropic, meaning third G is a dense subgroup of a compact group H. Sorry, so that's pre-generalized one? Yes, no, this is not an answer. I am just ignoring the questions that are asked to shortly. Okay. Now we can identify. Now, we can identify the earliest groups in these three cases. So, assume, but we do it in a greater generality, because not just for SBP, but for any C algebra A contained in SBP. So, take this A contained in SBP, then the H group of A is isomorphic to the quotient of G over N A in cases one and two is profile and then compact. Robine and compact. And in case when G is pre-compact, then the H group of A is isomorphic to the quotient of H over N L. This H is this group, just the compactification of G. This compact group where G is dense. Where for some normal subgroup N A of G, where they are respectively defined in case one, Defined in case one, the profinite case, this normal group, is simply the intersection of all normal subgroups of G of finite index that belong to A D. In case two, it is more common. So, in particular, in case one, this group E of A is profinite, compact, profinite, group, profinite group, and then in case two, which is compact group, so we define an equivalence in a group congruence on G. congruence on G, X is equivalent to Y, even only for every element P of A D. When you look at regularization internal of the closure of P, then X belongs to this set, even only if Y belongs to this set. And this is a congruence and N A is the class, E class of E, under this congruence, and then you have that this L group is the quotient of G over N A and it need not be already confined. And it need not be already profinite, of course. That's why this definition is a bit harder. And the last case, when we define in the pre-compact way, when we define this congruence on H by, X is congruent to Y if and only for every set C from some H algebra can be C, X belongs to tenure of closure of it, even only if Y belongs to it, and then N A is as before the class of P and The class of E, and this curvy C is an H by algebra. By algebra means it is closed under left and right. Translation generated by those subsets of H whose trace over G is in AT. So this is like an explicit description of the error in these cases, of this theorem. Now the Ominima case. This theorem and more is applied in the Omina. And more is applied in the ominal case, which was one of our main motivations. So, in the ominum case, assume M is ominous and G is a group definable in M. Then we have the basic proposition that whenever A is an externally definable subset of a Cartesian power, some Cartesian power of M, then A has M D P. With respect to this usual product topology, the underlying topology on M is Underlying topology on M is induced by the order. And in particular, if G is a group definable in M, then by PRI theorem, it is this manifold, right? So it has this topology, locally the same as in M. And the same is true for this tree in place of Mn. So the algebra, the algebra of external dividable subsets of G is then a different. Subsets of G is then a deep load G subalgebra of S B of G. And the theorem applies. So for this case that when this omega group satisfies the assumptions of the theorem, then this theorem provides the description of these edge groups. Well, this is not that much because in many cases, these compact cases, definable compact groups, this was already described. Maybe this description is a bit different. But still, this result is. Here this result is well applicable not just in omnima case but in pure topological young so arbitrary topological group. But now look at arbitrary group not compact and look at this SPP in it there are problems it need not be declosed anymore and it's quite surprising results that when we look at the group let's say When we look at the group, let the group be the additive group of realms. It turns out, with standard topology, it turns out that there is a single open subset A of R such that the d chloro of the algebra generated by A equals the all power set of G. And then obviously, so it follows that the declosure of A is not contained in SPP of G and therefore. SBP of G and therefore SBP of G is not declosed. But anyway, it is quite surprising that a single set generates like this algebra of all subsets. And the set is not hard to construct once you know the construction. Okay, so there are problems with this disclosure. Still, let A be L C sub algebra of S B P. C sub-algebra SBP, or C algebra arbitrary topological group. And we would still like to learn what this Alice group of A is. It turns out that an important step in learning what this else group are is identifying, understanding what are the maximal generic sub-algebras be of the D closure M D. Closure empty. Why is that? First of all, let me mention about writing on the screen that when you have a declosed G-algebra like AD, then any two maximum with respect to inclusion generic sub-algebras of it are isomorphic. So up to isomorphism is just one maximal generic sub-algebra. generics of algebra. And then once you have it, then you have a proper read, then you can read out from it the group of A. What do you mean by isomorphic? What do you mean by isomorphic? Isomorphic? Isomorphic is a G-algebra. Just pure G-algebra. Pure G-algebra, yes. But this isomorphic is not really abstract. It's maybe like this real mathematical isomorphic. So the proposition is: suppose that we have this. Suppose that we have this maximal generic sub-algebra of AD, then let X, let E be the set of those types in this maximal G algebra B such that DQ of P is contained in B. Then it turns out that this star operation that was defined earlier, earlier at the beginning of the talk, the same definition works here. The same definition works here, making E, which is star operation, a group. And this group is just isomorphic to the group of A. So, of course, it is not, there is still, so from this maximal generic sub-algebra going to the group, and your B is still some way to go, but still, somehow we are closer to it, if we understand what these maximal generic algebras are. And then I have some conception. And then I have some conjectures about it that I will just say now. But in the next part of the talk, I will just describe a way to explain what these algebras are and some surprising phenomena arising. It's also in the Omima case. Namely, first again this this topological group, and assume A is a subset of G, then let us introduce this regularisation operator rho of A. Operator rho of A, mapping A to the interior of the closure of A. So, you know, and let RO of G is a family of regular open subsets of G. What is a regular open subset of a topological space? And O, which is an open subset U, because it's equal to the interior of its closure. And these regular open subsets are just like what the name says. They are open and, moreover, much nicer than artificial open. Much nicer than arbitrary open sets. And in particular, rho of A, this integral of the closure of A, is regular open for any topological space, for any set A. And then this RO of G has a natural structure of a complete algebra of sets that is also G algebra. The algebra operations are not exactly set theoretic. They have to be some correction made. Have to be some correction made. Why is this easy? Not for the meat, but for the sum, for the sum, Boolean sum. And then the function rho from P of G to R of G, mapping A to its regularization, is a G algebra homomorphism. And now the main proposition here relates the maximal G algebras, G sub algebras of this algebra A D with maximal With maximal these subalgebras of some generic sub-algebras of this rare RO. Namely, suppose that A is a declosed sub-algebra of SBP. Then, first, for every maximal generic sub-algebra B of A, the algebra rho of B is regularization contained in Contained in RO of G is a maximal genomic sub-algebra of rho of M. That is a sub-algebra of RO of G. And the function rho from P to rho of P is an isomorphism. It's the algebra isomorphism. And in the other direction, every maximum generic sub-algebra of A well, no no. No, well, no, no, no, this is a misstatement. No, no. I mean that every, not of A, but of rho of A, every maximal generic sub-algebra of rho of A is of the form rho of B S1. So this shows that, why such a proposition? The same as we show in the next slide, namely here the regular open sets The regular open sets are nice, easier to imagine. They somehow correspond to the shape of G. While arbitrary, for example, strong generic sets in A or in S and P, they need not be open at all. They differ from the regularizations by a knowledge of a saturated nature. It's like a set theoretical nature. It's not clear what they are. Also declosed. Same again. Is it also declosed? Declosed. What is also declosed? Rho of A. Yes, yes, rho of A is declosed, because it's isomorphic. No, it is not isomorphic. Sorry, it is. It is declosed. But it's okay. And now, let us see some omnimal examples. Maybe I'm going to be using stock. The first example. Using so. The first example is the traditional example in topological dynamics, the circle. It's a circle, everyone gives this as an example. So in the circle, there are two, so the circle is definable in an ominous expansion of the reals, and then there are two maximal generic sub-algebras of maximal two-generic sub-algebras of the definable. In orange, there are external definable sets, are just definable sets because it's definitely closed. So there are two kinds of arcs, semi-open and semi-closed arcs, like this and like this, with respect to this orientation. So one of these maximal generic algebra is induced by finite unions of arcs of z form and just. Z4, and the other one is induced by the finite, it just consists of finite unions of arcs of Z4. So these are almost dissolved, but they are maximal algebras. But when we go to regularization, then the row maps this just to an open set like this. And then in the on the regularization, in the regular open set, there is just one, just one. just one just one just one maximal in this algebra RO of G intersected with deltg of R so there is just one maximal generic subalgebra and in fact it equals the whole algebra because the group is compact. Here every non-empty set is generic. Every non-empty open set is generic. Another example like that, when you look at the real line, when you look at the real line, then on the real line, the generic sets, well, the strong generic sets, there are two strong generic sets, n of the set and the whole R only. That is, in the That is in the Omni case. The Omniar case, there are two strong generic cells. And they are already regular open. So on the level of regular open sets, there is just one maximal generic subargent. Regular open external definable sets. So now there was an idea conjecture. There was an idea conjectured at some point in our research with Adam that it is so that we have a group and then it's max, it's ominous structures, a group, and then we look at the maximal generics of algebras, of the algebra of external definable circles of Q, and then on the level of regular open sets, they come from one maximal generic subject. Maximal generic subalgebra, somehow explaining the shape of the group. And it turned out false. So this is the next, the last. So now let us look at the group G, the S L two of R, the group of this simple linear group. Of matrices with determinant one. This group has been investigated in modern theories for many people. By Kismatouin, Panazi, Philais, and by Magielda, this topological dynamics calculated that the end is group. But here, Adam actually calculated, managed to calculate the the The maximal generic sub-algebras of this algebra of regular open G-definable subsets of G. And it turns out that there are continuum many distinct such algebras. And this was very surprising because in our imagination it was thought that, well, the this So these regular open sets, they are like easy objects to imagine and well, then of them being generic or not, it should correspond to the shape of the group G. And in particular, Adam introduced was looking in this issue and then defined some ideas, very nice notions, like a point at infinity, like At infinity, like here in R, there are two points at infinity. So it can be generalized to arbitrary group definable in omnibal structures so that the definitely compact group does not have any point of infinity, while the other do. And then these points are at infinity, they Infinity, they seem to be the right direction to imagine what the maximal generic sub-algebra of this algebra, rho of g times delta g of r, should be. And well, what else to say? Okay, so in because of this, of course, there are. Because of this, of course, there are a continuum essentially distinct maximal generic sub-algebras of P, P of this delta G of R when G is this SL2 of R. Essentially distinct, meaning that the algebras rho of P are distinct. Is there any description of an example of such a maximal algebra? Yes, there is, but it's quite complicated. I mean, it comes from the work of Jaguar, lah. Work of Jaguela, who described those minimal ideas, single minimal ideas, but Adam made step parallel and described all maximal generic sub-algebras of this loop. And it turned out, like Zegovio Gelder, we found just one maximal generic sub-algebra of the Generic sub-algebra of the tree of in this case. And Adam found all. And they turned out that there are continuum men. So these, as you see, these algebras from every, so in general terms, having just forgetting about this G here, but looking at this algebra consisting, declosed sub-algebra of R over G, consisting of regular opens. Of regular open subsets. So, from what I said before, we can read off from this algebra the edge group. And this algebra consists already of nice elements, open sets, without those no-dense sets that are somehow quite misleading. So, it should be possible to read off, to understand from it, the ELS group. And my idea is that this is in this. In this restricted setting, that's very, very important to point. Instead of looking at all subsets where there is set theoretical noise, you have a restricted setting of nice subsets, tame subsets, open subsets, and then you have some operation leading to some group, just like in homology theories of groups. So this group arising there should be somehow related to the original groups. Somehow related to the original groups she should reveal some aspect of it, only it is not clear what. It is still not explained. Well, so that's it. Thank you. Are there any questions? So but is it possible from from this the Adams description of these maximal algebras and from These maximal algebras, and from the calculation of the Ellis group using this, as you presented before, is it possible to compute in this example that this group is Z2? That this group is what? Z2, two-element group. Because this is no, for example. But look, but look, obviously, because this is a gender and actually this was done by the sound. But then of course you can see it from SASA but exactly. But they didn't use this epsilon star, this presentation from one of the previous slides. Previously, it was not used, so anyway, whether one can see the Z2 using this. Well, the very description of this algebra is not that easy. I don't know. It's subjective, you know. But I would say that once you have the algebra, then possibly you would see it directly. Possibly you would see directly there that this group is two elements. But the algebra itself but you know there is nice thing because this is SL two of R is a three-dimensional manifold. And so since we now know that this H group refers to regular open subsets of it, so regular open subset of such a two-dimensional manifold is something we can imagine. So, like here, in the real s well, this is. Well, that's all it's generic sets whatever. Like something like that, and then z will open. So it is easy to imagine such things. And so it is closer to mathematical, I would say, reality. So this is tempting to see what it is. So I have a naive question. So when you compute the number of maximal generic sub-altitude, Of maximal generic sub-algebras, right? In the circle, you get two. And there's two ideal subgroups. You compete. And so this also happened with the reals. Okay, I don't know if this is also true for SL2R, but is there a connection between the number of maximum generic sub-algebras and ideal subgroups kind of computed in a classical way? Well, like here you saw you see that I I it's a connection. So here you have two of course of course. True, of course. Of course. The number of is more complicated. This connection, I would need to write it down about algebras and the maximal generic algebras and the number of issues. Well, so we have Well, so so we have that so when you have a a declosed algebra, then there may be a several minimal left ideas on it and then And then, s since this is, we think of it as the group semi-group of endomorphism, some mapping every type P corresponds to P corresponds to DP. And DP is an algebraic object, is an G endomorphism, this algebra, so it has two parametric kernel of dp and. Kernel of the P and E. And now, every of these ideals is divided into this third number of u and this n groups u n. Now the kernel function mapping dp for p here to the possible kernels Kernels of almost periodic, for P for almost periodic status P. Mapping is like, so these minimal ideas are fibers of this function. And we have another function here, which is the image function, mapping every p to image of dp. And so here there are possible images, and these are all maximal. These are all maximal. These are all maximal generics of algebras. And the picture is such that every R here appears, its fiber is just a section along all the ideals. Inside each ideal, it distinguishes the fiber of this image function over R intersected with any ideal with a group. An ideal is a group row is one of the edge groups, such that all the edge groups in S of A are in bijection with the Cartesian products of the set of kernels and of the set of images. So this is the connection. And then, so if you have, like, if you have, like, for example, in the circle, you have just. You have just one minimal ideal, but two algebras. And therefore, we have two groups. While in the real line, you have two minimal ideas, but one algebra. So, again, you have two groups. So, this is like that. But when we go to regular open sets, this energy is changed at all. And so, that was why we were expecting that for regular open sets, there would be just one. Open sets, there would be just one algebra. Because, like, in regular open sets, like in the circle, the certain algebras over, like when you have the RO of G times FX of G, when you here have this algebra on P, maximum generic sub-algebra, that it may lead to more than may need to more than one maximal generic algebra in the on the level of G, on the level of external f x g of R. So this is like that. So in your examples for the breaker login, you either have one or continue many. Is this a dichotomy and does it have to do with? I mean not much is known about it. I mean, not much is known about oxygen. But again, my idea is to try to explain this energy group by as simple tools as possible, as close to mathematical reality. So that's why reducing from arbitrary subsets to regular open is a step forward. But it is still, it was surprising. You were thinking that once we reduce it to regular open sets, that the picture would be clear. Open sets, so the picture will be clear. But these examples are completely very distinct algebra made it like it was very well surface. Any more questions? We thank Julian again. And we can resume in nine minutes.
