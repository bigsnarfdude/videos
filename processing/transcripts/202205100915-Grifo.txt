Great. Well, thank you all for coming. And thank you to Carl, Lynchuan, and Louise for inviting me to speak. It's so wonderful to be here. This is not my first in-person conference since 2020. It's my third, but the first one was a week ago. So, you know, I'm still very, very excited to be here. So I'm going to tell you about some joint work with Alessandro. With Alessandro, Stephanie, and Jack Jeffries. And so the work I'm going to tell you about will be the beginning of a story that Alessandro will continue in the next talk. And this work is a few years old, which with the pandemic feels like 20 years ago. But I also know some of you have heard about this work before, but maybe some of you haven't. Before, but maybe some of you haven't. And so, there's two main reasons I want to talk about this. One is to set up the stage for Alessandro's talk, who will tell you about recent work. Jack will speak about something related tomorrow. But also, you know, this is a conference about mixed characteristic. And I suspect maybe not everybody here knows about p-derivations. So I thought it was my job to spread the good word. And so I will tell you about an application of p-derivations, which are Of p-derivations, which are a tool from arithmetic geometry, to commutative algebra. And this is really sort of the origins of those applications in the context of symbolic powers. Now, I also think that maybe not everybody in the room is familiar with symbolic powers. So actually, the first half of my talk will be telling you what are symbolic powers? Why do I like them? And I know there are some experts in the room. So, you know, this is your chance for a little bit of a nap, but you might want to wake up later in the talk. Later in the talk. So, throughout my talk, all my rings are Navirian and commutative, and my ideals are radical. They'll even be primed later. So, what are these symbolic powers? The first half of my title. The nth symbolic power of I. And by the way, I'm told that it is sort of hard to read the board, so I'm going to write as big as I can, as strong as I can. If you can't read it either here or at home, just stop me. I'll be happy to repeat things. To repeat things or write them better. So the n-symbolic power of i is the set of elements in my ring that live in the ordinary power. So this is the ideal generated by n-fold products of things in I, up to maybe multiplication by something not in any minimal or associated prime. Oh my goodness, I'm already starting so poorly. See, this is. Starting so poorly. See, this is the third conference in 10 days. So, aha. Okay, I'll get back to this. Sorry about that. What I wanted to write was: I'll take the ordinary power and I'll localize at all the associated primes of I. Since high is radical, that's the same thing as the minimal ones. And then I'll contract back to R. And what I was writing, but now I'll write again better. What I was writing was what happens when you take a prime. So if P is prime, this is the things that are sent into the power up to multiplying by something not in P. So in the case of a radical ideal, if you happen to have its minimal primes, I guess the same as giving a primary decomposition for I, what you would do is you would just take the symbolic. Would do is you would just take the symbolic powers of each of these primes and intersect them. Another way to think about this is that I took the ordinary power, I wrote a primary decomposition for it, and I collected the minimal components, and I ignored all the embedded ones. So there are many reasons to think about this. One reason is they appear as tools in the proofs of many classical results in computer algebra. Classical results in commutative algebra. So, for example, Kuhl's height theorem, which has nothing to do with symbolic powers, is proved using symbolic powers. So, for that reason alone, I think they're really useful. They are pretty natural things to think about, right? Because primary decomposition is one of the most elementary fundamental things in committee algebra. And they're also very interesting. They are sort of not hard to tell people about them, but it's really hard to study them. Study them. So, let me tell you some facts about symbolic powers. And I'll write a few more than I would normally write, in part because I want to write you some of these facts later, in part because maybe some of you haven't heard about these. So, here's a silly fact I'll use later. When I take a prime, so I'm being lazy here. When I write p, I mean prime. The n symbolic power is the smallest p-primary ideal. That contains that power, right? Because it's the p-primary component in p to the n. And I wanted to write this explicitly because I'll use this in the talk. Since I'm taking some components of the power, the symbolic powers contain the ordinary powers. These are These are nested in each other. If you take a higher symbolic power, you're land inside of a smaller symbolic power, just like ordinary powers. These form a graded family of ideals. So when I take a product of two symbolic powers that lands inside of the symbolic power corresponding to the sum of the orders, and notice in particular, this number three says that I can define. Says that I can define a graded algebra from these, right? I can put together in degree n, I put the n symbolic power. This is a nice graded sub-algebra of r joint t. And it's actually really interesting graded sub-algebra of r joint t because it's not always necessarily an Azerian ring, even if you take a prime ideal in a polynomial ring. In a polynomial ring, this might fail to be finitely generated. And I'll maybe say, I might say a few more words about this later. So, here's some other easy things that I'll use later. If you take a maximal ideal and you want to compute its symbolic powers, you're taking m to the n and looking at primary decomposition. There's only one prime containing m to the n, which is m itself. So, this guy already has. So, this guy already has no embedded components. And so, the symbolic power is already the power. In fact, more generally, maybe I'll write it here on the side. If you take a Cohn-Macaulay ring and you take an ideal, a complete intersection, so an ideal generated by a regular sequence. Generated by a regular sequence, then the symbolic powers are just the ordinary powers. But this wouldn't, I wouldn't be giving a talk about these if this was just the theory of powers. So these are not in general. So let me just write in general, these are different. So maybe I'll give you a couple of examples just to illustrate that. There are many nice examples. There are many nice examples one can do. So, for example, if you think about the monomial ideal generated by x, y, x, z, y, z and three variables. This is a radical ideal. Here's a minimal, a set of minimal primes, or the set of minimal primes. If I want to compute, for example, its second symbolic power, I'm going to look at Symbolic power. I'm going to look at each of these three primes, take their symbolic powers and intersect them. But each one of these is generated by a regular sequence. So their symbolic powers are the powers. So this is just the intersection of the squares of these ideals. And note that, you know, it's a very unfortunate or fortunate fact that intersections don't commute with power. Sections don't commute with powers or products. And so I cannot pull this two out. In fact, I really shouldn't, because this really isn't the square of this ideal. This contains the square, but it is different because, for example, in here I have the element x, y, z. And notice that i is generated in degree two. So i squared would be generated in degree four. No way. Four. No way this element of degree three is in there. So, this is a common phenomenon that you'll have an element of degree that is wrong sometimes to be in the power. And maybe I'll say a few more words about that. So, here's this example will be more of an exercise. There are many ways to solve this exercise, including using things I'll say later. So, take your favorite field. So take your favorite field and take a three by three generic matrix, by which I mean the entries are nine different variables. And think about the ideal I generated by the two by two minors of this matrix. So take all the all the things you get by deleting a row and a column, take the determinant of that. This lives inside a. This lives inside K, adjoin those nine variables where K is any field you like. And exercise that can be done in many different ways. The determinant of that three by three matrix is an element in isymbolic two. It might help to notice, okay, it's not obvious, but this is the prime ideal, so you can use the prime description. You just got to. The prime description. You just got to find something not in this ideal that sends the determinant into the square, which can be done in various cool ways, some of them purely applying linear algebra. But of course, this is an element of degree three. This is generated in degree two. So same phenomenon. No way that this is in the square. This is not in the square of my deal. Okay, very good. Okay, very good. So, you know, I know maybe I'm saying things that many of you know, but if you haven't heard much about symbolic powers before, I do want to point out that most innocent questions that you would ask about symbolic powers that sound really easy are actually insanely complicated. So I want to give you a list of questions that I think of sort of fundamental problems on symbolic power. Fundamental problems on symbolic powers that are very difficult, and I'll write them in vague ways. There are many ways to make them precise, but in all the problems I'm going to write are essentially open and you know, sort of open-ended questions in some way. So, here's some of my favorite questions. I gave you some examples of things with symbolic powers or not powers. You might ask, when are they equal? I gave you a sophisticated. I give you a sufficient condition for this to hold, right? Being generated by a regular sequence. That is not necessary at all. There are many theorems giving sufficient conditions for this to hold. For example, Jonathan Montagno and Luis Nunges Petancourt showed that if you have a monomial ideal, and they showed this just two years ago, so just to give you a sense of the sort of easy sounding things, they're not easy. They said if you have a monomial ideal and you test And you test this equality up to the minimal number of generators over two, then you actually must have equality for all n. But this is just for squared-free monomial ideals. For general ideals, there is no such theorem, right? There's an equivalent condition to this equality from L. Hoxer from the 60s that is really difficult to apply in practice. And apart from that, there are essentially no theorems giving infinity of conditions. Giving infinity of conditions. There's lots of open questions. For example, there's a problem in optimization known as the packing problem, which can be translated into a conjectural equivalence for the equality for square free monomial ideals. But I know I'm just saying things out loud, but just to give you a sense that this already is difficult. And one reason this is difficult is if you want to test things like this. Things like this, you have to be able to compute symbolic powers, and they are hard to compute in general. Even with a computer, it is not hard to write ideals in low-looking numbers of variables whose symbolic powers are pretty much impossible to compute after five or six. So it is sort of that makes studying these things a lot more complicated. One question that I've sort of alluded to is that if you have a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring, or you know, your favorite graded ring, you might ask, so I guess maybe I'll tell you a fact. It's an easy fact that the symbolic powers of a homogeneous ideal are also homogeneous. And you might ask, what is the smallest degree of some, you know, non- Of some non-zero homogeneous thing living in a certain symbolic power. And again, that's a really complicated question of which there's very little that we know about for the same reasons as before. So for example, oh, maybe let me make a comment first. I'm going to tell you in a few minutes, spoiler alert, that over a polynomial ring, these symbolic powers are actually. These symbolic powers are actually the polynomials that vanish to order n on the variety that i defines. And I'll make more precise what I mean by this. So, studying symbolic powers will sort of help you answer classical geometry questions like, what's the smallest degree of a polynomial that vanishes on this variety to this degree? And even for finite sets of points in projective space, there are open conjectures about giving lower bounds. About giving lower bounds for that number. And there's a lot more I can tell you about this, you know, during the coffee breaks, at least for the people here, people at home, you know, maybe some other conference, some other coffee break. Here's another fun one. This is the Eisenberg-Maser conjecture. So I do need to be over a field of characteristic zero. Field of characteristic zero, what I'm about to say is false in characteristic p, and it's an open question in characteristic zero. So you take a ring containing a field of characteristic zero, that should be a regular local ring. And the conjecture is, so you just look at the second symbolic power, easy sounding thing. Does it contain any minimal generator of I or not? Any minimal generator of I or not? The conjecture is that it does not. And that's open. Okay, I'll leave it at that there. One problem that I like a lot that sort of relates some of these other things is known as the containment problem. Which very roughly speaking asks about when do you have a containment? About when do you have a containment between a symbolic power and a power? And I remind you, the people at home, if they have notes, they can look back. Earlier, number, what is it? Number one of my properties from earlier told me about like backwards type of containments, right? If you prove containment like this, well, first of all, you can study the equality problem by studying this, right? If you can't make A and B equal, you can't. If you can't make A and B equal, you can't have equality between your symbolic powers. But this is sort of harder in a way than the equality problem because it's also asking when you're not equal, you want to know more. What can you say about the relationship between them? And if you prove a specific containment of this type, you could use it to say things about problem number two, right? Because the smallest degree of something in here is greater or equal than the smallest degree of something in here. And we do understand the degrees here. And we do understand the degrees here. They're just b times the smallest degree of something in i, right? So if you know something about i, you can get some bounds from containments like this. There are also variations on this problem when instead you put powers of the maximum ideal on this side, powers of the maximal ideal times powers of i. Alessandro will tell you about a question like that in his talk. And he, I think he'll say something about the containment problem too. So maybe I won't say too much now. But this is a sort of question. Now, but this is a sort of questions that, you know, for example, over regular ring, there's a really beautiful answer to this that is not best possible, right? Ideally, you want for each b to find the smallest a, and that's sort of a crazy question. Um, but that's maybe sorry for another day. And maybe, maybe I won't, okay, I'll write it down. I've alluded to this. You might want to know the symbolic algebra, this graded algebra. Kries algebra, this graded algebra that you can make. When is this an ovarian ring? Or equivalently, at least of an excellent ring. When is this a finitely generated algebra over R? That's a really tough question. And again, there are examples when this is not an Ethereum and I is prime, and the ideal is a polynomial, the ring is a polynomial ring. Okay, so that's just to give you a flavor of this sort of problem. Of the sort of problems that arise when you think about symbolic powers. I want to tell you, I guess the next thing I want to tell you about is something I've already spoiled. Oh, well, I think we know my title and Alessandro and Jack's names, but I'll repeat them later anyway. So, the Eisenberg-Mazer conjecture? Excellent question. Major conjecture? Excellent question. I have no idea. I've never thought about it. Aha. So, one should take the characteristic P example and kind of play with it and make characteristic, right? That's the first thing to do. I don't know it by heart. It's kind of tricky to write down, but it's it's a so it is it is the something in dimension four, I believe. And it's the it's a height three prime. I think it's a corner. I think it's a kernel of some mapped K of T. And after the talk, I can write it down for you. But it's not the sort of thing that you can just write down quickly. And I don't have it in my notes, but I'll tell you later. Great, good question. More questions? Can you repeat the question? Of course. So there are two questions. Is Eisenberg Meser false or unknown and mixed characteristic? And I said, fantastic question. I don't know. We should look at the example in characteristic P. Maybe that's something for this afternoon's. Something for this afternoon's problem session, and then Anurag asked, What is the characteristic counter example? And I guess now I'm repeating myself, but I said, Aha, I don't remember at the top of my head. I have a good idea of what it looks like, but I'm going to fail if I try to write it down now. Very good. So I don't know that anybody has thought about it in mixed characteristic, I think, is the real answer to the question. Well, but I do want to get us towards mixed characteristic. So let me first. Take. So let me first tell you a classical result. A theorem of the risky and the gara. Each one of them proved half of it. And I'm writing these names in a non-traditional order for historical reasons. Zariski came first. Nagata came second. It's one of them proof half of an equality that I'm going to give you. There's a very nice generalization of this. A very nice generalization of this from Eisenberg and Hoxter later. But the theorem is, and I'll write this theorem in various formats. So let's say that I take a field and my ring is going to be a polynomial ring over that field. The n symbolic power of my radical ideal. Ideal is actually the intersection of the powers of the maximal ideals that contain I. So you can think of this as kind of a higher order version of no sell and zats, right? Delete to the ends. You kind of have no sell and zats here. So adding the ends, you're saying, if you want to vanish to high order, you want to vanish. Sorry, if you want to be in the end symbolic power, to say it like this, that means that. To say it like this, that means that for each point in your variety, you vanish to order n at that point, okay? And again, intersections and powers don't commute, right? So this is not the power. Now, actually, I want to tell you that we can rewrite this theorem using differential operators. So I'm going to add that here later. Let me remind you all what I mean by differential operators. So I mean, over here. So, I mean, over things like C, oh, polynomial wing of the C, I'm talking about the algebra, the non-cumulative algebra generated by your partial derivatives. But I'm going to give you the general Grothendieck definition of differential operators. Actually, I'm going to give you a very general definition. So, let's say that A is a ring, then R is an A algebra. For now, A will be a field, later will be something else. Else. And I'm going to tell you what are the a linear differential operators on R. And I'm going to, so that's something I'm going to write DR over A. And I'll, this is some non-cumminative ring. And I'll describe it to you by giving you a filtration. To you by giving you a filtration for it, I'm going to tell you what the order n differential operators are. Actually, what their differential operators of order up to n. And this is an inductive definition. So the differential operators of order up to zero. Well, this is going to be some subring of taking a linear. A linear maps from R to R. So the order zero things are just the maps that actually are linear, right? So for each element of R, you get the multiplication map for R, and those are your order zero things. And now, given some a linear map, I'm going to say that it has order, it's a differential operator of order up to n. If you want to take it. If you want to take its commutator with any differential operator of order zero, which I'm cleverly writing little r because they're really elements in the ring. And I take this commutator, I want it to be a differential operator of order one less. And the differential operators version of the Sariski and Megada theorem. This Zariski and Magata theorem. I'm going to write something mysterious first. Is that this? So maybe you could take this. It's about to be a definition. This is equal to the differential powers of I, which I'm about to define, as long as my field is perfect. And what does that mean? These are the elements that are sent. That are sent back into I by all differential operators of order up to n minus one. And this is not a typo. If I want to be in the nth differential power, I want to use differential operators of order one less. So when you plug in a one, this is a zero. This is just asking for multiplication by every element in the ring sends me into a. Every element in the ring sends me into I, aka I, right? So this should make sense. The first guy is I1 is I symbolic one, which I didn't say explicitly, but that is I, okay? All right, so maybe I'll move over there. We finally made it to mix characteristic. What I want to tell you about is that that theorem is not true as written. If I replace my perfect If I replace my perfect fields with something of mixed characteristic. And it feels in a sort of amazing way, in the sense of sort of anything you write, well, okay, module something. Anything that should fail it is going to fail it. So for example, here's a really silly example. Imagine you take Z and join X. And I'm going to And I'm going to think about the maximal ideal 2, x. And let's think about its symbolic powers. It is a maximal ideal. I just erased the properties, but it's really trivial to see that the symbolic powers are just the ordinary powers. Okay, what are the differential powers? Well, my idea. Well, my ideal includes the element two, and that's kind of the problem. If I apply a villinear differential operator to this, so r over z, take any operator of any order you like. It is z linear. So z things pop out. And so this is actually two times, sorry, my twos and my deltas are too similar. So two d. Similar to 2d1, which is of course in the ideals generated by 2, and it's of course in M then. So any differential operator sends 2 inside of the ideal I want to think about. And this is a problem because this says the 2 is in every differential power of my ideal, but 2 is not even in m square. And so 2 is. Square. And so two is not in any of the higher symbolic powers. It's just in the first one. So this is saying that in this case, these differential powers are quite big, even for maximum ideals. Simplest thing you can think of. Same thing works if you try like, you know, the ideal two instead of this maximum ideal, which I guess I also justified because that's generated by a regular sequence. Because that's generated by a regular sequence. So, what I want to tell you about is how one fixes this problem in mixed characteristic. And to think about how to fix a problem, we should realize what is wrong. And what is wrong is that the differential operators, they lower degree on kind of the x directions. Sorry, they lower order. So they lower like x addict order. But they don't lower, in this case, two addict order. Tradic order. So you need, you know, if you're, say, over Z and you want to think about some prime P, or if you're in a DVR with uniformizer P, you want things that decrease p-adic order. Where are we going to find such things? Well, we're going to have to step outside of community of algebra for a little bit and borrow a tool from arithmetic geometry. So these are the P derivations I told you about. Derivations I told you about in the beginning. These were defined independently by Bouillum and Joyal. If you want to learn about P-derivations, Alexander Bouillon has written many wonderful things. You can read about this. And what is a p-derivation? Well, so let me say that I have a prime in Z and that my ring R R contains this prime. This is a regular element on R. I really want to, I'm going to want a ring of mix characteristic. So, you know, for the rest of the talk, this will be like Z or a D V R with uniformizer P. A P derivation is a map from R to R with the following properties. With the following properties. First, I want to send one to zero. I sort of have a product rule. So I'm going to try to convince you that these are sort of good replacements for differential operators, but in kind of the arithmetic direction. So there should be some sort of product rule, but it's kind of twisted by P. So I take. So I take one of them out and raise it to the P. And then there's an extra funny term. And for now, if you've never seen this before, the definition will look bizarre, but I'll explain where this comes from in a minute. And then the strangest thing for us, at least the strangest thing for me, is that these are not additive maps. So you wanted them to. So you wanted them to be additive, but there's actually an extra term that pops up that ruins everything. So you have to compare the sum of the pth powers with the pth power of the sum, which by the way, when you write this out, you know, you take like a binomial expansion, you find out this is a multiple of p, p was regular, so I'm going to divide by it. So this expression makes sense that I wrote here. And what is And what is this? Why does one define such a thing? I think it's okay to erase this. So, what does it mean to give a p-derivation on a ring R? So having a P derivation And maybe let me call it delta is actually the same thing as having a lift of the Frobenius map. So you go on P, you have a Frobenius map. I want to lift it to R, by which I mean I want to write a ring homomorphism. I want to write a ring homomorphism on R, but when you go mod P, it is the Frobenius map. So, how do you write such a thing? Well, this lift, let me call my lift phi. What it should do is it kind of should take powers of things, but only mod P. So I'm allowed to take something in the ideal generated by P. And this delta, this will be my P derivation. This will be my p-derivation. It's the correction term that you have on the p-side. So, my p-derivation will be the thing that you get when you kind of compare your lift of Frobenius with the actual P powers and you divide by P. So I should note at this point, of course you can't always have lift Frobenius. There are rings, of course, for which you cannot lift the Frobenius. For which you cannot lift the Frovenius map. But today I'm going to tell you about a situation when there is a lift of Frobenius. And then later in other talks, you might see a little bit about situations when you don't have P derivations. But I'm interested in the following situations. So we have P derivations for first of all V. V does have a P derivation. Z does have a p-derivation. So let's think about it. If I go back to the definition I read on the previous board, I know where one goes, it goes to zero. And I kind of have an addition rule. From that addition rule, using induction, you can immediately discover that there is a unique p-derivation on z. Now, now that you know there's a unique one, instead of bothering with the awful induction, you may realize that you know what it should be. Because when you go mod P, Because when you go mod p, you know, Fermat's little theorem tells you, raise it to the p powers, that's the identity map. So actually, the identity map is going to be a lift of Frobenius. So what is your p-derivation? It should compare the identity map with the p-powers map and divide by p, right? This is the unique p-derivation on the integers. If you have an extension of the integers when they're Of the integers, when there is a p-derivation, it must always be this on the integers for the reasons I said before. Now, same sort of trick works for things like the p-adics. So, actually, if you have any complete unramified DVR with uniformized. With uniformizer p, you have a p-derivation, and then I'm running out of space, but I'll put it here. If you take a ring that has a p-derivation and you take a polynomial ring over it, it has a p-derivation too. So if B has a p-derivation, you can extend it to the polynomial ring by doing the silly thing. What you do is on B, it is what it is, and then you define. And then you define the image of each variable separately in kind of a free way, set them to whatever you want, and then define it on the rest by following the rules. That's always going to give you a p-dervation. So in fact, you might have many choices of p-derivations. And I want to note, I want to explain why, but this is sort of not a hard exercise from the things that I've said. These are the maps. These are the maps that we were searching for. So, what did we want? We wanted to decrease p-adic order somehow. So, suppose I take something not in the ideal generated by P. Oh, my goodness. Oh, okay. I'm good. I got confused about the time. By the way, do I have 50 minutes or one hour? That was unclear. One hour. Okay, I don't have to rush. Very good. So, take something not in P. And take the p-derivation of this times your favorite power of p. So I'm really saying this is an element of order, of piotic order in. You can find that when you take a p-derivation, you do decrease pi-iodic order. So you are going to get an element of piotic order one less. And this is an exercise that you can do by, say, seeing what it does on P, which is kind of written on the other board, and then using the And then using the product rule and realizing what should be going on. So these do decrease p-adic order. And so with that, we defined mixed differential operators. So now I'm getting to this joint work with Alessandro de Stephanie and Jack Jeffries. Well, okay, maybe I'm going to tell you what makes differential power. Going to tell you what mixed differential powers are. Yes. Yes, same exact deal. Pick the images of the variables to be whatever you want. Very good. I'm kind of focusing on polynomial movings today because I want to write a version of that theorem about polynomial movings, although my theorem will not just be about polynomials. Okay, so what are these mixed differential powers? Are these mixed differential powers? This is what the differential powers used to be. We're not very creative, so we just threw in a mix over there. I hope somebody realizes that I'm about to make a pun. When we call these mixed differential powers, it was a good joke, we thought, because this means several things. So these are the elements in R that are sent back into I by doing the following. By doing the following, you're allowed to take differential operators. So, okay, and now I'm going to be over some A, which will be, you know, something like Z or some DVR with uniformizer P. And I'm going to be over some ring R that has a P derivation. Delta and I'm going to choose one preservation. There might be many to choose from. Choose one. You're going to take differential, apply differential operators to your element. And then you'll apply your p-derivation and its powers. And then you're going to want to think about this. So you take a different operator of order B, and you take an A. Order B, and you take an eighth power here. I'll think of this as a mixed differential operator of order A plus B, which should be smaller than nano. If you like, we could write less or equal than n minus one to match what I wrote before. So the plan is we're in mixed characteristic and we're mixing this up, right? We're mixing up p derivations and differential powers. We have a folder. Maybe I shouldn't say this in public. We have a folder called mixer uppers because we, you know, mix it up. Because we, you know, mix it up. Anyway, so, oh well, no, I said it in public. Sorry. You could think I'm embarrassing myself and not anyone else. So the theorem with Alessandro de Stephanie and Jack Jeffrey from a million years ago before the pandemic. This was officially published. Was officially published in 2020. I gave a talk a few days ago when I kept writing 2000 instead of 2020. Somebody pointed out that maybe I was afraid of whatever happened in 2020. I don't know, but this is the year that this was published. This time I wrote it right. It was about something else, actually. So, AZ or some DVR with uniform IZP. And I'm going to write a technical statement. And I'm going to write a technical statement, but if you don't like the technical statement, think that I'm talking about a polynomial ring over A. Okay? So I just need R to be maybe a localization of a smooth A algebra. But I'm going to want it to have a p-dervation. So for example, you know, make AB Z. A B Z or an unramified DVR. So suppose that I take a prime ideal. And prime ideals kind of come in two flavors. There's the ones that intersect A and the ones that don't, right? If you don't intersect A, everything is beautiful. We're back like in the old setting of being over fields. Copy paste the proof from the field setting. The proof from the field setting, and it works. The other kind of primes, those are the interesting ones, are the ones that actually contain your P. That's where the problem arose in that example we saw before. And I'm going to want, as a technical assumption, that the extension from AP to the residue field at Q to be separable. So, for example, imagine. Imagine that A mod P is a perfect field. That's a situation where this holds. And the theorem is that indeed the symbolic powers are the mixed differential powers. So we did add what we needed to fix the failure of the theorem. And I'm sorry for raising the definition, but if you forget what a p-derivation is, you know, just remember it's the correction term in the lift. It's the correction term in a lift of revenues. You just have what you do need is you need to have a p-derivation on this ring R. Although I will say... I'm sorry? That's true. That's absolutely true. That's what I was about to say. Very good. But you know. Yeah. Good. Yes. Yes. Very good question. That's one of the things I was going to say next. Maybe I'll say it now. You chose a delta to begin with. So we wrote a definition that depends on the delta that you want, right? This definition depends on a choice of delta. This theorem tells you the definition does not depend on the choice of delta. And actually, the only way I know how to prove that it doesn't depend on the choice of delta delta delta delta Prove that it doesn't depend on the choice of delta is via this theorem. Okay, because at the end of the day, this has nothing to do with your choice of p-derivation. Okay, so corollary, I'll write it here, corollary from that theorem on the side, this does not depend on delta, but it did a priori, right? The definition clearly depended on delta. It turns out it does not. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so there's a very variations on this you could try to do, right? You can now try to apply compositions of these guys instead. What you can't do, it is kind of weird, is you really don't want to switch the order of these two, which is sort of bizarre. But it's that's life, I guess. Luis, you have a question also? That was the question. Yeah. Yeah, so when we were trying to do this, you know, we'd figured out that perturbations were the thing to do. That peter evasions were the thing to do. And we were playing around with what was the right definition, and we kind of run into all these roadblocks. In the end, the day we realized this is the thing you want to be ready for. Okay, so let me sketch the proof. Just to give you a sense of how one does something like this, I will say the roadmap I'll write, this is copied from the field setting. This is the field roadmap, but now you have to. The field roadmap, but now you have to do a little bit more work. So, the first thing you do, some things you prove are completely general and don't rely on pretty much any of my assumptions. So, for example, something that relies on nothing is that the mixed differential powers contain the ordinary powers, and that's easy. I mean, it's you know, slightly more technical than the differential power case, but it's doable. Power case, but it's doable. It's something I could give you as an exercise. Then you're going to show that if you start off with a prime ideal, or more generally, a primary ideal, the mixed differential powers are primary ideals. And now we're going to use one of the very elementary facts I wrote in the beginning. You have an ideal that is Q primary, and it continues. Primary, and it contains the power. So it contains the smallest ideal that contains the power and is q prime. So this kind of gives you half of the work you have to do. And both these things, this is always true, even in singular settings. And in fact, having this always be true can be useful for applications to singular settings. And I'll let Alessandro tell me more about that. Let Alessandro tell me more about that. So, even when this is not an equality, this is a useful statement. And so, now you want to prove the opposite containment. You want to show that the differential powers are contained in the symbolic powers. And containments are local statements. This is an easy exercise in commutative algebra. How do you prove this? How do you prove this? Well, it suffices to show this, you know, after localization. And you don't have to localize at every prime in the world. You just have to localize at the associated primes of the bigger thing, which is cooked up to have the same associated primes as the original Q, which is prime. So all you got to do is look for. So, all we've got to do is localize the Q. So, now we just have to prove that after localizing the Q, we have this. So, what are the steps you take? Step three, you show that forming mixed differential powers commutes with localization. And this is a little more complicated than the things above, but it is not too bad. But it is not too bad. Okay, so you kind of think, realize that your p-derivation on R kind of gives you a p-derivation on the localization by kind of doing the obvious thing and things work out well. But the key point, the key technical thing that actually uses the technical assumptions, the rest doesn't, but the point that really needs our technical assumptions is that now you'll have to consider a local ring. Now you've reduced to the problem of considering. Now you've reduced to the problem of considering the maximal ideal in a local ring, and you want to prove that the mixed differential powers are equal to the symbolic powers, which are just the powers for your maximum ideal. And this is both in the field setting and the mixed characteristic setting. That's the difficult part of the proof, or the more technical part of the proof, but it is true. So At the end of the day, the proof is really: you show the mixed differential powers satisfy the properties they must, so that they can't be anything but the symbolic powers. That's kind of the point. So, in particular, you know, one thing we might do with this, okay, first, I now have a description of symbolic powers as, you know, vanishing to some kind, right? Know vanishing to some kind, right? I think of the differential operators thing as really saying you vanish to a certain order because you take derivatives and you still vanish, right? And so, this to me is also pointing to us that if you want to do things with differential operators and mixed characteristic, you know, maybe you need some new differential operators in this arithmetic direction, and maybe p-derivations are the thing to consider. So, let me use Let me use my last few minutes to talk about some consequences. So, I've already told you one corollary, which says this definition didn't actually depend on the p-derivation that you chose. Let me also tell you, and it follows as a corollary of this, something that was already proved by Isenberg and Hoxter, which is that even in this mixed characteristic setting, you know, now you have an actual An actual polynomial ring over A. Then your symbolic powers are the intersections of the powers of the maximal ideals containing your ideal. So you can prove this through the equality with mixed differential operators. So you go from difference operators to this, to this in the middle. Sorry, you put difference operators in the middle and you kind of prove it's equal to both. Middle, and you kind of prove it's equal to both, which is much easier to do. Let me also point out that yes, we can breathe. We did solve the problem. Well, I'm going to show you the theorem really is true, at least in that easy example that we saw before. So, remember before, we thought about z and join x and the maximal ideal 2, x. And we had seen that the symbolic power. That the symbolic powers were not the differential powers. And now I'm claiming they are the mixed differential powers. Let's check this. Well, I want to think about what p-derivations do to 2 that's an element in z. I just apply the formula for z. Remember, because my lift for beans is the identity. So this is what I got to do, right? Compare the identity to raising to p and the Raising to p and dividing by two. So this is minus one, which thank God is not an element in my maximal ideal. This is a mixed differential operator of order one, right? Because there's one thing over here. It's saying that this mixed differential operator is going to send two outside of f. And so this will say that indeed two is not in the mixed differential panel. Pattern, which is a symbolic pattern, okay. At least in one example, um, we checked the theorem appears to be true, although I didn't quite write down what the full symbolic part is. I'm gonna end by perhaps spoiling a little bit of Jack's talk. Sorry, Jack. So, okay, think of this as an appetizer for his talk. I'm going to tell you about one. I'm going to tell you about one fun application that will be a really simple case of a much cooler theorem that he's going to talk about tomorrow. He's going to talk about some joint work with Mel Hoxter. And maybe I won't say out loud what it is. Maybe you've already read the abstracts. Maybe you know what it is that he's going to talk about. But so let me tell you about. But so let me tell you about the fun application that will lead us to what he'll talk about tomorrow. I think this is fun. So it's an application to the Jacobian criterion. So suppose that I take a polynomial ring over my A. And I take some F over this. And I want to think about when I want to think about the hypersurface, R mod F. And I want to think about the singular locus of this. I want to think about what primes can I localize that that I get things that are regular or not. Well, maybe. Well, let me say that Q is some prime that contains F. And let's ask ourselves: is this regular or not? Well, this being regular is equivalent to asking the elements. So, if you think about this as RQ mod, I guess, F over one in the localization, when you take a regular. When you take a regular thing and you localize it something and you want to know if that's regular, now it's now a quotient of a regular local ring. This being regular not is about this element being in the square of the maximum ideal or not. So this is saying that in this localized ring, this element is in the square. If I want to lift this statement up to my original polynomial ring, this is saying one. This is saying once I localize, I'm in the square. So I didn't point this out in the beginning, but if you think about our definition of symbolic powers, you want that when you localize the Q in particular, you're going to get the square. So what you want here is you want that F is in the symbolic power of this key. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, very good, very good. Um, well, if I'm in a mixed characteristic setting, I now know how to check that f is in the second symbolic power. I have to take all differential mixed differential operators of order up to one, apply them, and see that I live inside of Q. So I guess I need something like, you know, some silly. Something like, you know, some silly statements like F is in Q or F times whatever is in Q. And then you also need the operators of order one. There's basically two things to think about. You take your old school differential operators, which are generated by your partial derivatives, right? These are the things in order one. You want to used to live in Q, but now there's one more thing to track. You got to check. You got to check that your p-derivation, so you got to choose a p-derivation on your R. Q contains P. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm so sorry. Q must contain P. Otherwise, I wouldn't need this new thing. Okay. In fact, it would all be silly, right? So when Q is a prime that actually contains my P, which is the problem, I now have to add this condition to check. Condition to check that indeed I had. Oh, and now I should say, ah, okay, I got myself in trouble. I thought I was so clever, but I was not. Okay, now it's better. See, because I have to say, like, one of these things is not a Q, and that was just going to be a mess to write down properly. Okay, I think that is maybe a good place to say, if you're curious about how one of you. Curious about how one would do this, not for a hypersurface. It will not follow from anything I say. So, you've got to go to Jack's talk tomorrow. Well, and that's a good place to stop. So, thank you. Yeah. I think you're refreshed. Regular rings more general than polynomial regular rings? Let me repeat the question. Does this risk in a Gator theorem fail if you have polynomial rings that are more general than things like polynomial rings? Regular rings that are more general. So it considers, okay. If you ask about the statement about intersection with the maximum ideals, no way that is true, right? Because that would say that the symbolic power of any radical ideal would be the power of the unique maximal ideals. That's nonsense. That's nonsense. ideals that's nonsense that's not true okay um if you ask me about the statement about mixed sorry about equality with the differential powers and mixed differential powers i did tell you that that's true for for example for the maximal ideal right um so you just got to be careful about what it is that that you're asking about so certainly not that statement about intersections as maximum ideals good go ahead yeah just i think Yeah, just a bit vague question, but I wonder can you write can you write the definition of these kind of differential powers by using the link with provenience instead of the key derivation in a kind of nice way? So let me repeat the question. A vague question. Can we write down the definition of these mixed differential powers? Maybe using the lift of Frobenius somehow instead of this P dervation? And maybe now it's me adding, perhaps, because we feel like lifts of Frobenius are friendly. Feel like lips of Frobenius are friendlier things to us than this funky maps? My intuition would be that the answer should be no, right? Because these are really the ones that are playing the role of differential operators, and that's what I would expect to use. The lift of Frobenius is something you can use to write this differential operator. So I guess, you know, a cheap way to answer your question would be, you know, put in here a formula for your p-derivation using the lift of Frobenius, but that's a really cheap answer, right? But that's a really cheap answer, right? Otherwise, I think there's nothing reasonable that you should be able to write. Go ahead, Ray. So, the follow-up on Frank's question: Okay, is that the Zariski Nagata theorem can certainly fail with the exponent one? Yes. Okay. And the question then is, if you choose your regular ring in such a way that it is correct, Correct with exponent one. In other words, P is actually the intersection of all the maximals of R. Yes. Doesn't become true in that case. Okay, so let me repeat Ray's question. So a follow-up to Renke's question. This can certainly fail even with like equal to one, you know, this equality between the differential powers and the powers. But imagine that you do pick something where your first power is indeed the intersection. First power is indeed the intersection of these maximal ideals. Does that then force you to have equality for all of them? So, okay, one answer to your question is that Eisenberg and Hochster proved that if in a more general setting, if you pick a set of prime ideals whose intersection is your ideal I, and then when you localize it them, you have So I have to think. There's some extra technical condition I got to add. But if you kind of pick your original prime ideals correctly, then it is true that the symbolic power is the intersection of the powers of those maximum ideals. That's the theorem of Eisenbutt and Hochster. Now I have to think about, but maybe that was your question, right? It was about that equality. Yes. So Eisenbutt and Hoxer in 79 said the answer was yes to your question. Very good question. Oh, yeah. Are there any Zoom questions? Really quick. Oh, yeah. Are there any Zoom questions? Oh, I see some chats. Let's see if I can. Yeah. So Takagi is asking, what was, so I couldn't catch the question about the Isenberg-Maser conjecture, but did someone ask about the mixed characteristic case? I think Kurano and Roberts constructed a counterexample in residue characteristic two. So I didn't know about that comment at the end. I was asked earlier if I knew about the mixed characteristic case, and I said, About the mixed characteristic case, and I said, I do not know. I think the first thing to look at is the prime characteristic kind of example and try to look at it in a mixed characteristic. Somebody also asked me what the example was. I kind of know what it is, but I didn't want to write it on the spot since it wasn't in my notes. But I think that's something to think about. But I would love, Shunsuke, if you have a reference for this Kureno and Roberts paper, I personally would love to see it because I don't know about that result. It because I don't know about that result. Very, very good, very good comment. Thank you. Are there more questions from home or Zoom? You might not be at home. I don't know. Oh, maybe not. Other questions in the room? Louisa has a question. If there are lifters of ovaries, is it possible? Lifting of Frovenius, is it possible to get lifting of cardiomaps? Oh, good question. So, if you have a lifting of Frovenius, can you get a lifting of like cardiomaps? I don't know the answer to that question. I think it's a very good question. And I'll think about it over the coffee break. Good. Any more questions?
