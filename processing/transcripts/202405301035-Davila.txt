The next speaker is Professor John Damila, and his talk is about blow up for the Kila Secum system in the plane. Please go ahead. So thank you. I want to thank the organizers for the opportunity to give a talk here. And apologies for not being able to travel there. Okay, so I want to. Okay, so I want to discuss blow-up for the Padlak Keller-Siegel system in R2. So it's this system of equations here. It is the parabolic elliptic system. So UT satisfies the heat equation with this drift term, where the drift is compute, the drift V or is generated by V, which is just the. By V, which is just the inverse Laplacian of U, wearing in two dimensions, and we take this inverse Laplacian as being convolution with the Newtonian kernel, and we consider a positive initial condition. So, this is a classical model for monocellular organisms, which move randomly and are subject to drift due to some chemical attractant, which is emitted by the. Attractant which is emitted by the cells themselves. Okay, so there are several Keller-Siegel type equations in the literature. This is one of the most basic ones. And so it was already noted that, well, first the total mass, which is just the integral of U in space, is a constant. And this constant determines whether there is blow-up or not. So, Jegan-Lookhaus proves that the solution is global if the mass is small and blows up in finite time if the mass is large. And the precise threshold for blow-up is 8π, and this was found by Doulbot and Pertin, and also in this later work by Blanchet D'Albeau and Pertin. So there are other quantities. There are other quantities that are either conserved or satisfy a nice equation. So one of them is the second moment. The second moment is the integral of u times the modulus of x squared. And for solutions that have enough decay, the time derivative of the second moment is a constant. The constant is over here, depends only on the mass. And you see here that mass being equal to a pi or bigger or less than a pi. Or bigger or less than Aπ plays an important role in the analysis. And another quantity of interest is the center of mass. So for this equation, the center of mass is preserved in time. So let me describe. So the main results I want to present are for the case of mass equal to 8π, which we call the critical mass case, or mass bigger than 8. A mass bigger than a pi, the supercritical mass. But let me say first that if m is less than a pi, then from this formula over here, you see that the second moment grows linearly in time. And you can then be it is possible to prove that the solution actually tends to zero in a self-similar way. And there are many stars. And there are many studies about the asymptotic profile and the exact rate of convergence for the solution as time goes to infinity. So now I want to discuss what happens when the mass is equal to 8π, and for this, it is useful to know that there is a family of steady states of the Keller-Syrial system. Of the Keller-Siegel system, and this family is explicit. They all come from this single explicit function over here through a shift in space and a scaling lambda. So this family of solutions also appears and is connected to the Hardy-Littlewood-Soviet inequality. These are the minimizers of the logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Solev inequality. Solving inequality and these functions they all also satisfy the L'Uville equation, in particular, this one. Actually, the natural law of this function is a solution of the L'Uville equation in R2. So, and one thing to notice is that the second moment of this family of solutions is infinite. Okay, so So when the mass of the initial condition is 8π, then what happens really depends on whether the initial condition has finite or infinite second moment. So there are results about stability of this family of steady states by Planchet, Carlin Carrillo, Lopez Gugome, Nagai, and Yamada. So under suitable conditions for, let's say, small perturbations and even Say small perturbations and even bigger perturbations of the steady states, you have stability. Carlina Figalli also obtains a rate of convergence towards an element of the family if the initial condition is the correct one. And then there are more strange phenomena also happening if or for some special initial conditions, the solution can oscillate between different states. Steady states in this family. On the other hand, if the initial condition has fast decay, in particular, has finite initial second moment and the mass is equal to a pi, then the solution must blow up as time goes to infinity in the form that u behaves like a direct delta centered, well, direct delta times. Well, they are delta times h pi and center at some point q, which is actually the center mass of the initial condition. Okay, and we are interested in stability questions, but also in the profile of the solution when it blows up. So, here this is blow up in infinite time as t goes to plus infinity. And these first works over here by Chauvines and Syrian campus formally describe what Formally describe what is the form of the blow-up as t equals to infinity. So, this is for the case of mass equal to e pi and initial condition with fast decay, let's say, then the solution, at least for x on compact sets, the solution must look like an appropriate shift and scale of this function capital U. This function capital U, which is a steady state with a fixed scale. And the scale lambda has been determined formally in this work as one over square root log of t as t goes to infinity. And so this work was formal, but then later Gaul and Masmoudi really constructed a radar solution that has blow-up radial solution that has blow-up as t goes to infinity and has this profile. And they also prove the stability of the blow-up, but in the regular case. So the stability means, so if they constructed a special initial condition that leads to a blow-up with this profile, and they prove that for any small perturbation of this initial condition in the radial case, and with mass equal to a pi, the solution still blows up and is Still blows up and it still blows up in this form over here. So the proof of Gola-Masmudi uses a spectral gap of campus and Tolbo, which is only known in the radial case, although there is numerical evidence that this spectral gap is true in general. So if the spectral gap is correct in general, then the result of Google and Massmoodie can, or the technique they use. Or the technique they use can be extended for non-radial perturbations. So, the first theorem I want to present is that one can construct an initial condition that has blow-up with the profile described before. And together with the existence of the solution, we prove a stability of blow-up in general without radial. In general, without radial symmetry assumption. So there is an initial condition u0 star with mass 8π and finite second moment. Actually, the decay of this initial condition is very fast. So that for any perturbation, and here I'm being a bit, I'm hiding in what sense, but with fast decay and small enough. So for any perturbation of U0 star, which has max eight pi, the solution still blows up and in the form Up and in the form discussed before. So it is the scaled version of this function capital U with the parameter lambda of t that as t goes to infinity has this behavior log of one over square root of log of t okay and then let me describe a little bit the case of supercritical mass. So if m is bigger than a pi, the solution has to the solution has to blow up okay um i and well and it has to blow up in finite time and one way to see this at least when everything has fast decay is in the formula for the the time derivative of the second moment if everything has fast decay then the second moment is fine my mass is bigger than if pi Is fine, and mass is bigger than epi, then the rate of change of the second moment is negative. So at some point, this if the solution doesn't blow up, this quantity, the second moment will be negative, but for positive initial condition, this cannot happen. Anyway, so for mass bigger than a pi, the solution blows up in finite time, and there were formal expansions of the profile of. Of the profile of globe by a radio Velastis and Velasquez, and then later rigorous constructions of solutions that really have this profile. And so Rafael and Schwer constructed radially symmetric solutions with the profile described by radon glasses. I will show it in a minute, the profile. And a colloquial, gold, massmouth, and Nuyen. They construct They construct radial initial conditions that lead to blow-up, but they also prove a non-radial stability of this of blow-up. So what is the profile that was discovered by Raymond Velasquez is that, again, the solution must look like a scaled version of the function capital U. By the way, this scaling is natural because this is the factor. Because this is the factor one over lambda squared here in front is the one that makes this scaling preserved mass. But what they discover is that the rate of concentration is given by this rate over here, which is square root of capital T minus T. So capital T is the time of blow-up. There is a universal constant. This little gamma over there is the Euler-Maskelonian constant. So it is this self-similar rate multiplied by something that goes to zero with this. That goes to zero with this exponential of square root of log. And so, Colot, Gul and Masmoudi constructed solutions with this shape. They proved the stability of that. And they also found initial conditions that lead to other blow-up rates, but these blow-up rates are unstable. Misogushi also showed that. So, also showed that this profile, this way of blow-up, is the only allowed mechanism, at least in the radial case. So, for radial and non-negative solutions, the blow-up always has to be in this form. So, this is the result. Sorry, I didn't mention the collaborators. This result is Federico Buseghi, Manuel Del Pino, and Monica Mus. Busaghi, Manuel Del Pino, and Monica Musso. So we prove that for any given points in R2, there is a solution that blows up at the same time at these given points. And actually, we can prescribe the mass of this solution to be: so here it is below: the mass is k times m, where m M, where m is any constant in a range from 8π to 8 pi plus epsilon, and this epsilon is almost a universal constant. So for the total mass close to k times 8π, but in this range, then there is a capital T and an initial condition that leads to a solution that has this. That leads to a solution that has this form: so simultaneous blow-up at each point with the rate lambda j, which has the same expansion as was mentioned before. But maybe there is a little correction to the point, but the point approaches as t goes to capital T to the prescribed points in R2. So, what is the difference with the previous? So what is the difference with the previous results? Well, we construct the solution allowing concentration at k different points. I mentioned that the Colod, Goel, Masmudi, Nuyen proved the stability of their solution. I mean, improved the stability of blow-up for their solution, but we have not proven that in our situation yet. But our method. But our method prescribes us, sorry, allows us to say that there is or allows us to describe a connection between the total mass of the solution and the time capital T of blow-up. So this is what I want to describe here. So for simplicity, let me do this in the case of blow-up at a single point. So in that case, if you case if you start with a very small capital T, okay, then for any m in a in a range which is an integral of this form, 8 pi plus an epsilon that depends on capital T, which has an asymptotic formula, and 8 pi plus a universal epsilon. So for any mass in this range, there is solution blowing up at capital T and with the profile described before. So this capital T is So this capital T, sorry, this epsilon of capital T, this number that depends on capital T, has this expansion as T goes to zero. And the difference with the result of Collot, Gaul, Mass Moudi, and Nuyen is that, well, they construct solutions with mass close to 8π, but it is not known exactly what is the value of the mass as a function of capital T. So given a capital T, they consider. capital T. So given a capital T, they construct one. If you take capital T is small enough, they construct another solution. And what mass does that solution have is not clear from the construction. On the other hand, this description over here tells us that the mass of the initial of the solution is in some integral that you can control very well. So So, a little bit about the proof. So we start first by constructing a solution with the desired properties. And so what we do is find an approximate solution, u star, that has more or less an explicit form. And yeah, the first term of this. First term of this approximate solution is something that is more or less natural. So it is the steady state center at some point C of t and scaled by lambda t. Here is again the scaling lambda t and multiplied by a cutoff. And the reason for this is that the well in infinite time, for example. In infinite time, for example, we want all solutions to have fast decay and so also because there is a heat equation in the back, one expects that the real solution will decay much faster than this function capital U when x is far from the origin. So a better approximation than capital U alone is u multiplied by Katov, or really I should be a Gaussian. Anyway. be a Gaussian. Anyway, and once you introduce the cutoff, then the mass of this object doesn't have, it's not equal to the mass you want to prescribe. Let's say we're in infinite time, so we want the mass to be eight pi, so it's natural to introduce another parameter, alpha, that somehow corrects the mass of this. So there is a construction of an approximate solution depending on parameters, lambda, the scaling. Lambda, the scaling x and alpha. And for the moment, we leave them as parameters. Then we realize this is not a good approximation. We have to add more terms to these approximate solutions. And at some point, we reach a very good approximation so that we can study the true solution as these approximate solutions and we prove estimates for this perturbation. Prove estimates for this perturbation, essentially by looking at a linearized problem. And yes, the estimates for this linearized problem or they depend on whether there are some conditions satisfied that I call orthogonality conditions. And so fortunately, there are parameters that Parameters that can help in making these conditions satisfied. So, in the end, there is an adjustment of the parameters that is needed to find good estimates for this remainder. And let me just mention a little bit how these equations look like. So, for the parameter lambda to be Lambda to be a good choice in the sense that the previous workshop analogy conditions are satisfied. In our scheme, this is different from the works I mentioned before, it is convenient that lambda satisfies a sort of non-local integral or integral differential equation. So this is a sort of convolution for the function actually lambda squared dot dot is squared dot dot is time derivative. So this non-local term plus this lambda squared over 2t should be zero for the scheme to work. So we need to construct a function lambda satisfying this. This is the form of the equation for lambda in the case that t, in the case of infinite time, when t goes to infinity. In finite time, the equation is similar. Actually, we have the same sort of non-local We have the same sort of non-local operator over here, but there is a constant appearing here that depends on the solution. And then there is this term over here that involves again the Euler-Maskeloni constant. So the way of constructing the solution somehow leads naturally to these non-local equations that we cannot solve exactly. We cannot solve exactly, but we can produce approximations to this equation which are good enough to make the scheme work. And as I mentioned before, a key ingredient is to find estimates for a linearized equation. And here I am just showing the form of the linearized equation that we want to solve. So when we change variables and we go to this scaled variable y, this is the equation we have to solve. This is the equation we have to solve. And here, this operator L0 is the one that you get from linearizing the Keller-Siegel equation around the steady state capital U. And it looks like this operator over here, which is, well, the first term is just the divergence term, but it is non-local because the regional equation involves Laplacian. The regional equation involves Laplacian inverse. And so we find estimates for this for solutions to this linearized equation, given right-hand sides that are sufficiently decaying in space and time and satisfy certain orthogonality conditions that I will not have time to describe. So with the techniques that I presented, Some objectives that we are working on are the following. In the case of mass bigger than Aπ, there is a formal paper by Seki, Sugiyama and Velaskis describing other types of blow-up, not concentration at a single point and not concentration at points far away. This is a form of concentration at points that are moving at exactly the self-similar rate as T goes to Kappa. similar rate as t goes to capital T. So this looks like a peak. One term of this sum is a peak centered at the point aj times square root of capital T minus T and scaled with the parameter lambda that now has a similar expression as before, but it's not exactly the same. So these concentration points collapse as T goes to capital T and the collapsing takes place at action takes place at actually, for example, vertices of a regular polygon. In reality, what is needed is that this equation is satisfied for the points of concentration. And also with the same type of techniques, we hope to do the following. Carlina and Figali proved for perturbations of the steady state proved convergence to one of the family, but the convergence is very bad, is one over one over square root of log of t as t goes to infinity and we can get well we think we can get better convergence in the the form of a polynomial decay as time goes to infinity okay so i think yeah this is all i wanted to say thank you for your attention Comments. Okay, so I have a question. So, is it possible to extend your beautiful results from the parabolic elliptic type to the parabolic parabolic system? Yeah, we have asked ourselves the same question. For the moment, I am not sure. I would guess that, yes. But yes. But yes, I think yes, under some additional hypothesis. So I'm not sure in general. Okay, I see. Thank you. So any question or comments from online audience? Yes, I have a question. Maybe I'm totally wrong, but you have this nice example of multiple blow-up. Multiple blow-up, and then you say that you don't know anything about stability. So, I was wondering what you mean by stability, because my first guess would be that if you have a generic small perturbation, then it is highly unlikely that the blow up and all the points will be at the same time, capital T. Could you comment on that? Yeah, thank you for your question. So, when I was talking about stability for this, Talking about stability for this, I meant the ideal stability statement for one blow-up point. Okay, that would be that if we produce, we construct the solution, then any small initial perturbation of the initial condition will lead to blow-up at a single point, maybe shifted slightly, and maybe the time of blow-up also changes slightly. So, this we haven't proved. This we haven't proved. And in the case of k points with k bigger than one, what is expected is that you have to be, I mean, that there are conditions or the initial condition must be in a certain manifold of the right co-dimension for this stability. So it's not complete stability, stability up to a certain co-dimension. This would be the conjecture for this solution. Okay, I understand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, any question? This is Dr. President, Professor Diabila. Very nice talk. And I also would like to thank you for your efforts to come to Krelovna. You waited, your plane was first cancelled, and the following day, you waited at the airport for over nine hours, and then it was. And then it was not clear if we could make it, but anyway, I thank you very much. We would have been happy to see you here. But anyway, thank you very much for your efforts to come here. And also, thank you for your very nice talk. No, thank you. Okay, let's thank Professor Davila Gir.
