Thank you for introduction. So, this is Sebastian Bo Deval from Laboratoire Didraulique, an hydraulics lab from École des Pont, which means my colleagues are usually engineers working on natural water flows rather than mathematicians. So, first I'd like to thank you for this, I mean the organizers, for this interesting workshop. For this interesting workshop. And also, I'd like to acknowledge the support by Colot Debris Group, the Materials, which is an INRIA applied mathematician group. And last, I'd like to dedicate that talk to someone many of us have known and shared the enthusiasm for mathematics and polymer fridge, in particular, John Barrett, who passed away a bit more than one year ago. So I will. So, I will talk today about a non-standard viewpoint about viscoelastic stresses in flids. And I say non-standard nowadays, but it forces me to come back to the origin, and it would have not be so unusual maybe a few decades ago. So let's come back to the foundation of viscoelastic stresses in Friedz. And it forces me to start at the very beginning. It forces me to start at the very beginning where flies begin. So, freeds begin with the Euler model of what? Of a Eulerian description of a continuum. That means he uses field variables. So let's recognize the velocity and the mass density, which depends only on the spatial coordinates x, which lives in a Euclidean ambient space, and erase any dependence on a particle label. Dependence on the particle label, which has been made continuous by Lagrange, for instance. That model is now well understood as an expression of Hamilton stationary principle. So it means you have an action and you can recognize energy conservation and momentum conservation, where you do these only functions of the spatial coordinates. Okay. And of course, momentum. Coordinates, okay, and of course, momentum conservation at the state at the level of smooth solution is implied by those representations through what phi t, which is you recall the placement function, which is the configuration at time t of the particle whose label can be mapped through the inverse since we are working at that level with smooth configuration field. Okay, and that model. Okay, and that model was successful. Why? Because, in particular, you can define univocal motions. The minimal sense is a small time motions well defined by a word by specifying an internal energy that depends only on the density. So, if you choose it well, the system is a well-known symmetric hyperbolic system. And then, small-time motions are. And then small time motions are well defined as soon as you work in the class of smooth functions and with smooth initial configurations. Okay, so that is the beginning. And next, I'd like to move on to real friends, which people started to do soon after, I would say, in the 19th century, mainly when Cauchy has consolidated continuum mechanics through the concept of stress. Cauchy was a professor at ecological. Press, Cauchy was a professor at École des Pont at that time. And people were looking at better models. So, for instance, if you start at the level of a symmetric hyperbolic system, causal motions that depends on time as a semi-group are well defined for real freedom, including some thermodynamic constraints. Constraint which were also developing at that time. For instance, shocks are well-defined 1D shocks. If you account in addition to momentum and mechanics for temperature, okay, I will not enter that at that level, but I will discuss whether viscous imperfections. So the introduction of viscosity at the level of a compressible continuum. Um, continuum can only be justified as an extra stress which is purely entropic. If you consider the Newtonian law here, which people came up after Navier, a professor at École des Pont, to Saint-Vnon, similarly, Poisson and Stocks. So all those people came up with that formula, and we are now widely used to that model, although it has some fundamental defects, which is the stress. Defects, which is the stress is purely entropic. Waves propagate at infinitely fast speed. And more importantly, also, the constants, the viscosities, bulk and shear viscosities are not material parameters. They are dynamic constants. They depend on the configuration. So that's why people came after with another question, and very soon after. And very soon after, Maxwell, just after, proposed a model that depends on material parameters to account for what? For viscosity in gases as soon as 1867. And to go forward, what he proposed is to interpret that empirical expression for viscous stresses in the limit of a relaxation of a model with Of a model with a relaxation time, which is supposedly also a material constant. The problem is, of course, that at that time it was very difficult to measure such material parameters as what you see here in the original article of Maxwell. He called it e for the elasticity and t for the relaxation time. So, a mu dot here, which is the shear viscosity, is nothing but the elasticity divided by a relaxation time. Okay. Divided by a relaxation time. Okay, so that was a problem, and the model was more or less forgotten for one century. And the question is: now, when did it occur that it was useful? Only when people came up with a model, a fruit, I mean a real fruit, that would allow for measurements of such things, especially after the Second World War, when people were very much interested by rubber and polymer fluids were. Threads were attracting attention. So, people wanted to predict, to compute, and to explain also what they saw. And Weisenberg, a mathematician, was one of the first to make the connection between Maxwell model and polymerfluid. Eckhart also did the connection. And they observed some features also of the polymerfreed. That question, of course, at the same time. That question, of course, at the same time that it makes it relevant. It questioned the extension of a Maxwell model, which was 1D to multi-dimensional flows. So that was the beginning of the question about how to make it multi-dimensional. And Aldroyd soon after came up with a concept which is material frame indifference, which means which is a very much stronger assumption than. As I mentioned, then simply a Galilean invariance, the stress, the extra stress, as concerns the viscoelastic stress, is required to be objective, to be independent of even a time-dependent rotation of the frame. So it means you have a very constraining notion of acceptable extra stress. And today, this is a very well-accepted formulation as a departure. Formulation as a departure for mischolastic fluid modeling. People work with an incompressible model of fluid at, let's say, constant temperature. We will see after why this is a problem. And they fix the density then and they add to the pressure, which is then dependent on this, the two components which depends on the polymer suspension. The polymer suspension, the solvent, which is purely viscous, and the polymer one, which is Maxwell transformed into a multi-dimensional equation, multi-dimensional version, where you recognize here an objective derivative. You have different choice among the Gordon School derivatives, and this could be the departure. Still, many questions arise. One was could One was could we account for shared inning, shared, which are things not really well grasped by that model. And many people sticked at the well-seen entropic dependence of the stress. So they started looking at the statistical physics foundation of that formula for entropic stress and the formula. And the formula was readjusted by Ruse team and many people working with the statistical physics interpretation of entropy. And for instance, today I will stick to Maxwell model, but the question would be how to make the statistical physics suggest you new formula for the entropy. Okay, so at that level, we could just stop and say this is a question for physicists. This is a question for physicists. In fact, it echoes the presentation by Tony Lolière, who showed us that you could come up with a very complicated model at the statistical physics level and then try to infer an entropy, then an entropic extra stress for the macroscopic level. Okay, this is indeed an art for statistical physics, and it could be justified. It could be justified from the continuum mechanics, I would say, purely macroscopic viewpoint today with what people sometimes call the metriplectic viewpoint. So generic is one instance of such a justification to explain how you can connect microscopic level with macroscopic level. Okay, today I will stick to the fact that it requires at some point the introduction. It requires at some point the introduction for justification with a second principle expressing thermodynamics. It requires the introduction of another variables, let's call it C. And in that framework of statistical physics, it's a tensor interpreted as the expectation of this matrix, which is the conformation of X is a vector of the Vector of the orientation and extension of a dumbbell, which follows typically a Langevin equation. That means it is over-dumped Langevin here. It is a static equilibrium of a polymer, of a just a very basic polymer model with two bits and one spring, which is heated by that environment at constant temperature. Okay, and the model. Okay, and the model statistical physics can be worked around to come back to that purely macroscopic model through a formula which I have put here. So this is called, okay, I've just forgot, but the Carnot's expression for the connection, for the stress formula. And okay, at that point, as I said, you could stop, but in fact, it raises still. You could stop, but in fact, it raises still many questions and questions for engineers. So, one question is: how can you use that actually for forecasts? And when you compare, so this is a problem as I will explain just after, but it also raises a question of does it really account for temperature change, which we see in non-isothermal flows? And it doesn't. It turns out that even in rubber-like polymer fruits, it turns out Like polymer fruits, it turns out that some part of the elasticity is not purely entropic, that means only purely attributed to some diluted polymer molecules, but it is also linked to the deformation of the whole fluids, like compressibility in a gas. It means then here to the suspension, if you mean. And then other questions come. And then other questions come. And before going to the one solution to that, and a new formulation, a new interpretation of viscoelasticity, which I find beneficial to some mathematical understanding of the viscoelasticity. Let me mention here that if people often nowadays justify, for instance, that formula with an upper convective derivative for the stress. The stress linked to dumbbells. You can also just identify here with the lead derivative associated to the Cauchy grain deformation. So there is no necessity for such a link. So there are different links. Here are some. So the first thing I'd like to mention here is that the model you saw just before has been used extensively by many people and with engineering viewpoint. With engineering viewpoint, essentially, and the fact that you have infinitely fast propagation speed is written down in it because they work with an incompressibility assumption. And usually they add some viscous suspension so that also not only to account for real physics, but so that the model is actually computable. And in fact, it turns out that those models have some Have some instability, numerical instability. When you approach what I would call the purely elastic limit, when you think of the Maxwell simple model, it means when you have a very large relaxation time and you forget about the suspension. Actually, people worked about the connection with elasticity, which is deeply linked with what I mentioned before, the non-isothermal flows. How was that tackled? It was tackled by people with a different community. People with a different community, mostly, I believe. People from the mechanics, rational mechanics at that time. And there are mechanicians with a strong mathematical background and maybe unfortunately too obscure to abstract formulation. So after Truzdel and all, and sometimes they didn't really come up with a practical, useful way, except the K BKZ model, which is a very specific. which is a very specific fading memory material, where the conformation which you showed just before, which had that very particular, okay, come back here, the conformation tensor, which had that very particular evolution law. In fact, since you can interpret it also from a purely macroscopic viewpoint here and recall the derivative of the The derivative of the deformation tensor, you can make the connection at a purely macroscopic level. So that would be a nice different link without statistical physics to what? To hyper-elasticity, then to a model where viscoelasticity is linked not with pure entropy, but also with elasticity. There are other problems with that model, although one of our attendants will confirm today that he did verify that the model was useful for mathematical interpretation. But the point is that the model has not been used very much because it is quite difficult to use. You have to put that integral formula within the differential ones for the momentum balance. And it has not been worked much around for now. Around four, I mean, a shield in theory, all those difficulties which are additional to the Maxwell Freed concept, could not really be treated within that frame. And in fact, people could only change the formula here for what is called the fading memory kernel. They could invent different fading memory, but it was not really physical, it was really abstract and not connected. Abstract and not connected to real physics. And in fact, it was not really useful because what is shown, in fact, in Michael Renadi paper, I think, is that only lower conductive and upper conductive Maxwell model are actually 100% well posed. I mean, for very smooth conditions. Okay, there are plenty of assumptions, but they were the best model coming up from that study. So, what I suggest. So, what I suggest today is to look at hyperlink between viscoelasticity and hyper-elasticity from a different viewpoint. And I will come up with a model which is a first-order system of conservation nodes that extends the usual polyconvex. Why polyconvex? Because it would be dealt also elsewhere for Walposness, polyconvex elastodynamics of hyper-elastic materials that allows. Materials that allows watts that allows viscoelastic flows of macroscued compressible, of course, and then formally contains heavy stocks. So, the good point is the elastic stresses, they are not in the frame of viscoelastic stresses, they are not purely entropic, but they have some energetic origin. Then shear waves can be propagated at finite way, finite speed, and it still handles incompressible flows asymptotically, of course. Asymptotically, of course, in a low-Mach number limit. And it is also compatible with the second principle formalism. Of course, that means we can make a dependence on temperature. I will not go very far in that direction because it has a lot of complexities, but for people familiar with thermoelasticity, it will be clear. Okay, just one point. I think that direction was more or less, I would say, tried by I would say, tried by people, a famous chemist in particular, Beris, in the 90s, but they came up with a hyperbolic model that was not very satisfying, and it has many failures. So the connection is not direct. So now I will go back to elastodynamics and explain to you how they introduce these coelastic stresses in elastodynamics. So the first point is to connect elastodynamics with fluids. So as you remember, Euler Uh, you remember, Euler model could be derived according to uh Lagrange-Hamilton principle. And in fact, if you remember about phi t as being the configuration, the configuration, the placement of the configuration at one variable was not introduced which is essential to deal with general fluids, is the gradient. The gradient, the deformation gradient, and well, we use only its determinant. And of course, for Friday, it is very practical to reduce the system of equations. So, this is one equation for the deformation gradient that comes from the definition from the placement function, and which implies the equation, which is a conservation law for determinants. The system can be. The system can be reduced by seeing that the stress in a fluid doesn't depend on the full deformation gradient, but only on its determinants. And then that's how you came up with Euler just by erasing the first equation. And you have a reduced system that has been worked around very much by people around Marden, I think. You make different material assumptions and you came up with different reduced versions of the Lacon. Different reduced version of the Lagrange and Milton principle. The point is that here I want to make the connection with elasticity, and I will not forget about, I will not forget the first equation. And I will show you how you go to a Yellowan description of elastic, hyper-elastic materials. Well, just by choosing an internal energy that does not Internal energy that does not depend only on the determinant, but as is well known for the New Wickland model, on the full deformation gradient here in a convex way. So you have that Cauchy stress, and this is the Eulerian description of hyper elastic materials, of the elastodynamics of hyperlastic materials. And this is completely equivalent at the level of smooth solution with the material description. So here I introduce what is I introduce what is sorry to interrupt you. You're slightly over time already, so please come to an end soon. Sorry. Okay, so this is the usual connection. And to finish in a second, I need to introduce, okay, so I need to introduce viscoelastic stresses. So I do that by introducing an additional material variable, which is Material variable, which is reminiscent of what people do when they introduce the conformation tensor. They introduce what? A second level of description to explain where thermodynamics and exchange with forces from a different level, polymer extensions, could express. And the good point is that, in fact, we can introduce something which is only advective, a material variable, which depends. Variable which depends on the reference configuration plus a source terms. This is completely compatible with hyper-elasticity if we looked here at the stress, which is given by that LMOS free energy. And the connection with KBKZ is clear. In fact, KBKZ has just rephrased that differential equation as using its explicit solution. Explicit solution and additional assumption to put the formula here inside 12 instead of A. But it makes it integral and then very difficult to solve. What I suggest is to keep the level of description at the pure conservation system of differential system of conservation laws. Well, it allows, of course, multi-time solution in the usual polyconvex setting. The usual polyconvex setting. So the difficulty is to show that we have an equation, we have an energy which is actually polyconvex in all variables, including the new one. In fact, the new one is not very practical to show polyconvexity. You have to change it to anything which is a function of it because it is simply advective. And using, for instance, Y, which is For instance, y, which is the inverse of the square, you can actually show that you are polyconvex, and then you have a well-posed model. Uh, this is the equation for the energy. You have a well-posed model for small-time smooth motion. And it offers, I think, many entry points for such questions as how to deal with compressibility. Then it means actually account for non-isothermal flows where there are some configuration. where there are some configuration dependence on of the elasticity and on the polymer conformations. And of course it offers also a link with different imperfections in fluids because this coelasticity, of course it is also useful for rubber like fluids but it is also being looked at for many glassy systems. Glassy systems, which are not only simple dilute polymer fluids, but which have some more different non-viscoles stresses. So just the parameter A, I think, is a good statistical parameter to go in that direction. And we stop here because I'm running out of time, but I am ready to answer questions. I suggest you look at an To look at an article just in press in M2AN if you want all the heavy details. Thank you very much.
