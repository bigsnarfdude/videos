Tell us about the top weight rational homology of AG. Thank you so much, Jenny and Jeremy, for organizing this exciting conference. I'm delighted to speak to you today. First, before I forget, I want to just thank a bunch of people and acknowledge a bunch of people. So I'll try to run some names across the screen like a movie. So my co-authors on this project are Madeleine Brandt at Brown, a postdoc. Brandt at Brown, a postdoc. Juliette Bruce is a postdoc at Berkeley. Margarita Mello co-led this project. She's at Rome. And graduate students Gwyneth Moreland and Corey Wolfe at Harvard and Tulane as well. This work was initiated at the Women in Algebraic Geometry Virtual Workshop at ICER, which I was happy to coordinate with Antonella Grassi, Rahini Ramadas, Julie Rana, and Isabel Boat. You'll see in this talk that the project itself benefited a lot from relying on work of Elbaz Rassalm, Gambel and Soule, and we're grateful to them for answering a few key emails. And finally, Ursula Tomasi gave us some very valuable observations that I'll try to speak about at the end. I want to also acknowledge ongoing Ongoing conversations with Francis Brown, Soren Galagius, Sam Ruszewski, and Sam Payne, especially the joint work with Galagius and Payne, sort of inspired this project. And these ongoing conversations, I don't have a paper to point you to at the moment, but they've definitely sort of reframed and helped me understand better the work that I'm presenting today. Okay, so let me get started. Okay, so this talk is about aging. I'm going to work over C. I'm going to work over C. So when I talk about this space, I mean a complex moduli space. It's a moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension G. And for the purpose of this conference, there's a fairly sort of brief way to get at it. It's the quotient of a space called Hg, the Ziegl upper half space, by the action of a symplectic group, sp 2gz. So here this Hg, think of it as a, you know, Think of it as a higher-dimensional analog of the upper half-plane in the complex plane. This is the space of symmetric matrices with complex entries of size g by g, whose imaginary part regarded as a symmetric real matrix is positive definite. And there's an action. There's an action of a symphonic group. So if I write it Symphonic group. So if I write it a matrix in block form, ABCD, then this action is, it sends tau to a tau plus b times c tau plus t inverse. And the quotient is ag, so that's one way to construct it. Though this construction doesn't make the most important, for me, feature of AG at all apparent. Namely, I claim that AG. Namely, I claim that AG is a variety. So it has algebraic structure. And of course, I should maybe be a little more careful. What's really helpful to us is that it's smooth as a stack, so you can think of it as smooth. So it's not smooth as a variety, but it's a smooth separated Deline Mumford stack. So smooth as an orbifold, if you will. Let me remark that its dimension is g plus 1 times g over 2, which is evident from the description I just gave, this dimension of the space of symmetric matrices. And this alpha. And this algebraic structure is very useful to our perspective. I think in some sense it's maybe one of the features that is more different in my talk than some, so than a lot of the interesting talks that we've seen so far. So the algebraic structure on AG means that thanks to the work of De Leon, there's extra structure in the rational cohomology of AG. Hohomology of AG, namely the canonical weight filtration due to tween. So for any variety, again, over the complex numbers. And x here need not be smooth and it need not be projective. Though if x is smooth and projective, you have usual Hodge theory. For any variety x, the rational cohomology The rational cohomology has extra structure. It has a canonical filtration called the weight filtration due to the lean. Specifically, Delene's work on mixed cost structures in the 70s. So let me just Just to fix the notation, so the I-th rational cohomology group, sorry, yeah. Yeah, so the rational cohomology degree i carries a filtration from w0 to w2i. And there are many nice functorial properties. Let me write Gerds of J for the associated graded piece in Graded piece in, so the JF associated graded piece. So by definition, this just means Wj over Wj minus 1, so the associated graded. And this wave filtration has the property that the associated graded is equipped with a pure hunch structure. Of link chain. This is vastly underselling, of course, what Delene achieved in his work on mixed Hodge structures. So these Hodge structures on the associated gradeds are in fact induced by a single descending Hodge filtration. And this weight filtration, the mixed Hodge structure on these cohomology groups, are Groups are a functorial association and is compatible with a lot of sort of structures you would hope it's compatible with. For example, Poincaré generality. So for X, smooth. So let me just let me assume that X is smooth. Let me assume that x is irreducible of dimension d being the same. There's an identification of the weight j degree i cohomology with rational coefficients and the dual of the weight 2d minus j degree 2d minus i, a compactly supported rational cohomology of x. So actually if you believe what I just wrote or you're willing to accept it, then you would also accept that cohomology can never appear in weight above 2D, if that's the case. So here we'll call cohomology in weight 2D the top weight cohomology. The topwake cohomology. And it seems that some experts prefer instead to think about its poem-grade dual, so that would be the weed zero compactly supported ecology, just to be clear. I'm sorry. So here this is weight. So here this is weight zero, compactly supported. So the main character of this talk is then the topweight cohomology of AG. Oh sorry, I might table it for my screen one sec. Okay. So let's So let's just write that our goal is to study the top weight. Oh yeah, so I mean, let me also remark, just to lay it out. So similar to what Nate said in his talk yesterday, if you're interested in studying the rational cohomology of AG, then for the same reasons as we saw in the mapping class group, Sort of, as we saw in the mapping class group case, this is exactly studying the rational cohomology of symplectic group 2g, z. And what our contribution is, is to study the top weight. So weight g squared plus g, which is twice the dimension of AG, homology of AG. Any questions or comments? Okay. Maybe I'll say why top weight? Well, I mean, this is, so the spirit of this project is very much in the same spirit as previous joint work with Soren and Sam. So, as may become apparent later in this talk, it's the top weight part of the topic. It's the top weight part of the cohomology, so this is sort of a canonical quotient of the rational cohomology of your variety. It's in some sense the part that one can access purely combinatorially. That is to say, if you have an appropriate normal crossings compactification, then just the combinatorics of that normal crossings boundary encodes the Taupwe cohomology. We can get into more detail, certainly, but that's the sort of strategy here. The sort of strategy here. So let me just announce the results and then we can talk about where they came from. So I have them down here somewhere. Okay. So this is our main theorem. This is a computation of the top weight cohomology of A5, A6, and A7. Don't be dissuaded by these strangely large numbers. This is just G squared plus G in each case. It's top wave cohomology. In each case, it's top wave cohomology. And these are our computations. So I want to acknowledge right away that these were deduced from computations of Albas François, Gammon Soul. It's not that they're direct, but I mean one has to do some work, but their computations are at the heart of what we do. So that's our May theorem. For A8, A9, and A10, we have some vanishing results. We have some vanishing results in the ranges shown. These are in turn deduced from vanishing results of Dutur-Sikerich, Elbas-Foissant, Coopers, and Martine. And there's slight improvements on what you would know from just virtual cohomological dimension of symplectic groups. Maybe this data looks like a mess, these six facts. I'll hopefully later have time to show it to you. Have time to show it to you in table form, namely the U1 page of a certain spectral sequence, and we can stare at it. It might gel a little better in that format. Let me make a remark. I should have remarked that the reason the theoretic starts at 5 is that the cases 2, 3, and 4 were known. So the rational cohomology ring of A2 and A3, these are the only examples that are fully known, as I understand. Examples that are fully known, as I understand. So A2 is classical, I think, due to Egusa, which is no topweight cohomology. And A3, that's the first, and prior to our work, only instance of a non-zero topweight cohomology group in AG. This is the work of Hain, who shows in particular that H6 of A3 is this sort of non-trivial extension of pure Hodge structures. And this Q minus 6 is the thing that you see in top weight in A12. See in top weight in A12. So, this is what we're recovering in our work, Haynes' class in top weight. And A4, as I understand it, it's already the case that the cohomology ring of A4 is not 100% understood, but experts such as Kulak and Tomasi have understood a lot of it, and Ursula kindly explained to us how to deduce from their existing work that A4 has no top wave hormonal. The homeland. So that was the state of things beforehand. Any questions or comments? Okay. So let me give you an indication. Yeah, I had a, oh, sorry, one more remark. The remark is that we have found odd degree coefficients in the simple-minded sense that some of these k's are odd, like this one, this one, and this one. Like this one, this one, and this one. So these were the first examples of explicit non-zero cohomology groups in AG of odd degree. And this was highlighted in an open problem in Gruszzewski's authoritative survey of the geometry of AG and its various compactifications. Maybe since I'm in a room with experts, I should say, so it's interesting to come. I should say, so it's interesting to compare this story with that of mapping class groups, SMAGI, where for Euler characteristic reasons, thanks to work of Harazavier, it was known that odd degree cohomology groups would abound in mapping class groups, at least for G even, just because Euler characteristics were massively negative. I have to say, I don't know of a corresponding sort of Euler characteristic. Sort of Euler characteristic resolved for AG. I know about an organifold of Euler characteristic resolve in terms of actual ordinary Euler characteristic. I don't know of any analog. But in any case, up to this point, it was sort of not known. Non-zero, sort of explicit non-zero odd-degree coherence logic groups are not known either for AG or any of its commonly studied magnifications. Okay. So I had brand new plans to give this like super, you know, like expansive and introductory talk. Let me see what I have time for, but I want to at least touch on the basic ingredients. So our main ingredient. Oh, let me see. Oh, yeah, I wrote this down. So our main ingredient ingredient is the use of an appropriate toroidal compactification of AG. This is a family of compactifications of the moduli space AG constructed by Ashe, Mumford, Rapiport, and Ty. And we use a particular one of them, which I'll discuss in just a moment. A torroidial compactification of AG is something a little bit more general. Something a little bit more general than a normal crossing symbolification. The latter is one where the boundary divisor is locally, atal or analytically locally, no more complicated than a bunch of hyperplanes intersecting transversely. Whereas in a toroidal compactification, your boundary atal or analytically locally looks like the sort of complement of a torus inside a normal toro variety. And AG, I guess now I can say famously, has toroidal impactifications which depend on input combinatorial data. And the combinatorics is, you know, remarkably goes back to, I would say, Rohr and I in 08, by which I mean 1908, and the theory of admissible decompositions. So let me just go ahead and So, let me just go ahead and define the sort of the combinatorics that goes into this construction. So, let's consider all perfect forms, perfect quadratic forms on some R to the G. So, by perfect, I mean That Q, the quadratic form, is determined at least up to scaling, up to multiplication by a positive realm. By its set, its set of minimal vectors, this means the following: you look at all non-zero lattice points. For which Q, so all non-zeroized points X, for which Q of X is less than or equal to Q of Y for all Y. So that's what I mean by the set of minimal vectors. And for some quadratic forms, M of Q uniquely up to scaling determines Q. These are called perfect forms. Certainly they have a whole life of their own. A whole life of their own study of lattices and quadratic forms. Associated to such a perfect form, let me define for you a cone. It's going to be a cone of positive definite matrices. And it will be a polyhedral cone spanned by a finite number of rays. And the ray generators are rank one matrices obtained by taking a vector times its own transpose. And that And that vector is meant to range over the minimal vectors of Q. This is a cone inside the positive definite. So it's a polyhedral cone inside the round cone of positive definite forms. And if you take, let me be a little informal, but if you take the union over all perfect cones, so more formally imagine all of these cones together with all of their faces. This is called the perfect decomposition. Decomposition. Let me just write what it is. It's an infinite polyhedral decomposition of the space, I'll just denote this omega g rational. What I mean is something very close to the positive semi-definite components. The positive semi-definite matrices would either Which are either positive definite, this is a special case, or more generally have kernel defined rationally. So the kernel, or the radical, is generated by some integer vectors. This is called the perfect cone decomposition. And the machinery of AMRT grabs this sort of Grabs this sort of, I would say, combinatorial construction and produces an associated compactification called the perfect compactification of AG. Let me give you some pictures, which I drew ahead of time. So, this is the only one I can draw. It's the only one anyone can draw, is g equals 2. So, this is a top view of the three-dimensional co- The three-dimensional cone of 2 by 2 positive semi-definite matrices. I give you on the right an example of a perfect form, q of xy equals x squared plus xy plus y squared. The minimal vectors are the ones that end putting in red. So you literally just evaluate the form on all the lattice points other than 0, and you pick out, you draw in pink the ones where the form is a minimal value. Here it's 1. So here So here this is the vectors plus or minus 1, 0, 0, 1, and 1, minus 1. And then you can see that this cone is exactly sigma of q. It's generated by rays x, x transposes, x ranges of minimal vectors. You do this for all perfect cones, sorry, all perfect forms, and you get an admissible decomposition, so-called. So-called of the cone of positive definite matrices with rational mull space that I denoted omega g rational above. Is that okay? Okay. So any I have some more pictures for you. There's a natural action of the... Oh, sorry. There's a natural action of the general linear group, GLGZ, on this round cone by conjugation or change of basis on the lattice. So I will define AG trop to be the quotient space. Now you have to be a little careful. I mean the quotient of omega g rational with its infinite polyhedral sort of space. Sort of structure. So, in particular, it's not the same thing as just the induced topology from the Euclidean topology. So, it is possible to regard AG Trop as in fact a combinatorial moduli space parametrizing tropical abelian varieties. But I don't need this description, and certainly in this crowd, there's no need to go into that. So, but let's call this space AG trop. So, I draw a correct. Space AG drop. So I've drawn a cartoon of it here on the left. And this is a cone complex made of cones. Everything deformation matrix is a zero matrix. So what's more topologically interesting is to consider the thing on the right, which I denote L of A G Trop, the link. So just take AGTrop and quotient out by. Oh, I guess I should write the non-zero points here. So delete the origin and quotient out by. The origin and quotient out by positive scaling. So, in other words, take a slice, and that's cartooned here over the right. Is that okay? Any questions or comments? Okay, so the idea is that the space on the right is. Is closely related to the top weight cohomology of the space AGB compactified. So let me phrase this as a theorem. We construct a rational chain complex. I'll call it a perfect cone complex or the perfect complex. It's spanned by equivalence classes of perfect cones. So by a perfect cone I mean any face of one of the sigma of q's that we constructed earlier. And so I haven't given a full definition of this perfect complex, but it's some finite rational chain complex involving perfect cones up to the action. So when I say equivalence class, I mean up to the conjugation by GLGZ. By G.L.G. Zing. And this complex, it's cooked up to reflect the rational cohomology of this tropical moduli space on the right. And this is in the spirit of, I guess, most recently joint work with Soren and Sam. But the idea of this kind of cellular chain complex for a space that is A space that is very similar to a simple shell complex but might have some self-bluings, is older and it goes back to work of E.G. Berkovich and Hector Boatman, I think, in a different context. So, okay, so this, as I was saying, this chain complex here on the left, the perfect complex, knows the rational cohomology of this tropical moduli space. And then, And then, by work essentially of DeLean, which you can see our papers for details, this tropical moduli space, in turn, up to an appropriate degree shift, knows the top weight cohomology of the space being compactified. So, this is a canonical isomorphism essentially to be found in Delene's work, but you can see our paper for details. But you can see our paper for details. In particular, we need that. Oh, I guess we need a bunch of things. We're using here that AG is a smooth and separated lean-Mumford stack, and its rational cohomology similarly carries a mixed hot structure in the sense of doing. Okay, so that's our connection between the sort of combinatorial moduli space and the classical one being compactified. Okay, so that's the first statement. The second one is that the perfect complex is closely related to existing complexes in the literature. So, sort of one of the main technical things we verify in our paper is that there's a short exact sequence. I said there's a short exact sequence relating Pg minus 1, Pg, and a complex that I denoted V upper G. So this is the Voronoi complex associated to the group GLGZ of Albaz-Masson, Gabo-Soul, who compute in, I think, remarkable computer computations the homology of these complexes for G up to 7. I guess I haven't told you officially the definition of VG, so let's approach it two ways. So the point of VG, as I understand it, is to compute the cohomology of the general inner group, GLGZ, with Steinberg module coefficients. And from that, they're able to actually deduce a lot about the coefficients. Deduce a lot about the cohomology of the modular groups GLGZ and SLNZ as well. So, this is, as I understand, the theorem of Sulei, and you can also see EVGS. To give a concrete definition of the roronoid complex, I can probably just refer you actually to this short exact sequence. So, roughly speaking, P upper G P upper G tells you about the, sorry, let me scroll up. P upper G tells you about the topology of this whole sort of tropical moduli space. Now, as you can see, some of that tropical moduli space actually meets the boundary of the positive definite cone, the part where the matrix, the matrices drop rank. That part, the sort of part of our theorem, is exactly the tropical moduli space in one genus less, AG minus one trop. Ag minus 1 trop. So this Vorganite complex is exactly the perfect, you can think of it as the perfect cones. It's generated by the perfect cones that meet the interior of the positive definite cone. That might be the sort of quickest way to communicate what this roronoid complex is in the context of this talk. Okay. Okay. Any questions or comments? So let me just let me show you. One quick question, maybe. Do you compare your AG with is AG the the classifying space of SP2G? Of sp2g or spg? So is g always even in this case is my question basically. It's sp2g z. So AG is a quotient by properly discontinuous action of finite stabilizers of a space that we saw was contractible by the action of the symplectic group. Group. So of 2G by 2G matrices. Okay, thank you. So you compare SB2G somehow to GLG. That's great. That's right. Yes. That's right. I wish I would have a sort of very high-level conceptual reason for this comparison. And I don't at the moment, but maybe offline. But maybe offline I might speculate. Yeah, okay. Great, thank you. Any other comments or questions? Okay, so here you can see by the short exact sequence how we play the game. We take existing computations for the Boronoid complexes and we deal with either the long exact sequence associated to this short exact sequence, or if you want, you can. Exact sequence, or if you want, you can just package everything into a spectral sequence. I might as well do that a bit more to be a bit more efficient. So, here I'm just referring to sort of the filtration on the complex P upper G, the one that is related to AG, by smaller perfect complexes. And of course, the spectral sequence associated to this filtered complex has on its This filtered complex has on its E1 page the homologies of boron complexes. So, with that filtered complex in mind, let me scroll down. Hopefully, I have this below. Yes, so on the left, you see the E1 page of the spectral sequence I just mentioned. So, it corresponds to the filtration. Corresponds to the filtration on perfect complex, PG, by smaller perfect complexes. So here on the left, I didn't do anything. To make the table on the left, I didn't have to do anything other than to copy over the data from EVGS. So more specifically, EVGS deals with the columns 5, 6, and 7 here that is copied from their paper. These entries, so this one, well, okay, these entries are more classical, but I forget their attribution. At their attributions. I think this one comes from the paper of Lee and Sharva from the 70s, although their paper dealt more explicitly with the SL case rather than the GL case, and we had to sort of plug, as far as I understand, a very small gap in the literature to compute this. And then these are the extra vanishing results I was mentioning before. So these are vanishing results on board. Vanishing results on Voronoi complexes in rank 8, 9, and 10. So this least Scharber result, you're not quoting their vanishing theorem, you're quoting some non-zero calculation in that paper? Sorry, what was the tail on your question to the next? Well, I guess Lee and Sharba, maybe in that paper or some paper published within a few years of that, proved like a co-invariance. Like the co-invariance of the Steinberg quotient GLN is zero. So, like, I guess initially I thought you were like saying Lee Sharba and pointing to a bunch of zeros, but you're saying Li Sharba and pointing to something concerned. Yeah, sorry. That's right. Is that correct? Okay. And then where would their zeros, would their zeros show up somewhere? What was yours are you talking about the bottom row? What? Oh, so the bottom row is the fact that the H0 of GLNZ with coefficients in Steinberg is zero. That's the bottom row of your table. Okay. Yeah, right. So the bottom row. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's try to unpack this. So the bottom row. The bottom row regards vanishing of a cohomology of PLNZ with Seinberg coefficients in the VCD. So I didn't bother drawing anything below the p-axis because all that stuff vanishes because of VCD. So this is vanishing in VCD, this is vanishing in VCD, sorry, in codimension one. Hopefully that answers. Hopefully that answers the question. Great. Okay, so the work in our paper can be sort of crudely summarized in passing from the left to the right, which is the E2 page. And actually, for this perspective, I'm really grateful again to my ongoing conversations with collaborators, Brown, Gruszewski, Galagus, and Payne. Gruszewski, Galagius, and Payne. So they really helped me sort of in ongoing conversations tease out the story in this context. So here what we're saying is that, so I've just drawn this in the example g equals 7 since sort of for the data we have so far. So if you sort of cut this off here, then you get spectral sequence that's opposed to Supposed to converge to the rational cohomology, sorry, yeah, the rational homology of the tropical moduli space A7 trot. And you can see that right here. So it actually converges at the second page. And you just get something supported in the last column. So sorry, I should have said this. This is a picture for G equals 7. For g equals 7. So that's sort of what we do, boiled down in the paper to get from the EVGS computations to computations on the tropical moduli space. Okay, in my last five minutes, so I want to get even more sort of conjectural and discuss some connections, some options. Discuss some connections, some observations that we're grateful to Ursula for pointing out to us. Yeah, so namely, let me go back to, let me display the main results of this talk in a grid-like format, which will turn out to be the E1 page of the spectral sequence. So here. Here we have passed to weight zero compactly supported cohomology, if you don't mind, but by point quite duality it's the same thing. So here we have essentially a summary of everything known about the top weight cohomology of AG. So our results that were announced at the beginning of this talk is the main era. This regards the columns 5, 6, and 7. This class here in G equals 3 in G equals 3 in the degree, cohomological degree 6. That's Haines' calculate class. And this sort of extra vanishing was also announced at the beginning of the talk. Again, this is related to the discussion we just had. There's nothing below the p-axis because of VCD, either VCD of general linear group or VCD of symplectic group. And the vanishing results, this is a, yeah, thank you to Sander for pointing this out to me after a previous talk. So if I understand correctly, there are vanishing results of Church R. Putman and Churchy Putman, which is vanishing, you know, for GLGZ in the V C D. So in co-dimension zero and in co-dimension one. Codimension zero was due to Lee and Charlotte. Zero is due to Lee and Charlotte. Is that right? Even with Steinberg module coefficients? Yeah. Oh, Steinberg module coefficients. No, no. I think they mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, okay. Great. Okay, sorry, I didn't know that. So here, just to be clear, I'm using vanishing Steinberg module tensor Q coefficients, and I didn't realize that that went back to Lee Trevor. Yeah, Lee Trevor did that and me and. Yeah, Leah Trevor did that, and me and Tom did a codevention one. You also, if there are number rings with a real embedding that are not Euclidean but are PIDs, your paper covered that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But they might not exist. Who knows? Oh, you're very. You're having a hard time absorbing all of this, but is it handy? Do you mind sending me a chat later or something to get the references corrected? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do that. Okay, perfect, thanks. I did want to mention, looking at one of the abstracts coming up for tomorrow, as I understand it, if I've gotten everything right, this co-dimension zero and co-dimension one vanishing is consistent with one of the abstracts tomorrow. So it would imply that at least in top weight, you would have vanishing in codimension one of rational cohomology of synthetic. Rational cohomology of synthetic group sp2gz. At least, this is only about a top weight group, this is a vanishing result, sp2gz, codimension one, coming from that of general linear groups. Okay, so at the moment, I just written in table form the results I presented. Finally, if you'll allow me one more minute, let me discuss, thank you to Ursula for pointing out this sort of conjectural picture. Pointing out this sort of conjectural picture. So there's a famous compactification of AG. It's not a toroidal compactification, it's the Satake compactification, or Bailey-Burrettal compactification. And for the purpose of this last minute of the talk, its main feature is that the Satake has a stratification by locally closed sub-varieties or substacks by the little Ag, so Ag, Ag minus 1, Ag minus 2, and so on. And so on. So by considering the, so there's a spectral sequence associated to that stratification. On the E1 page you see the compactly supported cohomology of the AGs. And on the E infinity page you would see the compactly supported cohomology or just the cohomology of the Satake compactification. And here I've chosen to pass to the weight zero of subspace. To pass to the weight zero subspace because that's what I know. Now, Ursula has pointed us to the following sort of conjectural picture. So the cohomology ring of the Satake confactification, there's this sort of stable cohomology ring that was understood in work of Charney Lee. It's generated, so it's this free commutative algebra that's generated by some algebraic classes. These are odd turn classes of a certain Hodge bundle. And then there are these sort of like harder to understand. And then there are these sort of like harder to understand classes, Y6, Y10, Y14, Y2K plus 2 in general, which were established in more recent work of Chen and Mo Yenga to be in weight zero. So these are weight zero classes of the Sutaki fractification. And it's natural to guess, so they have to be somewhere on the E infinity PHP spectral sequence. It's natural to guess that what we're seeing in our data are sort of candidates for are sort of candidates for classes that persist to E infinity and become the polynomials in the y-classes in weight zero. And it might look something like what I've shown here. There are a couple of other natural guesses. For example, one could certainly guess that there's no cohomology below this diagonal. I don't know how to prove that. I don't have a reason for that guess other than just visually what you see here. Another thing I was Another thing Ursula points out to us is that, of course, you know, we found some new classes in odd degree. This one and two others, I think, this one and this one. And they have to die somehow when you reach the E infinity page because there's no odd degree cohomology in the E infinity page. So that means that there's something, yeah, go ahead. Oh, sorry, can you say again which classes you were referring to? Oh, sorry, so there are. Referring to? Oh, sorry. So there are three things in odd degree. So this one's in degree 5 plus 10, which is 15. Oh, I see. Sorry, I missed your cursor. Thank you. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I don't have a real cursor. I'm just trying to use the outline feature. So this one, this one, and this one, I believe. So anytime if we have odd-degree classes, they have to die by the time you get to E infinity. So that means that some. Negative to E infinity. So that means that something is killing them. So they're pairing with something somewhere. So some new, some other classes that are sort of unrelated to the stable cohomology of Sataki on the infinity page. So just for example, this one here, I think if you believe the sort of heuristic that there's no global below the sort of main diagonal here, this one here would have to pair with something, I think, right here. I think right here, which is some class that's not persisting to the E infinity page. This is quite a mystery so far. Okay. Actually, I have to stop. So thank you very much for your attention. Questions for our speaker? Is there anything, so if you plug in Uh so if you plug in Lee Sharba or um Tom and Andy's result, can you say anything general about the top weight or about like pie weight cohomology or is that I guess superseded by Gundel's result that the homology of the V C D of symplectic groups been I don't know anything that I can say that I didn't already say. I can say that I didn't already say. So, in some sense, the VCDs of the symplectic group, SP2GZ, and that of GLGZ, like line up, if that makes sense, line up with all the degree shifts going on. So they both correspond to nothing below the p-axis in all my pictures of spectral sequences being known zero. Yeah, but I guess I was wondering, like, if you plug if you use Lee and Scharba and Lee and Scharba and Church Putman, do you get a general statement like the top weight of some top weight group of AG is isomorphic to some top weight group of AG plus 1 or anything? Oh, um yeah, that's right, and they vanish. That's right. Yeah, so like this. Yeah, so this, I don't know if I'm connecting with your question or not, but these rows of zeros are, I think, now known due to those codimension zero-on banishing results. Oh, sorry, I'm not sure if I've connected to your question, but maybe we can talk later, if not. Sure, yeah. There are other questions, either in person or? Your classes? Why? Why is there other classes? Do they manifest themselves in the Voronoi complex? In the Voronoi complex. Well, they seem to be somehow induced from there as well, or is that my just? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, then your classes are good. Right, so the E infinity page here is sort of conjecture. That's a picture that Marcela suggested to us. Sort of makes sense. But like, okay, so what is the, how did I get the data on the left, which is the E1 page of this spectral sequence, what was spit out by the previous spectral sequence? Yeah, so where yeah, so these Y classes are conjecturally coming from Coming from, you know, this is Y6, or this is a class that persists to become Y6, Y10, Y6 squared, Y14, and so on. Yeah. And the ones below? Like the ones here to the right? Those are inflation classes. Ah. Yeah. Like the ones that we... They're exactly. The ones that we... Yeah, exactly, exactly. So one of the contributions of our paper was to. Of our paper was to prove the acyclicity, this is a bit more technical, but the acyclicity of the inflation complex. So if you consider all cones that are either inflations in rank G or are of rank G minus 1, then that complex is acyclic, no homology. And so somehow these have to pair. And you have to sort of stop at the E2 page with everything supported in the last column. This is the thing I learned sort of after writing the paper. The main learning sort of after writing the paper from conversations with current collaborators. Thank you. Thanks. I will be very curious to read your proof to connect the top weight to these Vornoi things. Do you know anything about the other weights? Can you connect it also to something that's related to Voronoi? Related to Woronoi in some ways, that's just not as tangible, maybe? If only. So, to do that, I would have to understand not just the combinatorics at the boundary, but the geometry of the boundary. So, in other words, the topweight cohomology of AG can be read off of the combinatorics of the boundary, that is to say, H naughts of all the strata in the boundary. If you wanted co-wait to say, cohomology of the Say, cohomology of AG, you could do that as long as you knew H upper twos of all of the strata in the boundary. And talking to experts like Pruszewski, I mean, I'd be happy to be corrected, but these strata are geometrically complicated. So our game has been to just go with the combinatorics, purely. That's the top weight. Yeah. As for the comparison theorem you alluded to, I guess, yeah. It's, yeah, I guess, yeah, there's a lot more to say. And it sort of in even in the work of Delene, the use of simple normal crossings or normal crossings compactifications was paramount. Torio compactifications aren't that different in particular. If you have a torrential compactification and you want to make it normal crossings, you just blow up, you do toric blow-ups corresponding combinatorially to stellar barycentric subdivisions of cones until you have something, normal crossings. Normal crossings. So that part at least is not too bad. I'm not sure which part you guys are most interested in diving into, but yeah. So I'm a bit surprised, so you have a spectral sequence that only one page exactly coincides with quillen spectral sequence from With squid and spectral sequence for computing the homology of the Q construction. Are they related to each other? Is it just a coincidence that the Iman pages are exactly the same? Yeah, so I learned this with Sorin recently. It looks like they're the same because the groups are the same, but the differential is different. I see. Yeah. Do we have any more questions for Melody? All right, let's thank her again.
