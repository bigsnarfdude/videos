What I want to talk about today is, I want to kind of convince people in the audience that are not so familiar with casestability that castability provides what could be considered a correct approach to moduli theory of fano varieties and is the natural analog of the KSBA theory in the fano setting. And I apologize to some of the experts in K-moduli in the audience, in K-Sability in the audience, just because I'll be talking about some basic things for that. Okay, so at the beginning. Okay, so to begin the talk, I want to talk and discuss why we need key stability. So the basic idea is that the moduli final varieties is very different from the KSBA construction. So there are a number of complications that don't appear in the KSBA story. So the first thing is that limits are not unique. And what I mean by that And what I mean by this is that there exists some families of finite varieties over a smooth pointed curve such that the families are isomorphic away from the special point and that two special fibers are not isomorphic. Not isomorphic. Oh, thank you. So some So some simple examples of this, or maybe not so simple, but the first example, which occurs for smooth funnel varieties, is you see it in dimension three. So you can look at the Mukai Muamara threefolds. And as well, if you want to look in dimension two, you can look at singular examples. So you can look at generations of P2, generating P2. Generations of P2, generating T1, T4, which further generates T1, 4, 25, and this pattern kind of continues. So if you look at all maybe mildly singular KLT final varieties, then P2 would not be a closed point, and you kind of have this infinite degeneration behavior. So the second relation, related part, just a But later part, j just uh so your your smooth uh smooth example, everything is smooth. Yeah, so in the MUCHIMOMARIC we fault, everything is smooth. This is not the simplest example. They're much more simpler examples. Okay. But I guess in dimension two this doesn't occur. But we'll talk later. Yeah. Okay. So the next thing is that boundedness fails for For, let's say, KLT or SLC, which can also of fixed dimension and volume, which can be seen in that bottom example over there. And the last thing is that if we want to look at finite varieties, they often have non-discrete morphism group, so we're not going to get necessarily at the least. So, we're not going to get necessarily at the lean-Mumford stack parameterizing such objects. And if we look at the automorphism group, the global P2 at a point, and this is non-inductive, which causes complications for constructing the moduli space locally as some GFT quotient. So, the conclusion is that KSBA theory. KSBA theory does not extend to concepts. But we can take a step back for a second and note something a little bit different. So if we look at moduli theory from an analytic perspective, since I'm working over the complex numbers, it's related to Numbers, it's related to canonical metrics. So note that curves of genus G, at least two, emit some canonical metrics that come about from the uniformization theorem. And in higher dimensions, KSBA stable varieties have something called singular Kehler-Einstein metrics on them. And these are unique. Strips on them. And these are unique. And then, if you want, are interested in moduli of polystable vector bundles, at least the slope-stable ones, and Hermit-Einstein metrics. So you can think about moduli theory as you have some geometric object with a canonical metric, and as you take limits in the moduli space, you're taking some limit of this metric space. So for higher-dimensional varieties, we have these things called the Reinstein metrics, which I mentioned a second ago. So let's say for some pussy, x is some smooth projective variety, and that's the variance dimension on x. Our Einstein metric on x just means I have some Keller metric that satisfies what's called the Einstein condition. So the Ricci curvature of omega is some 1,1 form that you can spit out from omega, and then this lambda after normalization is one of these three values. And the properties of this is that these metrics, when they exist in a certain killer class, are going to be unique up to the action of the automorphism group acting on that metric. So it's kind of amazing you've got some canonical metric on your variety. Then the more subtle part is the existence question. Existence of Astronomy So if you look at this equation over here, this forces that the class in H2 of X, C. Well, this is in Well, this is in the first Turing class of minus kx. So this condition imposes some positivity or negativity or triviality of this first trick class. So there are really only three conditions to consider. And can't is ample, and cant is numerically trivial. And the Panam case The quantum case, when kx is anti- So in these first two cases, such a canonical metric always exists at the work of ya and column bin. Then this last case is either the more difficult or more complicated case where such a metric does not always exist. Not always exist, or more interesting case, depending on your perspective. So I think maybe the first obstruction to the existence of such a metric was observed by Matsushima in 1957, who showed that if X is a smooth final variety, then X is So, a meaning of the Kuhler-Einstein metric here, or meaning Killer-Einstein, implies that this amorphous group is remote yet. So we see that the block of P2L does it remaining by unique as this conditional is related. Is related to the uniqueness of the metric? Or like, I think they are related, but I don't have a precise statement. Or like, you're looking at hologramic vector fields in both cases, of course. And I think at first, when people observe this, people assume that. People observe this, people assume that the only obstruction should somehow correspond to the identity component of the automotive group. But as we'll see a little bit later, that that's not quite right. Okay, so let me give you some other examples of what happens or when you have such a metric. So the first is general orthogonal hypersurfaces. Orthomonal hypersurfaces are Killer-Einstein, and conjecturally, all of these of them should be Killer-Einstein metrics. And maybe the best progress on this problem is work done recently by Maiden de Troy. Another example is you can look in dimension two at smooth mono varieties in your KREinstein. And KREINSEN, if element only if, we are not isomorphic to Q2 at a point, well, P2 at two points. Maybe a third example is if you're a Tori Plano variety, and you're Killer Einstein, if you only have when you look at the anti-corruption called polytope. And then you look at it very simple, and this is our word. Okay. So now you can ask, what are the totality of the obstructions to the existence of such metrics? And this is answered by the Yao-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, which was first proved by Chen Donaldson's son, MTN, in 2012. In 2012, what it says is that a smooth final variety meets a kernel metric with normally if x is key positive. So the key thing is on the right-hand side, I have some purely algebraic notion that is related to some. Great notion that is related to some differential geometry condition. But for them, it was not projected, right? What? For them, the police stable was not projected at that time, right? I'll say it in a second, but I think it really early. It really was algebraic. I guess when Tien first defined it, it wasn't purely algebraic. So let me tell you what this case stability is and how it's defined. So as I said, it was first introduced by Tian, partially analytically, to kind of find all obstructions to the existence of one of these methods, and then algebraically defined by Donald said. Algebraically defined by Download set. So roughly, this is some infinite-dimensional GIT. And oftentimes when I give talks, I don't give the original definition, but I think it's kind of useful when you're interested in moduli theory. Because it really comes from, or either the definition comes from looking at Kil-Reinstein. comes from looking at Kler-Einstein metrics and obstructions, but it turns out the definition is closely related to kind of some modified version of asymptotic chaos to build. So I don't think any algebraic geometer would believe that this definition would work out, but it is related to algebraic geometry at some sense. So to define it, we have two objects, similar to the Hilbert-Munkert criterion for GRT. For GRT. So the first are your test configurations, which are just degenerations. So a test configuration, first hope for me. All right, let me take a step back. So from now on, X is going to be some projective variety, not necessarily smooth, and L is some anti-wire number. We want to define the case stability of this pair. So we look at these polarized degenerations called test configurations. A test configuration of x, L arises from the following theoretical. So the first thing I do is I take x and I embed it in some gable projective space using the complete linear system for some power of my line button. And the key thing is that r can be arbitrarily large. And the second thing is I fix some gm and G L capital N plus 1, which gives me a way to act by G M on this projective space. Okay, so then using this, I do a similar thing that you might do in GIT. So I take x cross g m. x cross g m and I have a map from this into gm cross g1 where I send an x comma t to I act on x by this gm action and then comma t. And then my curly x is just I take the image of x cross g m. x cross Pm side of Pn cross A1 and then I take the closure of this and get some possibly singular factor and then I take L to be O of 1 on this product over here and the restrictions. So if I look at a picture of what's happening I have some flat family over A1, and I have x away from 0. At 0, I get something that's possibly non-irreducible and not even necessarily reducible. Okay. So just a couple notes about this. So the first thing is that clearly we get a rational map from curly x to the trivial family. This is the first hint that this notion is related to some irrational geometry and irrational models. Next, Next is that GM antisode on this family and also fixes the special fiber. So we get a GM action on the special fiber. And then maybe this R can be arbitrarily large. So this R being large is telling you that the space of these degenerations is actually going to be infinite and dimensional. And that's what makes this. Next stall. And that's what makes this notion hard to get a handle. So a simple example of this is I take P1 cross P1 and I embed it in P3 or whoops as the perma hypersurface. Hypersurface and take my map from Gn to D L four E max to one one one equals and then at zero is just going to be hidden by tone. But really, if you do GIT, you see all these test configurations show up all the time. What's your R bit of? Say that again? What's your R? Oh, I guess I am doing this, or I'm being lazy and not telling you what the polarization is there. Polarization is there. So I guess if you wanted to, you could take your polarization L to be just the pullback of O1 over here. And then your R would be one. What you're saying is everything does depend on the choice of R? Your test configuration depends on the choice of R. But essentially, if you look at one of these test configurations for a fixed R, then you also get a degeneration in some any multiple of R. So at the end of the day, So at the end of the day, it doesn't matter so much as long as you scale it. Okay. And then the second is the Taki numerous. And this is the generalized version to the Donaldson. And this is the analog of the GFT weight. So what I do is I look at the space of vertical sections of the n power of the Y bundle of the Of the power of the Y bundle of the special fiber. And then I also can look at the weight of the space of those sections of the special fiber. I take the determinant. So this is some one-dimensional vector space with a GM action. So Gm is going to be actioned by T maps to T to the, and I'll take that weight. Weight. Okay. And then you construct this asymptotic invariant where you look at this fraction over here. You might notice that this, where the bottom grows like a polynomial in the dimension of x, and the top could grow at most like the dimension of x plus 1. So I divide by m and then I have some Laurent series expansion. Okay. And then the flutaki engine of this test configuration is just minus two times F1. This looks somewhat mysterious. As I said, it can be, it either comes from differential geometry, or it turns out that this is related to some limit of GIT weights. GIT weights if you're essentially doing asymptotic child development. So now let me tell you some algebraic process. Because essentially, we need some tools for understanding this definition if we want to say anything. If we want to say anything, because just using the definition, you probably couldn't say that anything is case-stable. Or, whoops, I guess I haven't defined what case stable is. So I guess you really couldn't. So this pair is based on its table. This topic invariant is always non-negative. Is always non-negative for all test configurations of the pair and k poly stable just means that this Katopian invariant, or I guess it means that K is semi-stable, and this Katopian invariant equals zero only when I have this test. I have this test configuration, and I want to say that it's a trivial degeneration. And what I mean by that is that the special filter is a small filter that I started with, but may have some non-trivial GM action on it. So this was Donaldson's original definition. And it turns out nothing is actually a k-poly stable essentially, or maybe a closed point would be, using this definition, because you can always get these kind of almost trivial tests. Kind of almost trivial test configurations. And the solution, as observed by me and Chu, is that you need to normalize this family and then take the special fiber. And then this is the correct definition. This is maybe the first, or an early hint that birational geometry is useful for studying this notion. And it's not just an infinite GIT notion, but you need to look at birational models. I'm taking the normalization of the whole. Uh I'm taking the normalization of the whole space. Hopefully like the actual normal space. Zero is often. Yeah, yeah. Okay. But as I was saying before, is that if you just want to go from this definition, it's hard to show that anything is k-stable or k-semi-stable, except maybe. Except maybe in dimension one, which was done by Ross and Thomas. Yeah. So you define semi-stable as a polystable, and you said that the existence of KLR ISM is for poly-stable. So is there a metric sense K-semi-stable? So I think the only definition I know is that we'll see in the moduli section is it corresponds to that you have some definit degeneration via a test. The generation via a test configuration to something that's capable of stable. But I don't, I don't. Or actually, there is something that you can say. There's some invariant called the radius Richie lower bound that tells you how close to admitting a Kaler-Einstein metric you get, and you can make a statement using that. You're very close to getting a Kaler-Einstein metric. Okay. So to make some algebraic progress, essentially, one needs to use. Progress, essentially, one needs to use tools from higher-dimensional geometry. So the first input results on this were that case stability is related to singularities. This was observed in Odaca's thesis. Was observed in O'Daker's thesis around 2012. So, one of his main theorems is: let's say you have a pair x, L, and I want to put some mild conditions on X. They're too technical for you, but I still know them. But I want it to be S2, which shows up naturally when we do KSBA stability and Borenstein in code dimension one, so that Kx is some you can make some error, define what Kx should be. Define what KX should be. Okay, so then what an advocacy shows is that in an atomically polarized case, I look at x, kx, and this is k semi-stable signal. x has SLC singularities. What this is telling you is that this KSB. That this KSBA condition is up to K in the non-K polarized case. So the KSBA moduli space is just a K moduli space. And next is in the final case, have a pair of x, minus kx, then being k semi-stable implies that x has k L T singularities. So these are. Singularities. So these are mild singularities that show up in the MMP. And in particular, they're all normal. So we only need to look at normal varieties. Can you say again what the first line reads? Or this one or this one? Yeah. So this is S2 and G1. So you're Gornstein at Kudimeni Multiples. Gornstein and G. Just because, or you need to make sense of Kx. These are natural ways, so this allows you to define kx by push-forward from the open or push. Yeah, so essentially I'm being a little bit, so I'm being sloppy because this is not a line bundle, but you could replace your L with a Q line bundle. And so Kx would be, yeah, you look at some open set that's Some open set that's smooth or has nodes, or sorry, the governance scene locus, and then you take the push forward. You might have to do it with a power to make it a lot fun. So you're assuming it's K sorry, it's Q volts? Yeah, so I'm assuming some power of uh Kx is one of those. Are you examples of current capabilities of strictly case nice stable? Yeah, so this is a good point. So it turns out in this case he actually showed that this is the same thing as being k stable, which I guess I didn't define. It means that the Futaki invariant is always positive unless at the normalization of the test configuration is the tributal family. Okay. Wait, what is the difference between police stable and stable? Yes, so it's this condition, so I didn't define it because it's confusing. So high stable is that the Futakia invariant is only zero when these things are isomorphic, but this might have a non-trivial GM action on it. And stable is that if we talking amirion is zero, The Futakian variant is zero, unless these things are isomorphic without the GM action. So you should just think of K, turns out this is true in the final case, K stable is just K polystable but discrete automorphism. So that is maybe more helpful. So let's stare both. You are assuming keyboards. Yeah. Okay, so I think this is kind of amazing that this stability notion is related to singularities in the MMP, but maybe it's not surprising that K stability imposes conditions on singularities because we know that this is true if you look at any, or like GIP stability, let's say. So now, the goal is to study the K semi for semi-semi Semi or semi-stability of KLT final varieties. So from now on, X is always going to be a KLT final variety. So the next algebraic progress on this is by Yi and Shu. What they observe is these. Observe is to check K semi-stability or K-ply stability of a KLT function. It suffices to consider special testing. Special test configurations. So, what this notion means, yeah. This is chili. Which leaves this? Oh, chili. Yeah. So it suffices to look at the special test configurations, which just means that you have some test configuration, x, l, and the special fabric is KLP. So in particular, it's normal, it's irreducible. It's irreducible, and so forth. So, an example of such a special test configuration was my degeneration of P1 cross P1 to a pwn over a product. And the idea behind this is that what they do is they take some arbitrary test configuration and they use some MMP process to modify it and make it so that this holds over here. Yeah, and you can do that without a base change. So you do a base change in a somewhat stable level. But the protection invariant depends on the family or how you feel it. Yeah, so essentially they have to kind of move the polarization or change the polarization and they have to analyze how the Fentopki invariant changes as you run an MMP and change the polarization. But maybe your comment thing is once you have a special test configuration, it suffices to replace this L with the anti-canonical polarization. Okay. And then the kind of big improvement is the language evaluations that came back came about in the last uh few years, or maybe five years. For maybe five years. So the idea is that if you have one of these special test configurations, then if you look at order of matching on the special fiber, then this is some evaluation of the function field of the test configuration. Since this test configuration is Since this test configuration is birational to x cross A1, this is equal to this field over here. Then what you can do is you can restrict this to the function field of x. So you get an evaluation of the function field of x. And this is quite nice because if you look at test configurations, they're n plus one dimensional, where n is the dimension of x. But when you do this. X, but when you do this over here, you're getting a valuation of your variety. So this makes the notion much easier to understand. This kind of observation in use in case of stability was done by Buxon, Pisa-Bokto, and Johnson. And then this brings us to the value of the criteria. Do you lose a lot of information when you restrict the thing? Can you recover? So it turns out you can recover the special test configuration from this. Now I tell you, but I'm running low on time. But yeah, happy to talk afterwards. So the value of the criterion, the idea is instead of starting with a test configuration, I start with a valuation. So I take x to y. X to Y to use some property of our rational morphism, X to Y normal, and I take some time divisor E on Y and then I look at this evaluation for E. Okay, and then the idea is you want to assign some numerical invariant to this valuation that is essentially going to be related to is essentially going to be related to a Satalkian variance. So we look at one of the discrepancy, which is one plus the coefficient of e in a relative geometry class, which shows up all the time in my rational geometry. And then you look at this more mysterious invariant where you take Where you take the top intersection number of minus kx, and then you integrate this volume function where you fullback kx to y, and I subtract t times t. And you can integrate from 0 to infinity, but this function eventually goes to 0, so it's only some finite integral. And then combine these and look at their difference. You don't come up with these by accident. So it took many papers of Fujita to write this. So it took multiple papers of Fujita to kind of realize this. So first, Fujita was kind of doing this where you took a divisor E on X and related it to some test configuration. Configuration and in that case, this number is just one, so you just had one minus this value. And it kind of took maybe three or four papers for Fujita and also Lee simultaneously to realize that this was the right thing. So it's a theorem of G taught and we which says that If x is some KLT phi variety, x being k semi-stable is the same as this Big End grant is non-negative for all the divisors E over X, as I have over here. And then with some input of some paper of myself with Chenyang, you also get the case data case. Also, get the case scale case. And this value is always strictly positive. Okay, so just give me a single example of this is if you take your X is that you take your x to be well uh g2 at a point and e is your conceptual divisor then it's beta of e computed with respect to your final x easy to compute but this is minus one sixth which implies that that is not stable So this criterion has really made or helped people make a lot of progress on understanding case stability and using higher dimensional geometry to understand this notion. So let me tell you some applications of this. So the first is due to Kento Tejita. Due to Kento forget, who showed that if X is a K semi-stable fano, or maybe dimension n, then X being K semi-stable implies that the top intersection The top intersection number of minus kx is at most n plus 1 to the n. And even that when this equality holds, you actually get projective space. So note that this inequality is going to fail terribly if you don't assume this case and line stability condition. And the proof of this, maybe I'll just say in words, is you take your final variety x, you choose x x x x x Final variety x, you choose some smooth point on it, you blow up that point, and you compute the beta invariant. You know it's non-negative, and you essentially immediately just get out this inequality when you do some computation. But I mean, what can you exclude from this one? Say that again? What exclusions, what consequences, or I don't know, can you eliminate if you look at So, like, if you look at, obviously, like in dimension two, this inequality always holds. But, like, if you look at Olivier Debarr's higher-dimensional geometry book, he shows that there are all these examples, and this number grows. I think it grows faster than a polynomial. I think it might grow exponentially, actually. Oh, nice. If you look at the maximum size. Oh, I see. Thank you. This is not true for a surface. This is not true for a smooth only. Yeah, so this is true in the singular case. And we'll see this come up a bit in the next lecture: that when you are singular, you can actually get a better inequality over here. And this is telling you that case stability kind of hurt balances singularities. And this was essentially a huge enemy system. Okay. So then the second application of this is theory due to Hamid and this one, where they essentially give you a way to explicitly calculate the female of this life discrepancy. Of this lack discrepancy over the expected order of dimension. And note that this quantity being at least one is the same as k-semi-stability. So essentially, their technique uses a junction theory to kind of reduce this to a lower-dimensional problem, and it's been extremely successful in computing case stability in explicit examples. And maybe an application of this is a nine-author paper due to. Is a nine-author paper due to Aroja, Castrovet, Sanchita, Calagaris, Martinas, Bethidia, Frama, Zeus, and Disponatan. So what they did is they looked at the case in stability, general finite threefolds. They looked at the general element, and I guess there are 105 different families. There are 70 things that are K semi for this, especially for the general element is K semi scale. So I don't think that this would have been possible maybe five or ten years ago. I mean, a lot of their methods, 78k police. Yeah, that's so so so basically semi-stream case stable general number case semi-stable if not if it's divisible. So divisor is stable. Yeah, so in most of these cases, as Banya is pointing out, is that the instability is given by an actual divisor on X, not over X. And for hypersection, what's the solution? Hyper Solstices. So in dimension three, So, in dimension three, it's also. No, no, no, we have higher dimensions. Oh, but in general or open? But I mean, I was just asking one status. So, what's cubic? Higher surfaces, not only which are hard, cubic or kind of close to. I'll talk about it tomorrow. Okay, we can. Okay. So, end things there and chopped up. Things there in the chopped up key module out here in the next class. There were some discussions. I don't want to cut off any questions. Could you repeat the characterization of polystability in terms of variations? Yeah, so good question. So I guess K semi-stability. So I guess case semi-stability is this beta invariant until it is greater than zero. And case stability is strictly greater than zero. And the highest stability is in between. So you allow zero on valuations that are coming from GM actions on X. And this was explained in one of the papers. So do you need to compute the data ingredient for every divider or a divider? Every divider or a divider class was so essentially this is uh the subtle part. So it's easy to show that something's unstable by finding just one bad divisor. But to show that it's semi-stable is much harder, and that's essentially this theory over here. So they essentially have this way of showing that if you look at divisors sorted uh over some bad point, then you can kind of bound this beta invariant for divisors over that point using some computations. Over that point, using some computations. And which year was that? 2020. 2020? 2020. Thank you. Yeah. Is the Euphemum or a Medimo? Yeah, so this will come up in the next lecture, but you want to look at this Euphemum over here, not the Euphemum of beta. And when this is less than one, the minimizer is related to some optimal destabilization of the file. Some optimal destabilization of the final variety. And proving that there actually isn't a P-mode was a key step in constructing these, or showing that the K-modules basic problem. So it's about three oh five, so we'll take the copyboard slide and then do about three thirty for the second half of the person's talk. 30 for a second half the kernel stop.
