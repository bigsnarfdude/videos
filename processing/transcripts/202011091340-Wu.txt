And I want to start with a profound apology that I am totally unprepared. I saw my talk will be next Wednesday, actually, Wednesday of next week. However, even I'm talking in two weeks, I don't think I have enough results to Enough results to talk about what I really would like to talk about: that is the impact of multiple waves in terms of the stream erasion and the effectiveness of the vaccine and the immunization program. However, today I'll still stay on talking about multiple waves. I would like to talk about the rule of dynamical modeling and the stochastic operation. And stochastic optimization with age-specific contact mixing to inform reopening in terms of trying to avoid or delay the second or multiple waves and to minimize the impact of multiple waves in terms of the ICUs and mortality. So, I will talk about actually. I will talk about actually a series of models going from very simple to complex including the contact mixing and stochasticities. I always joke about after every outbreak there is always a disease, there is always outbreak of mathematical modeling. However, the converse is not true. True, and this seems to be a real association with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The variety of models, and even within my own lab, with kind of outbreak of different forms of models. This is because of the rapidly evolving policy issues that we are asked to address from my lab. ILAF from the province of Ontario and from the federal government, we are asked to answer different questions at different stages of the pandemic. Questions relate to nearcasting the infection risk, to forecasting the epidemic peak, time, and scale, and to retroactively evaluate the interventions: what works, what doesn't work. And for the purpose of And for the purpose of design interventions to avoid a resurgence or second wave. And if that cannot be avoided, then how to apply the timing and the most to switch so that you can minimize the impact in different metrics that I'm going to talk about. So I'm starting. So I'm starting with a very simple model that was mentioned already in Dr. King and Dr. Wang's early talk. It's a very simple epidemiologic model that you stratify the population tense of the susceptibility and exposed and then you may end up with either asymptomatic infections or symptomatic infections and then removed. And then removed either due to the death or recovery to gain the temporary immunity. And we further incorporate some of the public health interventions, especially the contact tracing and the quarantine and diagnosis test to isolate the confirmed cases. So it's a very simple compartment model, and we are using HVD. We are using actually the first region is the ordinary differential equations. So susceptible can be exposed and exposed individual can be traced and then isolated, quarantine. And when the symptoms started to become the infection become more symptomatic, then they might be tested and isolated after confirmation. After confirmation. So, this is a very simple compartment model, and this model was posted online on January 23rd. That was really three days after the complete lockdown of the first epicenter, Wuhan, in China. And since then, we have been posting this model updated every week, starting in January. In January, and the model projection seems to agree with the data very well, so well that we cannot give the paper accepted to the NASIN because Paul's reason is they agree with the data so well, and the editor and review did not have confidence in the data, so something must be wrong in that sense. There is another There is another valid reason this paper cannot be published in anything is because of the parameter identification process. So we did some very simple least square penalized error estimation. It would be much more convincing, for example, if we have a collaboration with Dr. Wong and we did try later on using the R package palm. Our package palm by using the trajectory matching from Dr. Keynes' group with collaboration with FOLISA at Quaint University. But that was too late to justify the parameter notifications. However, the projection was quite influential in terms of really it was adopted by the Chinese government. By the Chinese government, and it was adopted, it was used by, for example, the JP Bogan risk analysis for its risk assessment in terms of investment in China during the time. So this was the earliest stage of the model. We used the model to Ontario, in the province of Ontario in Canada, to really make the projection. Really made the projection in terms of when the epidemic would peak. This was estimated to be around April 17th. The projection was made end of March using this model and this seems to be agree again well with data. This time I think people have more confidence in terms of the data. So the idea is very simple. You estimate the parameter. You estimate parameters from the data, and then you make a projection about the reproduction number. And it's crossing from this blue curve to the horizontal line is a crossing of the threshold, and therefore you would achieve the epidemic peak. So while the purpose of this modeling or the usefulness of this model and data parameter identification. Parameter identification is really to evaluate different interventions that are reflected in some of the model parameters. So in the province of Ontario, we did go through a sequence of social distancing escalation from school closure to declare emergency with closure of all public events and recreation venues. And recreation venues and then to the closure of all non-essential workplaces. And the model allows us to estimate, for example, the evaluation of the contact rate that was reduced from about 12 on average number of transmission effective contact to eventually four. And we estimate that the quarantine proportion increases. In proportion increased from, for example, 10% to about slightly under 40%. So, those are the two critical factors that contribute to the flattening of the epidemic curve, you know, tarot. And the pyramid identification would also allow us to really to see what did not work. And one of the key observation was that the transmission probability per contact. Probability per contact remained relatively unchanged. So that at that time, towards the end of March, that was the recommendation to the Ontario and the federal agencies that you must have done something to really reduce the transmission probability per contact. That included the mask varying. So those are some of the things that do well, but that also means that you can You can increase in your testing, you can enhance the public health measures, including the mask wearing, to really further reduce the transmission. That was really the message at the time, that you can reopen some part of the economic sectors, but you have to. Sectors, but you have to re-enhance some of the public health features, including the contact tracing and quarantine isolation and personal protection. So what we need is to simulate a process that's just simply reversing the escalation of the social distancing by gradually opening the walking place in the first phase and then with the First phase, and then resumption of some public events and activities in the second phase until you reopen the school. That was really the staged reopening process in the province of Ontario. So part of the rule of this model is really allow you to estimate and calculate the effective reproductive number. Effective reproductive intensive model parameters that correctively affect term of the interventions. And so, for example, we estimated in the first phase, for reopening, you need to increase the quarantine rate from proportion from 40% to about 60%. That was achievable. And so that's one of the evidence showing that we're opening. Evidence showing that reopening some of the economic activities may be feasible, and that's what's the message. But the message is come with a warning that you really have to increase in public health measures. And then come to whether you can reopen the second phase and the requirement in terms of the quarantine and testing seems to be about eighty percent. Seems to be about 8%, for example, in terms of the quarantine proportion. That was too unrealistically high that you won't be able to achieve it. So, what does mean is a resurgence or second wave is unavoidable. So, that will come to the question if a second wave is not avoidable. So, what will be optimal? What will be the optimal timing to switch from one phase to another? And what will be the timing and the magnitude of the second wave. So this is the simulation we produced by the end of April for the province of Ontario. These are not intense infections, these are intense of the cases in the ICUS, in the ICUs. US in the ICUs, because that would be the critical resources whether the public health system can sustain, can take the second wave. And this curve is produced by a series of optimization processes. So we build a model, refine Model refined the previous model by adding more key components relevant to the key public health resource in terms of ICUs, in terms of intonators and mortality. And you have optimization and certain constraints. The constraint is really trying to constrain the system so that the number of patients need the ICU is within the constraint provided by the Ontario. Provided by the Ontario Public Health System. And we use a very simple optimization cost function. We want to minimize the average number costs, minimal number of the contacts in the average number of the Ontario population. So this is truly dynamic organization programs. Dynamic organization program subject to a constraint or some constraints. So, for those of you who have been working on document control, you know, this is a bang bang control system decision is in the form of decision tree. So, this is one of the optimal decisions in terms that assume that you would have vaccine by the By the end of January. So that will be the optimal sequence of reopening increasing from phase one to phase two to phase three until ultimately the number of patients require the ICU getting close to the maximum capacity and by that. And by that time, you hope you would have some other treatment or vaccine available. So, this is really a kind of curve that you would expect if you're following this organization that what is a stochastic organization subject constraint based on the component model that we built. And this is a typical curve that you would expect two months before. Would expect two months before the like say you would accept the public health capacity in terms of ICU is going to be exceeded. And of course you can design optimal timing and change of the most in terms of you anticipate time when vaccine becomes available. So you can open earlier or later, depends on what you Depends on what you go. The key is you cannot hold on. You're going to have an outbreak. At a certain stage, you would have to decide whether you want to revert to the first stage of social distancing that happened in Toronto a couple of weeks ago, or depends on whether you have more resources available. So what is What is lacking so far is really we are talking about reopening and treating all the population as a homogeneous population. But reopening, I mean, closing down is homogeneous, but reopening seems to be more of age-specific and actually is more of economic sector specific. So that's one we really want to do. So we really want to build into the homogeneous mixing. Homogeneous mixing in terms of the social economic and the demographic structures of the province. And at Woodsdown, this is the kind of social contact mixing produced, I mean, this many years ago in some of the pioneer works published in PLAS Computational Biology and then in Plus Medicine. I applied to Toronto, but what we want to do is really pie by Is VDPI by combining this social contact mixing along with compartment models and using the potential social distancing interventions to see how those contact missing changes. So this is one that we have done in terms of for backward to see what kind of shift of the social contact mixing happened in Ontario. Happened on tarot. These are different contact mixing in different stages of social distancing. And we also have the estimation of the age-specific susceptibility and the detection weight. And the purpose of this is really to see which in different transmission take place in different cities, in terms of school, in the community, in household. In the community, in household, and in the worker place. So, I mean, it's not surprising when you closing down the economy and closing the school, then the transmission will more concentrate in the household. That's what's happened in Otaro. And the purpose is not really trying to see what happened and see what is going to happen if you reopen. It's going to happen if you reopen the economy, and especially when we started to in Ontario, for example, we reopened all the schools. So whether you're going to change the transmission context, but also change the epidemic curves among different age groups, and that's indeed happening in Ontario. And so, what happens is this curve. Happens is this curve thing is going to be reflected very much in terms of age-specific patterns. So we know that the transmissibility among the younger age groups tends to be smaller. So you would have more and more people you're going to see more and more young people infected where the ICU capacity is protected. Is protected. And so you might think this is good sense. You can still, the healthcare system can still function while there is still community transmission. So what I hope I would like to talk about, which I cannot talk about, is this might not good. So if you drive the epidemic to a more younger age group and have a longer outbreak duration and have larger Duration and have a larger population infected, you might give more and more opportunities for the mutation. And that will be really more challenging for the effectancy of the vaccine. And it will also give the opportunity for the disease to jump from the human to the animals and going back from animal to humans. We have seen some indication from the bisques, and all of this is going to complicate. So there is a reason, I think, why you should really control the second wave, even feature waves, even though you know the mortality and the demand on the critical health system is less. But the pressure for mutation might be increasing, and that would have a complication in terms of the Complication in terms of the vaccine and immunization program. Again, this I think is a challenge. That's why I would like to talk about this for this group, and I really hope there will be much interest in this line of research. Thank you.
