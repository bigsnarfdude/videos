But I hope that this summary talk gives you something to sort of take away. This is definitely my perspective, and I'm sure other people have different perspectives about how the workshop went, but hopefully I've tried to capture some of the main things. So one thing that I noticed from an astronomy point of view, listening to the statistics talks and to the statisticians that are here, is there's lots of new, new to astronomy, statistical methods that have not, like, they haven't been used in astronomy before. Have not, like, they haven't been used in astronomy before. And then terms as well. And as Adrian said, you know, lots of terms we could Google and things like that. So I thought I'd list some of them. So one was a term I hadn't heard before was scalar on tensor regression, which was what Wang talked about with the solar cycle. Another one was the covariate shift in propensity scores. So this came from studies like clinical trial kind of things, David Van Dyke was talking about, but actually, it's where you would do causal inference. But actually, it's where you would do causal inference, but these propensity scores could actually be useful in places where you don't need to use causal inference. Another one was causal learning, which I think Sunny mentioned in her talk. And then copulas, dynamic copulas, and conditional copulas that seemed to generate lots of interest. I'd heard about the North before myself, because Arya worked on those, but I actually did that paper with Sebastian, J. Mongol, and Joe Bovey while I was on leave, so I didn't actually. Ovi while I was on leave, so I didn't actually get to learn about it. But it sounded really cool, and so it was neat to hear Radu talk more about it and about these different ones too, like the dynamic copulas and conditional copulas. And it sounded like there was other interest too, because there ended up being a discussion yesterday about it. And I heard that that was pretty fruitful. Another one, this is one that I've heard of, but I heard some other people say that they had not heard of zero-inflated models before and that they might be useful in other contexts as well, so that's really neat. That's really neat. And another term I hadn't heard before was generalized additive models. So more stuff to Google. And so another kind of summary I wanted to make was about interdisciplinary collaboration from an astronomer's perspective. And I think what I, I mean, I already knew this, but I think what this was something that was well stated at this workshop is that statisticians have academic goals too, right? And someone asked at the very beginning. Too, right? And someone asked at the very beginning of the workshop: you know, are statisticians just acting as a consultant and what do they get out of it? But I think, you know, there's a lot that they can get out of collaborating with astronomers too, because we have lots of interesting problems. And so it's important, you know, when we collaborate with statisticians that we make sure that we're helping them achieve their goals too. And there are lots of interesting and hard statistical problems in astronomy. So things like noisy data, selection bias, hierarchical modeling, forward modeling and inverse problems. Forward modeling and inverse problems, simulation-based inference. There's also tons of statistical computation problems. And there's methods that astronomers have come up with for things like sampling posterior distributions, like dynasty nested sampling, the MC Hammer code that I think statisticians haven't heard of before. So that was kind of cool that there's some stuff from astronomy that maybe is interesting to statisticians. But I think also we, as astronomers, heard methods. We, as astronomers, heard methods that we might not know about sampling as well, like Inla and things like that. The other main takeaway here is that in astronomy, out-of-the-box methods from stats don't always work, and so we really do need statistical innovation. And that's why this interdisciplinary collaboration is so important in people. And finally, collaborations really do work better when started early in the research process. Oh, yeah. But the investment and the time is worth it. So that then, after making that summary, you made me think: okay, what makes interdisciplinary research effective? And this is a picture from yesterday in one of the discussion groups. We were talking about Sam's work, and it was a great session. We had like an hour of it, and everyone was talking, and we scribbled on the chalkboard, and it was just like a really, a really great environment. A really, a really great environment, and I was like, Well, why, you know, why did that work well? And why did other things work at this workshop well? And I think one reason is that we were all very patient with each other and understanding, you know. So I think that's something to carry forward. There was also, I felt personally that there was no judgment about what people should know coming in. So all the dumb questions were really encouraged and people didn't seem afraid to ask these things and people were happy to stop and explain terms that. Explain terms that might be new to others. And so I think that's something that we can all carry forward in future interdisciplinary collaborations. Another thing that I think worked well is there's lots of opportunity that's workshop to chat informally, right? Like all the meals, the social gatherings, yeah, during that time, you know, we also talk about bad movies or the food or whatever, but you know, work stuff comes up then too, and I think that that helps. And making that personal connection with people also helps collaboration. Connection with people also helps collaborations as well. There was open dialogue, and finally, lots of people became prepared with questions, right? So I think that always helps things too. In the very beginning of the week, I wanted to take us back to Monday and remind everyone that we had a panel on funding sources. And I'm hoping that this workshop spawned some perhaps new collaborations among people. Collaborations among people, and that you remember we have these Google Slides, they are open to anyone, and they have lists of funding sources. So, if you have a project idea that came out of this workshop, you know, you can go and apply for funding through some of these avenues. Okay, so just kind of summarize here, I think different perspectives are a good thing, right? On the Slack channel, we have these the photo channel and the wildlife channel, and I On the Wildlife Channel, and I thought it was really cool to see that there were a bunch of different pictures from Lake Louise, but they were all different perspectives. And actually, this one's from the river downtown by Radu, but you know, that's another perspective of Banff too. And you know, when we bring all these different perspectives, I think that the result that we can get can be really, really beautiful and unique. Okay, so I put this here to remind myself. Has anyone done a mentee thing before? A couple people? So, what mentee is. Couple people. So, what Menti is, just go here. So, go to menti.com and enter this code. You can do it on your phone or you can do it on your laptop. Keep it up there for a little bit. You could just put your hand up once you've already connected, and then I know I can change the slide. The side. Everyone here is connected. Okay. Okay, great. Okay, so the first thing I want you to do, I want you to list two to three words or terms that you learned at this workshop.  When you're done, you can have a look at the screen and you'll see it's making a cool little word cloud of the ones that are set most often. Everyone answered? Yeah, I should take a screenshot. We need some pruning. Yeah. Yeah. There's some duplicates too that it doesn't recognize, right? There's zero inflation, zero inflated model, zero inflated model, zero inflated. But copula's a really good one. That's cool. It's easy to spell. It is easy to spell. Not as easy as ABC though. Fair spray. Cool. Awesome. Okay, I just thought that would be a fun thing to do. And then, hopefully, I can save that. So, what was your favorite thing about the workshop? And this is anonymized, so I think we had an incredible group of people that worked well together. Yes, I totally agree. Small enough so you can interact with everyone. Small enough so you can interact with everyone, but big enough that you can have a broad overview of different topics. Cool. The duration on opportunities for interaction, the chance to get to know pretty much everyone at the conference and what they're excited about. Great talks by junior researchers. Yes, I totally agree. All the opportunities to meet, interact. People are very open and eager to share and learn. Oh, the flash intros. People liked those ones. Yeah. Great way to meet everyone. Afternoon group discussions. Talking with each other over meals. Other over meals, regular meals don't have an opportunity for chatting, and that's really nice to see. Yes, that was it. So, let's go to my last slide, which is to say thank you all. A huge thank you to Pauline, who really was the leader of organizing this workshop. So, yeah, big, big round of applause goes to her. Yeah, big, big round of applause goes to her and also Greg and David, who are on the organizing committee. It was a pleasure working with you. And also, thank you. I know we had to delay this workshop twice because of COVID, and then you also were willing to delay it for me while I was pregnant so I could still go. So I really appreciate that. And then I want to thank all the participants for coming to this workshop and making it a success. And to the Banff Center and Burrs, and also to Connor and Carlos. I don't know if they can hear me, but they're the technical support staff. Can hear me, but they're the technical support staff, and anything that'll be great too. All right, so we have went on the hot seat for a few more minutes. Anybody want to kind of pick her brain about things or
