Thank you. So let me remind quickly where we stopped last time. So last time we considered the space of the same morphisms of some closed manifold M. And just to be very explicit, let's say that M is just some compact surface, torus, sphere. And let's consider the space of homorphins, whereas the classroom is more. Whereas the clock of smoothness is at least two, then what we can do, oh, actually let's start this. Any smoothness. So, what we defined, we defined the new house domain. And that was defined as the interior of the closure of the space of diffeomorphisms, such that this diffeomorphism has a This diffeomorphism has a hyperbolic periodic point and stable and unstable manifolds of that point form a Hamatoin sentence. Okay, so the theorem claims that if you have at least smoothness 2, then Then the new house domain is not empty. So, this is a theorem by Sheldon House. In fact, he proved much more, but this is what's important for us, because it means that there exists an open set in the space of dynamical systems that is free of structuralist table dependent. So, let me just say a couple of words, very hand-waving. Very hand-waving and waving way, how one could obtain such a result. So now I want to refer to the picture that Frederica explained in his talk. So let's consider Spence workshop. So you have, I don't remember whether the fraction was vertical or horizontal, it doesn't matter. In any case, you have an invariant hyperbolic set. You have that horseshoe, which is a product of two countersets, roughly splitting. And what you can do, you can And what you can do, you can consider, suppose that you have contraction in the vertical direction and expanding in the horizontal direction, you can consider unstable manifolds of all the points inside. The Adobe-Perron theorem can be extended to the points in that horseshoe, not necessarily just to periodic points. And similarly, we can consider the stable manifolds of those points. So if I take a microscope and look at this. Take a microscope and look at this set, then what I will see, I will see locally a product of an interval by a concurrent set. So you have some limitations like that. And you can extend those limitations by dynamics. So what can happen, you can get a picture like this. So you can essentially get something that is suspicious in terms of tangences. So you have one counter set, you have another counter set, and you have a line where if those counter sets intersect, you get a tangency between. intersect, you get a tangency between those groups. Now the question reduces to the following. You have two counter sets and you can shift one among another. Is it true that by a small shift you can get rid of the intersections? Or not necessarily. Or maybe, of course if you have one point of intersection you can shift it a little bit and that point will not be a point of intersection. But maybe somewhere else you will get immediately another one. So let me look at this an exercise that proves the following. Let's consider just a standard Consider just a standard one-sword counter set. Standard one-sword counter set. So what you do, you take that unit interval. Oh, you know the proof that if you consider the standard counter set and intersect it with the same counter set shifted by alpha, of course it By alpha. Of course, if alpha is large, then you will just get two disjoint pants that far away from each other. But what if alpha is smaller than one in absolute failure? Then I claim that this is not going to be empty set if alpha is smaller than one. So if you shift it just slightly, then we will necessarily keep the point of intersection somewhere. And that's essentially the mechanism that allows you to obtain this result. This result. By the way, it's not true for any counter set, so you need to introduce some characteristics. If you remove a little bit more than one sort, then it's already not true. If you remove a little bit less, then it's not true. There is a whole theory behind, but let's not go there. Okay, so we establish that we have this picture. And now I want to provide an informal diagram that Jacob Paulis used to. I used to provide at his talks in the 90s Paul's diagrams. So what he did, he said the following. In 60s or even 70s, people in dynamics thought that mostly you have hyperbolic dynamical systems. They can be complicated, you can have an observant map, you can have horseshoes, but nevertheless it's hyperbolic. Also, people already read. Also, people already realized that there is some small dark fields. There are some new house examples. There are some little things, little open sets where something is off. But in general, people believe that everything must be hyperbolic. That was in the 60s and 70s. Then people studied hyperbolic dynamics, completed the description, and so on and so forth, and then they realized that actually. course and then we realize that actually what's interesting is not the hyperbolic power hyperbolic dynamics still interesting but there is a huge part in dynamical systems partially hyperbolic dynamics nikhaus domain many many different things that form the dark reload that was the state of minds of dynamicists in the 90s and i want to add one extra part to this diagram so let's see nowadays You have an open set of systems that are not structurally stable, you have an open set of systems that are structurally stable, and they are somehow located in that space of dynamical systems. So if this is a space of homomorphisms, then somehow you have some domains of hyperbolicity, and in between you have some. Between you have some new house domain and you have some other parts of the dark realm. How those two open sets are intermingled. So for example, if you take one-dimensional, typical one-dimensional curve, and you want to go from one hyperbolic system to another, what will happen with this intersection? Is it going to be just a finite number of wave locations, or it's going to be some intervals, or you can get a counterset, or you will get... Or you can get a counter set, or you will get something more complicated, like counter wall, for example, whatever it is. So, this is actually of practical interest in spectral theory, for example, because that intersection is a space of dynamical systems that are not performing hyperbolic, corresponds exactly to the spectrum of the corresponding operator, for which you would consider the Schringer Poseidon and so on. So, this is what many people are working right now, finding. Many people are working right now finding their experience in that direction. Could you say all that again? What the horizontal lines are, what the line you drew through there is. So there are some domains inside a hyperbolic that correspond to hyperbolic realm. So those are structurally stable. Hyperbolic realm. Those are structurally stable with homorphics. This is an open set, but that open set can be very complicated. For example, the complement to the Complicated. For example, the complement to the counter set is also an open set, but it's pretty complicated, and so on, and so forth. And you know that in the complement, you also have an open set. And then they are intermingled in a very complicated way. And the question of how exactly they are located to each other, what's the structure of the boundary, and so on, this is something that people study. Okay, so if you perturb hyperbolic just a little bit. A little bit. It will remain hyperbolic, as I'm sure. So, way interested in. I mentioned that in some cases you want to consider one parameter family of dynamical systems, and you want to see how that one parameter family intersects hyperbolic part and non-hyperbolic part. So, what's going to be in the boundary? So, in many cases, for example, that intersection is non-hyperbolic part is going to be counterset. Control set. Then you will be interested in the properties of that contracept, and so on and so forth. Now, the dynamics in the hyperbolic part is very well understood, but it's not very interesting from the point of view of classification because classification is there, essentially. What's interesting is what's happening in the dark realm, and people were trying. And people were trying to do that, and initially, there were some really nice results. So, New Haus, in particular, proved that there is a residual set in the new house domain where you have infinitely many attractors, targeting pre-waypoints. Then, people proved that you can have infinitely many non-trivial stranger tractors and so on. And it was more results. And then people just realized that you actually can get anything you want. And that's not just And that's uh and and that's not just um uh heuristic statement, it's a formal statement. And perhaps this is the last um thing that I want to say before I start talking about classification. Open set stance. Again, is the union race to open set stance on the space? Perfect question. Where is it mark? So the question was the following: if you take the set of structural Of structural stable systems together with new house demo. Is it dense in the space of all differomorphisms? The answer is the following. If part is equal to 1, then yes. And this is the result by Moderal Since Sambarina. Yeah, I'm mistaking myself to dimension to Sambarina. And this is. Marino, uh and this is this was a big deal in the paper appeared about many years ago in Nanos. But if part is larger than one, then it's still an open question to judgement health. The Pauli's conjecture is that the answer should be yes, but we just don't know. Um all right, so Now, I want to talk about unormalization and universal dynamics. So, suppose that I have some dynamics. So, for example, I have a unit mode on a plane, and suppose that I have a map. And suppose that I have a map G that maps the closure of the unit ball to R2 of some form. It turns out that, so roughly speaking, this is, but in this way you can realize any dynamical system you want. You can realize any dynamical phenomena you want. You just take any abstract smooth map. Suppose that this is R. One and let's say that the map tree appears via the normalization in the mimics of F which is CR the homomorphism of subsurface. Of some surface, if the following holds. So, what I want, I want to have some set V, and inside there will be some set V prime, and all that is inside of our phrase space M. So if there exists open set V prime inside of V, inside of M. And there exists such iterate such that the following clause There exists a CR change of coordinates R map sine from V to R two so what I want I want to send this guy into Into R2 such a way that if I consider first psi eithers and then so now I'm here then I'm going to consider m iterates of f and then I'm going to And then I'm going to go back to my initial coordinate system. And if I restrict myself to the ball B, this is the same as I will get exactly my map G, that is spacecraft. So if you have this picture, if this specific type of dynamics appear on a small scale, maybe somewhere for my map, and maybe not just for And maybe not just for the map, but for some large iterate of the map, you still have all the same dynamical phenomena. If you have an attractor here, you will have an attractor here, and so on and so forth. Turns out And this is a theorem that is also a summary of several results, mostly by Results mostly by Rayev, but also one chinkai at Shonikov and higher dimension. So I'm sure that I forget some of the results. But anyway, mostly by me derived, the claim is the following. For NR, these two, there exists an open set. There exists an open set A inside of the new house domain, non-empty because we call that absolute house domain. And Tom, what is V prime? V prime is not anywhere, just the first one. Um in in your definition. The subside um Um so just the language part of it so um so the idea that you turns is so here uh psi of p, psi of b prime is equal to So I have the change of coordinates which send V to some maybe larger disk and that V prime is sent exactly to the little disk. I see, so you're transferring over to V. The claim is the following. Inside of the new house domain, it's not the whole new house domain, but there is some non-empty open part of the new house domain such that Such that for any G, which is C R map of the closed unit discontinued R2, there exists a dense set E inside of this absolute and hollow domain such that for any map f on the D, Map F under D, G appears in dynamics of F via this procedure, the normalization. This is absolutely amazing picture because what it means, it means that you can take any dynamical phenomenon and you can find it densely in some open set of dynamical systems, and in particular, for example. And in particular, for example, what you can do, you can create the same host domain for this map, then you can iterate the procedure. So essentially, all the dynamical phenomena intermingled in a very complicated way. It's completely clear, I mean, from the common sense, not from the descriptive set theory, that absolutely no chance there exists to classify anything here. But of course, the question is whether Question is whether you can actually improve that. So, this is actually where the nemesis stopped and thought that, okay, that's it. There is nothing else we can do. But it turns out that one can prove formally that you don't have any classification here, and that's exactly what I'm trying to do. So, just before I go. So, just before I go to Zir, just a small remark. You can enhance this result in many different ways. For example, if you consider similar results, result holds in the space of dynamical systems. If you consider, for example, area-preserving dynamical systems, and this is of analogous in-house domain was constructed by Federal Duarte. By Federal Duarte and said, uniform dynamics in air-preserving case also was worked out by the interaction. I don't remember. I don't remember, but most likely yes, but I cannot promise that what would have to live up and this was on paper by Torre Branching Henschel. All right. I'm pretty sure that the answer should be yes because in hosting does your life. Does survive neo-analyticity, and the proof is by renormalization. So, what you do, you prove that via renormalization, you can get essentially a null map, and by composition of a null map, you can approximate any polynomial map, and by polynomial maps, you can approximate any polynomial map. And I think that's I can do one. Here is a first result from what I might call coffee-table mathematics. The claim. The claim is that if you consider, so take any equivalence solution which is either topological equivalence or equivalence by a C1 change of coordinates or by C2 change of coordinates or by C infinity change of coordinates. And this is an equivalence relation in the case of diffeomorphisms of any manifold. Any manifold of this dimension is this two. So we claim that there is no chance to find a classification by numerical invariance. There is no classification of this space is that equivalent selflation by numerical thirds. So what it means, um it means that there is this non-barel non-Barel function f from the sprees of homomorphisms to say real numbers, or as we know now, we can replace it by any polar space style set. F of F would be equal to F of G if and only if F would be equivalent to G, and this equivalence would be concentration from this collection. Any comments by conjugacy? You can choose topological conjugacy or conjugacy by some change of coordinates or conjugacy by topologies. It's change of coordinates, so it's conjugacy. So, in particular, it means that if you have some numerical invariants, it doesn't matter how many and how fine those numerical invariants are, they will not define the dynamics up to the context. So, let me, before I go to the proof, let me mention some of the invariants that people in dynamical systems consider and let me And let me explain that those are Schwabarel functions. So as an example, okay, what's your favorite function on the space of dynamical systems? On the space? Yeah, yeah. Entropy. So topological entropy is exactly the map from mechanical systems to from dynamical systems to R. And this is rel. Okay, I won't torture you anymore. Let me just give the following proposition that you have a bunch of examples. So let's denote by fixed of f as a set of fixed points and by RPODI And by our PDU widget uh by this symbol I will know the set of PUV points of PUTP. So for example, the following functions are so first of all if you n But if you can't do it, if you can folding sets up around functions around First of all, the set of diffeomorphisms that have no fixed points is borrowed. The circle of disheamorphisms diffeomorphisms where the number of fixed points is exactly n is barrack. The set of morphisms such that the number of periodic points of EO to n is equal to L is parameter. What else? We can see how fast the number of periodic points grows as the number, as the period grows. So of half which is defined as to something that is well defined. 1 over n multiplied by the law of the number of periodic points of period n. So for example, for an OSF map or for the Or for topological Markov chain, and therefore for any structural state, but if I morphism, this is a well-defined quantity, and this is a finite quantity. So the number of pero-eight points cannot grow faster than exponential, but it does. This function is burned. And then you can invent anything else. I bet that you will get an invariant which is burned. So just to demonstrate how it works, let me improve just Let me prove just some couple of the statements from here. The first one is actually um relatively simple, because what does it mean that you have a compact manifold and you have a map that has no fixed points? Map that has no fixed points. It means that every point will be shifted to some other point on some positive distance. And due to compactness, that distance is at least, I don't know, one over a thousand. That means that if you make a small perturbation of the diffeomorphism, then every point will be shifted by at least one over two thousandths. And therefore, this set is just open. So if you don't use open, what about you? What about U1, for example? So let's show that U1 is well. 1 is a set of diffeomorphisms that have exactly one fixed point. So let M of this i be a basis of topology on m. And without loss of generality, we can choose a base of topology such that the diameter of V1 is not less than the diameter of V2 and so on. And moreover, we can require that the diameter of Vi tends to 0 as I tends to infinity. So we have smaller and smaller open sets that form a base of the curvature. And now what I want to do, I want to do the following. want to do I want to do the following I want to define a mu n is a space of amorphisms such that f has no fixed points outside of V n. The complement to V n is a closed set, therefore it's compact, and therefore exactly the same arguments shows that this is an open set. And show that this is an open set. Okay, so for each n, we have an open set. And then we can express one in the following way. What I want to do is I want to take the union over all case larger than some n large. And I will take this mu n. Then I will take the intersection over all n. And then I will... So what do I have here? Here I have the set of... Here I have the set of all points where all the set of fixed points has diameter that is sufficiently small. After I take an intersection, I'm sure that I have the set of fixed points that has diameter which is zero, which means that it's either one point or exactly set. And therefore, if you remove a set of Different motions that don't have any fixed points, then you will get exactly the set of Different motions that has exactly one fixed point, and that's obvious. Fixed point, and that's obviously you can proceed in the same way and finish the proof. And essentially, anything you can come up with, even some function like being minimal or being transitive or something like that, all those properties form a parallel set in the space. Nevertheless, all those invariants are not enough to determine the index. So, y is that. So let me reformulate that result. So um a continuous map. So essentially what we want, we want to uh find a particular detection of input. Find a parallel reduction of a naught to the equivalence relation. As soon as we do that, we are done. So, what we claim is that there is a continuous. It's enough to find Borel map, but we will in short find a continuous map. Let's call it R, on the set of sequences of zeros and ones to the space of Defendomorphs that said. such that omega not omega prime, if and only if r of omega is equivalent to r of omega prime. That's enough to prove this the let me uh remind that uh the equivalency relation in the space of sequences that we might be not is the following. You take two sequences of zeros at once. Two sequences of zeros at once. And those sequences, if those sequences differ only in finite number of places, then they are inaugurated. Otherwise, then first of all, we will start with some preparations. What we need, we need a countable number of different Countable number of different types of dynamics that are really different, that are not contradicting. So, formally, what I want to do, I claim that there exists a sequence of maps, Gn, of the, let's say, of R2 to R2, such that Gn outside of the unit ball is side of the union ball is identity. G m is C infinity. And G n is not equivalent to G m if n is not equal to n. So roughly speaking, formally speaking, I want to find countably many different maps of a unit bolt to itself, which is identity on the boundary, which is infinity, such that the dynamics is actually different. So, for example, here's what I want to do. What I can do, I can just take each of those maps to be time one shift over a gradient flow. And the gradient flow is the gradient flow of a function, which is infinite function, which is just identically zero outside of the infinite disk. And for example, it has one maximum here, and so the gradient flow is just the flow that has one attractor, a point as an attractor. A point as my character. That is going to be my true point. Okay, now what I can do, I can take a function, which is a sinfinite function, that takes that has inside of this disk the whole interval of maxima, and that interval is exactly going to be my attractor. So if you want to write it down formally, uh you will have to struggle a little bit with the way to write it, but intuitively, um of course you can find a function such that the set of functions just Well, notice that those are not conjugate because if they were, then the set of fixed points would be mapped to the set of fixed points and those are not hemomorphic. Okay, but now I can do exactly the same and I can do, I can certainly find countable many non-hemiomorphic closed sets. That's not a problem. Okay, so um Okay, so I made sure that I have countable many different maps that I can use in the construction. The construction is as follows. First of all, the construction is local, so it really doesn't matter whether my phase space is a sphere or it's toros or whatever. Or whatever, everything is going to be happening in about a domain. First, I will choose two points. Those are going to be fixed points of any map that they will construct and any potential contravas. So, in order to make sure that those are fixed points for any potential contravassacy, what I'm going to do, I'm going to draw a sequence of disks that converge to the first point. That converges to the first point, let's call it A, and the second point, let's call it B. I will insert the, so I will take half of my guys, for example those with even this, whatever, and I will put those guys here in such a way that if everywhere else I have identity, then the map that I can start. Have identity, then the map that I constructed is going to be synfinite map. I can certainly do that because I can always multiply my vector field by any small constant. And if I do that, then the corresponding diffeomorphism is going to have a very small norm. And I can make sure that this norm goes to zero fast enough to guarantee that altogether I have smoothness not only everywhere in the disk, but also in the tree. Okay, I will do exactly the same. I will do exactly the same with... So those guys are not going to be changed, and those are needed only to make sure that the point A and the point B are not going to move anywhere by any potential conjugacy. The parts that are important to me is another sequence of disks that converge also to those points. And I will show the second half The second half here. So I have some maps there, there, and there. So all of them are non-topological conjugates. So up to this point, I just constructed one C infinity map. And I will be clear that this map is going to be R of 0 over 0 in the sequence of all 0s. So I already constructed the image of one sequence. Now I want to construct. Now, I want to construct an image of some other sequence. Here's what I'm going to do. If I take a restriction to any of the lower disks, that's going to be exactly the same. I will not change anything. I will not change anything here. So let me denote somehow the upper disks. So let it be A1 B A2 and so on. And this is B1 B superscript B2 and so on. So those are my disks. Now, if initially all of them are. All of them are different. So, for any two disks, the dynamics is different. All of them are completely different and not contribute to each other. So, if omega k is equal to zero, so I have a sequence if k's element is equal to zero, then I don't change, so this is my BAK and this is my BBK, I don't change the dynamics inside of those. then R of 1 restricted to V K is equal to R of 0 restricted to V K and the same for V V. But if formation t is equal to 1, What I'm going to do, I'm going to swap the dynamics. So the dynamics that I used to have here will be now in that disk, and the dynamics that was used to be here will be now in that disk. So then our omega restricted to BK. I cannot say equal, but it will be conjugate to the restriction of R0 to BKB. Uh the end otherware all. I claim that this map satisfies this property. Indeed. If those two sequences are equivalent, then I swap dynamics only in finite number of places. And if I have Finite number of places. And if I have a finite number of places where I solve the dynamics, I can find as smooth, as smooth as I want, diffeomorphisms that change with the coordinates, that maps one dynamics into another. On the other hand, if I have infinitely many places where I have to make this small, then by continuity, then I have a problem with continuity at the point A and B if I try to do that, because the lower sequence of disks ensured that. Of disks ensure that if I have such a conjugacy, then A must be mapped to A and B must be mapped to B by that conjugacy. But if I want to sort those guys, there's no way. So now I guess we can see why Matt was calling that table a coffee table problem. I can make sure that those are repeated the question. Yes, I'm saying these maps are such that all the different kinds of All the different the conjugacy relations under considerations coincide on the on these maps, on the images of our yes. We can, for example, make exactly the same map, and the change of poisonings can be even affine. When they are equivalent, they're actually C of Tim the function, right? Yes, yes. And when they're not usually crooked, they're not even topologically functioning. Um well, if if you have certainly uh topological equivalence, that's why that's why I said that uh you you can take you can choose your equivalence relation from that list. Topological equivalence is something that uh dynamicists are mostly interested in in small dynamics, so I wanted to explicitly emphasize that this is the one that also copied. Uh, if you believed in that, then um, so how much time do I still have? Um. Five more minutes. Okay. Then I want to mention another result. So you can ask a stronger statement. So you have that equivalence relation on that space. Is that equivalence relation is Baraba? And that's your question. So another theorem is the following. M is the dimension of m plus 5. And now I want to restrict myself to topological equivalence. This topological equivalence on the space of diffeomorphisms of m of plus of small s r. Oh, let's actually just take c infinity. So this topological relation on the space of C infinity if I'm more famous is not. C-infinite diffomorphisms is not relevant. The idea is the following. What you want, you want to construct a red reduction of the space, of the equivalent self-exation by isomorphism on the space of countable graphs. To the speech of diffeomorphisms. This is topological huge. I have to say that after we finish the proof, we got another idea that maybe it will eliminate this condition completely, but this is not something that we are really talking about. So, how the proof of this statement was going? Amazingly, pretty naive idea works. The naive idea is the following. Let's just take a countable graph. Let's just take a countable sequence of points in our manifold that converge somewhere. Somewhere. Let's make sure that those points are such that none of first of all we can work in a chart and therefore we can think that we are actually in Euclidean space, let's say five-dimensional Euclidean space. We can make sure that no two points, no three points are on the same line and no four points are on the same plane. Everything is generic. So what you can do now, you can construct a countable Graph, just all those vertices. Now, what I want to do, I want to construct a diffeomorphism that corresponds to this graph. What I need to do, I need to mark somehow dynamically, so all the vertices are going to be fixed points of my diffeomorphism, and on the edges I want somehow to mark dynamically the edge as the edge that exists or the edge that doesn't exist. So, here what one can do. One can take One can do. One can take really, really small, we call it cigar, it's an open set around that edge. And if I looked at this open set, I can draw another picture. So this is one vertex, this is another vertex, this is an edge. And since everything is five-dimensional, what I can do, I can either insert the dynamic that moves everything to work, the Or the H in that small neighborhood, or it makes this H an attractor in a sense, or it moves the other way around, and that makes it a repeller. So this is something that any topological contributor can distinguish, and therefore I marked each age as the age that exists or the age that doesn't exist. Therefore, I constructed the map from the space of graphs to the space of dynamical systems. Now, the question is why this Now, the question is why this is a reduction. This map is continuous, not jet parallel. Why is this a reduction? Now, if those two dynamical systems are topologically conjugate, then this topological conjugacy gives you some permutation on the vertices. The permutation on the vertices gives you an isomorphism of the graph because we called it uh all the uh edges. All the images. So that direction is easy. The hard direction is to show that an opposite statement holds. If you have some isoms that are isomorphic, then the corresponding diffeomorphisms are going to be topological contributing. So the trick here is the following. First of all, you notice that any permutation of natural numbers can be represented as a product of transpositions with some special matural property. And now you want to realize. And now you want to realize uh that if you just swap two vertices, uh what happens, uh uh you get an isomorphic uh you you get a topological conjugate uh a diffeomorphism. But then you want to take the product of those, so you want to take the product of those conjugacies and you want to make sure that they do not interfere. So up to this point all the construction would work in three-dimensional space. Why do we need five? It's because the idea is to pull those two vertices Those two vertices to an outer space, in a sense, swap them there and put them back. Now, if you do that, if you follow that homatopia and see, so you have one-dimensional edges, you have homatopia is also two-dimensional. So, in four-dimensional space, two-dimensional surfaces can have point of intersection that we cannot kill. So, but if you have five-dimensional space, then you can do that. Now, idea seems to be simple, but if you write the proof, you will get. Uh simple, but if you write it off, you will get 65 pages of text, uh, so it's not uh quite obvious, uh, but I get sessions from here and there. Any questions, Miss Bigger? Uh yes. Stars are three-dimensional? Five-dimensional. The full five-dimensional. Okay, so if I mean, the graph may not be planar or it can be crazy, like when you draw it, it can be like. So, the way we do that, we put that graph inside. We do that, we put that graph inside of three-dimensional space. Then we consider that three-dimensional space as a subspace of five-dimensional space. Then we consider those neighborhoods in five-dimensional space. We insert the dynamics there. All those cigars do not intersect, and moreover, when you swap them, you make sure that you never intersect on the way so. So that's why you need uh additional detimation. I actually don't see why this better. I mean, in the three dimensions, you'll have it even more complicated and wellness. Perhaps there's some special addition. And what if we think about graphs with this additional graph? The problem is that we don't know whether it's true that if you have two isomorphic graphs, then the corresponding diffomorphisms are topologically contradictory. Are topologically countries. Well, now you're in the winter, it should be more complicated, but I would make it. No, no, if you want to ask me what I believe is true, I believe that you can put it. I mean, this condition is absolutely irrelevant. It's just an apt effect of the financial. One note with metal. With a different note. Okay, since now we move to the questions, I want to, instead of answering questions, I want to put more questions to you in particular. Obviously, what we did here in both cases is using synfinity surgery. How about analytic category, male analytic category, or even analytic category? I'm pretty sure that you have in-house domain in analytic category. You have all the complications. Category, you have all those complications, there is no chance you have any reasonable precipitation. Well, I mean, contested, the more rigidity you put, the harder it becomes to prove. Yes, nevertheless, these are very interesting questions. So, what are kind of what are my cases of the most interesting? So, already you see that in real-rigged scenarios, right, one parameter, polynomial thamo. Parameter polynomial families, you can get some difficulties. Not quite at this level. I mean, there is no account about it. I asked Michelle Levich exactly about this question about quadratic family, and his answer was the following. If MLC pulls, then he is pretty sure that numerical invariance can be used to close. Well, okay, so there is a fairly easy implication that NLC implies that the metaphor except. implies that the mountain ports are this computable. Which is, yes, so this is this is even weaker. So density of hyperbolicity implies that the mountain ports are this computable. By the way, nothing is known that before is known. So yeah, so but this is perhaps too rigid, right? This is perhaps too rigid. Analytic would really be the most interesting. Or what's considered two variables, what's considered a standard point. Two variables was considered sustainable. Uh two variables yes were where I have some perhaps some what are the questions that are at least so another question not for people in that works in analytic critiquery but for people who work in smooth critiquery. So we have list couple. So the question have at least couple. So the question to you those examples are totally non-degenerate, totally degenerate, I mean completely degenerate. What if we consider Caucasus male diffeomorphisms? Is it possible to classify those? I'm pretty sure that no, because why? Another question. Is it true that there exists a density delta subset of the space of diffeomorphism which is classifiable by numerical invariance? I still believe that the answer is no, but that's probably. Answer is no, but that's probably even harder, and I have no idea how to process it. Or you can put some additional restrictions and so on and so forth, but any questions that you ask is going to be open-ended. Oh, by the way, sorry, this is not smooth, this is analytic. People do try to classify higher-dimensional polynomial time. Right, so there is there are various approaches to medon theory. So people at least seem to believe that well I mean this is this is unknown at present, but people at least seem to believe that the answer is this is too rigid, right? It is quite obvious that if you if you consider small gray Consider small perturbations in sufficient. And there is no hope. Well, what all that stuff does is actually gives a hope to finish the question completely, to answer a question completely. Much much interest and then in the piecewise linear linear category, it's just in a higher P. Our category, it's just in a higher E, right? So, for instance, we have a series of papers in which we put that Kurstan equivalence, inventorial equivalence, is frequently decidable. That's in dimension two. So, piecewise linear maps. Degree is not necessarily one, and the question is whether uh and the equivalence relation is just to change the triangulation of the image and the vertices to vertices. Vertices to vertices. Subtriangulations. Fine sub-triangulations which make the mattresses thing. That's it. This is known as Turstan equivalence. There's some rather difficult theory there, but they are algorithmically decidable whether it is such things. Now, it's known that it's not algorithmically decidable at high enough dimension, even for once. Even peace-wise high enough, I mean, like public. So, if high enough, I mean, like Navodovsky-Weinberg looks like dimension. It's a sort of byproduct of what they do for manifolds in general, so this is not all. So, what about dimension four, for instance? So, four, I'm not picking four for random reasons. This should correspond to manifolds of dimension five, just these sort of linear equations. So, these are finite, finite objects, right? Torially finite objects. Nothing's known. I mean, nothing's known in dimensions higher than 2, and in dimension 2, they are classifiable because of some rigidity statements, which are rather which will not. No, I'm too late for you. I'm happy to get me. Online questions? Okay, let's send questions. Next talk is at 10:30.
