So thank you for the organizer for organizing this workshop. It's a pity it's online, but yeah, well. And in fact, I'll report on a joint work where it sort of started in a previous edition of the workshop. So let me first explain what our First, explain what are quasi-fiber binary solid pressure operators. So, I'll report on the joint work with Chris Kotke. So, let M be a manifold with boundary and take it. With uh a fiber bundle that goes from M to S. S is a closed manifold and consider on R plus times. times dm the following metric so it's dr square plus r square pullback of some metric gs on s plus kappa so r is strictly positive and so g is metric on s On S and when I pull back GS and I add kappa, I get a metric on the M such that phi with this metric is a Riemannian formulation. Okay, so before talking about quasi-fiber boundary, let me give a definition of fiber boundary metric. So fiber boundary metric. On the interior of M is a complete metric J, which outside the compact set Is asymptotic to this model metric here star. So this model metric star, in fact, you could think of it as a Riemannian subversion over a cone. And I'll point out in particular that the tangent cone at infinity Of g, namely, which I want to take the limit when t goes to infinity of g res scale by t square. So when you do this, so it's sort of try to shrink as much as you can the manifold, and what survives is exactly the cone, this cone metric. This cone metric over S. So when the link is uh the link of the cone is s. So this fiber binary metric, they are generalizing, in fact, simpler metrics. So the Euclidean metric is an example. And then you can generalize the Euclidean metric by looking at metric that asymptotically look like a Euclidean metric outside the compact set. So I'll call them like this. You could also But also, a bit further down. So, asymptotically Euclidean metric, you could generalize to this asymptotically locally Euclidean metric. So, it looks like a Euclidean metric, but a quotient of the Euclidean metric away from the origin. And photogenalization is scattering metric or a simply conical metric. As simply conical metric, where instead of adding the link of your model con at infinity being a quotient of a sphere, it's any closed manifold. And then there are fiber boundary metric. You add a fiber above this at infinity somehow. So that's the picture. And so what is the idea of definition? The definition behind quasi-fiber boundary metrics or QFB metrics is to you want to allow the tangent cone at infinity so in the case of fiber boundary metric is dr times r squared times gs to Square times G to have a singular cross-section SGS with S a smoothly start smoothly start white space and GS a wedge metric. A wedge metric or iterated edge metric, a complete edge metric. In the many interesting examples, it's simpler than that. It's just S is just the quotient of a sphere, but the quotient which is not smooth, which is a Norbifold. And in this case, the metric you pit, it's just the quotient of the round metric. Okay, so that's just this, and in many interesting examples. This and in many interesting examples, that's all what you need to do, so you can keep this example in mind. Oops, and right, so before I won't give a detailed definition of what are Q of B metric, but let me give important examples. So, a recent example, so it's due to So it's due to it's R2 and Fritz Katie and Singer. So it's an announcement made in 2018 with detail to come, but it says that on the reduce Moduli space if I denote it, M0K of SU2 monopoles of charge K the L two metric is Is an example of a QFB metric. Maybe it was not here from what I said, but the metric itself and the space where it is defined, everything is smooth. But when you take this limit to define the tangent cone, the tangent cone itself is singular, but not the space we consider. So everything is smooth, complete. In fact, it's of bounded geometry. In fact, it's of bounded geometry. Another example goes back to Gilles Carron, and there's another argument that was given later by Richard. It says that the Hilbert scheme, so on the Hilbert scheme. Gilbert scheme of endpoints on C2, the Nakajima metric. It's a special type of QLB metric. It's in fact what is called a QLE metric. And in this case, the tangent cone at infinity with the tangent cone at infinity given by so it's C2N0 mod symmetry group where C2N C to n mod zero corresponds to the q in n Cartesian product of C2 with itself n time and I ask that the sum is equal to zero. So the symmetric group of n element naturally act on this and the cone is singular. So coming back to the So, coming back to the diagram above, so this QALE metric, so it's a generalization as the name suggests of ALE metric. So, the model is that your tangent cone at infinity, it's still a quotient of a sphere, but you allow your quotient to be an orbifold. It's a cone over a quotient of a sphere, but the sphere, this quotient can be singular, can be a Norbifold. And so that goes back to Joyce, who introduced this and Who introduced this and gave, explained how to construct Calabiao examples of those metrics. And subsequently, in the same way that a simple clinical metric generalizes ALE metric, there's work by Andade Geratu and Refanzero generalizing the QALE metric of joist to quasi-acyclic clinical metric, this QAC metric. And there they gave, they generalize using quite completely different methods some mapping property of the scalar Laplacian for this metric. And you can use it to construct example of Calabio QEC metric with this estimate. Frederick, your screen is not scrolling. It's not scrolling. Keep on going, yeah. Uh, keep on going, yeah. Go down. No, no, but uh, I went back up to put the diagram. Forgive me, okay. Yeah, sorry, mine. I'll go down, I'll go down, yeah. So, there's this QAC metric, and then there are this QFB metric. It's a generalization of QAC metric where you add the fiber bundle above this, essentially. So, it's a particular case. And I should have mentioned that this ALE metric, there's a generalization, this ALF metric, and I think there are the letters. ALF metric, and I think there are the letter ALF, ALJ, and ALH. And I don't know if it's stopped there, but all of those are particular examples of fiber boundary metric. And these two examples here that I mentioned on the Hilbert scheme and on the moduli space of monopoles, they are hypercaler metric. And this you know because they are constructed from hypercalor quotient. Hypercaler quotient. So they're very nice metric in that sense. And so more generally the deparation in all detail of a QAB metric use natural compactification by a manifold with corner equipped with an iterated vibration structure. So on each bonus. So, on each bony wrapper surface, there's a fiber bundle. So, I can say quickly it's a manifold with fiber corners. And you can define it in a neat global way at once once you have this manifold with a choice of total boundary defining function. But to give more intuition of what's going on, I prefer to go back to more the approach of Andai and RAIF defining QA symmetric and define. QEC metric and define a local model at infinity that covers entirely with different links how the QFB metric looks like at infinity. So to give a and then this using iteration on the depth of your manifold with fiber corner, this model you can use to build your Your to build the how a QSV metric looks outside a compact set but in specific region. So what let me write what I wanted to say. So they so QFB metric can be Can be defined iteratively using the depth of their compactification by Um manifold with corners with the fiber corners using the following local models local at infinity, you know, in the direction you look at infinity. In the direction you look at infinity local model of the form for the following form. And for those who know the definition of iterated edge metric or wedge metric, in the sense it's very similar. So you you want that the it will look at there's still this conmetric and then now I I'll suppose that the fiber bundle I look at the ball in the base where it's trivial. The ball in the base where it's trivial. So I don't have to worry about the fiber bundle too much. And it just becomes a Cartesian product of a cone metric. And GZ is a QFB metric of lower depth. Interior of Z, but I assume it's a manifold with fiber corner. So at the first step, Z is just a closed manifold. So it's just a Riemannian metric. And you get the behavior at infinity of a fiber boundary metric this way in a region where your fiber model can be trivialized. And then the next step is Is GZ is instead a fiber boundary metric. So Z is a manifold with boundary. And then you can continue like this with IUZ. And here again, R is bigger than zero. And infinity is when R goes into infinity. B is a ball, an open ball in, say, in Rn, some Rn. So this is a Cartesian product of a cone and of a QFB metric. But I lied a bit when saying that really the model, it's this metric in equation star star. Really, if row is A positive function with which outside the compact set is assembled behaving like a distance function with respect to this QB metric GZ with respect to a fixed point Q. So Q I fix in the interior of Z. Then Then, this matrix star tar is only a model in the region, the following smaller region. And I'll draw a picture in a moment to clarify. So, that's something a bit different than what's happening for a wedge metric or for iterate the edge metric. So I have this R, B, and Z inside the R plus times B times Z. And what I ask is that rho Z is asked to be smaller than delta times R. Okay, and I'll for some delta positive, and I'll draw a picture. So, like this. So, I have my manifold Z. I remove B from the picture and I'll draw maybe this dotted line is supposed to be the equation rho Z is bigger than delta R, right? And then if I draw in And then if I draw in green the part of Z that we see though, so for each fixed R, we don't see the entire manifold Z, we only see a part of it, a compact region. But as R goes to gets bigger, the compact region gets bigger. Ultimately, in the limit, when R goes to infinity, you recover the entire manifold Z, but it's only at infinity. at infinity so for for in the entire error for each each step in the model you only see a compact region of the manifold and so because of this the the local model the local model is is not a Cartesian product Or uh a war product, but uh but it uh sits inside one. And well, I was not planning to describe the uh what's happening in terms of manifold corner and uh least structured NVT, Li algebra vector fields, but uh this is reflected in terms of uh vector field. They are more intricate than in other Than in other situations because of this feature. Okay, so well, it was a bit sketchy, but well, I hope you get a flavor of what are those QFV metrics. And then let me go with the main result I want to present today. So So um let M be uh a manifold with fiber corner and of depth of depth two. Okay, so that's an important uh hypothesis and then if you choose a global If you choose a global total boundary dependent function, you get a class of QAV metric in the interior of this manifold. So let's suppose I did such a choice, and then with and you see I'll be really safe with this theorem. There's no way I can be wrong because I'll say with J QF B metric satisfying. Satisfying some assumption, some mysterious assumption. Okay, so there are many of them, so I was planning, I'll keep it mysterious, but when I give an idea of how to prove the theorem, I'll indicate what sort of assumption you need somehow. Okay. Okay, so suppose we are in the setting. Suppose we are in the setting, let v a smooth function on the manifold with corner be a total boundary defining function okay so you take a boundary definite function for each upper surface for simplicity you can assume that there's only two with a meeting at Assume that there's only two with the meeting at the corner. And you take a proxy of those. Or equivalently, it's V, it's a smooth function such that when you take the inverse of this function in the interior of manifold, it behaves like the distance function from a fixed point. Say outside the compact set. Okay, so with this assumption, then the Ajdaram operator the Ajdaram operator induces a thread. That goes so I'll denote the slash so that goes from say L2 L2 form with respect to the QFV metric such that when I apply my operation Such that when I apply my operator, I still lie. I don't lie more than in L2, but it was we asked something, okay. And it maps not in L2, but in V times L2. Yes? Okay. Journalizing a result for the US. Journalizing a result for fiber boundary metric, which, well, it's not quite in the thesis of Vaya, but then it's mentioned in a work and what the indication how to prove it is mentioned in a paper of Arcel, Umsiker and Mazeo. So it's somehow this generalized in the depth 2 setting. And more importantly, in a sense, it's easier to obtain, but it's more important. obtain but it's uh it's more important moreover there exists there exists delta bigger than zero such that um L2 harmonic form so the the L2 kernel of this Hush deram operator they are they decay a bit more than L2 form So, the slight more decay. And this, so I was not planning to, I want to focus on this result, but I want to mention that our big motivation for getting this result is that so. So combine with other results. I mean, it's not just this, but that's one of the key ingredients to prove. So using this, you can, and using the work of Fritz Kotkin-Singer, you can prove the same conjecture in depth too. So in the case of the moduli space of Modulized space of on the universal cover of the reduced moduli space of monopole of charge tree. And yeah, so you can prove this conjecture tells you how big is supposed to be the moduli space of homonic form. And similarly, for the For the Hilbert scheme of endpoints on C2, we can prove the Waffa-Whiten conjecture using this result and other stuff. We can prove the Wafa-Witten conjecture for, I forgot if it's presumably maybe it's three or four points. So there was a result obtained by Result obtained by in depth two, there was already a result obtained by Caron. And we are able to recover by different methods this result. And we can push a bit higher. Although this result here is stay for depth two, somehow we have a trick there to push a bit the result in this setting. But and for the moment, And for the moment, this depth two, it doesn't seem essential. Chris and I are working actively to remove this assumption, but I'll explain a bit later where's the problem to push the result of the chiaphormonic form and the Frenon-Nest result to higher depth. So the maybe Maybe uh if it's please uh don't hesitate to uh stop me and uh ask questions by the way. Uh um so the the the strategy of the proof it uh in the back I mean the the main tool is manifold corners uh blow-ups uh um beefration the the usual stuff as for those who know uh the approach of Richard it it's uh it's it's all there It's all there. But and the strategy is you build up soda differential calculus using manifold corners. And within this calculus, you construct a good enough parametrics to show those results. Interestingly, the result about the decay harmonic form I'm saying it's slightly easier in the sense that it seems we would be able to do it just having the double space. So no composition result. So, no composition results using a triple space. But for the Fredom result, we try hard because for a long time we were not able to construct a triple space. It was really painful. It took a lot of effort to get the triple space. In fact, finding the right triple space, we found that we were mistaken our double space anyway. But finding the right triple space was essential to push to get. Was essential to push to get the Federm result. In fact, even in the fiber boundary setting, I don't know of a way to prove that the result of Vaya and Auscell on SikhRMAT Zero without having composition result from the triple space, it seems. But yeah, maybe there's something I'm missing on this. But anyway, so given, assuming you have this nice calculus, I wanted to describe germany. I wanted to describe geometrically what are the sort of models you have to invert at infinity. So, this archdurang operator is elliptic. You can invert it at least elliptically. But it's not enough to get a compact error and show that it's Fredom. You need to be able to invert certain models at infinity to be able to get a Fredom result or to show the K of Harmonic form. And this essentially And this essentially there's two two model two types of model operators to invert to invert at infinity so one it's from the discussion before I guess it won't be The discussion before, I guess it won't be a surprise that's the ushdaram operator of a cone of a conmetric dr square plus r square gs with with s With S, uh well, S is a stratified space and G S is a wedge metric. So, yeah, there's this R direction, but otherwise, basically, you get this wedge operator. You get this wedge operator showing up. And so, what you can do is in depth two, you can use, so we can use the edge calculus of Rave. So, we can use the edge calculus of Rave. And if it's high-adapp, we can still invert it. We can use the generalization of the edge calculus by Pierre. Of the edge calculus by Pierre and Jesse for arbitrary depth. And so it's a somehow you have to invert a suspended version of a wedge operator in this setting. Not quite, but essentially it's this. And what happened is that the double space of the edge calculus somehow turns out it sits inside this QA. It sits inside this QFB double space that we managed to construct. But in fact, we construct an overblown version. There's more blow-ups that appears in our setting. But giving this address, we can see it fits nicely where it should on the QFP double space. So this we can do in arbitrary depth. And then basically the condition on the metric is you need to assume that the trick is you need to assume that the model is invertible for a certain range of weights. So that imposed some restriction, but for interesting example, there's not many topological obstructions. So if you take a random QFV metric, you won't be able to apply the theorem, but you can always tweak your metric so that it satisfies the assumption. So you have to move. Satisfy the assumption. So you have to move some geometric eigenvalue away for your model and can be done by modifying the metric. The second model, that's the one that is more problematic to go to higher depth, is the following. So it's still an OjDARAM operator. So it's the Odge Ojdaram. Munch the RAM operator of a metric of the form the Euclidean metric plus so in depth two Z GZ will be a QFB metric so GZ a fiber boundary metric okay and more generally in higher And and more generally in higher depth uh somehow that's a problem and more generally GZ is uh QFP metric in higher depth. So then the the operator will look like just the Argdaram operator on the Euclidean space plus the RDRAM operator of The HDRM operator of the QFV metric. So, if you want to try to characterize what should be the inverse, what you can do is you can take the Fourier transform in Rn. So, what you get is you get in the Euclidean direction, you get cliffholder multiplication. More or less, depending on the convention, and then nothing happened to the dz operator. So xi now is in Rn. So you get a family of operators for each c in Rn, you get an operator. So for X not equal to zero, D is fully elliptic. And in fact, invertible FB operator, fiber boundary operator. So it's the fiber cost or the phi calculus of Rafe and Richard. So it's the best possible situation. You can invert, and the inverse is just in the small calculus. Small calculus, it's the best one can owe. But for x equal to zero, then you have to use this result of Vaya and I'll sell Unsecrimat Zero. It won't be FredOM for fiber boundary solar spaces, but it is FredOM. And if you mod up the kernel, so we put ourselves in a self-conjoint setting, the operator becomes invertible. So you can invert it, but you have to use the large p-calculus of Rafe and Richard. So it's two different. So it's two different inverse and they don't match a priori, they don't really match. And so to reconcile them, what we do is we reconcile these two inverses, these two ways of inverting, these two inverses, generalizing This so Andras spoke about this Monday this low energy limit for resolvent of Laplacian on scattering metrics, so accepted metric. So we generalize this to this fiber boundary setting and for Dirac type operators. So visualizing the work. The work of Gueramu Azo and the Iamu share to the FB setting. And I I should point out that that around the same time there's work by There's work by Daniel Greaser, Talebi, and Bertman, where they obtained similar results for the Euch Laplacian for fiber boundary metric. But for this problem, we really need the construction for the Euchar-Ram operator. And using this, you can reconcile. You can see that when you take the limit C equal to zero, they sort of fit, provided you do. fits provided you you do some suitable blow up and these phases that you blow up explain how there's a transition between the the two ways of inverting and why we we need this fine description so the plusual description because we can then take the inverse Fourier transform and we get an inverse for the original operator and this then we can check it really fits This, then we can check it really fits where it should in our QFV double space. And then we plug it there and well, we could try to do things by end, but with the manifold required advantage is that you just put it there and then it fits nicely. And then you don't have to worry about the cutoff function and partition of unity. It just fits nicely there. And then you go with the usual machinery. You go with the usual machinery. So that's the two models. And so for IADEPT, you have to do the same thing, but you have to generalize the work of Guillermo Assel, Guillermo Scher to QFB metric. And so we're working on that. So then it's a low energy limit of QFB double space and triple space. It seems we are in the right. It seems we are on the right track on this, and we hope it will work, but it's still work in progress. And maybe in the few minutes remaining, the two minutes remaining, let me mention, let me go back to the QFB double space and triple space. Okay, so they are a particular feature we spent. Particular feature, we spend a lot of time. So, one thing that it took us a really long time to realize is that you cannot just start with the B double space for those who know that. So, for the edge calculus, if you want, you can start with the B double space and you'll have one more blow up, but you can still define the calculus. But there, if you start with the B double space, maybe. The B double space, you maybe you can do something, though. Uh, in the end, it seems maybe there was some problem with the double surface. We managed to construct this way, but definitely you cannot construct a triple space. So, you need to do a preliminary. In fact, one other difficulty is that you need to do preliminary blow up to so that the thing you really want to blow up become piece of manifold. And maybe I'll finish on that. Maybe I'll finish on that. So, the geometric idea to not construct the QSB double space, but the pruning blow ups, you have to do is to answer the following question. So if you have two QSB metric and you take their Cartesian product, is it again a QFB metric? The answer is yes. It seems imputively not surprising, though to prove it, you have to do some work. And in terms of manifold with fiber core, And in terms of manifold with fiber corner is you the way you do it is you you construct the you take the Cartesian product of your two manifold with fiber corner and and then you have to block corner of the co-dimension two all of them in a in a certain order and with this you get the double space of your uh the not the double space you get the the the fiber the compactification of your cartogen product of QFB metric and you can show that it's again the QFB metric with this compactification And if you instead do the blow-up of this code-dimensional two-corner in the opposite order, then you construct the contrast of your cartogenic product of wedge metric. So in this work, we sort of discovered there's some intriguing relationship between wedge metric and QHB metric somehow. And yeah, I guess. And yeah, I guess time's up, so I'll finish there. Thank you for your attention. So I have a couple questions. So, oh, so first, when you were said you had two model operators to invert, and the first one, you had a cone method. One you had a cone metric, cone over stratified space. Are you inverting it as a map from L2 to L2, or are you shifting weight to make it more like a B operator? Yeah, yeah, well, that's some of the detail I didn't want to enter with in this talk. But yeah, we use B densities, we shift the weight, yeah. Okay. And so that's why you don't have to worry about not having closed range? You mean if you were looking at, for example, if S instead of being stratified were the sphere, then you're looking on Rn. And if you look at the Laplacian iron functions on Rn, well, you don't have close range. Yeah, well, yeah, but we invert it. It's really we inverted, we think more of it as a suspicion. we think more of it as a suspended um yeah suspended operator but but yeah we we we invert it for um we take the Fourier transform in R essentially and then we we get the wedge operator we invert it and and we take the inverse Fourier transform and check that it it fits on the on the double space but we really work directly we use the edge calculus Calculus of Rave, of you and Jesse, to invert. And then we invert it for all family. And it's a bit like in the B calculus with the ND Schultz family. So you asked that the Nicholas family is invertible, but in our case, the Nicholas family, instead of being an operator on the closed manifold, it's a wedge operator. Operator. Okay. And you mentioned that for Bafa-Witten, you have a trick to go beyond the number of points. Yeah, so what we do is we can get the construction, we can get a partial parametrics construction. So we can get partial decay. Can get partial decay for any arbitrary depth because there's some model we can invert. So the model with involving low energy limit of fiber boundary HDRAM operator we can invert and all these cone operator we can invert. So when it's depth three, we can get decay at some boundary upper surface. And then playing with that, we can show that the Can show that we can prove the conjecture in this case. But we hope so in this other work, we can show that to prove the Waffa Witten conjecture, the only thing you need to show is that the L2 harmonic form decay like I wrote. So if you have this, then the result follow. But at the moment, we are not able to get decay for arbitrary depth. Okay. Cool, thank you. Are there any other questions for Frederick? Yes, Rif, you're muted. You're still muted. Yeah, okay. Here we go. So I'm a little bit confused why a problem on a stratified space, on a singular space, occurs at one of the front faces at infinity. So can you say a bit more about that? Because usually that doesn't. Can you say a bit more about that? Because usually that doesn't happen. The you mean the first model to invert? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so in the say in the QAC setting, that's the only model you see at the maximal upper surface, the one where it looks like a scattering metric. The model is really a co-metric. Really, a conmetric over the tangent cone at infinity. So that's what you have to invert there. I mean, certainly the spectrum, I mean, you know, so certainly the leading initial, I mean, sort of there's indicial behavior. You know, we did that. It corresponds to the spectrum on that singular space. So I guess you're saying something like that. Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, we definitely. So it's as saying the B setting, so these operators. So, these wedge operators, they have a discrete spectrum. And we can compute it exactly. But we have at least we know where are the homological indicial routes, and then the other one by scaling, we can assume that they are out of the way. And then with this, we And then with this, we invert it basically as in the B calculus for the initial factor. Yeah, no, that's exactly right. And so that gives you sort of the decay near the, you know, away from, I mean, sort of near the free boundary, right? Away from the strata, singular strata infinity. Okay, yeah, I understand. Okay. But in the QFB setting, I'll lie a little bit. So at this maximal upper surface, you have first to invert as much as you can, a bit like. As much as you can, a bit like in the parametrix of Vallain, you invert in the fiber direction as much as you can, and then you're left with a model with this cone. And at each phase, it's the same thing that is happening. So at the other phases, you have to invert, you have to use this low energy limit of fiber boundary operator or QFP operator, and then you have to solve a cone. Yeah, no, I understand. I understand. Okay. All right. Any other questions? Okay, not well.
