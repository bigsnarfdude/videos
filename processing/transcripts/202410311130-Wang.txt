And today we will talk about application of Manuel Hoof method to dynamic fracture of elastic metromaterial with local region liters. So it's quite similar to the previous discussion by Nevis, by Vichio. So thank you so much for your presentation showing our research figure. Figure. So, okay. Today, I will talk about three aspects of fraction mechanics of metal material. So, first I will introduce the background. So, we know that mechanical metric materials engineering is a hot topic in recent years, but paid a lot of attention on the On the electron wave band gap or vibration isolation. The dynamic strength has not received enough attention. But during the working environment, the stress effect always appears. So we localization and the strength concentration is very important. And the dynamic vibration and the fatigue always appear. So we need to. Or of the pair. So we need to discuss about the disaster and the prediction of periodic lattice defects. So we know that the periodic structures with defects appear in the under vehicle ships and the chemical industry. So how to analyze the defect states under wave and how to improve the dynamic strength is very important and the key challenges. Keen challenges and the defects lead to the wave localization and the supersonic crack propagation and the interaction between cracks and waves are our main attention. So we will discuss about wave coupling effect and dynamic stress failure. And then firstly, we will discuss about the crack propagation and the kinking. At first, we discuss about a simple model. This model contains This model contains two periodic lines, which includes the manageator and the local regionator. So it is a simple mechanical material model. And we use the discrete dynamic fraction method developed by Professor Slapia. And we derive the wave equation here. Equation here and we use introduce the variable and submit them into the wave equation so we can apply we can consider the Heavy set function here and then we use the Fourier transform of wave equation and we can derive for the steady state solution limitation here. And we can obtain the wave equal homogeneous equation with the Wina Ho form. equation with the Wina Hung form like this, where it has a kernel function here. And so we can derive the kernel function and use the C-type integral and including the remote external forces. So at last we use the Louvre's theorem so we can derive the solutions like this. And based on the limiting And based on the limiting relations, we can derive the local energy release rate and the global energy release rate. So, at last, the energy release ratio can be derived like this. So, this is the numerical results. It shows the dispersion curves of the intact part. So, we can see the crack speed when the crack speed reaches. Crash speed Vg is larger than the wave speed, the elastic wave can propagate to the right. But on the opposite case, if the dispersion curves in the broken part, it means that the crack speed Vg is smaller than the electric wave speed V. So the electric waves propagate to the left. So the wave within the button gap cannot be excited by the moving crack here. Crack here. And then we discussed about the energy release ratio. So it contains two regions. The first region is the instability region. And this is the stable propagation, it means. And so we can see the local generator can increase the wave dispersion and dispersion energy and reduce fracture energy. So it means the metal rest. So we propose, we. rest so we pro we we present the first is a a new phenomenon material rest it denotes the the mechanical material can enhance the structure failure because of the non-local resonator so the energy barrier here the energy barrier uh it means a highly enhanced dispersion and a substantial boost in the fraction resistance which against the further increase of the crack speed Increase of the crack speed. These results have already been reported by Professor Yusurish Genadi in WRCM. So we discuss about the supersonic region. Matter arrest phenomenon can also be observed here. And then we discuss about the crack propagation in locally resonant. locally resonant metamaterials with multi multiple degrees of freedom. This is a multiple degree that contains the shear tension and the rotation degrees. So three kinds of degrees are considered. So we calculated the argument angle. So we can see the larger area for the negative argument, the other structures corresponding to a lower energy ratio. Energy ratio and the more wave dispersion, less fracture energy, and the enhanced crack resistance. So we will cause another kind of fracture. It means the interface fracture. The crack locates as an interface between two half spaces here. And similar to the derivation performed. So we So we can derive the solutions like this. And then we derive the displace solution by the inverse Fourier transformation. So the sum of series of residues are applied. And then we calculate the energy release ratio both in the subsonic and supersonic regions. So we can see local generator. So we can see local generator can increase wave dispersion and reduce fracture energy. And we calculate the displacement field. So we can see motor atomic dispersion and the radiated waves can be observed. And the local generator can surprise crack propagation by limiting the crack opening. So we made the samples by the 3D printing technique on the fiber. Printing technique and fabricate the experiment segment. So, this is the matimaterial. This sample is not matimaterial. So, we can see the crack probation exacts elastic waves here. And we discuss about the crack kinky because it's an interface, interface crack. So, we can see the crack will kink away from the interface into the softer one. Into the softer one of the two material materials. So, this is the dynamic pressure process. Then, we will discuss about the influence of non-local interaction. In the second part, we have discussed about the magnetic without local non-local interaction. So, here we will discuss about non-local interaction. Non-local interaction is considered between Is considered between the main linear nature's next nearest one. So, this is the non-local interaction. And we can derive the wave equation on the band gap structure here. So, this is the dispersion relation. And we introduce continuous variable. And based on the Fourier transformation, we can derive the energy release ratio here. And so, this is the energy release ratio. So, this is the energy release ratio. We can see the non-local and the local resonators can enhance the fracture, enhance the fracture resistance in this large region. So, this is the affinity element simulation. So, the last one denotes the non-local interaction results. And we will discuss about the fraction resistance. Discuss about the fraction resistance by both non-local interaction and the damping. The damping is considered here. It means the energy lost. So this result shows that dumping can enhance the correct resistance. This is dumping result here. And the finite elementary result for the dumping, dumping, both dumping and non-local interaction. Non-local interaction. So at last we have started the wave scattering in mechanical materials. It is reported, has been reported by Mac just now. So this figure. We consider the according to the work by Sharmer. We performed the Winahu method, Winahu method applied to the wave accretions. And this is the incident LSV. Incidental view and the reflect LSV. And the reflect LSV. So, because of the semi-infinite crack, the LSV is reflected here. And so, we equations of the crack physics by the Lie transform, the Gaume equations can be derived as this form. And then we apply the inverse form, and we also consider the anti-symmetric displacement of the Anti-symmetric displacement of the crack space, we use the kernel function and by the Cauchy type integral. So we can derive the zeros and the poles with the different frequencies. So at last, we also apply the Louvre theorem. We can derive the wheel accretion, the polar coordinates here. Polar coordinates here. So at last we derive different frequency regions. Totally, there are four frequency regions. This is the frequencies one and three here, frequency two and four here. So because of the frequency are different. So then we use the method of statistical phase for different for diffraction integrals and we can derive the whole. Can derive the whole location. So, this is two kinds of circular pies. It means the rectangular and the semi-circular pies, respectively. And we can derive the local generator of absorbed and dispassive fracture energy. So, this is the frequency region one, region three, region two. Region three, region two, region four. So, modulus are an argument of the far-field approximate displacement are presented here. And at last, we consider the wave scattering in multimaterial with two infinite cracks. So, there are two cracks embedded in the multimaterial. So, we consider the interaction between the cracks, and then we can also derive the And then we can also derive the modulus and the argument of the far-field approximate displacement. And so we can see multi-regionators can create more band gaps and can protect correct structures from impact. So by additional local regulators, the position of band gaps can be changed. So at last, we will make the conclusion. We will make the conclusion. So, first, the local regulator can increase the stability resistance and retain the correct kinking by absorbing the fresh energy. Secondly, the local regulator mechanism can generate an additional band gap. Thirdly, the coupling of both non-local interaction and the dumping can significantly enhance the propagation resistance of correct propagation. At last, this topic is expected to be helpful. Topic is expected to be helpful to enhance the structure strength and the safety of other models, the materials, and the structures. So, thank you for your attention.
