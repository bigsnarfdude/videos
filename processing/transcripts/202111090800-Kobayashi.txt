The organizer organizer for inviting me this workshop. Today I like to talk about the effective feed theory from string compactification. It does not work. Oh, work. This is the content of my talk. After introduction, I would like to discuss about some structure in coupling in low energy effective field theory derived from superstrain theory. Then I'd like to discuss about the modular symmetry. Then if I have a time, I'd like to comment on clinic time. On Atlantic Tam. Then I'll summarize my talk. If you have a question, please stop and interrupt me. Otherwise, I'm almost going to sleep. Okay, so as you know, superstarian theory is a promising candidate for the unified theory of R. That means the unified theory of all of interaction, including gravity. Including gravity, and unified theory of matter such as score, lepton, and Higgs field. Also, string theory can explain several aspects of cosmos aspects. Actually, we have already obtained lots of heterotic string compactification and the DeepRAM model, which lead to the standard gauge group. I mean, this type of gauge group, and it's Type of gauge group and it's extension like a GAD extension. And this model lead to the three generation of coax and leptons. So we can say we have already lots of bouillaries spectra, massless spectrum, through string compactification. So what is the next? First of all, I think I think realistic realization of Yucal coupling would be one of the important things. We have to derive the experimental value of core klepton masses and their mixing angle and the CP base. Of course, at that time, in a Lagrangian of low energy effective theory, it would be important, and we would like to understand the So, we would like to understand the symmetry to control low-energy effective phase theory derived from superstring theory. So, string theory can be described by Kong theory. And the string mode, for example, mass stress mode, correspond to the operators in Kong Mafia theory. For example, B is an operator in Kong Mafie theory that would correspond to the sample. That would correspond to some mode in string theory. These operators satisfy this type of operator products expansion. Bi is about operator, VJ is one operator, VK is another operator, and HK and Hi, HJ are there are cohoma dimensions. Yijk is a Ijk is just a coefficient of this operator product expansion. Actually, that corresponds to the three-point coupling, or that would correspond to the UCAL coupling for Cox and Higgs. Also, we can calculate the four-point coupling, something this way, and within the framework of Kong Homer field theory, four-point coupling. four-point coupling can be expanded by a product of the three-point coupling, something like this way over this figure. Also, we can calculate the higher order coupling within the framework of conhomer field theory. In that case, end-point coupling can be expanded by the, I mean, can be written by the products of three-point coupling. And that is a confomer theory. And that is a conjunction. And actually, we have explicit calculation within the framework of string compactification. One example is intersecting debrain models. Abel and ON calculate maybe genetic endpoint copy. And they point coupling and they they show the example of coupling satisfied these relation and also uh kan xin che and i have calculated some uh higher dimensional operator within a framework of hydraulic string theory on orbod and they satisfy this type of relation in this calculation In this calculation, model M here may correspond to the massless mode or massive mode. It depends. Anyway, this calculation satisfy this relation or generically this relation. Actually, this structure has been well known for a long time. For a long time, and many people have known already. Anyway, this structure is a typical character in string-derived low-energy effective phase theory. I would like to study or restudy these implications in particle physics if it is interesting. So So I'd like to show another derivation of this type of structure among the coupling. So low energy effective phase theory or strain theory corresponds to the higher dimensional phase theory. For example, 4 plus 6 dimension. 4 is our space-time dimension, and the 6 is a dimensional Dimensional compact space. So string mode corresponds to the field in four dimensions and six dimension. So usually we calculate low energy effects theory in terms of KK calculine decomposition. X is a coordinate of our order dimension space-time. Y is a coordinate in six In six compact compact space. By using some this KK decomposition, we can write down the field in higher dimension. Psi n corresponds to the wave function in compact space and chi n corresponds to the field in four dimensions. For example, let's consider the massless mode on magnetized D-BRAM model with tallest background or all-fold background. We try to solve these equations for the wave function in compact space. And this suppose this AI corresponds to the background magnetic flux. Background magnetic flux. And so we try to solve that this Nausless equation or the Zermode in compact space. Suppose that several magnetized D brand there and let's pick up two type of models, Psi I, Psi J. J satisfy this their model equation. Actually, Psi I satisfy that this direct equation. Satisfied this Dirac equation with magnetic flux Ai. And the psi J satisfied this thermodynamic equation with magnetic flux AJ. Then I'd like to show the product can be expanded by another wave function, something like this way. So let's consider the zero-mode equation. Model equation where magnetic flux sum of magnetic flux Ai and Aj appear here. And we denote their wave function, zero model wave function psi k. On the other hand, we can show the product of psi i psi j satisfy the e to equation because of. Because of psi k satisfied equation, and that would be the complete set for mass res mode. We can say epsi product of psi i, psi j can be expanded by psi k, something like this way. And this is a coefficient, expansion coefficient. This is just a field theory in compact space, but the Compact space, but these correspond to this operator products expansion in Kohoma face theory. I mean, form looks similar. I cannot prove this is exactly much, but anyway, form is very similar. So we get So we get this wave function product expansion. Three-point coupling are obtained by the overlap integral of three zero mode, say psi i and psi j and psi k. We take a product of these guys and then integrate. Suppose that this is, in this case, a compact kitchen scale. Compactification scale, compactification space is a two-dimensional but if we consider six-dimensional space, we can integrate in six-dimensional compact space. Anyway, this is integral in compact space. Here we use this wave function product expansion. function product expansion. Then this part can be written by using this coefficient Cijk. And then this part becomes psi k and now we use orthonormal constant this. Then you can coupling can be written by this coefficient. So this coefficient you can Happen and for the explicit calculation, please see this paper. Now, similarly, we can calculate four-point covering. That is integral, overlap integral of four wave functions: one, two, three, four. And this part part product of two wave functions can be expanded by another wave function something like this and this is a coefficient then if we use this relation here then this integral this product becomes the product of three wave functions one two three and this is again a three point coupling so A three-point coupling, so that gives us this coefficient. So, four-point coupling can be written by product of three-point coupling. So, in this case, first I contract first and second. You can contract second and third first. Then, again, we can use this. Again, we can use this wave function products rule, expansion rule. Then this part can be something like this way, coefficient and another wave function. And again, this is one, two, three wave function. And this part integral of this part gives us some three-point coupling. So again, in So again, in this calculation, a four-point coupling can be written by a product of three-point coupling. This three-point coupling and this three-point coupling in this calculation is different. Maybe we can draw this type of figure. First, we contract I and J, I and J, then 3.5. I and J, then three-point coupling and three-point coupling, their product gives us four-point coupling. The same four-point coupling can be written something like this way. First, we contract J and K, J and K, then three-point coupling, and contract I and L, then three-point coupling, we get this. So this is a field theory digression. Is a field theory aggression, but this behavior is very similar to this behavior. So we can calculate similar computation for higher order coupling, endpoint coupling, similar this way, and we can use this. Can use this loop wave function expansion or loop. Then endpoint coupling can be written by products of three-point coupling. And so I have shown for the case with Taurus background or auto background with Malina. With malignant crux. Maybe we can consider another type of background and we discuss another type of possibility in this paper. But let me skip. So, I'd like to say maybe many string compactification lead to the four-wheeling structure. A four-point coupling can be A four-point coupling can be written by the product of three-point coupling, and endpoint also endpoint coupling can be written by the product of three-point coupling. So, for if we know the symmetry of three-point coupling, that would correspond to the symmetry for end-point coupling. That means the coupling that means the symmetry of three-point coupling is a symmetry of all higher order coupling so field theory calculation and the conformal field theory calculation is a calculation in perturbation what about the non-perturbative effect we have examples We have examples to satisfy these rule in deep brain central effect or unbroken symmetry. But I have to say we need more study on non-perturbative effect to be sure in which case these rules are satisfied or not. But anyway, today I'd like to concentrate on part of On path about calculation, and I like to see implications of these coupling structure. However, anyway, we have this structure, but this structure, this structure has been well known for a long time, and maybe. Time. And maybe all of you know this structure. But anyway, this is a typical character in string-derived low-energy effective phase theory. Maybe it is important to study or re-study the implication of this structure on coupling. I'd like to discuss its implications, some of Some of implications. And please tell me if you have any idea about the implication of this structure in particle physics. I have a comment actually. I thought those effects, right, in what you want to do in effective theory, you want to determine the contact term and subtract this part. And subtract this part from higher order contribution, right? This is your S matrix calculation, and you get this leading connection that we know is due to exchanges of massless. Something like that. Exactly. But what one is after in string theory is to quantify the contact, direct contact term that is beyond. Contact term that is beyond this subtraction, right, of via exchanges of a massless matter, and that's the term that you're after in your effect. You mean we don't know which mode mediate discovery or all the tower contribute to discovery. Well, it's the massive mode exchanges in string theory that are key in extracting the contact interaction of higher-order terms. Yes, that will be okay. I said the mode M, M may correspond to massless model or massive model. I don't know. But including the massive model, Uh, including the massive mode, uh, they satisfy this region in part albatross zero. Is that correct? Well, maybe that's what different mass terms, right? Different, well, maybe we can discuss that after. Maybe we should go ahead, right? Yeah, uh, so let me repeat. I don't, I'm not sure which mode. Which mode contributes to this covering, but anyway, we can write this way. Of course, if this is massless mode dominant, that will be happy and we know everything. Thank you for your question and comment. Okay, so I'm not sure the following example is good, but anyway, I'd like to discuss one simple example. Four-point coupling can be written by the product of Be written by the product of three-point coupling, and what is the epidemical implication? And for example, let's consider the four permit operators, some DIDs and some DIDs. These include four corks, and this includes four corks and lepton. So, generically, we don't know. No, or this coefficient. But if we employ this structure, this part can be written by the product of three-point coupling. Still, we don't know what is M, but anyway, product of three point coupling. And I like to And I'd like to compare this behavior with minimal private violation scenario in the standard model effective fishery. So in addition to the denominator standard model Lagrangian, maybe we can write down the higher dimensional operator, dimension five operator, dimension six. five operator dimension six operator they uh must be invariant under the standard model gauge group gauge groups maybe we can list up which type of operators are allowed under the standard gauge symmetry then a minimum flavor variation hypothesis in a limit that all of yuka copper and varnish their flavor symmetry They are flavor symmetry, this type of flavor symmetry. So, this is a flavor symmetry for all three generations of left-handed cork, and this is flavor symmetry for all three generations of up sector right-handed cork, and this is for down sector, right-hand cork, and left-handed lepton, and this is for. Repton and this is for charged right under the charge mark, charged lepton. And we assume that the Hiccup sphere is a singlet. And because of this symmetry, Yucal coupling are not allowed. However, if we assume Yucca coupling are spraying, I mean they transform non-trivially. A transform non-trivially something like this. So, for example, ecological coupling, upsector ecological coupling has this type of non-trivial representation and this symmetry we can write down the Euclidean coupling called upsector cock. And similarly, if down sector Euclidean has this type of non-terbial representation, we can We can write on the downsect ecotapping and similar for the child left ecotopic. So using this spring field, we can write down the ordinary coupling. And so we assume all higher order couplings are. higher order coverings are also has this lever symmetry and the higher order coupling can be written by the sprion I mean this in that case we can write down that this four or fermion operators this and this one but this coefficient can be written by using Can be written by using these Yucala experience, and this is also can be written by the D experion. So flavor and CP violation are controlled by cover coupling because there is a unique origin for flavor vibration and C V variation. There is a minimal flavor variation hypothesis. Uh, hypothesis and so as said, uh, effective field theory derived from a string has a similar structure. Four-point coupling can be written by a product of three-point coupling, and also a higher-order coupling can be written by the Can be written by the three-point couple. So these behavior looks like minimum forever barrelation. And so the symmetry of three-point coupling becomes a symmetry of all higher order coupling. So in so the other way, So, this structure will be okay in string computation. The capital scale is a compact scale, and below the compactification scale, something happened. I mean, some mode became massive, or some field developed bug images. So, for some So for some massive mode, we integrate such a mode and then still we obtain the DE structure. But in this case, mass scale is depend on the cutoff scale depend on the mass of these mass. And if some field develops vacuum, Some fields develop vacuum mixation barrel. For example, or this type of coupling can be replaced by the vacuum mixation barrel. Anyway, still we have this structure for unbroken symmetry. However, the cutoff scale depends on the vacuum meditation barrel. So anyway, a cutoff scale depends on the value of the value. Of scale depends on the detail of the scenario between the weak scale and the string scale or compatibility scale. But I think the structure itself is the same. So in a minimal free violation scenario, you can spring. sprion and they have this non-trivial representation under this flavor symmetry. On the other hand, in string theory, coupling depends on the moduli. In a sense, couplings are spherium. If we ignore dynamics of moduli, I mean, if we ignore dynamics of moduli, a coupling spirit. A coupling aspiration. So it looks similar. So, in this sense, maybe the symmetry of modern control or standard model effective phase theory like this theorem. So, maybe the symmetry of a moduli under which a coupling transform non-trivial. A coupling transform non-trivially like this would be important. So I'd like to discuss such symmetry, symmetry of moduli under which coupling transform non-trivial. One example may be a modular symmetry, modular symmetry. Recently, actually lots of study have been done in top-down approach. In top-down approach and the bottom-up approach, I mean, there is a fair theoretical approach, and many people construct a model which have modular so-called modular Fourier bias in go to the detail, but I just mention about only Only the essence. As you know, the torus is one of the simplest compactification. For example, two-dimensional torus construct as follows. In the two real dimensions over one complex space, we identified this line, this line, and we identified this. And we identify this line and this line, we get two-dimensional tolerance. We normalize this just one in complex space, and by using this coordinate in complex space, we describe the shape of this two-dimensional to us. So, identification of this line and this line and this random correspond to the V-divided two-dimensional. Uh, we divided two dimensions by the lattice spun by these two that specter. However, we can change that space. We can change from this to this, then we can construct make same ratios, same rattles, or we can change in the lattice base. In the lattice base, in this way, but we can make the same lattice or we can say we can change the cycle of basis. So such a change of basis can be written by SL2Z in this way. And concerned about the motors at this point. this point there is a ratio of this to this vector and the date transform something like this non-trivial way that is a non-trivial transformation of modulus for this type of element in sl2z modulus is invariant so on the modulus So on the modulus, SL2Z symmetry, or this type of modular symmetry, is correspond to this group. And the generator of the modular group are denoted by S and T and I will correspond to this one in on SL2G and on tau. And on our tau, tau transform under S and T and they satisfy these algebra on tau. On the other hand, in SL2Z, algebra of S and T is the same that is this part is different. So we can say that SL2Z is a double cover. S2Z is a double covering of this group. We introduce congruence subgroup. The definition is something like this. Anyway, it does not include the S and T generator, but that includes T and C. Then we consider this type of quotient. Quotient for this one, they satisfy this algebraic gradation. This is a modular symmetry algebra. In addition, this we get this algebraic gradation and that corresponds isomorphic to S3, A4, S4, A5 if N equals to 2, 3. If n equals to two, three, four, five. Actually, uh, low-energy model builder, bottom-up model builder use these symmetry for the Freba symmetry, and then they construct the Freber model. So, such people become interested in these motor symmetries. is modular symmetry. And we introduce a holomorphic function f tau. They transform something in this way under the modular transformation. This part W is called module weight and And the law is some unitary matrix. And so suppose that under the gamma n, there is a congruence subgroup, this part. Under the congruence subgroup, Mojocom transform something like this way and with a draw. But suppose that modular form transforms. Modular form transform something this way under this modular flu modular transformation. So this draw part corresponds to the quotient. So that would be the representation of these finite modules. So this low part becomes a representation. Law part becomes a representation of this finite model group. So that would be interesting. If law represents this gamma n, s squared should be equal to 1 because on tau s squared equal to 1. So let's consider this element. We put maybe the shear. Here and s squared, gamma equals to s squared, and this part is minus one. So, weight must be even if we consider the double cover S L to Z in S L to Z S squared equals to minus one. So if this represents the S to Z, that is. S to Z, that is a double covering of the previous modular group. This part can be minus one. So, in that case, modular weight can be integer, including odd. Or we can consider double covering of SL2Z further double covering. In that case, weight can be Case weight can be a half integer kind of spinal representation in a complex plane. And actually, this is expressed form of wave function which we have solved under the magnetic flux background, magnetic flux M and this is Z is a coordinate and this is a wave function. This is a wave function on Toros, and this is a wave function on this orphan. They have a wave function. These wave functions have a module weight one half. And using this integral, we can calculate the Yucca coupling. Yucca coupling also has a module weight one half. Oh in this case. Yeah. And in on Taurus, to realize the three generation, magnetic flux should be three and then we get the three thermode. However, on the old board, we can have a variety. Have a variety to get the three generation from various values of magnetic flux. And anyway, this is a table of the Zero mode and yes, depend on the shark spat phase. Let me skip the detail. So web function and the UCAL coupling. wave function and the ukau coupling has a modular weight one half and this is expressed form of wave function and they transform each other under the modular symmetry there is a kind of rabosymmetry which also which also transform you can coupling non-trivially and so that is uh what we i said To the previous slides. And actually, these wave functions and you got coupling have a frever group. And there is a coupling group of these finite modular symmetry or including this larger group with central extension. For example, Extension, for example, expressly discuss in this paper. So we have by example that modrai transform non-trivially and the Yucal coupling and transform non-trivially. And then in this case, In this case, you call coupling and the wave function has a modular weight one half. Actually, I don't know why this system beat to the modular weight one half. Maybe this is a spinal representation, but I'm not sure. So, in the previous section, I talk about the standard model. Standard model effect phase theory and that is a minimal bio, a minimal frequency vibration. Then I said some symmetry which transform Moji and the Vucal coupling important. Then I introduce Mojo symmetry. Maybe you know all about the Mojo symmetry. So I So I think application of these modular symmetry in standard model effective theory would be interesting. Actually, we have started, but today I cannot show the expressive result. Maybe we could finish our work soon. So I just showed one very simple example for the modular symmetry and symmetry which transforms you can coupling non-trivially. But the genet four-dimensional compact space has many modules. For example, Carabial has a many moduli. For example, if we consider the holomorphic three form, that is expanded by the symplectic base, alpha i and beta i, that is a simple base, and three poem can be expanded something like this. Then and alpha and beta is just Is just the base to expand the holomorphic three form. We can change the base. That is a sympathetic modular symmetry. And actually, the study has been started by the Sruminja and Kanderas and the Osa in this year. And anyway, there is a so-called simple modular symmetry. And the modulus defined by this ratio. And this part X is a project coordinate on special geometry. And the modular UI is an inhomogeneous coordinate. Anyway, modular symmetry is quite rich. I mean, maybe too rich to discuss in a simple way. Anyway, quite rich. Anyway, quite rich. And Kerala Moji also has a symplectic modular symmetry. So I'm not sure this example is good or not, but anyway, let me talk about a simple example. So let's consider ticks. T6 of Gn in that case. And we suppose that we have three diagonal Keral moduli and the deraton. And their Kerala potential can be written. And let's think about the heterotic string. And correspond to these 3E diagonal KL moduli, we have 3E untwisting. Untwisted matter field, I denote AI and A2 and A3, and they correspond to the three Kerala module. And this is a Kerala potential. So concern about the modular symmetry, we can see there are three SL2G modular symmetry correspond to the T1, T2, T3. And in this case, And in this case, we have a super potential for matter field, something like this way. And we can see there is a parameters of symmetry of TA and matter field. We have a three element that too looks S3. However, this system has a larger CMBT. A larger symmetry that is S4 under the S4 to this. So people are actually people already know this system as a permutation symmetry S3. But I think we have a larger symmetry and it is S4. So under S4 or three, 3 moltra and the matafid are S4 triplet and the Moadiraton is S4 singlet. If we consider y equals to constant, actually, for example, S4 generator can be written this way, then you can check this system has a S4 symmetry. S4 symmetry. Or S4 is permutation symmetry for four elements. And from the four elements, we can make a one singlet that will correspond to the dilaton and the three triprets that will correspond to the three diagonal kera module. Also, some Such S4 symmetry can be consistent with SU4R symmetry. Anyway, let me skip. So if I say this system has these symmetry 3 SL2Z and S4 symmetry. If we consider Symmetry: if we consider y-cost constant, however, this system has a sp8 symmetry as strong injury and following this discussion but this symmetry is a very important thing. This symmetry is a symmetry for constant incalculation. So, if we consider that through this symplectic Moja symmetry, this symmetry is broken by UK coupling or intersection of Moji. Anyway, if you consider UCAR coupling is spirion, this flu simple symmetry Symplectic symmetry remain. Under this full symplectic modular symmetry, you can coupling transform. I'm not sure this is a good example, but anyway, my claim is as follows. So, if we consider the many modular systems, we have a full We have a full symplectic modular symmetry. And the sub symmetry, G, remain for a constant you can coupl. You can coupling a spherium under the simple modular symmetry of this sub symmetry G and trans equal coupling transform non-tribulate. I mean, this symmetry. We would like to study its implications. But anyway, this symplectic modular symmetry and this quotient is very complicated. I cannot give you a present good example. Anyway, This genic symplectic modular symmetry would be interesting to study because of that involve much structure. And then that would be interesting. So 10 minutes. Let me comment. Let me comment on genetic term. So, so far, we have discussed about the coupling, actually the structure of coupling and the transformation of coupling. And the final part in effective low energy effective theory is a kinetic term. And actually, the calculation of and actually the calculation of the clinic term is very complicated i mean very hard and again i cannot tell a clear message in kinetic stamp but anyway we have calculated something about kinetic term so the simplest computation of kinetic term for matter field is a dimensional reduction from a higher dimensional spyament theory for example we can calculate Theory. For example, we can calculate the torus background with magnetic flux. Then we can calculate something called a motor girl. So supernatural theory will be okay, but DVI action describes the dynamics of open string on the D-Brain. So we can take this DVI action for starting point. Starting point, then we can do the dimensional deduction. So, for the first part, we expand by the magnetic flux. We consider magnetic flux background. Then our expansion is a small flux expansion. Then, this is same result as a superam theory. That as a superior theory, and this is a correction to the Kerr metric on the calculation by through the superior theory. So, anyway, this is just an approximation of that is a small flux expansion. So, this is just a small flux expansion. So, this result is not exactly. This result is not exact. We have more correction, including higher order of magnetic flux. Something like this. I'd like to see the full result, but I don't know how to calculate. Anyway, this we anyway, we have a collection in DBI action. And if you If you have any hint to calculate through result from a DB action, please tell me. And if there is a simple function, that would be tell something to us. I don't know this correction is a simple function or not. Okay, let me summarize my talk. We have studied a low. We have studied a low energy vector phase theory described from string compatification. And many compactifications lead to this rule. Four-point coupling can be written by a product of three-point coupling and point coupling can be written by product of three-point coupling. Actually, we don't know why the M, but anyway, we can write it this way. And the symmetry of 3. The symmetry of three-point coupling becomes the symmetry of four-point coupling and end-point coupling. So, if modular symmetry is a symmetry of three-point coupling, it becomes a symmetry of four-point coupling and end-point coupling in perturbation theory. So, this structure will be important from viewpoint of maybe a minimal flavor variation scenario in a standard model effective. In a standard model effective theory. And in the case, you can coupling aspirium. So the symmetry which transforms non-trivial you can coupling will be important. One example is a modular symmetry, include a simple tick modular symmetry. That's all. Thank you very much. Let's thank Tatsu for his overview talk. So, at this point, we have plenty of time for further discussion and comments. Questions first, maybe. Please raise your hand online for further questions. Or any comments, or you can also leave a message in the chat. No comments. Okay, so they are coming up. So They are coming up. So Saul is asking first a question. And then Ignacios. Yes, please, Saul. Go ahead. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Mary. Basically, what we have seen here is that you can get simple symmetries, you can get just modular symmetries, a double cover. Are you aware whether the actual modular symmetry is much larger in your models than only those? Models than only those groups that you have identified so far. Sorry, we are discussing the larger symmetry than the modern group, or we just concentrate what we get from the magnetized library model. Is that so? Yeah, no, my question is whether you think that the actual modular flavor symmetry is Modular flavor symmetry is much larger than the groups that you have identified so far, or not? Ah, okay, it could be. You know more. No. I don't know. Maybe Raja. Definitely we have this symmetry, but we don't know Raja's image. Okay, Naja. Okay, thank you. No jet. Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks. So, yeah, Ignacios, please go ahead. Yeah, I would like to come back to the question of medium. I don't know how many, you say many compactifications lead to this rule that you have a factorization of the endpoint coupling. I mean, in general, you have to assume there of all the. Can do the summation there of all the intermediate states. Yes. Yes, yeah. That's one point. Let's say how general, what are, can you give examples in which there is no summation? In other words, there is just one state, and on the other hand, if this state corresponds only to, I mean, corresponds to a massless. I mean, corresponds to a massless physical state, then this contribution should be extracted from the Gulsonian effective action. So, usually I take some measure, including a maximum. Okay, so you just take a safe part that we are doing. We agree. We agree. And we don't know what is massive mode M here. However, actually we have some example. Mass race mode is dominant, but I don't know there is a layer case or not. Anyway, usually I take some mission, but my crime is anyway. There is a three-point copy. I may, yeah. I may want to comment on this later, but let me go to Hans's, Peter Nilas' question. Yeah, I just want to make a remark there. I guess this is a statement of conformal field theory. Typically, you calculate the four-point function and then you factorize on the poles. And then you if in the massless pole gives you this Yukava coupling for the massless fields, which are relevant if you consider two of them as fermions and one as the Higgs field. On the same one as the Higgs field. I think this statement he's making here is just a statement of conformal field theory on the world chain. However, his examples that Zoe was showing were in the magnetized brain picture, which is classical wave functions, right? And CFT is in the gen intersecting the brain pictures. Pictures. Well, I don't know about these magnetic brains, but it's just the question when you do this calculation, let's say, in just heterotic string theory, that's what you do. Yeah, we have example only the massless model is a dominant in heterogeneous workflow theory, but that is not the general case. We have a lot of examples. Have a lot of examples, uh, massive model contributions in this case in heterogeneous model theory. Excuse me, what do you mean by dominant? I have to show that some example or calculation example, but online in the online It is very hard to Very hard to explain to me. Look, you know, the effective theory calculation of higher order terms, right, has to do with the subtraction of the massless exchanges, right? And the string theory has the power of tracking precisely the contact terms that we derive from string theory. And those are stringy effects, and they're associated. And they're associated with typically with infinite power of massive space, right? Yep. And massless exchanges, this is what we take out. This is in S matrix. We subtract that to extract contact terms of higher dimension operators. That's the standard procedure. I don't claim only massless mode appear here. Appear here. My same model also appears. But anyway, the form is this. And I take some measure here. It can't be only this because once you have massive modes, it comes with different denominator of the Feynman diagrams, right? That's where you get one over M string corrections from massive modes. And if they are a different massive model, And if they are at different mass levels, they contribute, denominator also contributes. It's not only product of the Yukawa couplings in the numerator. You mean depends on the mode. We have some factor here. Yeah, but different modes will have different factors. So this equivalent relationship you're writing. Relationship, you're writing. It's not. And frankly, I just don't see much point in talking about this relationship in the case of restless mode exchanges. This is obvious. Anyway, I don't claim only massless model appear here. All of a massive model can. All of a massive model can appear. But anyway, we may have this type of. But you said we need some or bowl factor here. Depends on the mode, right? Right, right. But there is an or bowel factor. It's not universal because different modes have different masses. but there is not there is a flavor independent no you don't know much really about the massive spectrum well you have it for amplitude calculations give you we we can frame uh three-point coupling include the massive mode become asymmetry of higher uh all the coupling Higher order cover it's very hard to quantify that, but you have infinite number of massive modes that contribute to this, right? Yeah, yeah. So by the way, just as another comment, you know, this contact terms were of interest in the intersecting brain models. Brain models, contact terms of higher-dimensional operators, right? We're of interest in intersecting de-brain models in the context, say, of proton decay that, for example, Klebanov and Witten were addressing precisely the conductance for simplest things and my work with Robert Richter as well. Just for reference, you know, how this is technically approached in the effective theory. Approached in the effective theory calculations. Mainly a comment, yeah. Any other questions, comments, maybe? Yes, Michael. I have a comment on my first. I have a comment. First of all, I agree with what Miriam, Ignacio, and Hans Peter said. But in these modular flavor symmetries, there is indeed something that allows you to compute the higher order couplings just from these modular flavor symmetries. And they, of course, match as they should with these expectations. So I don't think that it's precisely something like MFV, but there are certainly something to the statement that you. Certainly, something to the statement that you can relate these couplings to some extent. Yeah, it looks a little bit reminiscent of MFV. But yeah, so in this model of lever symmetries, you sometimes, well, you don't have to necessarily do the explicit string theory. It's sort of in the end a representation theory game, which does reproduce these couplings as well. So there's sort of some point to that, but I agree, of course, with all these comments, also the mass dimensions here a little bit. Mass dimensions here are a little bit obscure, but um these motor flavor symmetries are sort of perhaps not new, I don't know, but at least in some communities a new approach to also get these higher order correlators. Okay. Thank you. Stuart also. Stuart, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, let me unmute. Yeah, so you keep talking about minimal flavor violation. Is that correct? Is that correct? MFV. Yeah. But it hasn't much to do with soft SUSY breaking terms. If the soft breaking terms don't line up with the Okawa matrices, then you don't have minimal flavor violation. So it doesn't matter what the Ukawa matrices look like. They may be hierarchical, but you need to know what the soft Susie breaking is to know if you have minimal flavor violation. Isn't that true? So. So I'm not sure, but if switch breaking is occur by F term or modulus, F term also have some behavior under the modular symmetry. So it's true that in a supersymmetry. It's true that in supersymmetric theory, you can get minimal flavor violation by having, say, dilettante Susie breaking or whatever, but it's not guaranteed. And it's really a matter of the soft Susie breaking terms, which determine whether you have minimal flavor violation or not. That is not maybe that is not consistent with minimal flavor violation, but if we consider f-term of F term of modus has some symmetry, that is, for example, modular symmetry. Soft term also control by the modular symmetry. I think so. Any other questions or comments? I guess, Michael, you may want to take down your hand if you don't want to say anything.
