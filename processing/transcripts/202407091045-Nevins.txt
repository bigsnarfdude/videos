All right. Thank you very much. And really, really thank you to the organizers for letting me do this. So I really appreciate it. And okay, so the questions that I want to talk about now, well, it'll be interesting to compare and contrast with some of the questions about fixed point subgroups we said last time, but it's going to be a bit more in the spirit of the talk just preceding this one. And you'll see that a lot of the emphasis is how do we construct. Of the emphasis is how do we construct these things? And so there's some very algebraic questions that are coming up. But I will also use it as a little place to tell you more details about some of the cool stuff happening in representation theory. Well, could you click on the... Oh, no, I know what I did. Sorry, thank you. All right, so I'm going to take a pietic field. This could be the equi-characteristic case. And I'm taking a reductive, connective, reductive p-i-tic group defined over F. And the standing hypothesis is. And the standing hypothesis is one that you heard before, and p will not divide the order of the bile group, and g splits over a tamely ramified extension, and that's because of the construction of types that I want to assume exists. And then the setting of fixed point subgroups is I want to choose a subgroup of the automorphism group, some finite group. The only condition I have is that the order is not divisible by the prime p of my p-adic field. And then by results of Gopal Prasad and JKU in 2002, I know that if you In 2002, I know that if you take the connected component of the group of fixed points, that's a connected reductive p-adic group. And moreover, the Bruhartitz building has an action of gamma because gamma acts on G, it acts on the building, and the fixed points in the building is just the building of the fixed point group. So this is a beautiful setup for relating their structure theories. And of course, our examples include the classical groups, maybe starting from GLN and gamma something of order two in the And gamma, something of order two, and these are all our symmetric pairs. And maybe more generally, you might be interested in the fixed point group under some Galois conjugate, and this extension could be of arbitrary degree. So I'd be talking about any kind of restriction of scalars or extension of scalars. And there's probably lots of other examples, and I'd be loving to talk to various people about their favorite examples of these groups, because what we've been doing so far is just an incomplete generality. I think we'll get more track. Complete generality. I think we'll get more traction by going to some examples. And I forgot to say, but I read it on the first slide, most of this is joint work with Peter Lee. So the classic question, which is phrased very softly, is just how do the representation theories of the group and its fixed point subgroup relate? So when you're a p-iadic person, your first question is, oh, let's talk about their types. So the category of smooth representations of G by Bernstein's theorem decomposes into a direct product of Into a direct product of blocks. And these blocks are indexed by the inertial support of the representation. And these are the Bernstein blocks. So inertial support, we talked about cuspidal support. You take cuspidal support, but then you can let that cuspidal representation, you can multiply it by any unramified character. That's a character that's trivial on every compact open subgroup. And that gives you cuspidal support. And every irreducible representation has a given inertial support, and that defines its Bernstein block. And that defines its Bernstein block. And under the local Langlands correspondence, if you take the L parameters of representations with the same inertial support in this definition, on the Langlands side, you're going to get the same restriction to the inertia subgroup. So here's the V group, here's the inertia subgroup, and the inertia subgroup is like the maximal compact open subgroup of the V group. So it's looking very nice. Now, an S type, and I'll be dropping the S from now on. Be dropping the S from now on is a pair of a compact open subgroup, probably not maximal, and a little representation kappa, such that for all irreducible smooth representations of G, I want to know if that irreducible representation is in a particular Bernstein block, and all I have to do is ask if it contains kappa upon restriction to J. So that is a miraculous property, but it is what's behind a lot of the descriptions of these Brinstein blocks. A lot of the descriptions of these Branstein blocks in terms of representation theories of Heck algebras and things like that. And a quick example of a type: suppose that I have a semi-simple group, and suppose I've got a compact open subgroup and an irreducible representation such that if you just compactly induce this guy, you get an irreducible supercuspital representation. We saw that in SL2 for the case of in, well, in all of SL2, this is how we got our supercuspitals. Then the point is, that pair that I just wrote down, that's a type. That's a type. So, if we're just thinking about superclassical representation, the types are like the things you want, so you can just produce the representation. Okay, so let's just kill all hope. No, absolutely not. The types on G will not restrict to types on G gamma, but the obstructions are kind of interesting. So the first things you say for most types, if you wanted to do the restriction and you do this intersection, that's going to be way too small. There's no way that that could give you a supercuspital representation. And then even if you say, well, I only want And then, even if you say, well, I only want those groups that are stable under this action of this finite group of automorphisms, that restriction of this irreducible representation to the fixed points of J, that definitely doesn't need to be irreducible. And then even worse, if you had an irreducible component of that restriction of kappa, and then you could look at this pair, that's not a type. So it just, you know, it just falls apart at many levels. I'm going to come back and save some of this towards the end. So what do we do? So, what do we do? Well, we can't give up on that. Types were very important. We're going to restrict consideration to something called semi-simple characters. And there, there's an awful lot that we can say. So my definition, which is a bit rough, of semi-simple characters, I'm saying, suppose you have a type. What I actually mean is a type that we've constructed with the Bushnell-Kutzko construction or with the JKU construction. Then there's a particular pro-P subgroup that is maximal with respect to the property that your kappa is actually. That your kappa is actually just a character on that subgroup. So that came up in SL2 when we talked about, oh, well, if you just had the slightly smaller group, sometimes that extension lambda is just a character. So quasi-character here, sorry, that's the language for a complex-valued character, complex-valued one-dimensional representation. So then this thing, which is a much simpler object, so that's a pro-P group, and this is just a one-dimensional representation. This is called the semi-simple character. That's language from the Bushnil-Kutsko. From the Bushnil-Kutsko tradition of constructing types. And it would be called a symbol character if we're specifically talking about a supercospital representation. So some quick examples to give us a sense of what's going on. If I had a depth zero representation, so a depth zero type, then the associated semi-symbol character is the trivial character. Well, that was really boring. And on the Langlands side, the Langlands parameter is tame. Tame means it has trivial restriction to the wild. Restriction to the wild inertia subgroup. So, what it's saying is our interest stays in representations of positive depth. Those are the ones that have interesting semi-simple characters. And on the Langland side, it does suggest we're looking at what's happening on wild inertia. Okay, I should give an example. So, I'm looking at the AtherU construction of supercaspulan representations, and these semi-symbol characters are quite nice. I'm actually going to do this construction, and then you'll see us. To do this construction, and then you'll see us fly by a bit. I start with an anisotropic torus, an elliptic torus. I take the building, which is a point. I take a character of t of a certain positive depth, and then you just think of what that character is on, okay, so the character is trivial on tr plus, that's what depth was. This quotient here, so if you go halfway up to r over 2, you can prove this is actually an abelian group isomorphic to a quotient of the filtration subgroups on its Lie algebra. Subgroups on its Lie algebra. So, in the pietic case, we don't get to do exponentials, like that's pretty awful. There's a lot of stuff we can't do, but this moi-prasad filtration, we've got that. So, it's a way of translating questions to the Lie algebra. And generally speaking, we don't have a lot of places where you translate questions to the Lie algebra. Okay, then, okay, then here's just, if I take an additive character of my field of depth zero, I fix that for once and for all, then I could think, oh, well, my character is actually a character of. My character is actually a character of this part of the Lie algebra. So it's just given by something in the dual of the Lie algebra. And this little minus r is referring to where is my depths. My depths are lined up and defined so that this x will be at depth negative r in the jewels in the algebra. So this is just saying it's in the jewel, and then this is somebody taking f to taking it from f to c. Oh, right. All right. And now what we can do is we can extend this element x. It's in the dual of the Lie algebra of t, but actually t has a unique t invariant component. So I can extend this to an element of g star. And if you put it as an element of g star in this canonical way, then you actually end up with a character of the similar quotient of g, which is a representation of a compact open subgroup of g. And so the character of the torus and then this extension. And then this extension of this x, which is in the dual of this Lie algebra, giving us a character of this, that gives you a character, a one-dimensional representation of this particular subgroup. So here I'm just taking the pro P part of T, and here I'm taking my compact open subgroup. And this is an example of a semi-simple character. So you can think I took my character and I just fattened it up to the simplest subgroup where I can extend it as a character. Okay. So before I go into. So, before I go any further with the constructions, I want to give you a bit of motivation about these semi-simple characters and their many roles. So, the first one is just some recent work of Karinčuk, Splavlorak, and Stevens. And what they were doing in the Bushnil-Kutsko setting, where they have very explicit notions for these semi-simple characters, they worked out a sense of equivalence classes of semi-simple characters, and they labeled it by something called endoparameters. What they are conjecturing is that that Conjecturing is that that list of endoparameters should be in a nice, beautiful bijection with wild Langlands parameters. What I mean by wild Langlands parameters is just the restriction of your Langlands parameter to the wild inertia subgroup under the local Languins correspondence. So hoping that it has really good properties so that we can say very nice things about that bijection. And this lines up with this idea that it looks like my semi-simple characters are telling me what was happening in Walinursha. Now at a concrete Now, at a concrete level, actually, semi-simple characters are completely fundamental to the way we construct representations. So, if you go to the Bushnil-Kutsko School of Constructing Types, the way they actually did it is they started off from the types of GLN, which we knew, or sometimes when we knew this one, then you saw that the group you wanted to construct the types for was a fixed point subgroup. And what you would do is first you start off with all the semi-simple characters of the big group that have some kind of self-duality with respect to this involution. Duality with respect to this involution, which was gamma. And then you produced all the semi-simple characters by restriction. And then you just had to add in appropriate depth zero data to the normalizer of the character. I'll define what I mean by the depth zero piece, but think of that a lot of our groups have a depth zero piece and then a kind of a boring cropy piece. And our semi-similar characters are on the boring cropy piece, but the depth zero stuff is where you get the types. And then on the other view, And then on the other view, if you look at Finson's 2021 proof of the exhaustion of the chimew types, that other school of construction, under that hypothesis, what you first did is identified the depth zero datum in a representation and then reconstructed the semi-symbol character that gave the type that showed up in that representation, proving the exhaustion of this construction. So our question is basically in the abstract setting of the add their U types where you don't really Are there U types where you don't really see a connection between different groups? It's all extremely abstract. Can one extract a relationship between the semi-symbol characters of G and the fixed point subgroup that really mimic everything that we're seeing over here in the classical case? Okay. So we have to talk about how you'd construct the type of a supercuspital representation, which is all of them under a certain hypothesis. So this construction of a type, well, maybe I can add here, Roy. Construction of a type. Well, maybe I can add here. Roger Howes certainly told us how to do this for GLN long before the rest, and then Adam's thesis, and then JKU with a massive paper for supercastful representations. And then it was written up for the generality of all representations in 2016. You start off with a whole bunch of things. And these are structural elements of the group, and it's Lie algebra and the Bruhat-Titz building. And once you have all of those, then you can make a supercaspal representation of a certain Levi subgroup. Representation of a certain Levy subgroup, and you can make a representation of a compact open subgroup such that the compact open subgroup with kappa is a type for that supercuspital. Okay, and so there, that's the whole thing. Now let's just look a little bit at the ingredients. If you will bear with me for one slide, on the next slide, I'm going to cut a lot of them out and then we'll continue with that. But everybody should see a little bit of this because I'm very curious at the real perspective of how this isn't. Real perspective of how this isn't quite aq lambda, but morally speaking, we should be talking about those kinds of representations. So, what is this data? The first thing is a sequence of twisted Levy subgroups. So, that would be groups that are Levy subgroups over the algebraic closure. So like Levy subgroups that are not split over F, but are split if you go up to an extension. M0 is an actual Levy subgroup of the Levy subgroup of the smallest group of this sequence. The sequence we saw before, we had a torus, an anisotropic torus in G. So that was pretty boring. And when you have this, you also get a Levy subgroup of the whole group, which will be the Levy that we need at the end. All right, then you get a vertex in the building of the Levy subgroup of the smallest group. And that ends up being a point in all the buildings of all the groups that we might see here, but it won't be a vertex of the rest of them. So the way these things embed, the vertex. them so the way these things embed the vertex it'll be a vertex in the small group but it might not be a vertex elsewhere and we absolutely need that because we need to know how to define our more precise filtration subgroups that subtlety is incredibly important okay um then here's my depth zero piece so the m0 and then this irreducible representation of a maximal compact subgroup of m0 of depth zero containing a cuspidal representation of the associated finite group of lead type that's the depth zero information That's the depth zero information of a type right there. Okay, then a whole bunch of nice numbers. I forgot to say these are positive numbers. R0 is bigger than zero. And you have this r over two that shows up. I'm going to call it s. Then you need a bunch of characters of all these groups. And I put in red gi plus one generic because I don't want to define that. That's maybe we'll talk about that in a little bit. Let's say really good characters, one-dimensional representation. Bed characters, one-dimensional representations of these groups. So these are all twisted Levy subgroups. They have lots of one-dimensional representations, and you want to have them of the depth coming from here. And finally, we can do this. So I have to have some elements in the dual of the Lie algebra that realize my one-dimensional representation upon restriction. This is what we saw before in the case that the GI was a torso. So again, same kind of thing. My character tells me about a representation on a small. About a representation on a small enough subgroup that's abelian, that I can extend immediately and give me a representation of a big compact open subgroup. And this type down here is kind of built up from a whole bunch of getting smaller and smaller compact open subgroups that are getting wider and wider. I have a picture coming up. So if I just want to get supercaspal or plantations, can I just add this in? That's right. If I just want a supercus, actually, I'm going to get rid of the M0 if I want a supercuspital. If I want a supercuspital, and a G0 will play that role. And you're right, I need this one here. What I will impose is that the G0 itself is its center, mod the center of G is compact. So it's something like getting a G from this Jamian Levy subgroup. This thing actually won't have any Levy subgroups that are split. Is it obvious J is good? Is it obvious that J is good? Is a group. Is it obvious that G is a group? Well, I don't think so, but in fact, it is because each of these are twisted, are more percent filtration subgroups, which are normal subgroups of GX. So G D X S D minus one is just a nice normal subgroup of G D, which is G. And then, you know, so all the way along there, normal subgroups in the preceding. But it's like, it's like magic. So we can ask for another extreme. So with this particular depth here, Rob, and not necessarily cast it on, you can just pick. And unless there is a capital, then you just pick from one algorithm. Okay, so if I want a depth zero representation, then I'm going to take my M0 and I'm going to take this depth zero piece right here that contains the cutspittle, and then I will get rid of all of this. And I will just do M0x, which is a maximal compact open subgroup of that. If I'm not semi-simple, I'm going to have to make it to extend it to a compact mud-center subgroup. But if I am semi-simple, then I'm just. If I am semi-simple, then I would just compactly induce sigma all the way up to g. You don't have a sequence. So if I'm a depth zero representation, I won't get the sequence of twisted blood. Except for me, I should have said the depth of our representation will be this number Rd at the end of the day. So this only, all this complexity is only for positive depth. Okay, so I'm now about to toss away the depth zero stuff. About to toss away the depth zero stuff because I say for semi-simple characters, we don't need the depth zero information. That's exactly what we throw away. So, I can take away the twisted Levy subgroup, sorry, I could take away the genuine Levy subgroup and this cuspidal representation that's there, and that's some of the most complex stuff in there. And once I've gotten rid of those, then I could realize that actually that twisted Levy sequence, they're just centralizers of those elements xi. That's a very nice observation. And so, if I've already done And so, if I've already done all the work of finding what those elements xi are, then I already know what the gi's are. And if I already know the element xi and the point x of the building, then I know what the depth is because that's exactly the filtration level at which I find my element. So I don't need to carry those extra things along. They're automatic as soon as I have the rest. So this is the data I need to have if I want to construct a semi-simple character. And so that's a vertex in a certain That's a vertex in a certain, let's just say it's a point in the building, it's a sequence of certain quasi-characters, and it is a bunch of vectors in the dual of the Lie algebra. Okay, and then I want to construct semi-simple characters. Well, this will be quite nice. So the element xi gives you a character of this big fat open subgroup of the whole group G. And then again, phi i was a character of the group gi x0. So when I multiply them together, I have. So, when I multiply them together, I have the kind of open subgroup I was interested in. Here, I've made a picture in my ticks skills. So, there's G0, and then here's one of these fat subgroups for G1, and here's the fat subgroup for G2. They're getting bigger as the upper index increases, I'm getting to bigger groups, and as the lower index of the SI increases, I'm getting to smaller groups. So, anyway, there we go. All you have to do is each, so it takes a bit of thought, but what I So it takes a bit of thought, but what I've defined here, this phi i hat, as a representation of this group, this group up here contains this group at the bottom. And that's just because it's a rough, there we go. So I can, so it makes sense to multiply them all together. And that's my semi-symbol character. So the semi-symbol character is a nice extension of the restrictions of these things, and it's just built out of a few ingredients. And it's on this next propeed plug. And it's on this next propee. Okay, so we have semi-simple characters, but we're trying to talk about something to do with the fixed point subgroups. And it's not immediately obvious. Hopefully it's starting to be feel a bit more obvious how we might relate these to the fixed point subgroup. And the definition is that once we've stripped it down to these essential elements, it's much more clear that a datum, that triple, is going to be called gamma stable if x, well, it should be a gamma fixed. X, well, it should be a gamma fixed point in the building, and each of those vectors xi should be gamma fixed. So that's a very nice, clean definition of what gamma stable should be. And if we have that, then the first proposition is, suppose I have a gamma-stable datum. Well, then that point is a point in the building of the fixed point subgroup. Those vectors xi are definitely in the dual of the group, the Lie algebra of the fixed point subgroup. That is. Subgroup that is under very natural identifications. Even better, if I look at the centralizer of those elements and the twisted Levy subgroups, which came inside the fixed point subgroup, I get twisted Levy subgroups. My element XI will still have the same depth. The characters will restrict to generic characters, so Gi realized by XI. And at first glance, you say, well, that's it. That's perfect. That must be the datum for one of my semi-simple characters. Datum for one of my semi-simple characters, but it's not quite. So when I take this datum down here, this is not quite a datum for the fixed point subgroup, but you don't see it when you just look at this triple. I have to give you an example. So imagine G is SL2, and I have an involution that gave me the group SO2. Then here's a beautiful twisted Levy sequence. This is a nice compact torus sitting inside of SL2. And it's a twisted Levy sequence, but And it's a twisted Levy sequence, but when you take the gamma fixed points on those, you get equality. And in the construction, we absolutely cannot have two twisted levy subgroups being equal. It had to be an increasing chain of distinct twisted levy subgroups. So we have duplicates in our data. So something of when we collapse things, maybe it made sense. I'm in a much smaller group. Some of my twisted levy sequences collapsed and made the same one, same twisted levy subgroups. The fixed. Twisted Levy subgroups. The fix is really easy. So, if you had a whole bunch of twisted Levy subgroups that collapse to exactly the same twisted Levy subgroup, just take all those guys from the stuff that's a duplicate and replace the elements XI with their sum and replace those characters that you have with the product of the characters. And that makes sense because you're going to be restricting it to the same subgroup. And the result there is perfectly good. That is a datum for our fixed. Is a datum for our fixed point subgroup. Okay, so if we had a gamma-stable datum for a semi-simple character of G, we have just figured out that it very nicely produces the datum for a semi-simple character of the fixed point subgroup. Ah, but do I get semi-simple characters? Okay, so here's the definition of gamma stable. And the first thing is the good one. So I have a semi-simple character. It came from one of these data. Came from one of these data, then the group is gamma stable, thank goodness, and the semi-symbol character of G gamma corresponding to the new datum, the restricted datum, is just the restriction of things. So it just restricts. It's beautiful. So if I have the datum, then I have a perfect restriction of semi-simple characters. But our big question was really about applications to branching rules. And what we can deduce from this and the proof that I'd like to go. Can deduce from this and the proof that I'd like to go through with you is suppose that you had a representation and it contained a type that extended one of these Gamel stable databases. Okay. Then if I look at the restriction of the representation to the fixed point subgroup, now this one here is, I have said a non-semisible representation of infinite length. I think I'm going to ask people who know but examples to tell me if that ever happens actually, but it could be horrible and we don't expect it to be. Actually, but it could be horrible, and we don't expect it to be discreetly decomposable. So it's presumably a really, really horrible thing, but I can prove that that restriction contains, so it's multiple irreducible representations, and some of them contain types that come from this data. Okay, so it's about identifying some really interesting sub-representations that showed up in the restriction of the big. Okay, all right, so a tough slide, but then more fun slides. Okay, so here. More fun slides. Okay, so here we go. If we wanted to prove something like that, suppose you had a representation, it contains a type, and the semi-simple character in that type came from a particular datum, sigma. And here's my depth zero piece that I needed to make the type. Okay, then first thing you do is you take that depth zero piece and you restrict it to the maximal compact open subgroup of the gamma fixed points of that levy. That levee. And that will decompose into a bunch of irreducibles because this is just a nice compact group. So this is beautiful. It decomposes a sum of irreducibles. And first cool fact is that the restriction of this type to the fixed point subgroup J gamma actually decomposes. So it's just those irreducible depth zero pieces times some very nice pieces that are just the extension of the semi-simple character to the J gamma. So there's something, the semi-simple So there's something the semi-symbol character is already straightened up and clean. So when I do the restriction of the type, the only weird stuff that happens is the stuff on the depth zero piece. And the part on the positive depth has all been taken care of because of what we set up with the semi-symbol characters. Okay, so now here's where we're addressing all those issues that I mentioned on the first few slides. So if this C that we have here contains a cuspidal representation. Here contains a cuspinal representation. We are so dumped. We have a beautiful, we have a datum, we have a compact open subgroup, sorry, a twist, a Levy, genuine Levy subgroup of the twist of the fixed point group of G, and we have a representation that contains a custom representation, and that's the datum of a type occurring in the restriction. When it doesn't, then we do something crazy. So I have an irreducible representation C. That representation. C. That representation C could restrict further to give me an irreducible representation of this finite group of Lie type. An irreducible representation of a finite group of Lie type has cuspital support, just like the p-iadic groups do. So I can ask about that cuspital support of this representation, C. Then what we have to do is we were fixing a point in the building, and it's wrong to continue with that point in the building. I'm now going to move the point in the building to The point in the building to a point U that is near X, and that point U will define the levy subgroup L that shows up in this cuspidal support, but actually the opposite parabolic, so that the trick works out very well. And then you get to choose an irreducible component zeta of this restriction to this new subgroup, which is a compact open subgroup, but it's at the point U. It's the fixer of U in G0 in the fixed point subgroup. So we've changed a number of interesting points. A number of interesting points in the datum, but that's all we had to do. Then, replacing that point X with a new point U in our datum for our fixed points, our gamma stable datum, we throw in this new depth zero piece that we've constructed, and we get a datum for a type in the fixed point subgroup, and that datum is a type that is going to show up in the restriction of the representation to G gamma. Okay. Definitely not all types. We're not capturing anything close to all types that occur. So, and the way that we want to approach that now is maybe to look at it in the opposite direction. So in my, I guess I've been talking quickly. So my next question could be phrased as, do all semi-simple characters of G gamma arise in this way? So because I had all the semi-simple characters, we're able to see how to reduce a whole bunch of types in the restriction. Reduce a whole bunch of types in the restriction. Morally speaking, of course, all semi-simple characters should arise in this way, but there's actually a couple of really weird obstructions that cause quite a headache. The first obstruction to lifting a datum from a fixed point subgroup back up to the group is this issue of genericity. So, genericity, I can describe it maybe on that element Xi more easily. That element Xi is going to be generic if Is going to be generic if, when evaluated on all the co-roots, I will get something evaluation exactly negative r. So it's something like a generic element of that depth in the Lie algebra of the torus where it is, but it's a very specific condition that asks me to know about all of my co-roots in the whole group G. And there's, if I know that I start with an element that is distinguished relative to the smaller group, then To the smaller group, then I don't have any information about how the roots of the larger group act on this element. And so there's no way to guess that this element should be generic. And then the second issue is this problem of lifting characters. We talked about having GI could be SL2 and you look at the fixed point group and it's SO2. Well, I got a lot of one-dimensional representations of SO2 and none of them lift to a representation. them lift to a representation, a one-dimensional representation of SL2. It still doesn't have any characters. So you can't just lift characters arbitrarily. So in short, not all of the G gamma data arise specifically as a sigma gamma. Clearly we know, well, okay, it's not clear at all that all G gamma data arises some G gamma. And this is where the current work is coming in. And this is where the current work is coming in. The key notion to resolve this is an idea of refactorization, which appeared in Hakeem Mynahan in 2008 and was central to Finson's proof in 2021. And I'll just sketch out what those steps are like. Okay, so this is work in progress. So you're starting off with a fixed point subgroup, and you've got the datum for a semi-symbol character of this fixed point subgroup. The first thing we're going to do is we're just going to add all of the XI's together because there's just so Together because they're just so hopefully non-generic, and we already knew that you had to add some of them together when you were doing the restriction. So, we have to give up on the whole thing and add them together to give a particular element x in the dual-build algebra. And then there's a really neat way to refactor that point x at the given point under the action of the whole group G to produce a sequence of generic elements wj. And they don't quite work, so x. Don't quite work. So, x, this sum, will be congruent to the sum of the w j's, but only mod g zero, certain filtration of the dual of the algebra. Okay, but nonetheless, so you do get a new sequence, and now once you have that sequence, there are some methods in FinSEN that would allow me to construct a whole bunch of interesting characters that could extend that particular sequence. So, from the WJs, producing a whole bunch of characters. Once you've done Characters. Once you've done that, then what you will have to show is that there is actually a datum. So, such that when you take the gamma fixed points, you get something that is equivalent to the datum we started with for the fixed point subgroup in the sense that they would give us the same semi-simple character. So this is a strategy, but it hasn't yet fully been realized. But I keep using these talks as motivation. I'm going to tackle it one more time. I'm going to get through to the end. Time. We're going to get through to the end. So, where is this all going and what will we do? So, this method, as I mentioned, we produce a whole bunch of interesting types showing up in the restriction to the fixed point subgroup, but it can't possibly produce all the types. Even just Mackie theory would tell you that there's all kinds of types that I have missed in doing this restriction. But I think if we had a better handle on this converse direction and on this notion of equivalence of the semi-symbol characters, then Simple characters, then we could hope to say which pi contain a given tau upon restriction. We might be able to get a more precise kind of result. The next kind of question that we would like to know is just an explicit form of this equivalence relation on data coming from the equality of semi-simple characters. I think this is probably very, very close to refactorization that appeared in Hakeem Mernahan. But the reason why we might want to write it more explicitly is that was an example of what Was an example of what Spluderak, Krinchuk, and Stevens were doing to develop the notion of endo-equivalence, which NER and Bushbell are doing. And it's only been studied in the setting of Bushno-Kutzko types. So it might be interesting to really play that out more explicitly. And finally, you know, related to the question from yesterday, I would love to know for what pairs were actually discretely decomposable, because I think that if we were looking at examples where we were discretely decomposable, then I'm going to be able to do that. Where we were discreetly decomposable, then I'd have a much more explicit result using the techniques that we have applied in this theorem. So that's it. Thank you. I mean, this miscible cycle is basically horizontally exactly as a factorization because of factorization. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. I mean, you could just do it that way. So, think of it as, yeah, so a factorization of any quasi-character of a twisted levy circle. Well, I mean, that's the, yes, I mean, if you look at what Calantha does, he knows for toy, but you don't have to work with it, right? And probably Fincent does the same thing, right? That's right. The approach in the Fincent is to really go all the way down to those elements XI. And then instead of looking at... Instead of looking at, so this is what Bush and Elkiska are calling those potential simple characters and potential semi-simple characters. They had a perspective that we should, you know, take all the possible characters that come from a set of XI's or from element X, and that that might be the. Yeah, yes, but I mean, if you look at it in the concept, there might be a way to control things that the level of quasi-characters on top of the left because sometimes there's there's a canonical effect which gives us what the level of So that might make it simpler. I don't know, but it might. Yeah, I'm totally fine with you that if I would just stop and just look at what Caletha does and look at those ones, I bet you that should have an elegant answer. Thank you very much, you do. Other comments or questions? So what they said, I don't remember the subject. Well, actually, so I was just looking at it this morning. They're not giving any explicit statement of what the map should be, but they have found a nice set of that parametrizes all of their semi-simple characters in terms of kind of cadets have a choice, though, Hermitian form at some point. But then, but they just expect that there should be a bijection that is that commutes with a Objection that is that commutes with the local language, but they're not opposing natural not that I could see in their papers, but I think that's what they're aiming for. So, um, and there's a continuing work by Swederak et al. on particular examples. So, so I would I'm hoping that that somebody's like saying, well, this is how you're supposed to do it. Yeah, wondering whether you're like the premium side of yourself. I want to know what the premier side of the story is. Not that looking at representations of wild inertia is a fun thing to do.
