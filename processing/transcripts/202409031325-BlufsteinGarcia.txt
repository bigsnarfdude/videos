If someone is watching this from the future then you should go watch Alex's talk first because otherwise you won't understand. So okay. Yesterday Alex talked about mainly the Hobbes property for RT groups. I will also talk about the Hobby property today. So again I won't recall what RT groups are and so on because you've seen it plenty of times. But just so you remember, an RT group is, or in general, a group is cohort again. If they inject If every injective endomorphism is also an isomorphism, and it's Hauptian, the same happens for epimorphisms. So, I don't know. Okay. Maybe I won't recall what RT groups are, but just remind you of some findings. So, birth-type art groups, you've just heard about them, so we know what they are. And we have three infinity RT groups. These are the early groups. Infinite dirty groups. These are the outing groups where the graph defining the outing group is section. So the label between any two pair of generators is not infinite. So they all are related in some sense. And finally, we have hyperbolic type, which just means that the corresponding cluster group is hyperbolic. And in this case, when we consider large type and hyperbolic type, essentially it's just saying large type plus 3 frame. Essentially, this is the only thing that we are writing. So now I will just state our main theory. Which is actually quite stronger than this Hawkhan and Cohafan property. And this will take a while, so bear with me. It's quite long, but I'll explain a little bit. So we just take essentially any morphism reaching A. Between A and some other attribute A gamma, right? Where both of these, I won't write it again, but they are large type free of infinity and hyperbolic type. So as well, W grammar hyperbolic means in which step? Grammar hyperbolic. And this is labels 3, 3, and 3, 3, 3. Okay. So we have essentially any morticism between two altitudes with all of these conditions. They have a prime or prime at least three, so at least three generators for each of them. Such that the image of the function f is not cyclic and does not mutually split as a direct product. This is just to avoid some trivial morphisms that we don't really care about. So the conclusion is the following. Let gamma one be a subgraph of gamma that is a minimal induced subgraph minima with the property Minimum with the property such that if we restrict f only to the generators in this subreference, we get the same. So famma 1 is equal to k gamma. So we obtain the same image, we only look at this subset and the complex. So Then what we get is the problem that there exists another subgraph, gamma 1 prime, gamma prime, an induced subgraph again, an isomorphism i from gamma 1 to gamma 1 prime. This is an isomorphism of unlabeled graphs. So these graphs, the define articles, they have labels. This may not respect the labels. But it's an isomorphism at the level of graphs. There is also a domain G in the image, a gamma prime. It's an F signal which is only plus or minus one such that the following code. So for every distinct generator S and T in our one, we have that M I S IS IT divides MST. This MST is just the label between S and T in the graph, and this is the label in the image here isomorphism. So they may not be exactly the same, but one device is the other. And also that for every I think standard generator in gamma one. In gamma one f of s is g times I of s to the epsilon. So let's look at it maybe backwards. Essentially, what we are saying is that modulus some trivial morphisms that you could get if the image is really small, any morphism between parting groups of Parting groups of these families is just a conjugation, maybe a global inversion, so maybe you invert all the generators, and a graph automorphism. Because of course, I don't know, you have a 444 mapping to a 444, you could swap the generators around, so that's what this height accounts for. Okay, and that's the idea. We don't want the image to be sighty because, of course, we just send everything to the same element and then that will tell you nothing. And we pass to this subwrap to make the statement cleaner, because of course some generators may be in the kernel of the map, so we ignore those. But again, except for those CP cases, Hallmark is somewhere. CD cases, hormarctisms look like this. Okay. So now an immediate parallel is that if a gamma is as before, so with all of those hypotheses, it is Kokyan and Ko-Kok. And what's the proof of this? Well, I didn't tell you how you construct this for gamma 1, but it's essentially what you could expect. You just remove the generators that are in the kernel, and if two generators map to the same thing, you only keep one of them. Okay? So that's how you build this gamma one. Gamma1. And so, for example, when the morphism is injected, you have that gamma1 equals gamma. And so now you have this isomorphism. So gamma1 prime is also gamma in that case. And then you get that the morphism that you have is actually an automorphism, which is just again, conjugation, maybe a global inversion, and some automorphism, of course. Automorphism of graphs, if that is permitted. And if it is surjective, then same thing, but you just look at the image. This gamma prime will have to be everything, and so you have this isomorphism, so gamma prime is also everything, and then again you get that the original morphism is an automorphism. And the only maybe thing that you have to check is uh this condition, that the image does not virtually split, but Image does not virtually split, but if the morphism is injected or surjective, the image is one of these healthy groups. And since they have rank at least three, we know that those don't be rejected split here. Okay, we move on. So the initial hypotheses you energy force was um large. Like are any of these large freedom are these are they all enforced or not none are enforced or? Not non-valid flows? Oh, so what we have is, I won't give those counter examples now, but you cannot remove any of these. Whichever you remove. So gamma and gamma prime assumes to have all three of those. Yeah, yes, both three of those. Yeah. So they passed through it. And yeah, plus where I was going to say now that if you remove any of these, or you remove this condition on the image, we have council examples for orchestras that don't work like this. For orchestras that don't work things. So, in some sense, it's the best we can. And the examples are not too complicated. So, maybe just a sketch on how do we prove this. So, the first proposition that we need is, well, this is sort of what Alex mentioned yesterday, but say you have f from some a gamma to a gamma prime. A gamma to a gamma frame as equal theorem. Then for all S T, sorry, for all S generator, S is either trigger or conjugate to some T plus minus. T plus minus 1 15 double 1. And the way in which you show this is you prove that, again I won't define the lean conflicts, but you prove that the fixed point set of the image of such a generator in the fixed point set in the lean complex sorry is a standard trick. A standard tree. So that tells you that this element is conjugate to a power of some standard generator, and then you need to rule out the cases where that power is plus minus one. And that is maybe a more algebraic argument, but that's essentially it. And then... Wait, wait, before you read it, can I ask? This corollary says A as before. Does it mean these four conditions? Yes, those over there. Over there. Over the large field continues this one, sir. This one, and then also bracket risk three, so same conditions as in the theorem. So this is a proposition that we use as an auxiliary proposition to prove the theorem, so we assume the same hypothesis. Well, this involves F and in which sense corollary? Both. Corollary is both. When you take gamma. When do you take gamma prime equal to gamma? Take gamma prime equal to gamma, then you have an endomorphism, and then you study whether when it's injective or surjective. Sorry, maybe, I just want to understand what does S before mean? Exactly. Which conditions? Ah, here it is. Only this. And rank at least three. Okay. And I guess that every F has these properties. Uh if it is injective or subjective, then yes, because uh these groups do not reject it. Then the other ingredient that we need is actually a previous result by Nicodemus. This is more or less the same as Alex mentioned yesterday, but for the case of the specific. So you have a gamma large tree of infinity. You have standard trees T1 to Tn such that Ti intersection of Tj is non-empty for any distinct. It's non-empty for any distinct i and j, but triple intersections is empty whenever you take three of them. Then there is translate of the fundamental domain in the link complex such that For every eye, this translate contains an edge of one of these bits. Gamma contains an edge of Ti. So from this proposition, we know that each generator is sent to a contributor of some generator, but maybe they are all contributed by different elements. So this thing over here. So this thing over here guarantees that the LMF conjugating piece is two and so on. So that the element conjugating them is you can take you can take it to be the same for the You can take it to be the same forever. So that's where you get the uniqueness. The proof of this is in our article, but it follows from Nicolas' previous work. So I think he's up to. And how much time do I have? Four minutes. Okay, maybe I can stop there and we cover that. Okay, maybe I can stop there and we'll have it over. Are your questions complex? Then let's take our speaker again and speak ten minutes quote before what it got like in before what about like in eight minutes
