My name is Ya Ming and I come from Shanghai Institute of Immunology and Infection. So today I will talk about something under infection. As we know, the settle skeleton systems composed of microtubules, acting filaments, and intermediate filaments. And they are responsible for different functions. For example, microtubles For example, microtubules are for cell division only, acting filaments for cell migration and cell mechanics, intermediate filaments for cell morphology and cell stress response. And we are more interested in the intermediate filaments, which are less investigated in the certain sketch field. This story, like just because the intermediate. Because the intermediate filaments have some special properties, it's the most tolerant and resilient network from the biochemical point of view. And my study just started from my postdoc when I was working in Bekalapannik's lab, which is also here. And we find the interaction between actin and the intermediate filaments. And after that, And after that, we just find that under some stress context, the intermediate filaments are more sensitive. For example, under hypo-osmotic shock, a few minutes, the intermediate filaments, which is in red, are disassembled and reassembled to maintain the architecture of the cell. And also, under the confinement migration, which Which in the most cases happened in vivo, we also see the intermediate filaments vamentin and the nuclear lamin are critical during this confinement migration. But we want to still looking for some more clinical pathogenic relevance. So we started to working on the infection models. So imagine when pathogen infects one cell. One pathogen infects one cell, it will be invasion, replication, and egress. And we have a few work on both sides. For example, we found the COVID particles can invade through the philopodia, which is more efficient. And on the transmission side, we see the cell surface vamentin can make the contact between the cells. But today, I would like to talk about the more. Today, I would like to talk about more about replication and this intermediate filament cage, what we find under the host cells. This work has been done by my postdoc, Sheng Shang, and she find during the salmonella invasion, after it enters the host cells, this bacteria will take advantage of the sassisomes, which normally only this size. Normally, only this size, but it will become to about 10 micrometers, almost as size as a nuclear. So, how this replication vacuum maintain as it is and doing the replication work? And nobody really works on that before. So, by using the immune fluorescence, you can see we tagged the bacteria with red. Tagged the bacteria with red, and we see the vermin intermediate filaments can gradually, after infection, surround these replication vacuums. And if we deplete the vamentin, we see these dispersive replication machineries, and this subsequently leads to less bacterial load and less cell deaths. And we were thinking the bacteria. And we were thinking the bacteria is complicated. It will release some toxic. And what kind of thing triggers this change? And we're doing this Co-IP and MASPAC combination things. And we find one effectors from the bacteria called SO-B, and which is important to trigger all these signalings. And if we generate a bacteria without these effectors, These effectors and these replication vacuums cannot be properly formed. And upon identify the components from the bacterial part, what's the host part, how this bacteria can transfer their signals to the host cells. We dissect the domains of this bacterial effector, and we find there is a CDC42. We find there is a CDC42 binding domain. And by the IP experiment, we find only the N-terminal of this cell B can interact and active CDC42 in the host cells and also recruit the CTC42. And further, we find CTC42 in the host cells is correlated with how the intermediate filaments cage formed. Page formed. And with that, we find host like newly machines which only appeared when pathogen affect the cells. And is this like kind of universal phenomenon? And we checked another viruses, which is Zika virus. It's like WHO only announced seven emergencies and Dika is one of it. Emergencies and Dika is one of it. And the reason is Dika virus is an RNA virus, similar to COVID. It replicates based on the ER, which is in the cytoplasm. And upon infection with Zika virus, we also see this surrounding of the intermediate filaments vermenting around this viral replication factories. And this just triggered after the RNA. After the RNA, the viral RNA started to replicate. And by the super-resolution imaging, we can see it is a cage to surround these replicating factories to help it escape some immune response from the cytoplasm. And without intermediate filaments, they still have less bacterial load. Less bacterial load. And during doing this work, we check the papers, and one paper just described these replication factories. And they also, by electrotomography, they see the filaments around here, but they didn't mention what it is. And we think we find the answer for this. It's like the intermediate filaments around these replication factories. And if it is a universal response, can we? Universal response: Can we find a way to against the functions? The first we find one of the reasons the intermediate filament is less investigated because it has no obvious phenotype and it's very specific, tissue-specific expression, which is good in the perspective of finding the anti-infection strategies. So, we did this screen. We did this screen based on the imaging and as using the intermediate filaments organization at the result. And we find several like clinical approved drugs which can disperse fermentin. And these drugs has because for the actin and the microtubules, there are a lot of drugs we can use to disrupt it. But for the intermediate filaments, so far there are less drugs. And we were thinking. Drugs, and we were thinking those molecules we find can be wonderful tools to manipulate intermediate filaments. And by using one of it, we checked the infection effects, and we find they are less infected by using these drugs against the Zika virus infection. And also, in the Samonella infection, these drugs can also disrupt the vacuum. Drugs can also disrupt the vacuums. And in the mouse model, it dramatically decreases the bacterial load in all those tissues. And we were imagining this mountain cage. It's like a semi-permeable cage. And next we were thinking, we still want to continue this. And we want to find what's the mechanics under this. And is there any other proteins or lipids or other organelles interact with this? organelles interact with this cage and both from the uh from the host cell perspective and from the settle from the pathogens perspective uh and we only in fact investigated two pathogens so far but actually we have done other pathogens we want to summarize what is the uh the university or the the university of this valentine compartment organization applied for and there are different And there are different replication compartments in the viruses and in the bacterios. And our guess is all the viruses replicate based on ER, all the bacterials replicate within the latest, our studies can apply to those. And we also published our opinions in the current opinion in cell biology. And following that, we were seeing. And following that, we were thinking that happens in the nature host cells. So what will be the response in the innate immunity cells? So we start to looking for what happened in the macrophages. And the macrophage, the most dominant function of macrophages, the phycocytosis of the pre years. And previous people had reported that there are like The people have reported that there are like phycocytotic calves, all those philopodias, and all those subcellular structures. For example, they either hook those bacterias and grab it back to the macrophages, or they function as a shovel to make the phytophytotic cup to grab those bacterials. And we are thinking: is there any other structures when Structures when the body encounters severe infections. And with these questions, we start to check the morphology of those macrophages. And we find that upon infection, different from the roundish of this bipolar of the typical macrophages, some of the macrophages they started to grow this dendritic pseudopodiars. Pseudopodius upon the infection. And we checked also with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterials. And we find it seems only gram-negative cell bacterias can trigger those pseudopodies. And also, this can be reversed when we withdraw those bacterias. And we were thinking, it already be seen. Like, already be seen or be investigated by others? Is it real or it just happened in the petri dish? Or what's the function of it and how it forms? With that, we checked with other macrophages and also with the primary macrophages, and it all forms this special pseudopodia. And also, we checked with stentratic cells, which is not. Dentratic cells, which is not looks similar, like the macrophages. We look, and we also checked with other cell types, and it's not. And we also challenged the macrophages with the cell debris, which not form those special succopodia. And we were thinking maybe it is true, and then we characterize those macrophages. Those macrophages with this pseudopodia. And also, to make it sure, we infect the mouse and using this two-photon microscope, doing this in privatal microscope, and we do see the macrophages are starting to elongate it and to make those branches and structures. And to differentiate from the previous structure, we compared those with the lamepodia and the philopodia. And it's more long and branching. It's like two or three folds than the cell body. And it has many branchings. And it is also important that for the philopodia, only a small amount of bacteria. Only a small amount of bacteria can already trigger it. But for this special pseudopodia, only massive infections can trigger. So indicating it's some strategies against severe infection. And also, we checked how it looks like first, it's like a tube, and it has a blonde end, and it also has some hopelocations to attach. And to see whether it is really a bacterial triggered, so we use this macrofluidics. You put the bacterium in top and the bacrophage in middle, which cannot go through. Only the bacteria can go up to form these dilutions. And with that, we were able to see please the videos shipping bo fan is this. This manella in the above, we can see those pseudopodias really grow towards it and indicating it has a direction. And it requires the contact. We're also using different pores of this indeed transferral assay. And with this larger pores, the bacteria can go inside, make the contact. With this, it cannot. And we only see this special pseudo-putter formed in this. This special suit performed in this contact case. So, indicating this special architecture can only happen with contact of the pathogens and also with the specific direction. And what is the function of it, which we find one we found one event showing this bacteria can indeed be captured and move along with this specific structure. Basic structure. And also notice that it's enrapped with the lysosome, which indicates its destination is go-to degradation, similar as the bacterials engulfed with the cell body. And also we checked with different macrophages and indeed can capture more bacteria. And how it formed, we checked. It formed, we checked the three cytoskeleton system within these structures, and we find they are both expressed there. And the F-actin is also stronger, and the intamir filaments also stronger. And by using all those drugs against actin, and we find only the up to three that cannot indicating all the filaments within this structure are acting bound. This structure are actin bundles, not branched actin. And further, we characterize how typo function actually and then we deplete the vamentine intermediate filaments and we see it can budding from the from here but cannot well be stable formed and uh uh And this and what is the trigger of those? We checked the bacterial part. We found this is a gram-negative specific LPS and gram-positive specific LTA. And we only find LPS can trigger this structure. And the LPS downstream is a tollac4 receptor. And we deplete the tollac4 receptor both with. The collapceptor both with the drugs or with the gene knockout, and which also deplete those structures. And we were thinking: if this bacteria LPS trigger the activation of TOR4, so what's the underlying mechanisms to really induce the cytoskeleton remodeling for this structure? And for that, we have did this challenging with LPS and isolate the cell, the macrophages, one cell per wheel. One cell per well, and we were we sorted and find the cell groups with more of those pseudopodials and with less. And by sorting of this, and we checked the characteristics of those cells, and we found that they are more like M1 macrophages, and they are abundant with actin and actin filament-related. Filament-related proteins. And the upstream of the acting assembling is all these GAFs, GAFs, and the low ATTPACs. So we go through all those GAFs and GAFs, and we find one specific called GAF3, which is only specifically expressed in macrophage and the macrogliers. And it's a JOA-specific GAF. And we found this. And we find this NF kappa B, which is downstream of 44, can really trigger the expression of this GAF3. And by silencing of this GAF3, these structures diminished and also the bacterial load diminished. And also if we deplete the rho A activity. And in the ether evalual model, if we transfuse those. if we transfuse these those cells with those we transfuse these bacterials with the specific zootopodia we can we can really make the make the bacterial load decreased and also those inflammatory factors pressure are slightly decreased so this story we just uh would like to uh introduce uh present we find a structure which is uh unique Which is unique. Maybe people already seen it, but never really exploited, and which we think is a strategy for the macrophages against the severe infections. And we also explored some other acting cytoskeleton systems within the macrophages, which concern the ECM degradation. And called Podosums. And this project started like four or five years ago when I talked to Sasha, when I really checked Sasha's paper and talked about the podosums and how the microtubules and mouse and two linked to regulate the formation of the podosums. So I'm thinking, what's the intermediate filaments function in there? And how it relates to the matrix degradation. Matrix degradation and with that, we first checked with the macrophage how it works under the ECM degradation. With PBMC and all the cell lines, we see this is the fluorescence fibronaptin. We see big black holes and the small shallow holes indicating the ECM degradation efficiency is distinct. And we correlated and we find it's like two groups. And we find it's like two groups, and we correlated this. We created this with actin structures here, because previously, if we study in the macrophages, we only see those podosums which release the MMT for the exam degradation. But if we increase the exposure time, we were able to see all those peripheral stress fibers, and we see those. And we see those with concrete photosums, their ECM degradation ability are much more higher than those dispersive photosums. And if you see the left image, it's always from the center and radiated to the cell periphery. And if you check with all those fibronic info sites, you can see they are doing the radiation. Sides, you can see they are doing the retrograde flow, and this velocity is similar like the acting retrograde flow. And then we checked with this double staining of fibronectin, one before point validation and one after it, so we can distinguish the inside and outside the fibronectin. And we confirm there are like inside the fibronectins which can which collocalize with the Which collocalize with the lysosomes and can delivered by these periphery stress fibers. And after that, we screened a little bit and we find the tropomycin 4, which specifically look like to the periphery stress fibers. And if we deplete knockdown tropomycin 4, all those fold size, female phone size are. Feel like info size are slowing down under the ECM degradation are less efficient. And after that, we see those with the structural emulation microscope. And the red one is acting, make the protoplasm core, and the green one is for the Haitians. And the purple one is intermediate filaments, which is all enriched also in those protosome clusters. And if we zoom in, and we find it's like also surrounded those individual protosums. And we also find if the varminting intermediate filaments network kind of dispersed, all those photosome are also dispersed. And we also exclude that violent knockout can really affect the individual architecture of those protosums, but seems only this dispersion of those protosums. And the ECM degradation happens when the protosomes release the MNP. So by using the biotinylation, we extract. The biotinylation, we extract the membranes and then we checked the MMPs also less in the case of mammal knockout, and which can be rescued. And we were thinking what's the underlying molecular mechanisms. So we did the RNA sequencing and we find one specific integrin called CD11B, which is a specific macrophage integrin. Integrating. And we find silencing this integrating also lead to the similar defects, both the MMP, also the proto-sam turnover time. And also, if we re-express the CD11B in the background of 110 knockout, it can also rescue its phenotype. And then we were thinking, And then we were thinking how it happened in the real cancer disease. So we use this lung cancer model and we checked with the database and we find in the more advanced stage there are more M2 macrophages. And we stained those patient tissues and we find the M2 macrophages, they display more concrete FAT staining. And if we knock out Vermontin and those blue ones indicating high efficient degradation macrophages, the proportion of them are decreased. Also can see in here. And then we started thinking if the ECM degradation correlated with Degradation correlated with cancer cell migration. So we use three models: the transval on co-culture, these lung cancer cells with macrophages. And using the transwill, we find the normal M2 macrophages can increase the invasion, but not the vampty knockout macrophages. And also, using the 3D equal culture, we also see they are more invasive with this M2, but not the Vampina COT. And also, And also, if we co-inject those cells in the cell, we can also see the same similar phenotype. And to summarize this, we find the special strategy for macrophages to degrade ECM, which can be applied to the cancer cell migration. And if we look back at the study on the intermediate filaments, the 65 years since identify, for example, vamentin, there is no research on dysfunction in infections. There are like cancers or in the organic organizations or migrations, but not in the infection. So we think in our lab, we will devote it to review how vamentin function under the infection. Under the infection this I want to deliver is we are studying the most resilient network by mentee, but we are also trying to learn from it this tolerant property. And with that, I would like to thank you all.
