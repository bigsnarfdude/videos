Thank you. I'd like to thank your organizers first because I'm really enjoying everything. The conference, the location, the food, everything is wonderful. Then I have a technical issue because I was expecting this to be bigger. So I don't know if you can, because if you can read it as it is, that would be better because I don't know, like this one. I don't know, like this was a slide. Is it readable? Because I came to this, but then you see only a small part. That's better. But you can see some more. Okay, so I scored more. Okay. You can ask me to go back if needed. Or if I go too quick. Okay, so the title has exploring it because uh it's I It's an attempt to understand the KSDA modular space of surfaces in some special case where it should be feasible, at least in part. I think the moral is with Ghana, maybe was a bit pessimistic, said we know nothing. We know little. We've been working a lot, but we still know little. And since the general set up General setup, and also even some has been recalled in Julie's talk, and also Jean-Fran√ßois' talk, and even part of the results have been stated already, so I decided to concentrate more on the methods and just try to give you an idea of how we did the little we did. So this is an overview of joint works with several people, so I've listed everybody here. Listed everybody here so you know what letters they refer to: Stephen Kaflans, Manco Franchozzi, Giuliana, and Zenke Orlanske, in different combinations so I get them right. And as the warning, we work oversea and we always assume everything is projected. Okay, so you have already learned by now what we mean by a nice surface. This is a surface of journal. A surface of general type, possibly with canonical singularities, ample canonical class k squared equals one and chi of the structure sheet equals three. And due to another inequality, sorry, I didn't need to do that, you this is maybe it's a compromise. I just shrink it a bit. This is equivalent. It's a bit. This is equivalent to geometric genus being equal to 2 and Q equals 0. And somebody asked about the name. I'm not really sure. I think I learned it in some lecture notes by Greece, but it's a convenient name, short, also just stuck. And so as you already know. I mean, I can comment on the name. I mean, so pages for Horikawa and H is for Horikawa and I is supposed to be slightly easier than H. That's the way. At least Ahorikawa surfaces also. I'm not so sure this is a good but anyway, very pleasant. Because usually Arikawa surfaces around the two network lines. Yeah, yeah, but yeah. One slide. Okay, so the point is that I'll explain this pattern later, but in this case we have a But in this case we have a very good description of what the Kizagen modular space is. So you know it seems reasonable to try to understand the boundary, let's call it. Although as you know there may be entire components that do not belong to everyone tree. And why why this Why these invariants? As a person who has dealt with surfaces most of my life, this is very practical because k squared is the smallest possible. And then PG is the biggest possible for k squared equals 1. So you are one of the network lines. And usually these are the surfaces that are user easy easy to classify, easy to describe. The more you get the more the ratio of k squared over chi increases. K squared over chi increases the heart rate is. And there's maybe Radu can comment on this too. There's been an interest on discuss of surfaces by him in green briefings, laser robots. As far as I understand, I'm not very good at object theory, but they are trying to find that cognitive, I think, with normal crossing boundary where the period map Where the period map extends. And so this has been like a testing ground for some of the results. And another thing I didn't write in the slides, I think you can think of these circles as an analog of curves of genus 2. They arise as exception to variationality of the some pre-canonical map of threefolds. Like the bicanonical map. The bicanonical map of a surface of general type is birational, unless you have a few finite exceptions or there is a genus to vibration. And this is something similar, I think, has been proven for threefolds. You have birationality, I don't remember which canonical map, unless you have a fabrication in high surfaces. So I don't know. These surfaces tend to appear in different places. And our point of view consists, it's very hands-on. We try to construct examples that lie on the boundary, stable i surfaces, and then we try to place them inside the moduli space, so decide whether they are movable or not, essentially. So, first of all, let me recall okay, this is Okay, this is this is the I did something stupid with the title. Forget about the title. I'm gonna erase it because I chance to talk because so much of it had already been explained. Okay, so what I actually wanted to say is how you do this, how you construct examples of stable search. Construct examples of stable surfaces. It depends whether they are normal or not. If you want to construct a normal one, you may start with a smooth surface, some configuration of curves that you can contract to an SLC singularity, blow down, and this gives you a normal surface with the right kind of singularities. Then you have to make sure that this is what you have to say. That this is what you have to have started is a stable surface. So you have to make to check that Kx example. Basically, you look at the pullback of KX or X tilde, and then you have to show that it is NAF, and the only curves with zero intersection are those that get contracted in this map. And this is what Julie's delightful example. Julie's delightful example is, for instance. She gave us an instance of this, and I'll give another one later. For the non-normal surfaces, the construction is a bit different. Jean-Fein recalls somehow part of it. So you remember that for normal stable surfaces, you could imagine one similarities are just... Because I mentioned one similarities are just x-ray equals zero, double crossing points. So there are more abstract ways of defining this. So you have X and you have a divisor inside that we call the double locus. Actually, it's defined by the conductor, but basically you take the double crossing locus and take the closure. That's what it is. Then if you consider the normalization, this double This double locus opens. So you get the inverse image, which is also defined by the conductor inside X bar, and it has a 2 to 1 map to D. So every time you have a normal steel surface, you have a a diagonalised piece. You would like to say there is a n so this is a normalization and this is to do one. And this is to do order. One would like to say that there is an evolution associated with this map. This is not always true. It is true when the bar is smooth. But certainly you have an evolution of the normalization. And this evolution preserves something that's called the different. Don't worry too much about this. This is a Q-device, a fatty Q-device on the barn new, and basically it's a correction. And basically, it's a correction term so that you have the adjunction formula work. And this evolution presents the difference. And then I've written down the relation between the canonical class of x pulls back to kx bar plus d bar. So this has to be ample since we are on a stable surface. And I made a mistake here because the fact that X has the SLC singularities is reflected by the fact that this is an L C pair. And the interesting thing from my point of view, our point of view, is that you can go back. So you can start with a triple where you have x bar, d bar is an L C pair. bar is an L C pair with kx bar plus the bar ample, tau an involution of the bar of the normalization of the bar that preserves the difference and you can glue to obtain a stable surface and this is a theorem by Polar. So I'm going to give you two examples of this doing construction that doing construction then I mean they will it will be clear later why I chose this and they are not very intuitive. So the first one you start with P2 you take a general line L1 and the quintic general quintic so it meets the line at five points and I do the same twice doesn't have to be the same quintic Doesn't have to be the same printing. But what I'm asking for is that it is possible to map this line to this line and the PI in such a way that the PIs go to the QIs. And then I take as a L C pair, this joint union of this. Oh sorry, I didn't say the most important thing. I'm not going to do this, but I'm going to take out it. This, but I'm going to take double covers. Double covers, these are double covers of the plane branched over a sextic. So basically, they are K3s. They are singularities occurring at these points. These are mild singularities, just A1 points. So nothing too bad happens. And so as a log canonical error, I will take these two These two K3s as a divisor, maybe I shouldn't run this. Try to name it. So oh no, no, no, forget it. I was mixing up. So the uh the divisor is the pullback of the two lines and we have uh and we have a nice mortisable. We have a nice mortis of the two lines so that the points match, and this means that I have an involution preserving the difference. In this case, the difference is one half the sum of the points. So, I can perform construction and I get a stable surface. I'm not going to show you why, but this is an a nice surface. K square equals one, p g equals two, q equals zero. g equals 2, q equals 0. So we call this without much imagination, we call it K3 plus K3 K3 plus K3 example. And this is not Gaurisin, but the index is 2, Kaxis 2 Karti. And that's a strange feature because we have a panzi of canonical curve. But in fact it is a passive concentrated A fact concentrated here. You have all all the material curves are nor non-reduced and have a support double logus. And the second example is a bit in the same vein. So here I started with an ambiguous surface with an elliptic vibration and the minus and the bisection. And bisection is easily seen to be a minus two term. And you know that every elliptic fibrillation on the request surface has two double fibers. So I fixed one of the double fibers. This is, I wrote double fiber, but what I really want is what we call half fiber to the support of double fiber. And if I can so the minus two curve means the F fiber at one point I can I contract the minus two curve and I get again a mildly singular surface. This P1 is the This P1 is the image of the minus 2 saturation. Again, it's an A1 point. And I do something similar now, but starting with a K3. So again, an elliptic K3 and with a section, in this case, not a bisection. Again, this is a minus 2 query, which I can contract. And in this, you know, the In this you know, the the lynching fibers are very moduli. So I pick one that is isomorphic to my L C fiber so that I can match them. And again I take as the L C pair, the disjoint union of this singular surface with this singular surface, and as boundary, I take the double fiber here. Take the double fiber here and the other fiber as I want it to hit here. And maybe why do I bother to contract these surfaces? Because basically I want Kx bar plus d bar ample. So I cannot use a fiber. Here the canonical class is trivial. trivial. So I make my curve sample by contracting the A1, D minus two curves. So the difference in this case is this should be P2 I think, but anyway it's one half the singular point. So again I can perform a Roland's construction. Again I get the surface with this one I get the surface with a square equal 1, g equals 2, q equals 0, kx to 3, as before, the not very original name of a request pass state for this example. You can look at the canonical curves here. So it's not so on this side, I have the ambiguous. So I told you there are two double fibers, so they can. Fibers. So the chemical system casts on this part the other fibers, the one that then blue. So this is fixed. But it is a pencil, and it is a pencil because here I can take any elliptic fiber, so this works. Okay, so this is how you construct Stable surfaces in general. So let me recall quickly. Yes? What would happen if you were to load two enrichments? I think you get different chi because there is a very easy formula for chi. Chi of the two s sum of chi of the two surfaces minus of chi of the s uh surface in the middle. So it will give you chi equals two. Give you k equals to but these are arranged so that I get I surfaces. What's the formula for k square again? K square, you just take kx of the normal surface plus the boundary and square root. And it's not hard to see that in both examples on each piece you have one f. So that adds up to one. Wh uh w where does it actually to be cartiers? In both cases, there are A1 points on the double locus and that's where the face be currently. I don't remember exactly which singularity it is important in class Schaffer Baron's reason. class Schaffer Baron's list must be as it to Porto I don't remember maybe possibly even a situator double dressing I'm not sure so as I said these classicalized surfaces are sort of easy to describe you you have a good You have a good bitanical model. You look at the bitanomical map, it goes to P3, and the image is a quadratic cone, and it's just a double cover branched over the vertex and the section with a quintic. And you don't want a quintic to go through the vertex. And in order to have a classicalized surface, the branch lock was The branch locus has to be either smooth or at most AD singularities. And you can easily compute the number of parameters on which the contraction depends and you will find out that it's 28. And here you start to see why it's not so easy to describe all the compactification because of the dimension is large. And somehow this. And somehow, this is why I said that these are an analog of the genus II curves, because genus II curves are the only curves such that the back anonymical map is to do one. And one interesting thing, because I told you, one of the steps we have to do with describing this modular space is to decide whether, I mean, To decide whether an example that we constructed is multiple or not. And all these surfaces have this pythonic involution. So if you specialize, this persists in the limit. So if you can show that the surface you construct does not admit this involution, then it means it's not smoothable. And it turned out that in all our experiments, this was really this. This was really this is just a necessary condition, but in fact uh it was also sufficient, just in the cases we consider. Okay so I think I changed this uh and and made a little mess, but what uh I said that if you have only AD singularities, you could get a classical I surface. Of course you can allow B to have worse singularities, but as long as the pair given by the cone and one half the pair chloroplast is L C then basically by the orthos form. Basically, by the Urdis formula, you still get an SL stable surface. And if B doesn't go through the vertex, it will be Doristin, because it's smooth above the vertex, and then it's a haggard surface elsewhere. And so, this is a first kind of degeneration you can consider. In practice, besides ADE singularities, AD singularities. The singularities you can impose are elliptic singularities of the green one or two. This corresponds to a quadruple point on the branch logice or so-called 33 point, a triple point that when you blow it up, you get again a triple point. And the nice thing, which is this theorem of 2017, is that 17 is that in this way you obtain all the Barnes in I services. So we have enlarged a bit our knowledge of this space. And already with this very simple-minded construction, I described the elliptic singularities at the isolated lines. You can also have double curves. So you get many different examples. Examples. When B is reducible, you have a normal surface. As I said, you have either simple elliptic singularities or casps. When B is not reduced, you have a non-normal surface. And the possible normalizations are the project plane, you want the path, or if you want one over an elliptic curve. And now I copy the table. You can stratify. You can strategize if I can fit all it here too small? I don't know, but anyway I like the gra we you have the open set of classical ones and then this is the way you can specialize uh to different type of singular surfaces. So Of singular surfaces. So the ones they start with, I think it's an N, this is the archiving characters loved by Zerke. All these N at the normal ones, so for instance, N2 is normal with an elliptic singularities of DB2 and N12 is normal with an elliptic singularity of db1 and 2. There's another and here you can see what the And here you can see what the minimum resolution is. And there is a nice pair of lines here where you have the same singularities, but the resolution can be either rational or irregular. So it's sort of subtle. And then you have the non-normal ones. So these are the ones with normalization is del petro, projectic plane. Projectic plane and elliptic areas related not to read this NA. And this diagram shows you how you can specialize from one type to the other. And I think this reflects something that Green Griffiths and some RASA and Robles have done. They studied how the mixed latch structure should degenerate Structure should degenerate when you go to the boundary. And it turned out that this stratification we did basically matched theirs. The only difference is that we did not distinguish between um simple elliptic and cusp, while it it's different from the oxygenatic point of view, so they did that. They did that. So now everyone would like to see more of these eye surfaces. And the first thing you can think of doing is I said I didn't want B to go through the vertex. Now I allow B to go through the vertex. This way I get two Gauristin surface. And in general, this will be the surface. Be the singularity at the vertex would be a point of time one-fourth one. And since when you put the vertex in second-dimensional condition, this gives me a divisor in the practication. And of course, it is in the closure of the main component. But this is not the only thing you can do. You can also take the cone and degenerate it to a couple. And degenerate it to a couple of pair of plates in P3. And you see, if you still remember the K3 plus K3A example, it naturally arises this way. So it is possible. Let's say, okay, the defect somehow of these degenerations is that they occur. Is that they occur in hyperdimension? This I wrote here, I hope it's called as sweat on the highlight. The formulas that you wrote before work also on Q divisors, so you change it because they have Korean. So the formulas that you wrote for the defect, and you use the canonical because it's Korean? No, the formula kx bar plus d bar is always the putback of kx. Okay. But here, I don't know if you what I'm not sure what the question you study. Here it's just a small computation near the vertex. If you ramify on a curve going through the vertex, you get this type of singularity. You can make it on F two instead of the on uh instead of the bone and you see what happens. What I wanted to, what I did not point out is you see look at the dimensions in this column. The biggest, we have a 28 dimensional modular space and the biggest dimension is of this right is 20. So we get only very small two dimensions of variety. And one would like, you know, it seems more natural to try to to see what Natural to target to see what the divisors in decompact verification are. So, this is not a good way of adding divisors. The first divisor we need is this one. Just let people through their teams. And a way of constructing devices has been analyzed by Gagliato, Kirsty, Luca, and Jean-Christian. Person look at Jang, and what they do, they make me just worse. I think may I call it one step worse than SLC. So they don't have an SLC surface, then you can perform semi-stable reduction. And this way they analyze a list of eight similarities that were classified by Arnold, and for each of them, they describe. And for each of them they described uh uh a device uh corresponding to this. But I think Louca will explain this in detail later. But that's a very nice way of finding divisors. I just got a question about that K3 plus K3 smoothing. Is there a like a genus II Lefschitz vibration that that smoothing is compatible with? Uh the the genus II vibration is the Genus 2 vibration is given by the canonical system. Yeah, so this that it is compatible with that that genus 2 vibration. I'm asking just because I'm wondering if... I'm not sure. Because as I said, what happens is that the canonical system in this example is all concentrated on the double logus. So but those K3s have a have a But those K3s have a have a have a genus 2, Legends vibration. That's a double line. I guess the reason I'm asking is just wondering. That's probably the bicanonical. Because what you do is you take the double cover. So the double locus up upstairs is affiliate. So if you want if you want the a line is tw is the bitanical system. The bicanonical system. And then, of course, in the bicanonical system, I think, you know, here the bicanonical system is a plate section. This is a bicanonical map, so it would be a plate section, a double cover of a plate section of this surface here. Another question: Are the divisors in the Hodge theoretic interior or are they at the Hodge theoretic boundary? Which device are you? So they're in the hot shore and in pure because they have pure limited structure. So not so bad. Yeah, okay. So the other possible approach to define divisors, you've heard a lot about this already, is to look at surfaces with one single quotient singularity of a certain type. Singularity of a certain type, these so-called desingularities. Desingularities are either, by definition, either rational double points when you consider that they're smooth, so we don't pay much attention, or they are secret quotient singularities of this type. They are called wall when D is equal to one, and the first example is one for one one, and we have already seen that we can produce a device locally. Produce a device that would deal with this singularity. And this also has been reported a couple of times already. There is no local obstruction to keep RSI smoothing for this surface, for these singularities. So they are good candidates for singularities on a limit of smooth ice surfaces. And just to give some meaning to these numbers, the number Numbers, the number M is the Cartier index, so as you can see here, this is an index to singularity, and D is the dimension of the Q Garrett's deformations. So for D equal 1, you have only one direction in which you can smooth. So it is better. And I Julia's analyzed analyze very detailed way I think the case of numerical quintics with were is worthwhile with one s dissing clarities. So we tried to see what we could say about iSurface is one of these singularities with the idea of looking for divisors and Julie joined our team and And this table basically summarizes the result. There are essentially three possibilities. Essentially, because the first line is more than one, but the high Dimension one is only one. And these three possibilities all occur and in fact we are able to describe them Are able to describe them completely. And I don't know how much time I've left if I really want to show you this or not. Maybe I'll go back to even the end. Just wanted to give you an idea of how you go about proving a classification like this. So the first step is to try to find what are the possibilities. Find what are the possible dissingularities on your surface. And a very big help comes from this paper of Julie Wich and Carlos, where they have general bounds for the type of dissingularities in terms of a square. But this is, you know, as it happens in surface theory very often, sort of clears the field a lot. But you still have to do with some exceptions, and you have to do that by hand. Exceptions, and you have to do that by hand. And then, once you have identified the possibilities, then you have to go about constructing them and see what happens. And as I said, maybe I'll skip this for once for the moment. I wanted to show you how you exclude some of the possibilities that are left, like one. Left, like one, just remember that somehow one would expect 192 to occur and it doesn't. And the reason why I'm going to skip it because there are lots of details. But my point in writing down this computation was to say this was just very old-fashioned classical algebraic surfaces theory. So this is more fashionable, let's say, but in the end, you. Say, but in the end, you use a lot of the classical stuff. So, assume that we believe that we have restricted all these possibilities. For m equals 2, we have exactly the examples I've described before, double covers of the bone going with where B goes through the vertex. And M equals three I'm not going to describe because it's similar to M equals four. It's similar to M equals 4 and 5. And this is an example that you can find in Julie's Murzua's paper. So as I said, we don't have imagination. So this is the answer surface. And in principle, what do you want to do? You want to find a surface y tilde with a configuration that That you can contract, and that gives you the required singularity. So there are algorithms, it's just you look at the continuous fraction to decide what the exact real divisor of this singularity is in the minimal resolution. And it's the one I'm drawn here. It's a string of P1s. They are all string of P1s. You need to know these are the self-intersections of the Of the different pink ones. And also, there are ways of knowing what the y data should be. Thanks to the fact that k squared is one, we know that all the resolutions of the non-classical surfaces are not of general type. But since this is a rational singularity, PG and Q don't change, so this has to be properly linked. So this has to be properly lifted because it can only compensate. And you can also tell how many blow-ups there are between this y tilde and its minimal model, which is 2 in this case. And so you have to find a surface, a minimal elliptic surface with pg equals to blow up in such a way that you produce a string like this. string like this and then contract down the string and that's how you do it it's not so it's not so hard you start with a this is I want with a nodal fiber blow up the singular points point and then this will produce something like this and then you blow up one of these two points and you get this configuration so you have the I didn't say it but you have to stay I didn't say it, but you have to start with the surface that already has a minus three curve as a section. Then the strict transform of this is this has been blown up once at the node and once again, so this is minus five curve. And then I take the strict transform of the first blow-up, and this is the minus two curve. And this gives you your example. Of course, you have to show that it's. To show that it's actually a stable surface, check that the canonical classes are there. But you can do the same game, also with a cascader term. What's the difference? The difference is that once you blow up this for the first time, you get something like this. And so there's no choice. The only possible blow-up is here. This is a more canonical construction. And what we can so let me think what I want to say first. Okay, so we sort of made this more systematic. You had mainly the example. And we basically constructed all the elliptic surfaces with the given invariant and the minuster curve as a section, a bit in the spirit of what Alini was doing yesterday. Was with me yesterday, and we could show that the construction depends on 28 parameters. And you may remember that 28 was the dimension of our modulus space. So this tells us that the general such surface cannot be smoothable. And if you look at the condition for the involution, you can see that the involution you cannot have the involution in this case. So In this case, so the surfaces arising from my nodal singular fiber certainly cannot be smoothed. Here, as I said before, just because after the first blow up you have the possibility for growing up and you choose one. But in the other case you have only one possibility and you have the involution. You have the involution. So, this led us to conjecture that this should be smooth. And I think I have a statement here of what I already told you. Maybe the only new thing is that for each type you get an irreducible family and you get divisor for 1 fourth, 1.1, 111 over 18, 1.5. And a whole component for the index 5. I think this picture is a good summary. Sorry. And the dotted line means that we conjecture that these two main component meets this extra component in the surfaces of the from the cascadal singular curve. Can I make one more question? Can I make one more comment? Yes, please. We had this, I mean, there was this philosophy that the wall singularities with d equal to 1, they should give an advisor. But in our case, I mean, they both failed somehow the expectation because one is just one too big, the one over 25 and the 1 over 18 one has d equal to 2. But should, I mean, it's expected to appear in correlation. That's why I chose. That's why I chose the one ninth over one two because one over eighteen it in principle it I mean locally it's a specialization of one over nine one two and but so it should you expect one over nine one two which doesn't happen and you would expect this one in co-dimension two but in fact the first one doesn't happen and this arises in co-dimension dimension one instead of two and this also should be co-dimensional And this also should be contamination one, but in fact it's a component. The map to the local information is not such. We didn't compute that. So is that there may be another component with the one over 912 that meets that? Okay. I'll get to that. I have another feature. So is the index one covering this in case you uh die or uh Index one colour should be it's a rational double point for all these singularities. You have one over M square the group that is of order M square D and you divide by the subgroup of order M D and gives you a M to one map of some rational A as a product. AS product to your CPI. So yes, what I want to do just to connect a bit to what I said at the beginning, once you constructed the surfaces, you have to decide whether they are smoothable or not. In this case, it was easy. We have the evolution and also with the The evolution and also the dimension wasn't correct. In the picture, you can see that these are smoothable. They are in the boundary of M13. And in this case, it's not so hard to show it. You can compute the canonical ring of the surface. You see, it's a You see, it's a complete intersection in a weighted gentle space, and it's not hard to produce a smoothing. Which is this family here. And you see for t different from zero, you can solve for u. So basically, u was the variable. So basically, you are in p1125. And I didn't say this, but the double cover of. This, but the double cover of the colour branched over a quinty, you can you can write it as a hypersurface p1125. So you get a smooth eye surface and for t10 you get back these equations. We have to deal with much more complicated cases, but the philosophy underlying the way we show sorting SL is very concrete. And so? And so we have one more new member in our team, which is Stephen Kafla. We did a more detailed study of this part of the moduli space. And first of all, this was a dotted line in the previous picture. So now we are we sho we have shown smooth ability for uh the caspidal. The caspidal final to a surfaces, and that's a very complicated computation. I can say it because I would never be able to do it. And basically you have a general presentation for the canonical ring of these surfaces, and there's one parameter that tells you whether this, when it is zero, you get caspa when it's different. Caspia, when it's different from zero, it's nodal. And when you set that equal to zero, you can transform the equations in different formats that show that it can be smooth. When you say caspa and nodal, I'm referring to this picture where I constructed the surface from a nodal or a caspital singular fiber of the elliptic vibration. Yeah, and as you can see, we tried also to understand a bit co-dimensional too. So how this trend means so you see, for instance, in this corner, it means that you have a dimension to family where this singularity and this singularity appear at the same time and they are specialization. Same time, and they are a specialization of this and of this. And for instance, we show that this cannot happen with this combination of two singularities. I read it from the picture. Interestingly, this 1915 is the same as 1912 and it can be written both ways. This singularity that I said should happen, but it didn't. You can find it on You can find it on this component. When you specialize and go towards the main component, this also specializes to this one. I need some explanation of what happens, but at least. So I think I'm good with the time. I'm going to say just very quickly what is our last idea. What is our last, I think, next step? Because we spent a long time studying these surfaces, and as you can see, the picture is completely partial. We don't know what else is out there. Anything could be. One of the main issues is having some bounds for the index. There is a bound by Alexeyev, but it's, I don't know, 1600 something. So I So, I don't know, we thought about possible ways of getting better bounds, but we didn't get anything. So, this is a bit in the spirit of the generation I showed you at the beginning with Dorenstein. We are looking at two Dorenstein. And the reason why I would like just to say this, even if briefly, is that the point of view, the approach is a bit different. I wrote work in progress, I think, all. Work in progress. I think we believe all the math is there, but we haven't been able to write everything down in complete detail, so I'll leave it with quotation marks. But the claim is that the two barystenized surfaces with reduced canonical surf curve general you remember that K3 plus K3 at Plus K3 at all the canonical curves reduced. If the canonical curve is reduced, you have basically two possibilities: double cover of the cone, which we are already expatting, and the Eritreans plus K3 example. And in both cases, the surface is smoothable. For the double cover, it's obvious, and this again can be proved by Again, can be proved by computations with the canonical ring. And what we do is we take a general canonical curve. This is a curve of genus 2. And since 2K is Cartier, adjunction works. So Kc is just the restriction of 2Kx. So it's going since uh Gerb of genus 2. And basically you have two types. Basically you have two types. You look at the canonical methods. The canonical map is not base points. It's 2 to 1 to P1, like for the smooth case. And you get pictures like this. Either smooth or some kind of singularities. It can even be reducible, but the point is that this was only one. And the second one, what we call The what we call type B. The canonical system has a base point here. So you have to look at the bank canonical system, and this goes through a pair of lines. If you want to, you can look at the bicanonical system in both cases. Type A, the image is a smooth conic, and in type B, it's a pair of lines. And what we do? We take the canonical Plus, the one shift of the surface we restrict, and this is not an invertible shift in general, but it's somehow an analog of a characteristic, something that twice, whatever that means, is the canonical ring. So you can compute the analog of a half-canonical ring. Using this multiplication map, and once you've computed that, this is classical, I think I've seen it used by Males Reed a lot. Once you know the canonical ring of the canonical curve, it's not hard to lift it to get the canonical ring of the surface. Type A will give you the double cover of the corner, and type B, you see it's the reducible. Be you see, it's the reducible character, but it corresponds to 83 plus or 50. Okay, I think I've told you more than I should have. Okay, well if there are no questions, let's take the speaker again. I have to make it all the way.
