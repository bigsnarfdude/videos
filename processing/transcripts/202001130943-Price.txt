Probably half a dozen or so who are working under DOE projects, and I thought it would be worth maybe providing a sort of high-level view of what some of these projects are, what some of the progress and challenges that we're involved with, and I'm assuming that a lot of the things I'm going to talk about are things that other people are working on and are also dealing with challenges. Dealing with challenges and problems. So, some very high-level background on DOE's interest in earth system modeling. Prior to about 2013, we were largely partnered up with NCAR working on the community earth system model, and all of our climate model development, including ice sheets, was sort of fell under that funding umbrella. After 2013, that funding was sort of pulled back. Sort of pulled back to DOE. The programs that fund climate work are under Biological Environmental Research, BER, and Advanced Scientific Computing Research, OSCER. So you might see those acronyms pop up, and I know people aren't necessarily familiar with them. But anyway, the money was sort of pulled back, refocused, and redistributed with the idea that we were going to build our own Earth system model, which is Model, which is called the energy exascale or system model. The exascale is sort of an aspirational towards next generation high-performance computing. We're in phase two of the project. There are three-year phases of the project. There's many, many DOE laboratory staff, postdocs working on this project, and there's a number of universities involved as well. And there's more and more universities over time as. Universities over time as the DOE funding is going out to universities. Phase one was basically where we developed the first version of the model, and phase two is sort of, it's just a chunk of time, three-year increments, basically. And there's a review and a reproposal at the end of each funding increment. Yeah. And all the Landecis models. And all the land ice modeling work sort of falls under this broad umbrella. The land ice modeling is considered an ecosystem effort, meaning at some point these land ice models are supposed to find their way into the Earth system model and be used there. So these are just some of the broad goals that DOE has for its climate modeling effort, which sort of were meant to differentiate it from. Were meant to differentiate it from existing U.S. efforts and sort of motivated breaking off and starting their own effort. There's, of course, a big interest at the sort of government level of looking at impacts on infrastructure, energy infrastructure, national security issues. DOE has a lot invested in high-performance computing, and we're supposed to be able to take advantage of those resources, particularly trying to push the limit on high-performance computing. The limit on high-resolution simulations. Also, we'll get back to this later, but there's a lot of changes coming along with high-performance computing architectures, and we're part of our mandate is to sort of try to be out in front and on the cutting edge of trying to figure out how to use these new architectures. There's roughly three science-focus areas. The only one we'll really spend much time on here is down in the cryosphere, but just to give you a broader picture. But just to give you a broader picture, looking at precipitation extremes and impacts of precipitation extremes, trying to get a better feeling for how biogeochemical processes impact the carbon cycle. And then the one we're most interested is in sea level from the Antarctic ice sheet. And these weren't just sort of pulled out of the blue. These all have sort of look back to Look back to DOE strengths in other areas. DOE has had a strength in high-latitude climate modeling for a long time, so that's part of the reason why that's one of the science-focused questions. I think a lot of people know this by now, but most Earth system models treat ice sheets sort of in this fashion, where there's a wall here where they meet the ocean. More and more Earth system models are now. More Earth system models are now trying to incorporate ocean circulation under ice shelves and ice tongues. So, right now, E3SM has this capability in it in fully coupled global simulations. We're not yet doing dynamic ice sheets. So, right now, the ice sheet is still static, but we can actually at least circulate the ocean under there and exchange heat and freshwater fluxes. And the goal. And the goal, of course, is in the long run that we can do coupled dynamic ice sheets as well. This is just sort of breaking down that sea level rise question into a few smaller bite-sized chunks that we can work on in the short term. These are sort of things we're working on now in the Earth system model that we can look at with this new capability. Can look at with this new capability of having ice ocean circulation involved. The main one that I think we're concerned with here is looking at what factors having to do with ice-ocean coupling control melt rates underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. And the other way you can sort of think about this question from the perspective of somebody interested in ice sheet modeling is where. In ice sheet modeling, is where we're spending a lot of our effort on the Earth system model side under this cryosphere effort, trying to figure out how to get realistic melt rates in an Earth system model so that when the ice sheet models are actually coupled, we're forcing them with some realistic forcing and they're doing something sensible. And this is just to give you some idea of how we're doing there. These are some low-resolution. These are some low-resolution simulations. This is about a 160-year timeframe here. So these are melt rates integrated for all of West Antarctica Peninsula, East Antarctica, and all of the Antarctic ice sheet here. The green and blue are estimates from the Rigno et al. data set. So they're not tied to any particular time. They're just here as a reference to sort of see how we're doing. To sort of see how we're doing on the vertical axis of the plot. And the red and black are two different simulations, and you can see the black, we more or less, if we just look at all the whole Antarctica integrated melt flux, we're doing relatively well. This other simulation is one where, for reasons I won't get into but we can discuss later, the melt rates underneath Filshirani go off the rails and increase by many orders. And increase by many orders of magnitude, and we have this instability that other people have seen in their simulations before. And you can just see that one ice shelf basically, when that simulation goes crazy, the melt rates for all of Antarctica are off by about a factor of two. So, Steve, these are global simulations. Yeah. And these are fully coupled, right? The ones that you're showing? Those were data atmosphere, but you're Data atmosphere, but it doesn't matter too much. We have a similar thing in fully coupled simulations as well. Steve, when you say low resolution, what's the resolution? What are you hoping to do? So the low resolution would be about standard kind of IPCC class models, one degree. The ocean varies between 60 and 30 kilometer resolution. What we are hoping to go to in the next phase of the project is something more like 10 or 5. More like 10 or 5 kilometers around Antarctica. And we have some high-resolution simulations. We have done some already. And with some caveats, higher resolution, you definitely do better at getting melt rates right in the right places. So, a little bit on the ice sheet modeling effort. I don't know what happened before 2006. Around 2006, there was some very little bit of money put into the CESM effort under this SIDAC project. So a little digression. SIDAC is a project, this stands for Scientific Discovery Through Advanced Computing. Some people here are funded under this funding source. And that's a combination of VER and OSCQR funding. And the idea is you take domains. idea is you take domain science people over here and you pair them with numerical computational science people like Moro and Irina and Omar and you stick them together and you do great science with high performance computers. Okay so there was a little bit of funding thrown at this early on around 2009, 2010 and since then we've 2010, and since then, we've had really very good support from DOE for ice sheet model development. There was an initial project that funded a lot of sort of pilot projects at a number of universities. Some people in this room were funded under those efforts at various stages. From 2012 to 2017, we had a larger five-year project funded where we were developing roughly four-ish models. Out of that, two models sort of served. Out of that, two models sort of survived, and there's an ongoing project right now that's focused on additional model development, but also more focused on coupling those models to the Earth System model. Are you keeping time on me? Because I was keeping time, but I realized I only started it a minute ago. So yank me off if I. This is how much? Ten. I have ten. I've had ten already? Oh boy. Okay. Already? Oh boy. Okay. Okay, so these are things we're focusing on. I think a lot of people will recognize these, and I won't spend too much time going through it now because we'll visit it again. I guess I want to mention that we have two fairly mature models right now. I think a lot of people in here are familiar with the bicycles model, maybe less so with the MOLI model, that's a collaboration between the Los Alamos and Sandia crowd. And these pictures are just to give you some idea that we have. Are just to give you some idea that we have mature ice sheet models that can do big, you know, impressive-looking simulations. So these are again some of the things we're focusing on. I won't touch on all of them, but I just want to go through, maybe spend a little time picking apart some of the reasons for focusing on those things and where we're having where we have challenges and questions going forward. I think everybody understands. I think everybody understands the importance of subglacial hydrology, so I don't need to go into that too much on the ice dynamics side. Maybe people think a little bit less about why this is important for the Earth system model crowd. If you have subglacial hydrology in your ice sheet model and that ice sheet model is in a climate model, you can do a much better job of specifying where, when, how much. Water is being put into the oceans. We could talk about this more later, but if people in this room knew what was happening in climate models and the way they put precipitation, freshwater from the ice sheets into the oceans, they would be pretty appalled. So there's lots of ways we can improve on that simply by improving the physics in ice sheet models. And another place, we focus a lot on ice-ocean interactions. Focus a lot on ice-ocean interactions, and that subglacial meltwater coming out from under the ice sheet has big impacts there as well. Some things that are challenging to think about. I'm glad Ian mentioned sliding. I don't mention it at all because it's something that's sort of implicit. We've been talking about sliding laws for 50 years, and I don't think we've sorted that out yet. Sorted that out yet. But we do know that one thing that's critical in glacial sliding is the effective pressure, and that's something we want to get out of these. That's the main thing on the ice dynamic side we want to get out of these sliding laws. I think there's still some questions around channels in terms of do we really need to resolve channels? That makes it a lot more computationally complex, especially if you're talking about large-scale issues. Talking about large-scale ice sheet model, if you're talking about Earth system model, I think there are some issues around whether the way we currently do channels converge with resolution. How are we going to couple these things to our standard optimization schemes? Ian mentioned that already. There's a lot of work on the software side to couple inputs and outputs, so forcing from the climate model. Forcing from the climate model, how does that get into the subglacial hydrological system? And then, when you pump the water through the ice sheet, how does it come back out? And something that doesn't really have anything to do with these, but I couldn't fit it in anywhere else, I think there's some opportunities here for using hydrology models for dimension reduction purposes. You can read this if you want, but maybe I'll just run you through it over here on the side. So, we commonly So, we commonly have a the way we do inversions, we think we know what the sliding velocity in the ice sheet looks like. We optimize the basal friction parameter to match that. We have something on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions unknowns. But when we bring in a subglacial hydrology model, we can basically map that same parameter over into a number of global parameters. Global parameters that span the whole ice sheet and is more on the order of five or ten. And if we can do that and still get a realistic-looking basal sliding field, there's a potential for having both sort of time-evolving sliding and also being able to do a lot more with uncertainty quantification because this, as we'll talk about in a minute, is a huge problem for uncertainty quantification efforts. For answering the quantitation. Yeah, the ignorant question. That map to me at least looks more like a map that you may or cycle that you do at each time. But presumably there's information from how that evolves if you'd like to. Yeah, so this is a little bit of a sloppy workflow that we have just been experimenting, but ideally we would like to do the optimization of the basal hydrology parameters and the sliding model parameters simultaneously. Simultaneously. And that's something that Moro and other colleagues are working on. It just, the numerics of that is not really working yet. So this is sort of a one-off put in place. Basically, what we were trying to do here is see if can we get a realistic looking sliding field through this sort of process? And if we can, maybe that's a way to take our standard optimization methods. Optimization methods and then move that into a much smaller parameter space. Okay, the other ice sheet model physics I think people are all familiar with that we spend a lot of time concerning ourselves with these days are having to do with fracture and calving. That's obviously because we know that ice shoals are important for buttressing the flux of ice across the grounding line and into the ocean. Across the grounding line and into the ocean. There's some coupling with both forcing from the surface climate and the basal climate, so the ocean. Again, for people who don't necessarily think about Earth system models, if we had better fracture and calving in our ice sheet models, and those ice sheet models were in the climate model, we'd do a much better job of putting icebergs. Icebergs in the right place at the right time and with the right amount of freshwater. And this is actually a really important thing for improving the freshwater fluxes in the Southern Ocean and Southern oceanography in general. I'm going to move along here. This is just some pretty pictures to show you how we're working on including fracture and calving in ice shelves in our project. We're using a damage evolution. We're using a damage evolution approach following some work of Jeremy Fassus. Some questions again. Like I said, we're using a damage mechanics approach. There's a lot of other people who would advocate for using linear elastic fracture mechanics. I don't know that that's practical on very large scale models, but there's certainly information that can be passed between these two. That can be passed between these two approaches. Right now, we're not coupling the damage back into the rheology, but we should be doing that. When you do do that, though, it can become very numerically challenging. So I think there's some challenges there for people working on solvers, looking at how damage and rheology interact. There's questions about. There's questions about how we actually use something like a damage evolution scheme to create icebergs. Are we going to actually try to resolve rifts? Are we just going to have sort of a continuous conveyor belt of icebergs that fall off? There's a lot of issues about how you pull damage physics into your model and then still be able to optimize that model using schemes that we currently use. And again, And again, there's issues about how damage and fracture are coupled back to climate processes both at the surface of the ice shelf and underneath it. How am I on time? Am I way over? I might skip some. I'm going to have to skip some stuff here. Yeah. That's just 16 minutes. Okay, so I'm going to leave the coupling stuff and I'm going to hope that Zeiler talks about. And I'm going to hope that Zeiler talks about most of the coupling stuff that's important. Basically, 70 years lids. Yeah, this is the issue here: is that right now we're doing this in the climate model, but in order to be able to actually move the ice shelves, there's a lot of software engineering involved, but also there's some pretty heavy computational physics problems involved in the ocean model around. The ocean model around wetting and drying. I said that. I'm going to skip this. Okay. This is especially important topic for our goals of coupling species into Earth system models. So we've been doing this for a long time where we take observed data set of velocities, we optimize our basal friction coefficient and on the ice shelf, some kind of stiffness coefficient. Some kind of stiffness coefficient to come up with velocity fields that look very much like observations. One thing we're not doing a good job of is being able to capture actual observed trends or even steady-state trends with those same initialization methods. And this is critical for an Earth system model because you can imagine you put your ice sheet model into an Earth system model. The ice sheet model, as soon as you As soon as you hit go on the uncoupled, on the coupled run, it's going to go staggering off into some other state and do something that's completely unrealistic. So this is actually from a Greenland simulation. I don't remember when we did this, but we pulled this out of some old work. And you can see we had a Greenland ice sheet that was very much initialized to look like present day right here. And you integrate forward in time, and after 500 years, you've got Time and after 500 years, you've got almost a meter of sea level. Actually, I think this is actually sea level fall in this case. The ice sheet is growing. Where in reality, what you would want to do is capture something closer to steady-state trend or even better, the actual observed trend. This is some work that Morrow has done, and I'm not going to steal his story here. I think he'll talk about this more tomorrow, but we've been working on a way of adding. But we've been working on a way of adding in the tendency terms and allowing a little more flexibility in the ice thickness during the optimization so that instead of having this noisy flux divergence field as soon as you take your first time step, this is the thing that leads to that ugly transient I was pointing to before. If you take these other things into account, you get something that looks much more like this, which Like this, which in a steady state, these two fields would look identical, and obviously this one looks fairly close. And the price you pay here is, of course, that maybe you don't have such a good fit to the surface velocity anymore. But that's probably something we can live with when we're talking about coupling to our system model. I'm going to skip here to this very humbling story about our efforts. About our efforts at uncertainty quantification. I think I don't need to spend much time on this, but everybody's concerned with how do we add some confidence bounds on our simulations. This figure from the last IPCC report, these blue and green lines are our ice sheet contributions, and you can see there's no error bars on them at all. So we spent a long time. We've spent a long time working on this sort of trying to put together a prototype end-to-end uncertainty quantification framework that builds off of our adjoint-based optimization. There's some sort of quick and dirty way of doing this is to use emulators for both the process where you calibrate to observations and when you propagate through the forward model. So this is a sort of mean. So, this is a sort of medium-resolution Greenland problem we worked on. Here's the map point distribution of the basal friction. And the idea was we would have a steady-stage Greenland ice sheet where if we just force it with steady-state forcing and we don't vary the map point distribution, the surface mass or the overall mass balance stays constant. There's no contribution to sea level. Here's an idea of the post- Here's an idea of the posterior variance on this map point distribution that we sample from to do forward propagation. And this is what we were hoping we would see. We have this nice normal-ish looking distribution around zero. Here's what we actually came up with: about 20 millimeters of sea level fall. So if nothing else, we would have hoped that this would have been distributed. Have hoped that this would have been distributed around zero. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly went wrong here. I think maybe we can discuss that some more when other people are talking about uncertainty quantification approaches in general. But I think what we came away with was that we were a little bit humbled and we need to, instead of trying to do the big, expensive, realistic problem right off the bat, start working with some much smaller problem. Working with some much smaller problems where we can really prototype things out from end to end first and explore things more fully. So, to that end, we've sort of adopted this set of tools that Doug Brinkerhoff is working with, and we're going to be redoing a lot of this work using some much more fast, efficient tools and smaller, idealized problems. This is pretty much my last slide. I think. I think, well, I'm going to say there's probably not too many people in the room who are really concerned with the physics of ice sheets, the interesting science, who care a lot about these changes that are coming along to HPC architectures. But pretty much everywhere is moving to machines with more on-node parallelism, and the number of CPUs is not going. And the number of CPUs is not going up. There's a lot of reasons for this. One is energy efficiency, but these machines are also very friendly for things like machine learning. Ian mentioned that. I should mention that DOE is throwing something like three to four billion dollars into machine learning over the next 10 years. So it's. I think the machines and this machine learning thing are sort of evolving hand in hand here. Here. If we want to be able to run on these various codes on these machines, and if we want to be able to get allocations on these machines, we need to be able to use these new architectures. And Irena spends a lot of time working on this. She'll talk about this later in the week, I think. The important thing is, well, one important thing is the science and the simulations we like to do. We like to do don't really benefit from this, these architectures at all. I'm not being recorded, but we can talk more about this offline. I mean, this is a little bit of the tail wagging the dog. You know, the science should drive the hardware, not the other way around. But we're sort of in this situation right now, and I think we have to all figure out how to do the best we can with it. With it. Okay, I'm over time, so I'm just going to skip the summary. These are some of the people in the picture here involved in the project. These are all of the people involved in these projects. And some of these people are in the room here today, and you'll have a chance to talk with and hear from them more later in the week. Thanks. We'll push this copy break a little bit later on. So, if anyone has questions to Steve, you can take a couple. Otherwise, we'll stop the crossing. Okay, so in that case, let's stop the copy. I think it might still be going, so you might need to press.
