So just to start off today, what I'd like to do is talk a little bit more about winds over the ocean in sort of general terms, finishing up our discussion from yesterday, and then move into some different ways that using a range of different tools from, say, stochastic analysis or from just basic probability modeling, we can think about some of the variability of winds or the ocean and try to develop ideas. And try to develop idealized ways of modeling certain statistical characteristics. But just to start off, I'd like to talk a little bit about wake effects, which are not unique to over the ocean, but over the ocean, because the boundary layer looks a little bit different than it does over land, can have some additional properties. So if we imagine wind passing an individual turbine or a wind farm, those turbines interact with the flow, they extract energy from the flow, they change the Extract energy from the flow, they change the character of the flow, they change the character of the turbulence in the flow, and those wakes can persist over the ocean potentially tens of kilometers downwind. And a nice example of that is shown from this image. Now, this is using something called synthetic aperture radar. It works a little bit like scatterometer observations do. The colors indicate the speed of the wind from, we see four. speed of the wind from let's see four and a half meters per second there we get this work four and a half meters per second here up to nine meters per second um the white dots we see here these represent individual turbines within wind farms and so we see that the wind is coming from the bottom right of the figure and in the wake of these wind farms there are these regions of reduced wind speed which persist if we look at the scale we have If we look at the scale we have here, in many cases, a few tens of kilometers. So, quite some distance. And in particular, you'll note that this farm here is being influenced by the wake of this farm. And that can be economically quite important. Is that some satellite? Yes, I would think it's normally SARS satellite. I'm pretty sure this would be satellite, yeah. Okay, it's right there to capture. Okay, caption. Yes. The Sentinel-1A satellite. Okay, yes. Now, in terms of what controls the rate at which these wakes recover, it's basically determined by the character of the turbulence and the mixing, because eventually, if we go far enough downstream away from the turbine or the wind farm, the turbulence within the boundary layer will mix things up again and it will return the pro. Again, and it will return the profile of the winds and the turbulence to something that's more similar to what you had upstream. So you see that we have in this turbine here. We have flow past it. We have this extended wake. The turbulence downwind, downstream, will slowly erode that wake, and then eventually you'll have some sort of return to undisturbed conditions. And so, really, it's the character of the turbulence in the downstream conditions. In the downstream conditions, that affects how far that wake is going to persist, and as we've talked about quite a bit, that's strongly influenced by the stratification. And in particular, if you have warm air over cold seawater, which might have occurred because it's the summertime and you've invected or transported warm air from the land over an adjacent ocean and passed it over some wind farms, you can have quite strongly stable stratification and the waves can persist for tens of kilometers. For tens of kilometers. An example of this is shown in these figures here. Now, these are not wind farms as such, but it's an indication of how localized roughness can produce wakes that, depending on the character of the stratification, can persist for some distance or can be eroded fairly quickly. The upper two panels show temperature anomalies relative to this. Relative to this location of this funny triangle here that actually does represent a wind farm. This is the Baltic, and this is northern Germany. So, what we see is on the left-hand side, a condition where over land we have relatively cold air and relatively warm air over the ocean. So, we have offshore flow, and the winds are showing in this bottom panel here, which is bringing this cold air from the land over warm seawater, which is going to be inducing unstable. Which is going to be inducing unstable stratification. Okay, so the winds are carrying this cold air over this warm surface. Now, in this region, there are a number of, in the land, there are a number of localized roughness patches. There's little forests. There's the city of Rostock. And when the flow passes these rough patches, of course, this is kind of like, in some ways, passing a wind farm, right? You get increased mixing, you get. Increased mixing, you get a reduction in the speed of the flow. And so you can see that there are these regions of relatively slow wind speed, and that's what's shown down here. The colors indicate the speed and the arrows indicate the direction of motion. But within several kilometers, those have more or less eroded and offshore the winds are more or less uniform. In contrast, on a day when we have warm air over the land, that we blow over a cold surface, so we induce a stable stratification. Surface, so we induce a stable stratification. The wind passing over these localized patches of increased roughness produces these wakes that extend tens of kilometers downwind. All right, it just takes a long time under these conditions of stable stratification for the relatively low amounts of turbulence that are present to erode those wakes. Well, I have a question regarding the definition of the two requirements. Wake. Wake. So it's a disturbance in fluid that is caused by the fluid passing some solid object or a solid object moving through fluid. So the most familiar example of a wake we would see is if you're on a boat and that boat moves through the water and you see the waves moving away and then you see some turbulence behind the boat. That's the wake of the boat. Yeah, thanks for pointing that out. And so we can see very different Very different conditions in terms of how, over what distances, these localized disturbances in the flow can persist depending on the character of the stratification. And you can also imagine that on a day like this, shown on the right-hand column here, that if the wind changes direction a little bit, if this triangle here is our wind farm, that we can go from a situation with relatively abundant wind to relatively little wind with just a slight change. Little wind with just a slight change in the direction of the flow, these long fingers of low wind speed extending tens of kilometers offshore. What's the wave on the bottom? Right, so the waves difference of colour is temperature, right? Temperature? Yeah. Wind speed. I'm sorry, I wasn't clear enough when I said that earlier. The colors down here indicate wind speed. So these orange colors are getting into sort of 10 to 12 meters per second, and these blue colors here, these long things. And these blue colors here, these long fingers of low wind speed, that's getting to five or six meters per second. But these are model results, right? These are model results. This is worse. So they'll model lakes? It has these dynamics in it. It has these dynamics in it. Yes. And we did. So the student I was working with to do this work actually had access to Actually, it had access to power data from that wind farm. Oh, yes. And it did an okay job. Aren't those the wakes of mountains? They're the wakes of little forests, of cities, of sort of patches of enhanced roughness on land. Now, this is northeastern Germany. It is an extraordinarily flat part of the world. Okay, there are little hills up there, but also. There are little hills up there, but also, you know, they haven't completely deforested this region. So you get these little patches of woods. And, like I said, down here, we have the city of Rostock, which is also just a localized patch of enhanced roughness. My question is about that little wind farm that you see, like a triangle piece. And in both cases, under both conditions, you actually see what appears to me like a high speed region downstream. High-speed region downstream of the plant. Why is that there? That's counter-included. Well, I think it's just simply because the wind is coming from off of the land, and so it was slow here, and it's just slowly speeding up. I should notice not really making an impact on that process. I don't think the wind farm is accounted for in this simulation. Or the wind farm is not present in the wall. So this is a little bit of a bait and switch. So earlier on, when I talked about wakes, I was talking. Earlier on, when I talked about wakes, I was talking about the wakes of wind farms or turbines, but a wake is a wake is awake to some extent. Yes, true. And so, here I was talking about the wakes of localized roughness patches on land and see how it was carried downwind. But yes, this simulation did not include the wind function. It is a little triangle that we dropped onto the figure. Yeah. By the way, you can wait till I see if it worked. If a work model like this has been developed for the like rockets towards the operator side, where you see these kind of things? I've not seen examples. Yes, I mean, people run not at this resolution. I haven't seen simulations, but there's lots of four kilometer resolutions for Western Canada readily available. In fact, NCAR, in partnership with others, has just been released. Partnership with others has just released the CONUS 404 product, which is 40 years of four-kilometer resolution simulations over the continental US and southern Canada. So that's it. I mean, it's four kilometer resolution. It's still relatively coarse, but it's lots of numbers to put. Do you think these kind of effect would be relevant for that? Because this is for land and ocean. Land and ocean. I mean, it's relevant anywhere you get a change in stratification, right? So we're looking at stratification induced by advective processes, not stratification induced by diurnal variations. So this would be definitely relevant over the Great Lakes and other large bodies of water, probably over Alberta. And we've got lakes, but not that big in the south, anyways. And they're also in vector across seas because there's Effect of processes because there's wind coming from VC going over the mountains, and all sorts of things going on. But different type of air in the alvertist hearts. We should look into this. But I mean, the basic principle, what I like about this figure is it illustrates the principle that you get these little patches that are rough, but they slow the wind down. And how long it takes for that wind to kind of re-equilibrate and become like the areas around it can be very dependent on the Very dependent on the character of whether or not you have a warm surface below cold air or the other way around. When we talk about WARF, we say it has this many kilometers resolution. Yes. And I know that means in the horizontal distance. I never got a clear answer. Well, what about in the vertical direction? How do you space those out? Not as finely as I would like. So I don't do these simulations myself. I am a consumer of these simulations. Generally, there's less attention paid, I would say, to vertical discretization than there arguably should be, in my opinion. The problem is that in many ways, at least in the near surface, in the boundary layer, particularly in the surface layer, the critique is made, and I think it's a legitimate critique. The problem isn't so much the resolution, the problem is the parameterizations. You know, the parameterizations are parameterizations are you know why why why put a whole lot of resolution into you know if into places where our parameterizations are maybe not quite as reliable but then i i think there's there's counter arguments to be made into that as well particularly when you think about the fact that the stably stratified boundary layer at night might only be 30 meters deep right that's that's often maybe one or two model layers so it's it's it's a challenge yeah like the verb is the changes by Resolution changes by that's right, exactly. They do have a finer resolution here in the surface, and then you don't have to have 20-meter resolution in the mid-troposphere. Might not even bother the problems. Okay. Any questions around this? Okay, so just by way of review, and this is a review also of yesterday, many different sources of data available. Many different sources of data available to study processes of the winds over the ocean, and there's advantages and disadvantages to all of them. There's fundamental differences in the ways that winds over the ocean behave from over land, and many of those are because of the unique nature of the marine boundary layer. Interaction with the surface wave field can produce a state-dependent or wind-speed-dependent drag coefficient, as well as changing the character of the boundary layer and introducing some wave boundary. Character of the boundary layer, introducing some wave boundary layer kind of class similarity arguments break down. Stratification has an important influence on the wind. And wake effects can, over oceans in particular, last for very long distances and very strongly be very strongly influenced by that stratification. Okay, I'll just note, I do have a whole bunch of references here, but I'll just draw particular attention to the last one, which I used quite extensively in producing the Extensively in producing these slides. It's a very nice review article in Wind Energy's from a couple years ago about some of the challenges in modeling offshore wind, understanding the modeling offshore wind. Any questions about that? Or I move on to a new topic? Okay. So, what I'd like to do for the next hour or so is talk about a sequence of idealized applied math and statistics approaches to understanding certain observed features of surface winds over the ocean. Now, strictly speaking, of course, from a wind resource point of view, we're much more interested in what's happening at, say, 100 meters up. Happening at say 100 meters up, but we don't have all that much data 100 meters above the ocean surface in order to sort of constrain what's happening. And so I'm going to be focusing much more on the sort of the 10 meter winds. So ocean surface winds. And I'm going to start off with an idealized model of near surface wind probability density functions. And stuff very nicely. He set me up this morning to having described stochastic differential equations, which we'll use to. Differential equations, which we'll use to develop this model. We'll talk a bit about the autocorrelation of speeds and components, and the fact that there's some interesting structure and how the different components, how their autocorrelation functions behave with time and how they differ from that and the speed and in ways that can be understood. And time permitting. We'll talk a bit about the fact that the asymmetry of the wind components that we had talked about yesterday, the skewness, interestingly, Skewness, interestingly, can be enhanced by low-pass filtering. So often we think of low-pass filtering, which in the very simplest case you can think of as being like a running mean. You're adding up a bunch of random variables. Often people will wave their hands and invoke the central limit there and say things should get more Gaussian when you do that. This is an example where that doesn't happen. So I would like to ask, you said on the idealized model. So we are more, you are not interested in like the 100 meter base. In like the 100-meter bins, but we have a data available on 10-meter bins. So, is there an approximation based on 10-meter data to 100-meter end? So, all the profiles that we've talked about up to this point are ways of trying to do that extrapolation. The problem is you need to know a lot of information, particularly you need to know stratification information. So, using in an idealized way without running WARF or another comprehensive model. Or another comprehensive model, actually trying to get information about winds aloft, knowing winds near the surface and maybe some basic stratification information, that can be very difficult, particularly under stable stratification. Everything gets much harder under stable stratification because length scales get very small and a lot of our similarity theories don't work when stratification is too strong. So yes, people have these extrapolation approaches. People have these extrapolation approaches, power laws, things like that, but they are all approximate. And the quality can be very dependent on the actual meteorological conditions. Thank you. Okay. So to talk a little bit about the dynamics of wind over the ocean, I'd like to start with the Reynolds average momentum budget in the horizontal that we talked about yesterday. So again, Talked about yesterday. So, again, just to remind you what this represents, we have the time rates of change of two components of the horizontal wind, U and V, which I can think of as being the flow towards the east would be U and the flow towards the north would be V, although that's not actually required the way the equations are set up. We have terms that describe the advective transport of momentum by the flow itself. And again, there are over bars over these. There are over bars over these quantities, so these represent transports of the Eddie averaged winds or the Reynolds averaged winds by the Reynolds averaged winds. We have our turbulent transports, and then we have on the right-hand side here the combined effect of the Coriolis force, so this effective force that exists because the Earth is rotating, and the pressure gradient force, which exists because the pressure is different in different places. So, these are equations that we've talked about quite a bit. And what I'm going to do is now take them and quite systematically simplify them to get a set of equations that I can do something with in a simple setting. And so each one of these approximations that I'm about to make is debatable. We can argue about its quality, but what I'd like to do is have it be open source, right? It be open source right and be transparent and just go through what I'm doing to simplify these equations in order to get a set that I can do something. The first thing I'm going to do is remember these u and v here in principle are three-dimensional spatial fields and actually four dimensions if you include time, right? So these are three-dimensional space or three spatial dimensions in time. I'm going to get rid of the vertical coordinate by just averaging these equations over the depth. Just averaging these equations over the depth of the boundary layer. I'm going to say the boundary layer is a depth h, and I'm just going to integrate these equations. I'm going to average these equations by integrating and dividing by h. Of course, the benefit then is I'm going to integrate these derivatives, and so I'm just going to get the turbulent fluxes at the bottom of the atmosphere and the top of the bouncer there. I'm going to neglect the horizontal momentum transport. Turns out that's actually not. Turns out that's actually not a bad approximation. I'm going to assume that my boundary layer depth, H, changes very slowly with time, so I can commute my depth averaging with this time derivative. Okay, that's going to switch the integral with the derivative by assuming that h varies slowly. I'm going to remember that at the top of the boundary there, my turbulent fluxes vanish because that's how I'm defining my boundary there. Because that's how I'm defining my boundary layer. And I'm going to remember that at the bottom of the boundary layer, I can parameterize my surface momentum fluxes in terms of a drag coefficient and a quadratic function of the wind. And I'm going to get these equations. It's not being agreeable. Okay, so with capital U and capital V being the depth averaged, let's just say, eastward and northward components of the flow, then I can go from these partial differential equations to these ordinary differential equations by integrating out the vertical coordinate and neglecting these horizontal momentum transports. It's a way to simplify. It's a way to simplify them and close them as part of it. Yeah. Yeah. Although it's not entirely closed because I don't actually know what these two things are. The UG and the VG, those are my pressure gradient forces, effectively. That is being produced, those quantities are being produced by the large scale weather, right? So what I'd like to do is think about my slab of boundary layer here being subjected to some externally To some externally imposed weather variability. I'm not going to ask where the weather comes from or why it takes the variability it does. I'm just going to say there is weather and it's changeable. So I'm going to model that as something which is variable. Also, what I'm going to do is I'm actually not going to directly model the pressure gradient forces of UG and Vg, but I'm going to Vaguely, but I'm going to model this difference, what I called yesterday the ageostrophic difference between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. If I had perfect geostrophic equilibrium, there would be no difference. But in the boundary layer, there is generally a difference. And in fact, even in the free atmosphere, even though those differences between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force are very small. And the Coriolis force are very small. If we didn't have them, the weather would never change. The weather changes, therefore, those differences must exist. So in fact, what I'm going to do is model these agiostrophic residuals here in a way I'll talk about in a second. And I'll just note again that in parameterizing the surface flux by this quadratic function of wind speed, effectively, I have to introduce the wind speed, which I'm just going to give the symbol lowercase. I'm just going to give the symbol lowercase s. So I have two now ordinary differential equations, much easier to deal with, but not closed. If you said H varies slowly with time, are you going to let it vary on similar scales to the I'm actually going to hold it fixed? Easier. Yes. All right. So how do I model these ageostrophic terms, these imbalances between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force that are fundamentally associated with the pressure? That is, that are fundamentally associated with weather variability. I am just going to treat them as red noise processes like we've seen earlier, as what we might call an Ornstein-Ullenbeck process, a Langevin process, a red noise process. These terms all get used interchangeably. I'm going to introduce these parameters or these variables rather, eta u and eta v, which have simple linear damped dynamics. linear damped dynamics, which characterist time scales tau u and tau v, and then some white noise. Those are independent Brownian motions, the w1 and w2. And so eta u and eta v are then independent ornestein and lumbeck processes. And then these are what are going to be driving variability in my simple boundary layer model. So A to U and A to V represent that's externally imposed weather. And then I have Weather and then I have my simple boundary model here. What is find using? Ah, thank you. Thank you. All right, I should have mentioned that because what's important is that agiostrophic difference is not just the weather, it's also the climate. I have some long-term average difference between those two. So there's a mean. So there's a mean agiostrophic component, and then there's a fluctuating agostrophic component. And pi u and pi v, these represent the means of those essentially large-scale forcing by climatological features. And then this is the weather variability. You know, this is hand-waving. This is meant to be kind of an intuitive model to try to understand some basic physical processes. This is not a forecast model. is not this is not a forecast model so pi u and pi v d do not depend on u or v um not at this level of approximation no yeah we're assuming exogenous quantities that don't we just kind of assume that we know that um large-scale dynamical processes establish mean u and a mean v and so there has to be some sort of non-zero value to these in general and that's that's what Rule, and that's that's what produces the previous slide, but the pipe. Uh I'm sorry, it's the average of the divergence. Yeah, well, no, yeah, so the pi pi u is the average of this, pi v is the average of that, with minus sides. And I'm taking over the other side of the equation. Taking over to the other side of the equation. No, I'm keeping on that side of the equation. Sorry, they're staying. Everything else is going to their side of the equation. Okay. Like I said, this is an intuitive form of idealized model building. Okay, this is not a robust first principles argument. But what this does is at least I try to be very clear about where I'm making approximations and why. And what this does is it gives me then a stochastic differential equation. Then, a stochastic differential equation and four state variables that we can try to treat. Now, because of these nonlinearities in the surface momentum flux term, we can't actually get anything analytic out of these equations, at least not pathwise. But it turns out that if you make a couple simplifying approximations, in particular, if we let the time scales of our red noise processes Timescales of our red noise processes go to zero, and we assume that their the way they interact or that their characteristic magnitude of variability is isotropic, then we come down to a single nonlinear still stochastic differential equation in two state variables. So, simple reduction in the order of the model. Again, it's nonlinear. This doesn't. Again, it's nonlinear. This doesn't admit pathwise analytic solutions. But what it does admit, and we were introduced to the idea of the Fokker-Planck equation earlier, is that to every stochastic differential equation, you can write down a reaction diffusion equation for the probability density function, and you can ask what the steady state solution is. And it turns out that the Fokker-Planck equation for this very simple model does admit an analytic solution. Admit an analytic solution. And so we can come up with a model for the joint distribution of our two wind components in terms of this particular function here with a bunch of parameters. So what is nice, what I like about this approach is that we get a probability distribution where the parameters are not just some sort of statistical quantities, but they actually all have physical meaning. Sigma is related to how variable our weather is. Pi mu of pi v represents Pi mu pi v represent that long-term, the processes that generate the long-term mean winds, drag coefficient, depth of the boundary layer. First and then so. Okay, so well in the and n1 in front of the exponential is this standard volume randomly and one is the fact that I don't want to integrate this to figure out what the normalization factor is to make this integrate twice. Integrate one. Yeah, it's going to be some mess, anyways, right? And we don't really care what it is because I can always just calculate the proportion of this. This is whatever we need to make sure this integrates to one. So the second one is what was the second one? An omnibus domain. The domain was h of t, that depends on time, right? Well, what's uh no. So I probably should have just said I'm assuming h is constant because I am. I'm assuming H is constant because I am ignoring variations of H to keep things as simple as possible. Yeah, now is it too simple? Almost certainly, but at least start to get some interesting results. Could you remind me what S was? S is speed. So S. So U squared plus U exactly S squared is U squared. Oh is u squared plus v squared. Okay, tau u and tau v in the original formulation of the model, these were the characteristic, essentially, exponential decorrelation time scales of the red noise processes A to U and A to V. So that's the memory of the weather. So what I've done here is taken a limit which is totally unphysical. I've said the weather is faster than the weather. Said the weather is faster than the boundary layer processes. It's the other way around. Okay, but it gives me something I can deal with analytically and get some interesting results. And I'll come back to the more general model later. Because one of the nice things that this model actually is able to characterize is I can do things now like compute what the various moments of the distribution are according to the model. And I get this very nice demonstration from this idealized. From this idealized physical setting, that the first order moments for the mean of either u or v, the components, is actually related to the skewness, the asymmetry of the distribution. So that they are always opposite in sign, so that if the mean of u is positive, the skewness is negative, and vice versa. And also, And also, as the mean of u gets larger, the skewness gets larger as well. That falls out directly from this model: that there is this direct relationship between what the mean of the wind component is and the asymmetry of the distribution, which is in fact exactly what we observe. So, looking at, in this case, this is 44 years of observations in the upper panel. In the upper panel, I'm showing the long-term mean of the zonal wind component. That's the component towards the east. In the right-hand panel, the radional wind component, flow towards the north. And in the bottom panel, I'm showing skewness of these two quantities. And what you can see is that there is this almost perfect spatial anti-correlation between these two quantities, that there's this very clear connection between how strong the wind. How strong the wind is on average at a particular location, and how asymmetric its fluctuations are. And again, mathematically, there is no necessary relationship between the mean and the skewness. But it emerges from our physical constraints. It emerges from our physics of the problem. And it comes out very nicely from this idealized analysis. Idealized analysis. Do you see that in the PD? In the PDF? In the PD, the PD that you have. Well, you're good. Because what you have is what this is, is the probability density function, so I can compute all of the moments. I can go in, I can do these integrals to find what the moments are. There's different kinds of averaging here. So the over bars, that represented the slowly varying part of the flow. So it is still time dependent and it still has variability. So this is not looking at the statistics of the turbulence. It's looking at the statistics of the weather at the surface. Now, the fact that you have this opposite relationship between the mean of the component and the asymmetry of the distribution, yeah, it doesn't follow obviously from just looking at this formula. You have to go in and actually do the calculations, but it emerges very quickly. And so, this model is able to account for this quite Uh, quite striking observation, right? That I mean, first off, our components of the flow are highly non-Gaussian. If you look at the values of skewness here, they're ranging between minus two and two. Those are quite big for geophysical flows, for geophysical variables, and that there is this very clear relationship between the different moments. You showed us a picture of ocean surface when. Picture of ocean surface wind before. Yeah, that was the speed. Okay. Yeah. And the statistics of the speed are very different from the statistics of the components, although there are natural relationships. But that was from an that wasn't from a model, right? Well, this isn't from a model either. These are reanalysis observations. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These are observations, and I'm saying that we see this observation. And I'm saying that we see this observationally, and the model is able to account for it. Again, many very crude, simplifying approximations to get there. But you could argue that perhaps this is still capturing in some sense the essence of this behavior. Will which spatial scale in your model be implied? It is point-wise, because, yeah, so in that sense. So, in that sense, it is really meant to represent. How do I put this? It is meant to be point-wise. So, I have looked at this behavior, this connection between moments in observations. It applies in a reanalysis product where here I'm looking at quarter-degree by quarter-degree boxes, but I can also look at BUI observations, which are individual points. And you see the same behavior. And if you apply that model, That model point by point from reanalysis data. Are you assuming that the boundary layer height stays fixed as the point moves around? No, the boundary layer is going to be point variable. But at any point, you're imagining that it stays fixed in time in the idealized model. Of course, it doesn't. Right, in your idealized model. I see, okay. But you don't have to make this assumption that it's homogeneous spatially. Okay. The other thing you can do if you want is you don't actually have to integrate over the top of the boundary layer. You can integrate from the surface to some fixed elevation. So you can define H as a constant. But then you have to think about the turbulent fluxes at the top, which you can do. And that's another way of formulating the problem in the past by putting in some sort of effect of any viscosity. Yeah. So they're all kind of equivalent formulations. Nice. Something about the interpretation of this result. So when mean is positive, we get a distribution that is skewed negative. So the left tail is heavy. So when we see B, even though it's low probability, we see winds with negative velocity and or negative direction and very high. In general, we see the See that you do get you do see sign crossings, um, but one can one way to think about this is actually, as I would say, directly related to the physical interpretation, is that when you have a non-zero, and this is actually I haven't indicated the maximum of the distribution here, not the mean, but when you have a non-zero mean for the component, then you have a tail. Tail, you have an asymmetry, and you have a long tail which is directed towards a state of rest. Okay, and this goes back to this idea that with this quadratic dependence of the surface momentum flux on speed, in some sense, if I imagine I have my boundary layer here and I have my external weather that's variable and it's fluctuating, and I have some fluctuation. And it's fluctuating, and I have some fluctuations that are trying to speed the flow up, and some that are trying to slow it down. That because the drag increases in a non-linear way with how fast the speed is, then those perturbations which try to speed the flow up have a smaller effect than those perturbations which try to slow it down. And so that produces then an asymmetry. And the magnitude of this asymmetry gets larger. Gets larger the larger this mean is. If I move the mean to here, then I would get a symmetric distribution. That's kind of the idealized physical intuition, which is why I think this model, even though, as I said, many, many crude and highly, highly simplifying approximations were made to get there, I will argue it actually captures some essential aspects of the physics. I'm still a little bit confused as to the, and maybe it's because I'm thinking up from an engineer. What do you use this model for? What is the utility? What is utility? I'll answer as a scientist. I saw these maps and I wanted to know why there was this relationship between the average wind component and the shape of their distribution. That was the utility. That was the utility. Now that you've made it, what could you use from this understanding? It does have relevance if you want to understand. I don't want to go so far as to say necessarily the extremes, but if you're interested in the just variability of the wind, knowing that it is strongly asymmetric, those distributions can be quite useful. And when you're starting to think about When you're starting to think about any sort of quantity that is of application and interest, which depends in some non-linear way on the winds, then that actually starts to become important, what these shapes of the distribution are. So, for example, different parameterizations of the exchange of gases between the Gases between the ocean and the atmosphere will often have, say, a quadratic dependence on wind speed. White capping and wave breaking, that often is parameterized as being cubic in the wind speed. Even things like the rate at which energy is put into the ocean through mechanical processes, that power is cubic in the speed. So, if you're interested in statistics of those quantities, then try to understand some of these higher order moments. Higher moments, yeah. It also becomes interesting in that it is directly related to the observation that we saw yesterday that for big chunks of or big parts of the tropics, that the wind speed distribution is negatively skewed, which again is perhaps a bit surprising given that speed is a quantity which is bounded below by zero. So if this is speed, we know that the distribution has to go to zero here. And so over land, we're quite accustomed to seeing distributions of speed that. We're quite accustomed to seeing distributions of speed that look like that, but over much of the tropics, a distribution that looks like that is quite common. And that can't be accounted for if we assume that the components of the wind are Gaussian. You can show that very easily. And so this is a necessary component, actually, of the non-Gaussianity of the components. And what's nice is with this idealized model, you can also show that because you can take the expression for the components, you can express. Components, you can express u and v in plain polar coordinates and then integrate over angle and get a physically based, although highly simplified, representation for the probably distribution of the speed itself. Where just in case people are not familiar, I naught here is an associated Bessel function of the first kind, which is something that comes out when you're doing integrals of the exponential of trigonometric functions. And so, again, we can come up with a model like this that can actually Come up with a model like this that can actually say something about the shape of the speed distribution and can also capture the negative skewness that we observe in the tropics, which is itself a manifestation of the non-Gaussianity of the components. This phenomenon is not observed on land, it's only observed on the ocean. Yes. Well, to the best of my knowledge, and it's, I think, because when you get Because I'm going to get into a lot more detail about this. The places where the skewness is negative over the ocean are in trade wind regions where the speeds are very, or where the winds are very, very strong and very, very steady. And that's a part of the wind variability space that we don't sample over land in nearly the same. In nearly the same kind of way. If you look at the typical distributions of wind speeds over land, if you get away from regions of complex topography where all sorts of things can happen, where these distributions can be multimodal, they can have all sorts of complexity. But if you look at a distribution of wind speeds over the prairies, over grass. Over the prairies, over grassy fields, things like that. They generally have this characteristic shape, and they're almost always right-skewed. But we think about a space of, say, the mean and the standard deviation of our speed or of our winds, right? This negative skewness phenomenon tends to occur here, which is not a place which Which is not a place, which is where the lands typically are. The lands are often up here, similar actually to the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, which both show wind speed distributions that look like this. And I also have, I'm sorry, you could put it towards her sake. If you'd like, I could actually even say to some extent this is going to be North Hemisphere Midlands, tropics, Southern Ocean. That's where those different geographical regions sit in this space. And because they sit in these different regions of space, the characteristic distribution Of space, the characteristic distributions of the components and the speed are different in these areas. I'm just curious, so do you have some example from this density to show you can accommodate wide range of the density shape? I don't have that figure. I've made those plots many times. Yeah. But it does. It will produce the negative skewness that is observed. And also, I think, as just a simple idea, the density may be used to generate the winds, random realizations, and maybe simulation because it could be, it don't even need to be normalized, integrated, because the ratio would be sense. Yeah, now the extent to which you'd want to do that, because this is, I would say, qualitatively useful, but quantitatively, it's Quantitatively useful, but quantitatively it's wrong. Because of all of the approximations I've made, this is not going to fit perfectly actual wind speed observations. But what it does is it gives us an understanding, an intuitive understanding of how the shape of the distribution varies depending on the physical setting you're in. So it's, it's, you know, there's different reasons to build models, and one of them is to just develop understanding. And that's my primary focus here. My primary focus here. Nice question. What would be the implication of this relationship between the mean and speed for wind power? Well, I mean, again, it has this implication on the shape of the speed distribution. The individual components are less important for wind power, but the speed, of course, matters. And so if you think about, again, you have you're interested in we have. You're interested in we have just a very simple power curve that looks like this, and you want to compute the average speed or the average power production, say, or the statistics of power production, or even better, compute the probability distribution of power production. Then the distribution of the winds matter, right? And what you're doing is you're putting an already non-Gaussian distribution through a very non-linear function. Through a very nonlinear function. And so all of those higher order moments then actually start to be potentially quantitatively significant. Now, whether or not you're going to be putting a wind turbine a thousand kilometers west of the Galapagos Islands, you know, probably not. But so from wind power perspective, that open ocean distribution is maybe not so relevant. Maybe not so relevant. Of course, you have to be closer to the coastlines before that's going to be relevant for wind power. But for a lot of oceanographic processes, it actually matters. Like I say, if you're interested in the average rate at which CO2 is exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere, then these things can matter because those are also non-linear functions of the speed. Sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, he's going. Well, maybe another comment about Denise's question is distribution of the components also will have a big effect on individual weight losses between turbines because it changes the way that the wind is oriented with respect to the layout of the turbine in the environment. Again, with the qualifying statement that all of this is eddy average, this is all, so I'm not really looking at the detailed characteristics of the turbulence. This is all the slowly evolving. This is all the slowly evolving weather part of the clouds. You mentioned like this limit how we need to deal with how we need to deal with. This comes with intuitive given that the environment. So what about the other limit? Tau u going to infinity and well infinity is also too too far but but you would expect tau u and tau v to be We don't understand like 15, you know, well, what you don't want to do is, yeah, you wait, wait, well, okay, you could argue that at that limit, you turn off the weather. And if you turn off the weather, then the variability becomes much less interested, right? You lose your variability. But I don't think I'll get to it. In my notes, I do have a discussion later on about this interesting phenomenon that the asymmetry, that the skewness of these component distributions can actually be substantially increased if you take. Substantially increased if you take starting from say hourly data, if you average that to daily or three-daily data, the asymmetry of the fluctuations actually become much larger. And that enhancement of the asymmetry of the distribution by low-pass filtering can be understood in terms of the more comprehensive four-variable model I showed earlier. And there's a one-relevant non-dimensional ratio, which really kicks in. Ratio, which really kicks in, which is the ratio of this tau, which is in some sense the characteristic time scale of the weather. And then from the first two equations for u and v, you can derive a characteristic boundary layer time scale. And it's the ratio of those two time scales that determines whether or not you enhance the asymmetry of the distribution by low-pass filtering. And that's something which the idealized model, which was not designed, I mean, this I first thought. I mean, I first thought about this 15 years ago. No, God, 20 years ago. Well, before I was thinking about what happens under filtering, but it turns out that it actually is capturing that behavior, which again suggests that even though it is very, very simplified and not to be believed in any quantitative sense, that there is something in there that is actually capturing some essential character of the physics. Okay. So in the last 20 minutes, I'd just like to talk about another approach to understanding some of these statistical, observed statistical features of surface winds. And this is taking a very different approach, moving away from thinking about things in terms of stochastic dynamics and really just playing Just doing a lot of statistical analysis and making some judicious approximations to try to understand the following observation. If we think about serial dependence in time of our surface winds, so if I know the winds at a given time, what does that information tell me about the winds at later or potentially earlier times in a statistical sense? There's lots of ways of measuring dependence, but the simplest, most straightforward. But the simplest, most straightforward is the autocorrelation. So we can imagine taking the correlation of some process X with itself at a different time. Now, here, t is kind of the base time and uppercase T is the time lag. If this autocorrelation function does not depend on the base time t, then it's stationary. And after this, we're just going to assume that things are stationary. This is a general setting. So how this quantity varies as a function. How this quantity varies as a function of capital T tells us essentially how rapidly, at least in a linear sense, this variable x forgets its state. Or in perhaps more interesting settings, if R of T actually oscillates, it tells us something about more generally the dependence between the state of the system at a given time and the state of the system at other times, in a linear sense. Linear sense. Okay, and if we look from observations, right, these are observations, and everything from now on is observations. If we look at autocorrelation functions of different aspects of the wind, I'm showing this here at three different locations, and I'm showing three things. I'm actually showing four things, but I'm going to ask you to ignore one of them. So for the moment, ignoring what this gray line is. Gray line is. I'm showing the autocorrelation of the zonal wind components, so that is the component of the wind towards the east in the dashed line, of the meridional component, so that's the component to the north in the dot dashed line, and the speed in the solid look. And so we see at all these locations, right, there is a decrease of the autocorrelation with time, as you might expect, although it is not necessarily monotonic. It is not necessarily monotonic. So, what is the tire resolution? Ah, yes. These are from three hourly. I'm going to say three hourly. Yeah. And so this is going from a lag of zero on the left to four days out. So this is giving us kind of a characteristic picture of what we might expect the memory in some sense of our variables to be. And what we see is that there's actually a big difference between A big difference between the two different components at our three different locations. So the north-south component of the wind is statistically related to itself at different times in a different way than the east-west component of the wind is. And both of them are different than the speed. And so the question is, can we help we try to understand some of these aspects of this asymmetry? So I'll just note, going back here actually, hopefully show this map. These two locations here, site A and site C are, well, let's go through all through all three of them. Site C is at 50 degrees south. So that's in the middle latitudes. In fact, this is in the Southern Ocean, a place that's characterized by essentially a constant stream. By essentially a constant stream of low-pressure systems moving from the west towards the east. Point B is in the trade winds, relatively quiet, relative variability. And point A is at 35 degrees south. That's sort of where these things are, or the boundary between, where we have some influence of these low pressure systems, but you're not quite in the heart of our. The heart of our storm tracks. And so, if we try to understand, you know, for example, in these two subtropical middle-latitude locations, why it is that you might have this asymmetry in the autocorrelation function, one very simple way of thinking about it is what the characteristic forms of weather are in these regions that are dominating the variability. And in these regions, as I just indicated, the dominant form of variability is the passage of low pressure systems. Is the passage of low-pressure systems. So, what I've drawn here is: I imagine I'm looking down from above at the Earth's surface. This is meant to represent an isobar, so a line of constant pressure with low in the middle. We're in the southern hemisphere in all cases here, so we keep low pressure to the right. So we have these circulating weather systems, right, where we have, now they're not generally circular, but this is a simple idealization. We have these circulating. Have these circulating flows, and these systems propagate towards the east. Okay, so basic mid-latitude weather that our low-pressure systems propagate generally from the west towards the east, sometimes a little bit towards the north, sometimes a bit towards the south. In the southern ocean, pretty much due east most of the time. And so, we can ask, if we imagine we're And so we can ask: if we imagine we're in some position here, and one of these storms comes over top of us, what kind of perturbation in the wind do we see? Now in the zonal component, remembering that this is what the flow is looking like, if we imagine looking at the perturbation of the wind as this storm passes by, we see that we start to acquire, because of the sign convention, where positives towards the wind. Where positive is towards the west, we acquire, actually, positive is towards the east, we acquire a negative anomaly in our component. That's kind of what the anomalous zonal component will look like. But as it passes, if we think about the anomalous meridional component, the first thing we see is an anomalous flow to the south. And then once the center of the storm passes, we see an anomalous flow. Of the storm passes, we see an anomalous flow to the north. That's if we look at the anomalies in the radional direction, they're going to look like that. And if we think about many, many of these storms passing and dominating this kind of variability, you see that in the Meridianal direction, we have this rapid change, a much shorter time scale of variability, and a reversal. A reversal where I go from one sign to another. Whereas in the zonal direction, it's a much more gentle and gradual change that it's always the same side. And if I look at this southern ocean location here, the zonal winds, their autocorrelation function decays monotonically down towards zero. But the mariodal comes down, takes a slightly negative value, and then bounces back up. Back up. And you can actually, if you make, again, a whole bunch of simplifying assumptions and assuming that all your storms are circles that move at the same speed and they only move towards the east, you can actually average out over a bunch of these and come up with an explanation of what we expect our autocorrelation functions to be. And in the zonal direction, we find that it is this. If we assume that the storms have an exponential. If we assume that the storms have an exponential or Gaussian, I should say, profile, I have this sort of slowly evolving Gaussian. And the Merdional direction, I have this polynomial, which multiplies the Gaussian and gives me these two characteristic patterns. This is my zonal decay. This is my Mordombian decay. Now, it's a little bit more exaggerated than what we see in the observations because, of course, this is highly simplified and there's other things that are going to be affecting the wind. That are going to be affecting the winds other than potentially just these phenomena-scale storms. But again, at a qualitative level, this kind of idealized, no, rather than dynamical, I've described this as idealized kinematic thinking, allows you to try to get a sense for why we have these observed statistics in regions that, and these strong asymmetries in the autocorrelation structure of our two wind components in regions that are. Structure of our two wind components in regions that are dominated by these large-scale storm systems. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Did you by chance analyze the particle toporrelation function in the time point? No. Just focusing on just a straight autocorrelation. Yeah. Now, quick follow-up. So have you looked at? Quick follow-up. So, have you looked at the cross-current correlation between UNDE? I was just curious. Yeah, this one is quiet. Yes, not a lot of people. Yeah, it shows more or less what you'd expect. And finally, just to try to get a sense for why. Oh, Joshua. We use our correlation in turbulence all the time to characterize time scales of turbulence. Exactly. And we say more or less square crosses zero is the spatial or Is the spatial or time scroll scale? Do you make any kind of those comments of where cross and zero here? Well, that was a kind of average time scale of those storms, I suppose. That's right. Okay, so the decay time scale you can see here is determined by sigma, which tells you how big the storm is, and S, which is how fast the storm is. Okay. So sigma is the width of the storm, S is its propagation speed. You take a ratio and you get a time scale. Now there's a factor of four, too. But if you're cool. So yeah, you get a kind of 10 amount. And so, yeah, you get a kind of kinematic prediction for physically what is determining that decay scale. And it's how big are the storms and how fast do they move? What does kinematic mean? So in physics, we distinguish between kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics is the description of motion. Dynamics is the explanation of motion. I'm not saying anything about why we have storms. I'm saying if we have a storm, these are the things we've expected. Store, these are the things we'd expect to see. Yeah, so you might, if you if you take a first-year physics course, right, and you talk about things like you know, uh, the relationship between accelerations and speeds and forces, not even forces, until before you talk about force, it's all kinematics. As soon as you talk about forces, then it starts becoming dynamics. Thank you. And then, very quickly, finally, we also saw the fact that the speed decay was different than either components. That the speed decay was different than either component, which is maybe not terribly surprising because, well, we have to combine the two components to get speed, and we do it in a nonlinear way. And as soon as you start taking nonlinear functions and variables and then computing moments, things will change. But the question is, can we actually try to understand what that autocorrelation function of speed is in terms of the autocorrelation functions of the components? Autocorrelation functions of the components. And with a certain simplifying approximation, you can actually make quite a bit of progress. And I'll just note that really it hinges on the fact that, and I'm not going to go through the, I'm not going to show why these things are true. I'm just going to say these are the results of these things being true. If we consider the standard deviation divided by the speed divided by the mean of the speed and the factor of two for technical reasons, this ratio is observed to be less than one. Is observed to be less than one, and in general, if we look at observations, it's much less than one. So, if I take scatter owner observations from over the ocean and I look at this ratio, and I look at a histogram of this ratio at different locations all over the ocean, you see it is mostly here around 0.2. That's a small number. Now, why on earth does that matter? Well, it turns out that you could show, and this is a fairly simple calculation, that That to order quadratic in that small number, to second order in that small number, the correlation between the speed and the square of the speed is almost exactly one. These two vary almost perfectly together. And then what you can get away with is you can say, okay, then it turns out that the correlation of the speed at two different places or two different times is very well approximated by the Times is very well approximated by the correlation of the squares of the speeds. Why does that matter? If I want to relate the correlation of speeds to the correlations of the components, this is really hard because I'm correlating two things which are the square roots of sums of squares. But if I can take the correlation of the square of the speeds, then this is just u1 squared plus v1 squared. This is u2 squared plus v2 squared. I can just expand that out and start doing calculations. Start doing calculations. And it turns out that, again, if we neglect the non-Gaussianity of the components, you assume they're isotropic Gaussian, and come up with a formula based on this approximation for the correlation between the speeds at two different locations or two different times in terms of the correlation functions of the components. We have terms that are quadratic in the correlations and terms that are linear in the correlations, and the relative weighting of the components. And the relative weighting of those terms is determined by the ratio of the square of the component speed to the square of the standard deviation. Basically, if for a given component, the speed is small compared, or the mean is small compared to the standard deviation, the correlation of the speeds behaves quadratically in those of the components. And if you're in a region where the means are large compared to the variability, Are large compared to the variability, then the variability is going to be a weighted mean of the linear dependence on the components. Very simple formula. And that's what the gray lines are. We apply those. It's a very simple formula. And these two, the zonal and the meridional relation functions, give us these gradients. Great. They're not perfect, but they sit very closely with speed curves. And so at least gives us a first step towards understanding why it is and being able to model in terms of the statistics of other quantities, why the autocorrelation function of the speed looks the way it does. If you were interested in being able to relate. In being able to relate the characteristic time scales of fluctuations in the components and the speed together, this provides you a way of trying to approach that. Could you briefly state, please, about the black line? Straight black line. This is just the raw observational autocorrelation function of the speed. The great line is the simple model. Where I take this curve and I take this curve and I combine them according to that equation I showed a minute ago. And the fit is almost perfect. It's pretty good. Is almost pretty good. It's not perfect. There's a gap there. So we know this isn't true, but it's not bad, particularly given, again, a bunch of very crude approximations I've made along the way. Now, I'll just briefly say that you can do more if you're really interested in the dependence of speed. Right here, I was trying to model the dependence of speed in terms of the dependence of the components by using this simplifying approach. By using this simplifying approximation based on this observation, that I can approximate the correlation of the speeds by the correlation of the squares of the speeds. But you can do more. You can, for example, try to model the joint distribution of the speeds, so a bivariate speed distribution, in terms of some assumptions about the joint distribution of the components. So you start with a four-variable joint distribution. A four-variable joint distribution. So u and v at two different locations or two different times, make some simplifying assumptions, and then turn that into a joint distribution of the speeds, a bivariate distribution. There's different ways you could do that. So what I'm just showing here is that four different locations, scatter plots. Now, these are spatial joint distributions between the speeds at one location and the speeds at another location. And the speeds at another location. We see different kinds of shapes in these scatter plots. And then depending what kind of bivariate models you build, you can fit those pretty well. So this bottom row here shows a bunch of bivariate speed distributions that I get by assuming that the vector winds are Gaussian, the vector components are. The vector components are Gaussian, so my four-dimensional distribution is Gaussian, with certain assumptions about correlations between them and isotropy of fluctuations and things like that. So these are the joint distributions that you can get. But this is the price you pay. This is the formula. And I'd like to point out the infinite series of triple products of Bessel functions, which converges very slowly numerically. And it's really not a very easy mathematical expression to work with. I mean, when I wrote this paper, this is the one time in my career that I've ever had to work with confluent hypergeometric functions, so that was kind of fun. Special functions you learn about as a physics undergraduate and never touch again. But it's not very practical. And so this kind of idealized component-wise modeling and then trying to get the joint distribution for the speed. The joint distribution for the speeds from that. Even though you can make some progress, it's not clear that this is a very fruitful direction to pursue because it gets miserably complicated analytically very quickly. Do the chunk case really important too. Yeah, it is a numerical computation. So the computer's not still working. Yeah. So yeah, you basically have some convergence criteria you have to apply. Yeah. To apply, yeah, but I mean, the convergence is slow, um, depending on the parameter values. The point is, you can do it, but it's probably not worth it. Isn't there like a simpler distribution to estimate this distribution to some extent? Like to approximate to this, like the so the simplest thing you could do would be just like a copular approach. And what I was trying to do was avoid that and actually say, I want to know, say, if I know something about the components. I want to know, say, if I know something about the components, what does that tell me about the speeds? Without having to just say, yeah, I can always, I can always come up with a bivariate distribution of speeds using a copyload. No problem. So in that sense, you can do bivariate modeling. But this idea that you can sort of start from saying something about what the components are doing and then integrating over angle. This is just, and this is just two, you know, two speeds. Imagine trying to do this for a spatial. A spatial, like some spatial statistics. You're trying to have a 256 by 256 pixel map of speeds, and you're trying to characterize its high-dimensional non-Gaussian dependent structure. So these analytic approaches, I think, it's the kind of thing that you can push to a certain point. And then after that, that's where the machine learning comes in. Is there anything? Is there any danger of single point inside the arc tension? Not that I have ever encountered. So no, not that, yeah. It always seems to actually, I mean, remember, it's in an arctangent. So even if that argument goes to infinity, right? It just gives you pi over two. So I'm just going to stop here on maybe it's kind of a And on, maybe it's kind of a not the right, most hopeful place to stop because, really, the point is that there, sometimes you can do these things analytically and you can get some useful results, or you can get some results. But, you know, it might be more work than it was worth in the first place. But there are other approaches to trying to model these, of course, these distributional structures. And it's just that idealized modeling can often only take you so far. And that's I think I come to time. And that's a good time. We're slightly over. So, thank you all very much. I'm happy to take my club for each other. More questions? Feel free to defer the questions for a subsequent conversation, but where do you see kind of the atmospheric? Kind of the atmospheric science community moving to in terms of computational directions, right? So we have work now. Well, not now, it's been around for a long time, but there's a lot of like one could, so in my community, there's a lot of activity around coupling mesoscale models like WERF to Elliott's models. On the other hand, maybe you could go the other direction, right? The other direction, right? You have a global circulation model that are combined with medical scale models to maybe, I don't know, connect the two a bit better. Can you comment on what do you see as new directions in the community? I mean, all of those, yeah, because they address different questions fundamentally. I mean, there is this, this is more a question of time scale than spatial scale, they're not totally independent. You know, there's this move to what they call seamless prediction, where you use. Prediction where you use the same modeling system to do short-term weather forecasts all the way out to climate change projections and have like a unified system. But still, that's not the same kind of spatial difference question. I think the key point is if you're only thinking about hydrodynamically relevant scales of motion, right, in the atmosphere, that's 10 to the minus three meters to 10 to the seven meters. That's 10 orders of magnitude. So I don't think it. Orders of magnitude. So I don't think at any point in the foreseeable future, we're going to have comprehensive models that are resolving all of the scales. So this kind of all this, this kind of idealized, you know, one-way forcing type approaches, I think are always going to be used, at least for the foreseeable future. There are things that are happening that are okay. There might be good news or bad news, depending on how you look at things. So I just found out the other day. Depending how you look at things. So, I just found out the other day, talking with a former student, and Chris Q is describing a big project I think was based in the Netherlands to essentially have a generative emulator of LES simulations. And you could basically feed it, you know, your larger scale information, and it will give you a generated AI, generative AI-based LES output. Now, he also said there are. He also said, there are artifacts. It's not a physics-based model. It's trained on physics-based models, right? But it's not a physics-based model. You know, I think there's definitely scope for that to develop. I think there's a lot of potential in that, but there's also a lot of danger. So it needs to be done extraordinarily carefully. I think it's. Yeah, I don't, I'm not aware of there being on the horizon any kind of transformative breakthrough in the way we do things. And I mean, that just might be my own myopia. I don't know. But it is, it's one of these, you know, to go back to this description of turbulence as the great unsolved problem of classical physics. It still remains, right, that problem. And so we have these pragmatic approaches. I think, just to give an indication of how hard the problem is, this is one thing I like to describe when I teach atmospheric physics. We all like to make jokes about how bad the weather forecasts are. They're remarkably good and they're getting better. Computationally based, you know, Based, you know, computer-based numerical weather prediction begins experimentally in the 1940s. And then in the 1950s, there's first steps towards operational approaches. So that is now seven decades of operational numeric weather prediction. You can, of course, look back at past predictions and get a sense of how they perform compared to contemporary predictions, and then you can compare them on some common metric and And for something like predicting the state of the atmosphere five kilometers above the surface, so say the waves or the temperatures up there, which is important for large-scale weather forecasting. Those, the quality of those predictions, the skill of those predictions have increased steadily over the past seven decades at a rate of one day per decade. So that a three-day forecast now is as skillful as a two-day forecast. Is as skillful as a two-day forecast was 10 years ago. And that rate of improvement, that linear rate of improvement, has been more or less steady for seven decades. Now contrast that with Moore's law and the growth of computational power. It's just getting harder and harder and harder to get that kind of extra piece of information from a weather prediction point of view. Yeah, so I like that as an example of the fact that, first off, this is actually one of the huge scientific success stories of the 20th century, is numerical weather prediction. It's just, it feels very ordinary to us because we live with it all the time, but it's amazing how transformative that has been. But it's always been hard. And in some technical sense, it's getting harder and harder. Well, I think Trisha has a question. I'm sorry, I think we opened it up. Are there questions online? Okay, just a question, a quick question here. Given data based on the shape of the wind speed and its distribution, its skewedness, can conclusions be made? Can conclusions be made about whether the wind speed is from the ocean or the land just by data and the skewedness of it, the distribution of the wind speed? I would say yes and no. I would say that there are certain features. So, for example, if you have a very, very strong bidality in your wind speed distribution, that's a hard thing to get over the ocean physically, whereas over land, Whereas over land, if you know you're near some sort of topographic feature, so that the characteristic of the flow is very different depending on what direction the prevailing winds are from. And in contrast, you know, if you have a mean wind speed of like a mean wind speed of 10, 12 meters per second, that's pretty hard to get over land. But you can get it over the ocean. I mean, there's not many places where the average I mean, there's not many places where the average wind speed on land is 40 kilometers an hour. So, to an extent, yes, but only when you're kind of looking at the sort of the, I don't want to call them outlier, but the more at special cases. In general, you know, if you have something with a wind speed of, I mean, wind speed of five meters per second and a positive. Per second and a positively skewed distribution that's unimodal, then you know you could get that in a lot of different physical settings.
