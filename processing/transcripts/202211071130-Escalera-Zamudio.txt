So, I'm really happy to be here and share with you some of my preliminary advances and also a bit of the research I've been doing for the last five years. And I will give you a break from COVID at the beginning of the talk, and then we will go into COVID again. But I just want to highlight the importance of using genomic epidemiology-based approaches coupled with phylodynamics to study in a more comprehensive way. In a more comprehensive way, outbreak occurrence and integrating different research scopes. So, briefly about me, because not everybody, most maybe most people don't know who I am. Well, I was born here in Mexico and I studied biology and then I did my master's in Cornavaca. And after that, I had the chance to go to Berlin where I studied my PhD and I worked. My PhD, and I worked with viruses in bats at the moment. And after that, I moved to Oxford, where I have been working for the last five years until now. And my research, I've always been interested in studying the ecological interactions that there are between viruses and their reservoirs or hosts, and trying to understand how these ecological interactions may actually impact evolutionary processes in both reservoirs and virus populations. Recibros and virus populations. So, I really like studying adaptative processes and those mutational pathways that may actually lead to the emergence of high virulence or risky virulent phenotypes in viruses. So I don't work with any particular virus. I work with any pandemic virus, RNA virus that is considered a threat to global health. In that sense, I work with SARS, influenza, both human. With SARS, influenza, both human and avian, LASA, and I also work with the host populations. And as I said, what I'm interested in is studying the immune variability of the host populations, the viral origins and spread patterns, and particularly understanding the virus host dynamics in terms of what are the potential drivers of the emergence of high-risk genotypes and phenotypes in viruses. So, as you know, genomic epidemiology is a very useful tool for exploring disease dynamics in the context of different scenarios. So, it is through genomic epidemiology that we can understand how an outbreak is emerging, how is it changing, where the mutations are occurring, new variants, and so on and so on. So, and the importance of genomic epidemiology, of course, have been highlighted by SAR-COV2 and what we have lived in. And what we have lived in the last three years. So, before it already existed, people like me and others were working already with it, but now it just became very apparent and clear how important it actually is. However, the study of disease dynamics should be placed within specific ecological and social settings. So, I think there is still a very big breach between what people do with genomic epidemiology and the driver. Epidemiology and the drivers behind disease dynamics, and how these drivers are very, very changeable or diverse according to the regions or the places that we study, and also what virus populations in which ecological settings we're studying them. So the World Heritage Organization has a strategic plan to improve pandemic preparedness, in which they have highlighted the importance of bridging different cross-collaborations and research areas. Cross-collaborations and research areas in the science field, and also highlighting the importance of linking applied to basic research. And of course, this also comes with a lot of the problematics that need to be solved in the sense of resource allocation and capacity across the world, in which we still have a very big problem in terms of the responses of different countries to the. Different countries to the pandemic in terms of their capacity and the problematic of data sharing and how we can resolve these issues to work together and not separately. Because, as you know, the responses have been very, very distinct and we need to sort of make them come together. And that can only happen tackling the inequalities and the differences across locations. So, in that sense, for example, if we use local and other social and anthropological Anthropological derived data from a region, we can tailor what the public health policies in specific regions and populations, and we can inform how these can be tailored to that population and how likely is the population to adhere to non-pharmaceutical interventions, for example. And in terms of how we can get a more comprehensive understanding of outbreaks, we can try. Understanding of outbreaks, we can try to integrate what we, the knowledge that we have on basic applied science, particularly on the molecular mechanisms of disease emergence, with data that could also inform how to enhance surveillance models. And with that, we can have a comprehensive or more global understanding of what's happening, and we can also identify common trends in disease dynamics. So, in that scenario, I'm gonna briefly touch on this. To briefly touch on the importance of studying convergence in viruses at different scales. So, when we speak about convergence from a basic science scope, we might think about a molecular scale where convergence may be represented by re-emerging or re-occurring mutations in independent viral populations. However, these mutations need to be associated somehow with adaptative processes. So, we're not talking about just mutations that So, we're not talking about just mutations that recur and re-emerge constantly. And these could be happening because of many, many drivers such as linkage and so on. But we're talking about those mutations that may actually represent biological significance in the virus populations that we study. And from the applied science scope, convergence can also be defined as common trends in the epidemiological behaviors of independent virus populations. Speaking of truly unrelated viruses. Truly unrelated viruses or viruses that have a common origin, for example, different SAR-COV2 lineages. So, in that sense, if we identify what are the social or diverse drivers behind disease dynamics, and we see that there's common trends, then we can, of course, manage better ongoing outbreaks, and we can also predict behaviors of future outbreaks when we use these as proxies. So, convergence. As proxies. So, convergence evidenced both at a molecular level when we're speaking about applied research, basic science research, or at a different scale, a larger scale, talking about epidemiological convergence raises the possibility of predicting pathways. This is quite controversial, but we can set up the foundations of trying to understand common evolutionary processes and also recognizing common trends and the drivers of disease dynamics in different ways. Drivers of disease dynamics in different regions of the world. So, in that sense, I will talk about exploring evolutionary convergence and how we develop a method to try to understand or to pick those mutations that might have a biological consequence and relevance. And this methodology was applied to several viruses, but I would just use as an example our work on high. As an example, our work on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that circulate in domestic and wild bird populations. So, in that sense, avian flu is a concern to global health. There is a continuous circulation in wild and domestic bird populations. And every year, there's a seasonal fluctuation, and every year there's outbreaks of low-path and high-path viruses in the bird populations. The bird populations, and this causes a huge economic loss in terms of the economic power of what we're dealing with, but also raises the possibility or the chances of transmission to human populations. So since 2003, there have been sporadic infections of H5N1 viruses that have a very high mortality rate in humans. And as of March 2022, it's already a bit outdated, but there's Already a bit outdated, but there's continuous detection of these cases. And these viruses do pose a severe threat to human health. And as an example of this is also the outbreak of H7N9 viruses that was detected in China for over five years and caused like over 500 deaths. So it is something that we have to keep our efforts in the surveillance of these viruses. Viruses. So, what is interesting about avian influenza viruses is that they display two different phenotypes. The first one is a highly pathogenic phenotype and a low pathogenic phenotype. And we're talking about bird populations here. We're not talking about humans because in humans, they cause a severe disease, whatever they are, if they're high path or low path. But in terms of bird populations, highly pathogenic phenotypes cause a very high mortality rate. And it's quite interesting because it's a phenotype that is. Because it's a phenotype that is strongly linked to a specific genotype. And this genotype is a polybasic leverage site that is in the HA, which is a hemagglutinin protein, which is a main viral receptor and anti-immunogenic target. And this polybasic cleavage site now has the insertion of one or more basic residues in the site and is recognized by proteases that are distributed in many different tissues of the. In many different tissues of the animals, and then causes a systemic infection. So, that is a very clear link of a phenotype that is linked to a highly variable genotype, actually, because it varies a lot. So, and this is me sampling in Abbotsbury in UK, surveillance of highly pathogenic avian flu, and it was very terrifying, I must say. So, it doesn't make it easier if you are like terrified of the. Easier if you are like terrified of this population that you are surveilling. It was really, really hard work. So, going back to avian flu, here in the map, we can see that what I was telling you, that the phenotype is independently emerging across different regions of the world and time and space. So, in the map, there are the recorded outbreaks of AVM flu for the H7NX subtype. An NX subtype, and these have been recorded since 1963. I think the sampling for this study was done until 2017. And you can see that these emerge in different parts of the world and they correspond to different virus subtypes. So you have sometimes H7N3, H7N9, so on, so on. And the virus populations that cause a given outbreak display a very specific, unique polybasic clearage site. Polybasic cleared site that is different to the others. And this is also reflected when you build a phylogenetic tree of the sequences of the HA, you see that these actually correspond to independent genotypes that are emerging across time and space. And this pattern is also recognizable with the other genome segments, not only with HA. So it's very clear that these viruses are emerging independently, acquiring a polybasic cleavage site, and then disappearing and causing outbreaks. So we know that we know what's causing hypotheses. We know that is the polybasic cleavage site. But we don't know if there's actually any mutations that would stabilize this given genotype prior to its emergence because they die off. So it doesn't seem to be very stable. So as a proxy, we used the emergence of mutations that were permissive or compensatory for the case. Compensatory for the case of H1N1 human influenza viruses. There's some mutations that stabilize the drug-resistant phenotype in human flu. So these mutations emerge immediately before the mutation that is stabilizing the drug-resistant phenotype. And we thought that maybe this was the case again with avian influenza viruses. So what was happening in the trunk of the tree just before the emergence of the polybasic cleavage? Before the emergence of the polybasic cleavage site. So that led us to the research question: are there permissive compensatory mutations playing a role in the emergence of the high path phenotype? So for that, we developed a pipeline that was based on both phylogenetic-based approaches and mostly comparative phylogenetics to try to identify mutations that emerge repeatedly. Repeatedly in a phylogenetic tree, and that could be associated with a specific phenotype of interest, in this case, HyPath. So, how we do that is we have to take into consideration, of course, the evolutionary history of the trait, because if we just use, for example, a chi-square and check for association and we don't see that there's a correlation between the data, then we will get false positives. So, we have to use a phylogenetic trees to understand. Use a phylogenetic trees to understand if there's true independence in the phenotypes or genotypes that we are looking into. And of course, these tools only work when there has been like a very successful sampling genomic-based surveillance of the viruses in question. So with flu, we're very lucky because it's one of the best studied viruses prior to COVID. So we had like loads of samples from 67, 63 until the present. So we had a very good sampling and then we had a robust stream which we can look into the mutations that were. Which we can look into the mutations that were happening. And so once we detect these mutations, we used a phylogenetic statistical approach to check for these associations. And then we searched for cumulative evidence that could lead us to think that these might have relevance in terms of the biological implications or functions in the virus. So we first check for evidence of positive selection, and then what we do is contextualize the mutations that we've Is contextualize the mutations that we find in terms of structural biology to see what these mutations might be impacting a specific function in the protein per se. So this is a general pipeline and we used it to screen the genomes, complete viral genomes of both the H7 and H5 virus subtypes, because that's where the high path phenotype is restricted to. However, because I don't have time, I won't have, I won't go into. I won't go into details about all the mutations that we find. I'll just go into this mutation at site 143 of the H7 hemagglutinin. And here what we find is that out of nine clusters that we identify as specific outbreaks, we see that this mutation from A to T is happening in five out of nine of these clusters. So under our model, we see So, under our model, we see that there's a significant association here linked to the hypat phenotype. And under our pipeline, we also see that this mutation was evolving under diversifying positive selection using several methods. And when we contextualized the protein in terms of structural biology, we found that it was located in the globular head of the HA. So, and it was in an So, and it was in an antigenic pocket site. So, what we can see is that it is very likely that it's contributing either pleiotropically or alone to antigenic escape. So, through this pipeline, we get a mutational panel that is scored across all genome segments. And that is how we found evidence that there are several mutations that might involve different functions, different viral functions that may precede the emergence of a polybasic levocyte. And we find this consistently. side and we find this consistently both the h7 and h5 viral subtypes we see mutations related to antigenic escape host immune modulations for those occurring between in the pb2 and s segments and also those related to viral replication efficiency in these viruses so these kind of studies if you couple them with strong genomic surveillance that is longitudinal constant in the populations that are relevant That are relevant may function as early detection systems. So, if you're surveilling the viruses, you see these mutations emerging, you keep an eye on those viral populations, and then you might get some predictive power of what's going to happen in terms of the emergence of the hypothalphenotype. However, this is only a natural replicating experiment that will only confirm as we have better and better surveillance. So, in terms of So, in terms of exploring epidemiological convergence, I will talk to you about the work that I've done in terms of the global COVID response. And this work was done as a result of international collaboration between the University of Oxford and the Ministry of Health here in Mexico and also several academic and public health sector institutions. So, it was a very big work, many people working together, sharing a lot. Sharing a lot of the different resources and data sets that they had, and highlighting again the importance of bringing together academic and public health. So Mexico was one of the hardest hit countries by COVID in Latin America, with over 7 million cases up to date, more or less recorded until now, and epidemiological curve fluctuated in five peaks recorded. In five peaks recorded September this year. So early from the beginning of the local epidemic in Mexico, there were several efforts to allocate resources for the surveillance of the virus in the country. And the Mexican Consortium of Genome Sequencing was formed in February 2021. And it was right now, I think there's over 70,000 genomes. 50,000 genomes from Mexico. Around one-third of these were done or sequenced by the consortium together with other institutions. And it was quite, I think it's quite a remarkable effort of what Mexico did because it was quite powerful to see what lineages were circulating in what regions of the country. And we could understand the curve of dynamics, dominance dynamics in the various within the country compared to a neighborhood. Within the country compared to neighboring regions like the States. So, and once we had so many genomes, of course, we could do many, many interesting analysis and we could do some robust phylogenetic inference and so on. So, we decided to compare what were the transmission and evolutionary epidemiological dynamics of different lineages that were predominating in Mexico during the first year of the epidemic. So, up to date, over 200 Up to date, over 200 different viral images were detected to circulate in Mexico, including all VOCs. However, you can compare the dynamics and the presence of these viruses compared to other regions, and you can see that Mexico displayed very particular dynamics compared to other countries. So, for example, we have here in the red box the dominant lineages relative to others in the country, and we see Others in the country. And we see that first came 222 and 519, which were endemic to Mexico and the US and dominated in the country. And then there was the introduction of alpha and gamma that actually never dominated across the region like they did in the US and Brazil, for example. And then was the introduction of Delta and just took over absolutely everything. So this study was just before the introduction of home recurrence. Was just before the introduction of Omicron. So we're just looking before the first year of the epidemic. And what is quite interesting here is that you can see that the genome sampling frequency also coincides with the different epidemiological peaks. So you have there 222, and then that coincides with the first peak, with the first wave of infection in the country. And then you have 519, and again, that happens. And then you have Alpha and Gamma, and those coincide with the valley. So it's quite interesting. Valley, so it's quite interesting what's happening there because they never dominated, and then you have Delta and the peak exploded, and then you have Omicron and another peak. So, so we were trying to see what was going on there for us was quite interesting. So, our results revealed contrasting dynamics, but with similar patterns that we could observe. So, for these 2 to 2 and 519 lineages that were determined to be endemic to the region of North America, we North America, we did some phylogeographic analysis and actually found that it was very likely that these two lineages were sampled, even though they had been sampled more robustly in the US. We had much more genomes from the US. When comparing to Mexico, it is very, very likely that these lineages actually emerge in Mexico and then spread multiple times back and forth between Mexico and the US during the first year. And also, there was the dominance of over 60. And also, there was a dominance of over 16 months in both of these lineages. What is quite interesting regarding the previous talks that we had is that 519 directly descends from 222. So there was a nested evolution there happening. There was only three mutations in terms of non-synonymous mutations that were happening there that marked a big difference in terms of dominance and spread of this lineage in the country. So that was two similar dynamics. That was two similar dynamics. And when we compared what was happening with ALFRA and Gamma, we see very different patterns. So, first of all, these were characterized by multiple introduction events into Mexico from abroad with many transmission chains. However, very few of these resulted in successful transmission chains. So, let's say from 100 that we identify, only seven clusters resulted in large clusters of transmission clusters. And the same, very simple. Transmission clusters. And the same, very similar patterns were observed also in terms of the distribution, the geographic distribution of the transmission chains for these two lineages. So this is the genome sampling. And you can see here that there's, of course, like an enhanced sampling in the north of Mexico for alpha and an enhanced sampling for the south in Mexico. But this is just genome sampling. When you do phylogenographic analysis, you see that most of the cluster for both cases. You see that most of the cluster for both cases come from the south. So, genome sampling doesn't necessarily reflect what is happening actually in terms of transmission in a country. So, yeah, that's a very important thing to take into consideration. And then came Delta, and we sampled Delta, and we see again a similar dynamic in the sense that there were many introduction events, but very few transmission chains. But what we can see here is the size of the cluster. Can see here is the size of the clusters is completely different to what we were seeing before, right? So we see huge clusters. Of course, the sampling got better in the country and the sequencing got better. However, when you normalize these, you can see that these huge clusters actually correspond to transmission chains. And you see that these behave very, very differently. So you have cluster 5D that was quite centralized, no, sorry, cluster 6D that is quite centralized in the center of the country. Centralized in the center of the country and then spread from the center to other states, but mostly was contained in Mexico City and the surrounding state of Mexico. And then you have this other cluster 5D that is hyperdiverse. So it's been sampling both in Mexico and the United States. It's composed of four different sub-lineages of delta. So it's talking about like a virus diversity there that is very, very high. And you can also see within the And you can also see within the country sampling in all 32 states. So we see very, very different behaviors there. And when we did some phylographic analysis coupled with human mobility data, we see that the state of Chapas in the south plays or played a key role in the dissemination, diffusion process of the virus across the country. However, not all viral movements could be explained by the mobility patterns of serving within the country. Served within the country. So there's evidence that maybe movements from other countries into Mexico may have played a very important role, but we don't have genomic representation of neighboring countries from Mexico except the US. So that's also a very important bias that we have to consider. What happened there? Well, and conclusions for this is that SARSIOVITO and Mexico had very unique dynamics. Mexico had very unique dynamics, and this is probably happening in other countries. So, it is important to notice the differences because what happened in the US and the UK, the best sample countries, doesn't necessarily reflect what is going on in other places, especially the dynamics. Traveling by plane is not what's happening necessarily in Mexico, driving the disease, is movements of people and particularly unregulated migration. We see a congruency with the spread. We see a congruency with the spread of C5D in Mexico that is congruent with unregulated migration. So, this is something that needs to be explored. So, tailoring those details will give us more information on how spread is happening in the country. So, I have three minutes left, and in that sense, I would like to briefly introduce this project that I'm establishing now as a solid research line that is also based on the same principles of exploring evolutionary. Principles of exploring evolutionary and epidemiological convergence in different viruses. So the basis of the project is establishing a network for sharing data in which we have a strong connection with academic and public health sector in Mexico. And the idea is that we build trust to share the data, to generate and exploit new data, and to generate comprehensive analysis that are to be integrated through spatial or epidemiological. Through spatial or epidemiological-based approaches. And as I said, the project is developed in Mexico as a case study, but has a capacity of expanding to other places of the world because it is searching for creatable, scalable models that could be applied in different regions. And it also involves genomic surveillance of cohort populations, and one of them is hospitals, frontiers, borders. Hospitals, frontiers, borders, or markets. And in that sense, two pilot projects have been developed so far. The first one was carried out with the National Reference Lab here, part of the Ministry of Health and PAHOM. And this study involved a retrospective study using historical sample collections that they have there. So they have fridges full of samples of anything, and there's no capacity to sequence them. So it's so valuable to go back. So it's so valuable to go back and see what has happened there. So we decided to study these, focusing on Chikucuna, Denge 1, and Dengue 2 that are endemic in the country. And again, what is quite interesting is that we see the same pattern, almost the same pattern as we saw for SARS-O-COV2. So we see multiple introductions, in this case, very likely from Central America, and a subsequent viral spread from the south. Again, I put it there in the red box. Again, I put it there in the red box, state of Chapas, into the rest of the country. And again, this spread pattern, coupled with human mobility, we see that there is a strong congruency with unregulated human migration. So you can't stop people from moving, but you can provide them services and see how we can ameliorate the situation there. So it is quite striking. So what we find for Chikuncunya and Denge also was found independently for Sika. So again, Sika is. Sika. So again, Sika introduced into the state of Chapa with a subsequent spread. So I think I'm trying to make a case here of how convergence has different scales and understanding convergence from a molecular level to an applied size to applied scope that can actually inform public policy health, public policy making is quite important and can really lead us to. And can really lead us to understand how to control outbreaks and predict behavior. And with that, I would like to end my thought with my favorite quote in biology. And I'm happy to take any questions that you might have. So I don't know how it works. I think I can maybe I'll stop sharing for now or yeah. Can I steal the mic maybe? Yeah, sure. Okay, okay. We'll go back to. Great. Thanks. Thanks, Marina. That's excellent. So I think we're at lunchtime, but what I'm Lunchtime, but what I'm going to suggest is that we take like we have an hour and a half about for lunch. So we'll do the breakout rooms first if each speaker is okay with that before taking a real lunch break. So we'll do the same thing. Daniel in breakout room one, Marina in breakout room two, and the people here will try to sort out. Try to sort out how we're going to do it. So I guess with that, right? So we'll do the breakout rooms and then it will be lunch. And then there's a group photo, which I'm not sure. Are we, I guess we're going to do that for the people here? And are the Zoom people going to do like?
