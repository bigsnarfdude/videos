Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being in my talk, and it's a great pleasure to be here with you. Thank you for the invitation. So my talk will be on stochastic waves, on metric graphs and their genealogies. So waves here is not a wave equation, it's just a solution to some reaction diffusion equation or stochastic reaction diffusion equations. Categorization diffusion equations. And those equations model some forward in time population dynamics. And so those populations might expand in space and with some certain speed in a certain directions. And we're interested in the speed of expansion. And also we are interested in their genealogy. That means imagine we pick some samples in the current time. That's what we observed. And then we want to understand the genealogies of the picked sample. Of the paked sample. So we also are interested in the sort of retrospective point of view. And it seems like in this conference, there are interest in stochastic PD on different spaces. Here, space is metagraphs, essentially one-dimensional object, but we're focusing on non-compact ones. So because we're interested in long-time wave speed. So there's a non-compact metro graph. So, this is a non-compact metro graph typically. And the stochastic to the noise is a space-time white noise in this talk, which sort of arise naturally in population dynamics. So let me give some motivation before going to the math. So the general question in spatial pop genes is the one to understand general principle governing the dynamics and the genealogies of interacting populations. So this is just a schematic. So this is just a schematic, you know, graph figure showing some population with different genetic types invading over space over time. And then, but what we don't observe the whole history, right? In, I don't know, cancer growth or human population or virus infection. We don't see everything. What we see is probably some sample, picked sample, maybe. I don't know, swap data from COVID patients. I don't know, swap data from COVID patients. And then we want to understand the genealogy, right? And so this, there are some mathematical formulation of this and very long history. If you forget about space, just like a well-mixed, right? We just care about what's the density of a population over time, then one of the most studied model is the right-fused diffusion, which is this stochastic differential equation. Diffusion, which is this stochastic differential equation, it's a stochastic ODE. Somehow the pointer is not aligning to what I'm pointing to, but this right-fusser diffusion, stochastic ODE, arise sort of robust, have some robustness in the sense that it arises as the limit of different models, like the Rift Fisher model, like this one. Basically, from one generation to the next, a children is picking their parents uniformly at random, and then we will adopt the genetic type of the parents. Type of the parent. And then from generation one, generation two, generation three, and then you know, so on. And then suppose initially there are, let's say, one-third of them are genetic type A, and then two-thirds are of type B. And then over time, you know, the fraction of type A will change. And then the fraction of type A, you know, under rescaling in the sense that when the total population size goes to infinity and one unit of time is n generation, then this SDE will pop out. We pop out. And also, more general reproduction dynamics, the canning model, meaning that every person is an exchangeable model. No space, every person gives birth to a random number of children, but then it has a constraint to have the same population size at the end. Then it would be like a kind of a multinomial, generalized multinomial distribution. If the tail behavior is not bad, If the tail behavior is not bad, then this SD also arrives. And also, not just that, but the backward in-time genealogy will also converge to a random tree that is also robust. And that tree is called a Kingman tree. So in well-mixed case, this question I study a lot. And by maybe in your stochastic processes class, we talk about birth death process, markup chain. You may also talk about this in the discrete sense. In the discrete sense, of course, there are a lot of generalizations, right? Spatial version. If you heard of this measure value process incorporating different genetic mutation matrix. So Tom Kurtz, Moran, Peter Donnelly, Pittman, a lot of people have studied this model and different generalization. Oftentimes, the whole machinery is that you introduce a forward in time population dynamic, and then now you pick. Population dynamic. And then now you pick a sample at a current time, you go backward and then see if there's any scaling limit. And so this has been studied a lot. Now come back to this case with space. We want to understand what is sort of long time behavior, what is extinct, of course, can go extinct, and what's the extinction probability of each type. Each type, um, what's the probability of co-coexistence right in space? We also are interested in the range of the speed of expansion, the structure of the tree. Um, and there are some mathematical results proven for model, but and there's some a lot is not known. But the general idea is that if the population is the mutations are neutral, so one color does not have. So, one color does not have an advantage of the other color, then the tree is mostly like a Kingman tree still. But if one type has a very large advantage over another, then the tree shape will be different. It can have even multiple mergers. And it's well described by, for exchange model, is well described by the Lambda coalescence. But in this talk, do you always assume that there are only two different genetics? Are two only two different genetic types? No, uh, we can uh people look at infinitely many type even the infinitely alley model, they call, and then for those they have sampling formula, the U1 sampling formula, and and and different. So, so no, usually the genetic type can be a lot. And one of the contributions of Tom Kirk's earlier work is on is look at even the type space is uncountable. So, they can define processes on. So, they can define processes on. But the number of genome types are fixed, or they can change, or it can change over time. Yeah, the existing types can change. It can disappear, yeah. Typically, if you don't introduce mutation, it will disappear and it can be. So, in this case, or in this picture, it is showing a scenario of expanding population. And then typically, what we see is that near the wave front, only one color. The wave front, only one color remains, in this case, the red color. But if you do another simulation, it can be the green color. And then, so people ask, what's the probability of seeing the red rather than the green near the tip? So this is a so-called this decrease in genetic diversity is observed in expanding population. And there are some rigorous results. But, for example, for humans, it is known that. It is known that if you use our genome data and then measure some kind of genetic diversity, it will be a decreasing function over geographic distance from Africa. And so then there is some suggestion that human population sort of migrate away from Africa. So I don't think in this talk we have time to talk about the tree, mostly focusing on the four in-time population dynamics. Focusing on the four in-time population dynamics. And classically, we use reaction diffusion to model population dynamics, right? So just a quick recall, it is a heat equation like this, right? Where u tx is maybe the population density at time t and location x. And if you add a reaction term f of u, then it would be some spatial diffusion together with some. Together with some reaction, might be birth that process, right? And if f of u is of this particular form, f of u is beta times u times 1 minus u, it is basically diffusion with local logistic growth, right? There's some finite resource that preventing it from growing to infinity. This equation has a special name. It's called the FKPP equation. It was introduced by Fisher to model the spatial spread of an advantage. The spatial spread of an advantageous gene over space. And mathematically, we know it's one of the simplest models that exhibits traveling wave phenomena. And the wave speed is studied by proved by many people, right? We know if alpha is the diffusion coefficient and beta is the local logistic growth rate, then the long time linear speed is 2 times square root alpha times beta. Maybe an open question is: what if we spread this wave on a fraction? Is what if we spread this wave on a fractal? The speed might not be even linear, right? And that different proof, of course, this reaction time can be replaced by a different reaction function as long as it is monostable. Yes, in the sense that, so here zero is, sorry, let's say one is unstable, zero is stable. And then typically it will have a wave speed. Typically, it will have a wave speed. And the wave speed, in that case, this beta will be replaced by the derivative of that function f of u at zero. So if you talk about genealogy, we need to understand what is an individual in a PD or stochastic PD, right? And that's why we need to understand how this equation arises from discrete dynamics. It is for the stochastic. It is for the stochastic FKPP equation, which is the FKPP plus this noise term. I will talk about this in the next few slides. But it is known that it arises in various discrete models, including Moran model, the Bias-Wooden model, birth-death process, etc. And this noise, gamma, is like the reciprocal of the effective local population size. So, roughly speaking, if you look at the population size up here, Size up here, scale is m, then m times the distance that each individual will interact with will be this one over gamma. So it is conceivable, right? If the populations get larger, the noise gets smaller. And that's quantified. But this is not the goal of the talk. The talk is about just the PD, a stochastic PD, not about the discrete system. So we focus on this stochastic PD. So, we focus on this stochastic FKPP on the real line, where W is a space-time Gaussian white noise. And this picture is taken from During Mueller and Smirker's paper. It is a snapshot of the stochastic FKPP. This fluctuating curve is that. And we see that there's a point here where it is exactly zero onward. And there's a point up there, which is exactly one on the left. On the left, which is in contrast to the deterministic case. And there are different properties that is proven for this SPD. Here's a list. For positive time, it's always strictly between zero and one. Yeah, but was it the solution to the deterministic equation? The smooth curve? I think so. I have to double-check that paper. But we know that. Check their paper, but we know that we know mathematically we can prove that for that deterministic case is always true equation zero and one. Um, and and for the stochastic, yes? Stochastic one always below? That's a good question. Uh, and the answer should be no in general, but for small noise, typically it is, which is uh typically means with large probability or um maybe in this sense, this is the last bullet point. This is the last bullet point will sort of answer your question. So, yeah, so maybe let me answer right now. So, the answer is that the speed for the stochastic FKPP for small noise is slower. It is proven. So, this first term is the speed of the deterministic case, right? And then it has to subtract by a positive constant times this log gamma minus two. For gamma, small enough. For gamma, big, the situation can be. A big, uh, the situation can be different, uh, and there are some recent results by Carmula, uh, but um, it's, you know, we know very specific properties, like asymptotic when noise goes to infinity, but not for fixed noise. And when you say speed, that is u when t goes to infinity? Yes, when t goes to infinity, we look at the location when the solution is at value of 0.7, for example, or one half. For example, or one half. Yeah, so this is a list of what is proven for this stochastic FTPP. We know it arrives from discrete model. We study somehow is backward lineage dynamic. We know a wavefront is formed. The compact containment is that if we start with the compact initial condition, then for all time, the solution will have compact support. The solution will have compact support. And also, extinction can occur now, which cannot occur in the deterministic case. And this is the formula. And then speed is also known. But there are also something not known, maybe open problem again. Strong existent and strong uniqueness for this is not known. All right. And Carmilla, I think, said that there are at least. Carmila, I think, said that there are at least two wrong proofs, right? Is cow here? Hi, Cal. No, so uh, yeah, so uh, and also what is not known strong existence, strong uniqueness. Oh, okay. And also, if you restrict the space to the space of continuous function taking values between zero and one, uh, this Uh, this is also not known, but I think the answer is yes, but I don't know. All right, so still, there are a lot not known here. And so now look at the equation we are trying to address. Oh, okay. But before that, let's look at this stochastic ration diffusion equation on Rn. Well, in this conference, we all know this, the notion of mild solution, and we know that it depends on the And we know that it depends on the transition density ptxy of the diffusion on the space, right? And we know that typically speaking for space-time white noise, dimension two is sort of ill-posed. And we know because if you compute, let's say the variance of this is infinite, the heat current is too singular. So for specifying the stochastic FKPP, it is also the case. KPP, it is also the case. This is another open problem, right? For dimension two or above. And usually we discretize space or modify the noise, but here we look at a metric graph or essentially one-dimensional space. Well, actually, some fractal can be made sense of, right? So this is the class of equation. So this metric graph, right? These are examples of metric graphs. So the real line itself is a metric graph. So, the real line itself is a metric graph with one edge, no vertex. The circle is a metric graph with one edge, no vertex, and compact. The interval, unit interval, is a metric graph with one edge and two vertices, etc. And it can bypass the Europoseness and still allow us to study the effect of space, which is important. And the notion of solution, again, is the depend on the heat kernel. kernel um and in general it can be it's only a sub-Markovian kernel and uh yeah Fredlin uh Sandra and Fradlin explicitly studied this equation and as a scaling limit of two-dimensional SPD when one of the directions have a very fast time scale and the scales to converge to stochastic PD on a metric graph right and Right. And yeah, and here we look at a little bit more general boundary conditions and non-compact space. So an example is, let's forget the noise, just peep equation, right? The PD, FKPP on a tree, we spread on a tree, what is the speed? Would it be faster? Would it be slower? And it turns out that speed might not even exist. Speed might not even exist at all. So, this is in contrast with the FKPP on the real line, which always have a speed as long as beta is positive. So, here we need beta to be big enough relative to the degree of the tree. Maybe an open problem again related to Mickey's talk is that, okay, now if this tree is spreading more and more, will the blow up be harder, right? Will it destroy the blow up? Right? Will it destroy the blow up? Right? I don't know. That's another. Conceivably it will. So, what is the role played by the vertex and the vertexes? Oh, yes, I should spend more time on this. So, there's boundary condition at a vertex set, right? So, let's assume this is zero. So, basically, it's just no flux boundary condition. The Cherkov boundary condition. So, flow in equals flow out. Condition. So flow in equals flow out. Mathematically, it's a sum of the outward derivative at the vertex is equal to zero. Yes. But what happens to the wave at the vertex? You have this traveling wave. Like, what does it look like? Oh, yeah. It would spread out. It would go down, spread out. Yeah, it would. It picks a branch or it's like this is a PDE, not a stochastic PDE. So it will go out everywhere. And if it is a regular tree, And if it is a regular tree, basically every branch is the same, right? So you just spread out whenever it reaches a vertex, it will keep, it will still move, and then the mass will decrease by a half here, right? Or, you know, by three times, right? It was just spreading, spreading. So the critical, so I should show that. So the result we got, okay, is for this equation. The next slide we show the result. So this is the FKPP. So this is the FKPP PDE on deregulatory with the vector D is, you know, we allow the degree to be different at different levels, but the degrees at each level have to be the same. So it is still some kind of regular symmetric. And the L, the branch length, can also be a vector, which can change from different levels, L1, L2, L3. L3. And actually, our result covers IIDK, so the tree can be random. So a PD on a random tree. That's what we're looking at at the end. So basically, there are three points of our results. So there's a critical birth rate beta, which depends on the tree, such that if the birth rate is greater than that parameter, then a wavefront is formed. formed and we have asymptotic speed existence of asymptotic speed which is the same almost surely in the sense that if we pick IID D and IID L right but almost all realization of D and L there will be the same C star so the C star is the same for almost all realization of the random tree if they are IID and the formula And the formula is very complicated in terms of a variational formula, but it's still kind of explicit in terms of a large deviation rate function. And we can show that it is strictly less than square root 2 beta, which is the speed of the real line case, except when d is 2. Maybe let me show a special case. Special case when it is a deregulatory, so the vector d is the same, all of them are d, and with branch length l, then the critical birth rate is this number, d over d minus 2 over l d log d minus 1. And when d is 2, it will be zero. There's it reduced to the real line case. And the asymptotic speed is this guy. This tree is not random. Is not random for this corollary. This tree is deterministic. Yes, it is the direct tree. It's when the IID distribution is a direct delta. All of them are the same. And I do idea of proof is, you know, Feynman, basically, the good thing about looking at the regular tree is that it can sort of reduce to a one-dimensional case, right? If you look at this. If you look at this equation on the tree, via the Feynman-Cart transformula, we can write the solution in terms of a grounding motion on the tree. And then for the Brownian motion on the tree, when it hit the vertex here, it will have two-thirds probability to go to the right and one-third probability to go to the left, right? And then so basically the wave on a single semi-infinite A single semi-infinite branch can be written in terms of a random motion on the just a line. But then when it hits a vertex here, it will have a skew, right? Two-thirds go to the right, one-third go to the left. So the whole question now reduced to a last deviation principle for this kind of skill or multi-scale branding motion on the real line, right? And then so Felden-Wenzel theory allows us to. Theory allows us to do that. And because we're looking at random tree, the last duration turns out that we adopt the idea of James Nolan and Jackson about large deviation for a random walk in a random environment. The random environment is like a random tree. And the characterization of the last deviation function is in terms of the Is in terms of some iterated Merbes transform. It just turns out. So let me get on this slide. Let me tell you how to find the speed. So how to find the speed heuristically. So this is the Feynman-Cart formula, right? Projected on a single semi-infinite branch. So this Y is the multi-scale brand in motion. This is the solution. Now we can see the red. We can see the red term here as an exponential growth into the beta, right? As long as v is smaller one, so it's sort of further away near the tip. But this exponential term will be nothing if the first blue term is zero, right? So this blue term is non-zero only if y t for large time t is back to sort of the origin. Is back to sort of the origin, the initial location, which is last deviation event. And then, so by quantifying, you know, the last deviation of this yt for t large in terms of the lattice rate function, basically equating how big these two terms are, right? This rate growth rate is either the beta, this growth rate is related to the last deviation rate function. We equate it and then solve it. It and then solve it. It turns out to be correct. So, yeah, so this is how we get the proof. So, what if, so next question now is, what if there's noise? Oh, okay, I need to go faster. Then it's much harder, right? What is speed even? Because now, different branches, it can be different. But before that, it can. But before that, it can go extinct. So, what we get as the first exercise is to compute the extinction probability on the tree. And that's what we did with my student Johnny. We get an explicit formula for this extinction probability. And the proof is quite neat. It's used duality. So, if in case you haven't heard of it, it's a special property of this to CASA FKP, which makes it sort of exactly solvable. Which makes it sort of exactly solvable. And so it turns out the stochastic FKPP is dual to a particle system called the branching coalescing Brownian motion, right? And this is a duality formula. So X, X, I are the, is a bunch of Brownian particles with split it with rate beta, and they coalesce with intersection local time proportional to gamma, the noise there. And then this is the equation. And then this is the equation relating u and xt. Now, if you believe this duality, right, and then now let t goes infinity, see what happens. When t goes to infinity, the left-hand side will converge to, okay, we have to show that u infinity exists. If it exists, then it will converge to the probability that u is zero, right? And the right-hand side. And the right-hand side will converge to this expression with respect to the stationary distribution of the branching coalescing particle system, which happens to be a Poisson point process with a rate 2 beta over gamma. And then now we just compute expectation with respect to Poisson process, right? And then that would give the formula. So very simple if we have duality. And we also look at quasi-stationary distribution. Distribution would be so population will go extinct, but it might take a very long time, right? And we know that the effective population size before the gamma is like one over a population size, which is typically big. So noise can be small. If noise is small, it can take a long time to go to extinction. And so some quasi-stationary distribution in between can be of importance. So mathematically, quasi-stationary distribution. quasi-stationary distribution is the conditional, right? It's like a fixed point under conditional distribution, condition on non-fixation. Fixation here means that it's either constant zero or constant one. So this pi, if this pi satisfy this, then it is a quasi-stationary distribution for the stochastic FKPP. And in the recent work, we have shown that for compact metric space here, Space here. It has a unique QSD. And if it's a fixed point, it is the unique basin of a tractor. And then from this, we can also look at studies tail behavior for extinction time. It will be related to the first eigenvalue of the cued FKPP equation. And it can be explicitly written in terms of a Robin boundary condition. The Robin boundary condition. Of a robin boundary condition. The robin boundary comes because the dual process has an intersection local time killing. Now, let me quickly go. The idea of proof is we need to create a new dual. So it turns out the Qt FKPP is due to another branching, coalescing branching motion with a specific killing time, basically killing one color. And then using this, this is the statement of. This is the statement of the new duality. Now, if we believe this new duality, we can use it to establish the feather property of this Qt process, which is enough for us to establish the Schrouder fixed point theorem. And why the fixed point theorem? Because QSD is by definition the fixed point of a map from measure to measure. So by definition, if you have a QSD, If you have a QSD is a fixed point of this map from a probability space on continuous function taking away the absorption state, and we also get the fellow property for the original FKPP, which seems to be also new. And then we also study compact containment for more general equations. So now it's not just FKPP, but as long as the drift coefficient B. The drift coefficient and noise sigma satisfy basically the noise is big enough to drive the solution away to kick the solution down to zero, then the compact containment still holds on the metro graph. So the future work would be now we've proved that it has compact support. What will the support look like, right? If the support is expected to grow, and then what is the speed? Is it the same in different directions? Is it the same for the maximum? Directions? Is it the same for the maximal directions, etc.? And then, yeah, and then, of course, the genealogy is what we are interested in. So, there are some practical motivation for this work with my collaborator, Wisconsin Madison. So, he's doing some lab work on spreading this virus infection on a metric graph. Well, it's a micro channel. It's a microchannel that is manufactured as a container. And then we are interested in looking at this, and we take sample cells and do DNA sequencing and then see if it agrees with some of the predictions. So let me stop here. Thank you for your attention. All right. Any questions? Right, any question? So you mentioned the solid factor. What type of platform? Yeah, it's so pincer gas cat and any fractal that I think the SPD or the CASI FKPB makes sense, for example. I think what really matters is for fractal, the kernel have this estimate, right? Maybe something like that, right? Maybe something like that, right? Is that geodesic distance to some beta, right? Something like that, right? So that's the PTXY. So as long as, so beta is the walk dimension for fractal is really bigger than two. And for alpha, the house dark dimension depends on it can be more bigger than. More bigger than is one point something, right? But in any case, as long as this alpha of a beta is less than one, less than two, three less than two, then the stochastic FKPPs will make sense because the dual process. So you want the recurrent type one. Oh, okay. I don't know the name, but okay, interesting. So if alpha of beta less than two is called recurring, it is recurring. Less than two is called recurring. It is recurring? Less than one. Less than one. Okay. So this is already enough. So we need less than recurring, probably. So this kind of fractal. And then the proof of extinction probably should go through. And we can talk about the dual process, right? The branching coalescing process on the fractal. We talk about intersection local time. Time. And then we can use it to define the solution of the stochastic FKPP. Yeah. But yeah, I would love to learn more about fractals here. Yeah, yeah. Application, that probably they won't care, but mathematically we take as a motivation and Mathematically, we take it as a motivation and we care, and it would be interesting to know. Yeah. Yes, yes. And we can make it a non-compact one, right? And you can see that. Yeah, because we're more. Yeah, that would be interesting. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Maybe we can have a question. Maybe we can have a question. Sure. In there was the question earlier where you we were looking at the graph and watching the wave splitting between the branching point. Regulatory, basically. Right, yeah. I wondered, do you get something similar when you've got, let's say, two waves going down a branch meeting at a vertex? Is that something I was trying to visualize it as an I was trying to visualize it as an application think, okay, so you've got two populations that have divided and separate, and then the genes are churning, and then what happens when you they intermix again? Interesting, yeah. Well, mathematically, we can definitely look at different initial condition and see how it look like, right? We can so there the initial condition is a single bump, right? It's just a single bump and or have a side initial condition. And the good thing about that is we can write it using the dual. Can write it using the dual under the duality, we can write it in terms of the maximum point of the branching random motion. That's a Bramson approach, where if you start with step like initial condition, then ut comma x is equal to the probability starting at x, the leftmost position of the branching brand emotion hits zero. Right, and that description works if the initial condition is a step-like, but we can look at any other initial condition. Yeah, and yeah, so yeah, you mean biologically or some other visualize like okay, so I can see two populations being separated, say, by like a river, and there are the eastern and west side populations, right? And then what happens when they get to mix again? Yeah, that should be a result. Yeah. Yeah, that would be interesting. Yeah. Although the context here, mostly in mine is virus spread. Usually we start with when we got infected, usually just a few particles in our throat. And then it might be a mixture of those and a mutation can arise. But I don't know, might be lung to bat to baccalasis, you can have different populations. Pops a population that Burso and meet. I don't know. Yeah. But we'll have to talk about it. Two minutes, we end with two minutes. Thank you. Yeah, actually, it's exactly the recurrent one.
