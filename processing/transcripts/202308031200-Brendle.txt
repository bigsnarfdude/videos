Okay, thank you very much. I'm very pleased to be in such a nice place and having the opportunity to give a talk here. So thanks also to the organizers, to everybody. Okay, so I'll talk about something, some topic Some topic called higher-dimensional carbon characteristics. I will say in a minute what it is. And actually, this work was started by not by myself, but by Corey Switzer. He wrote one paper about it. And then we started joint work. We wrote another paper about it. And what I will talk about today is partially this work, I mean, the joint work that has been done a while ago. I mean, I think it still hasn't appeared. Mean, I think it still hasn't appeared. It should appear in the JSL, but I think it's electronically it has appeared, but not physically. So it's like two, three years ago. But then more recently, I thought again about this topic and I got some more recent results. And that's why I chose to talk about it. But then I didn't really have time to work out these more recent results. So this is really work in progress. I mean, there is still, hopefully there's still something to come. But I will, I hope, I very much hope. I will. I hope, I very much hope I'm on sabbatical now, you see. And as you probably all of you know, if you're on sabbatical, you have much less time than when you are at your home university. So traveling too much. So I think once I go back, I really have to sit down and write a paper. So, okay. Let me start. Let me start. Let's see, there is, yeah, but I think there's no problem with the upper and lower boundary. Boundary. Let me just review classical cardinal characteristics because, for the framework we are going to develop, I think it's good to have an idea of what classical cardinal characteristics are. I think all of you know about them and or have at least heard a little bit about them. So let's go through this quickly. Well, let's say X and Y are probably spaces, but typically they are just omega to the omega, except for one situation. omega except for one situation but uh and of course and then r is a relation on x uh x cross y now actually for the definitions which are to come even being a polish space is completely irrelevant i mean could just be any set i mean you could just have any set and relation on any set and you can define what we want to define so uh well the relation has to satisfy certain The relation has to satisfy certain things, like given any y, there is an x which is not in relation to y, which means sort of x is unbounded over y. I mean, r is sort of a bounding relation. That's the way you can think about it. So if x is in relation with y, it means that y bounds x in a certain sense, or i r bounds x. And the other thing we want is that given any x, there's a y which bounds it. There's a y which bounds it. These are the two things. And once we have these two properties, then we can easily define two kernel invariants associated with this relation. One is the unbounding number, and the other one is the dominating number, right? So the unbounding number is the minimal size of a subfamily of the left-hand set of X, such which is unbounded in the sense of the relation. So given any Y, there is an X in the set which is not. There is an x in the set which is not bounded by y. So that x is not in relation with y. And the other one is the dominating number of the relation r, and it's the minimal size of a dominating family in the sense of this relation again. So the minimal size of a subset of y such that for every x there's a member in this subset such that x is in relation with y, which means x's are bounded by y. are bounded by y. Okay, so and as you all probably know, I mean classical carbon invariance or many, not all, but many of the typical classical carbon invariant can be defined in this framework. I mean many of the well-known ones, of course, B and D, but then also additivity and covenality, covering, number and so on of ideas, and then many other colonials like the splitting number or the reaping number. Splitting number or the reaping number. Now, when we investigate such cardinals and the connection between them, we use the Tuckey ordering. I don't have to say much about it, I guess, because this was defined in detail by Natasha in her talk, except that she only defined it for partial orders. But actually, Tukio can define for arbitrary relations pretty much in the same way. And here we do not necessarily have a partial order. I'm not requiring that R be a partial. I'm not requiring that R be a partial order, right? Okay, so R is Tukey smaller than S or R is Tuki reducible to S. It means we have these two connecting functions. You can actually do it just with one function. That's how Natasha defined it, saying that one function has to be the cofinal function. That one would be the unbounded function. That's the cofinal function. I mean, this function takes unbounded sets to unbounded sets, and the other one takes cofinal sets to cofinal sets. final sets to cofinal sets and you can just redefine this just using one function it doesn't really matter but often it's defined in this way we have the two functions phi minus and phi plus and now I'm writing here x r so I mean the x the poli space or whatever that set is from r from the r relation and the other one is from the s relation so it's the left hand set and the y is the right hand set so we have these two connecting maps i mean the picture is really like this you have we have This you have we have the R relation say omega omega omega omega r and omega omega omega omega s and the phi minus goes here and the phi plus goes like that and we have the condition that if we take some x from here and some y from there and the phi minus of x. The phi minus of x, which is over here, is in s relation with y, then also the original x over there has to be in the r relation with phi plus y. That's the condition. That's how it's usually defined. And why is this useful? So, this is the Tukey connection or Tukey reduction or whatever. Why is it useful if we are It useful if we are to keep it reducible if r is to keep below s, then we have a connection between the bounding and the dominating numbers. So the b of s is less or equal than the b of r, and the d of r is less or equal than d of s. I mean, if you don't know this, just prove it. I mean, that's an easy exercise. It just comes from the definitions. These are VR is less important than VR. No, no, no. R R is truly smaller. R R is trucky smaller, so it has the B unbounding. Yeah, in general, like those numbers over there are the B R is less equal than the B. No, no, no, because we don't have a that's oh, that's true for if we have, for example, eventually dominating ordering also. So if we have a partial order, but in general, that's not true, though. This one may be bigger than that one. There is an example actually. We will, in a minute, I'll show you an example where consistent. I'll show you an example where consistently this is bigger than that one. But for some, of course, it's true. And that's a very nice duality. And this duality actually extends to models showing consistent inequality. Okay, so let's come to some examples. I think, again, these are examples more or less well known. One is the eventually dominating ordering. So less or equals star. So we are working on. Star, so we are we are working now in omega to the omega. So we have a function f and another function is eventually above f if except for finitely many points, g is above f. So that's the first ordering. The second ordering is the slalem ordering. That's a little bit more difficult because it's in two different spaces. So you have omega to the omega, and then you have the slalom space, and then you have this ordering. Now, what is a slalem? A slalom is something like this. As you may think from the As you may think from the name. And so it's a function, say, psi, such that psi n is less or equal than n for every n. And psi n, of course, is a subset of omega. And then we have this relation here. And what does the relation mean? A function in the bare space is in the relation with psi if and only if for almost all n, for all but finitely many n, f n is an element of this. Is an element of this set of this final sub psi n. That's the Slalem relation. And then the last one is eventually different. I think it's what the name says. I mean, two functions in the bare space are eventually different if except for finitely many points, their values are different. Okay, these are very well-known relations. Now, of course, if we look at the first one, the eventually different ordering, then we just get the standard. Ordering, then we just get the standard unbounding and dominating numbers, which are sort of two of the best known and most used cardinal characteristics. And well, for the other, I will say it in a minute what happens with the other two, but let me notice that we have a Tukey connection here between these three relations. Now I wrote it out with a space here. And these two relations are trivial. And these two relations are trivial. I mean, if, for example, if a function eventually dominates another one, then of course they are eventually different. And also, if one function is contained in the slalom, then I mean, if you associate with the slalom the max of the slalom, then it means this function is eventually dominated by the other one. This gives the two key connections. I mean, these are very simple 2G connections. But of course, by the previous slide, they already say something about the connection between the colour invariance. Between the carbon invariants. So we get that the B number of this one is less or equal than B less or equal than the B number of that one. But actually, these numbers are well known. They have been characterized. The B number of the Slalom relation is additivity of null, and the B number of the eventually different is non-mea. So it's, and then similarly, dually, we get this one. Dually, we get this one. And then this also answers Hector's question. Of course, for B, B is less or equal than D, and also that one is even smaller, so that's less or equal than that one. But these two are independent. So the B number of eventually different can be strictly bigger than the D number of eventually different because non-mea can be bigger than covering Meagher. Happens, for example, in the random model. Okay. Okay, so let me go back. Now, of course, all these cardinals they sit in J Hon's diagram. Unfortunately, I don't have a picture of J Hon's diagram now. I think most of you remember it anyway. So this is the smallest in Jihon's diagram. This is the smallest of all of the cardinals, and that's the biggest. And as I said, that one is small or equal than that one. Okay, but now we step sort of one level higher. Sort of one level higher. And instead of looking at functions from omega to omega, that's a bare space, we look at relations on functions from omega to omega. We look instead at functions from the bare space to itself and on relations on this space. So the new picture is sort of now we have omega to the omega and omega to the omega here and there, and we look at functions in this space and we want to have some relations. Want to have some relations. And we can actually use the relations which we had before and maybe also some ideas to define something. So we have an ideal also, and then we have a relation, R. And the relation is like one of the earlier ones. I mean, it can be like eventually different or eventually dominating or whatever. So the R is a relation on the bare space. A relation on the bare space. And now we can define what it means that a function is in R i relation with G, a function f is in R i relation with G, so G is sort of above F. This is sort of the picture. And it simply means that the points where that basically f is, if we have an X here, then we have the point FX in the bare space and we have the point GX. Bear space, and we have the point gx in the bear space. And we can ask whether these points are in the original R relation, whether fx, r, g x holds. And we say that this r i relation holds between f and g if the exception points are in the ideal i. So basically, this set where it doesn't hold here up to here, this must be an element of the ideal. Right? So that's a very natural relation. So that's a very natural relation on the bare space. And then, of course, once we have this relation, we can immediately again define carbon characteristics, but now they are sort of one level higher. So the unbounding number of this relation, it's defined exactly like as an unbounding number is always defined like before. So it has the same definition. It's a minimal size, but now, of course, we have functions from bear space to bear space. Such a given. To bear space, such a given any function, there is a function which is not bounded, an f in f which is not bounded by g in the sense of this relation ri. Now, this had a little bit complicated definition, so let us write this out. It means that there exists an f such that this set of exception points, I mean, where f is not, fg is not in relation with g g x, f is not in relation with g x, this is not in the With gx, this is not in the ideal i, right? Okay, that would be the unbounding number, and we get exactly the same, the dominating number. Dominating is always, the definition always a little bit easier. So it's a dominating family in the sense of disordering. So the minimal size of a family of functions, such a given any function, is another function which dominates it in the sense of Ri. So it means that the set of, well, the set of exception points. Well, the set of exception points is in I. I wrote it a little bit differently: the set of x such that f actually is in relation with gx, that's in the dual filter. So I star, of course, is the standard notation, is the dual filter of I, right? Okay. Oh, sorry. Okay, so these are the definitions. And now, of course, you can consider this definition for many relations. Consider this definition for many relations and for many ideas. So you get lots and lots and lots of cardinal variants. Let's just restrict ourselves to some interesting ones. I mean, I just look at those which were originally considered by Corey in his first paper. Only at the very end of the talk, I will consider some others which had not been considered by him. But let's first stick with those. And those are where R is one of the three relations I explained over. Three relations are explained over there: eventually different, eventually dominating, and slalom. And the I can be, of course, the most natural ideals, the ones we use all over in sort of pure mathematics in general, are the omega and the null ideal. Let's add one more, the sigma compact ideal. So the ideal which is on omega to the omega, which is generated by the compact subset of, of course, this is every compact subset is nowhere. Every compact subset is nowhere dense, so this is contained in the mega ideal. It's a strict sub-ideal of the mega ideal. Countable is also interesting. Actually, good question. And that's also something which will form part of the paper I'm going to look at. So there, of course, the results are a little bit different. I will not say anything about it, but Juris is right. I mean, we should also look at countable. What about Euris? What about you restrict just the nice functions of your actions rather than all functions? I see. Good. That's also a good question. I don't know. I haven't thought about this. Okay, so I should make a list of what all of you asked, and hopefully, some of this will already appear in this new paper, which I'm planning. Okay, now if we have the Tukey relation, of course, Tukey is a general definition. So if R is Tukey relation, So if R is Tukey less than S, actually also R i is Tukey less than S i. This is easy to see. And so what does this mean? It means that once we have the original Tukey relation in the bare space, on the lower level sort of, now I have a lower and a higher level sort of. Then of course we also get Bsi is less regular than Bi and so on. So we have this connection. And then of course we have the other connection. If I is a sub-ideal of J, then ideal of J, then the unbounding number of i's less or equal than the dominating number of i is bigger equal because you have a bigger, if you have a smaller ideal, you need more functions because then the exceptions that may be smaller. Okay, all of this is nice. Well, one more thing is that's also sort of trivial. Of course, Br is always less or equal than Bri, and an upper bound would be Br to the non-i to the uniformity. To the uniformity. I also leave this to you. And as I said, we look at first of all at this situation. So you can figure out we have three relations, three ideas, three by three is nine, and we have a non-bounding number and a dominating number. So we already get 18 carbons. And as an example for the relations here, for example, B slalom K is less or equal than B. K is less or equal than B eventually dominating K and so on. I mean, we have this relations because this is because that's because of the tubular reducibility, then the next one is because of this fact, and so on, you know. Okay. Oh, so we have the diagrams. This is a diagram for the null ideal. We have six cardinals for the null ideal. And by what I just said, I mean all of these inequalities follow by this basically. Is followed by this basic. And on the other hand, then we have the ones for the meager and the compact ideal. And because the compact ideal, sigma compact ideal sits inside the meager ideal, of course, we have one big diagram. Now, of course, this is maybe hard to remember. And because it's hard to remember, I started drawing this diagram over there. So, but only one half, I just run out of time. One half, I just run out of time, so I didn't draw the other half. And we will have to complete this later on. But for the time being, some of the bounding numbers are all over there. There can be more relationship, right? Oh, yes, that's a good question. And this will be, well, at least half of the topic of my talk, or maybe even two-thirds. So, okay. Itself. So, okay. So, what questions can we ask? Oh, you were ahead of time. Are there other relations between the two? Maybe are there even equalities between some of the cardinals? Then, of course, well, this is sort of the same question if as the first one: can we get models where we distinguish them? To what extent? Uh, to what extent are the B numbers and the D numbers dual for on the lower level? We have this strong duality between B and D. So, of course, we expect and hope this will carry over. It's a very interesting question, and it has some interesting answers. And then, finally, look, I mean, we want to show that some of these cardinals are consistently different and so on. Of course, one thing we can do is just One thing we can do is just step into some model and then show: oh, here it's this one has this value, that one has that value. But an even better thing would be to do the following, just compute these cardinals here in terms of cardinals we already know. Now, what could these cardinals be? Of course, the original ones, like B of R or D of R, or invariance related to the ideas. Uh, invariance related to the ideals like additivity or of the ideal or whatever. I mean, it could be these original cardinals or it could be higher cardinals. Like you see, we have this, there's this, all this research going on on this higher bare space where you look at kappa to the kappa instead of omega to the omega. And there we have an unbounding number and dominating number. And maybe these are also helpful. So the question is, can we do this? And this is. Can we do this? And this is also a very interesting question, which has some interesting answers and, of course, many open problems still. Okay. So let's first look at the situation when CH holds. This is, of course, not the situation we are really interested in because we don't believe in CH, but it's a nice thing to start with, and then it makes things. Start with, and then it makes things much more easy. Well, I assume a little bit less than CH, but you can think of all this as being like a CH context. B of R and additivity of I are continue. So that's first what we assume. And then we have some other assumption. Either our relation is tuky above eventually dominating that's easier situation, or it's at least. That C is a situation, or it's at least to be above eventually different. This is a weaker one than that, but then we sort of have to assume that C is equal to C to the less than C is a successor for technical reasons. But that's I'm not sure whether this is really needed, but I don't really care because this is a very special situation anyway, and I want to get ZFC results and not just CH results. Then we actually simply if Actually, simply, if we have this situation, we can just compute the guys. And the bounding number is BC, and the dominating number is DC. Now, what is BC and DC? Of course, we look at C to the C. That's what I just said. It's the higher Bear space. And we look at the bounding number, dominating number of the higher Bear space. Now, of course, in particular, this holds under CH. Well, if we have additionally this. We have additionally this stuff here, but of course, under CH, the rest will be true. So, what does it mean? It means two things. Under CH, we get these higher cardinals. We can just compute them, but also we only get two cardinals. Remember, we had 18 at the beginning. We are reduced to two. And of course, they may even be equal, but in general, under CH, they are not equal because you have CH and then add cohen subsets of RF1. Cohen subsets of RF1 and then distinguish these two numbers, right? It's C to the C more dual less than C. Right, yes, exactly. The standard higher Carlinos. So it's very nice. We get the duality, which was one of the earlier questions. I mean, these two Karlinos are dual to each other, again, in a strong sense. So that's nice. And now, of course, the question is: what happens if CH fails? Then the picture gets much more interesting. And I will first look, I mean, historically, we first looked at the unbounded numbers. We got really many results about them, and then we looked at the dominating numbers. But sort of the dominating numbers are a little bit easier to deal with. And that's why we'll first look at the dominating numbers. Okay, so what happens with the dominating numbers? Oh, there is something missing. A bar is missing, but I think it's here what's meant. Assume we have an ideal. We have an ideal whose cofinality is at most continuum, which will be true for all the ideals we are considering here, and also so that whenever you have a set in the ideal, the complement is peak, which is of course also true for all of the ideals we are considering here, then d of r i is equal to d of r empty set. So with the empty set, I mean the trivial ideal, the ideal which has a unique member. The idea which has a unique member, which is the empty set, which means, of course, in terms of domination here, it means everywhere domination. I mean, this just corresponds to the everywhere domination. Oh, so this is interesting. The dominating numbers do not depend on the ideal. And it means we are left with only twelve caliments. So we started out with eighteen. So we started out with 18. So now, of course, the question is whether we can reduce this more. But you probably, you may already imagine that that's not the case because I already started drawing the diagram and I will not draw the rest. So the D of R, this is the epsilon star. Epsilon star of the empty set. star of the empty set and d of this one for the empty set and d of this one for the empty set. They are here and of course they are out of life this and then also you have this L so this is the diagram and now of course we have to see that there are open questions in this diagram but also But also, there are many things we know. Then, of course, oh, one corollary, which is easy from this one, is that these dominating numbers always have to be at least C plus. They have to be strictly bigger than continuum. That's now because this is the dominating number of the everywhere domination. This is a trivial diagonalization. Okay, fine. And of course, I mean, in the CH context, these numbers were strictly bigger than continuum anyway, also the unbounding number. So, but we will see in a minute that for the unbounding number, this is quite false, this conclusion. Okay, now the question is: can we say more? And of course, there was this last question about these cardinals: namely, can we just write out compute them as something else? And unfortunately, there is no complete answer, but there is a conjecture. So let me explain the conjecture now. Assume we have kappa less or equal than lambda, and I think I want that kappa is regular, so I'm not completely sure about this anymore. But I think, yeah, for defining this less or equal star in this space. So now we look at the space kappa to the lambda. So it's functions from lambda to kappa, but lambda may be much bigger than kappa. So it's a space. Kappa. So it's a space which looks like this, I mean. And in this space, we can again look at the dominating relation, right? Eventually dominating. So it's lambda and kappa. There's two functions and then some eventually dominates. I mean, I want the exception that would be less than kappa, but actually, and then of course, you will get the dominating number for this relation, right? And this is called, or I will call this d lambda kappa. This d lambda kappa. And I put this lesser equal star in parentheses because it doesn't really matter. It can be proved that this dominating number for this lesser equal star is the same as the one for everywhere domination, so it doesn't matter. Now, let's go back to the bare space. Sequence in our relation is eventually dominating if it's not just dominating. It's not just dominating, but given any y, there's an alpha zero such that whatever comes after alpha zero dominates y, right? It's a very natural notion. It's something like a losing set in a sense, right? And then there's a notion of eventually unbounded. Now, of course, these things may exist or not exist. For example, let me see now. This is not. If we look at the easiest relation, which is Look at the easiest relation, which is the eventually dominating relation, then the eventually unbounded sequences just exist in ZFC, and the eventually dominating exists if and only if B equals D. That would be a typical example. Now, if we have an eventually dominating sequence, then actually the dominating number of this relation is less or equal than DC kappa. Oh, the length of the sequence is kappa. Now the length of the sequence is kappa. So it's this space where lambda is equal to the continuum now. And if we have an eventually unbounded sequence, then it's the other way around. So if we happen to have both, then we completely computed this cardinal here in terms of that one, which is very nice. Now, unfortunately, this is in general not true, but of course, as General, not true, but of course, as I said already, if we have b equals d, then for the eventually dominating relation, we have both sequences, so then we get the conclusion. And there's another result, which is a little bit more difficult to prove. If C is the n successor of B, then that also holds. So, for this to fail, I mean, the continuum would have to be beyond Dalef omega, at least. And I don't know whether it can fail. So, in the end, there is the Can fail. So, in the end, there is the conjecture. The conjecture is not just for eventually dominating, it's also for the other relations. The conjecture would be: this cardinal is just that one, which is a better known cardinal. Okay, now of course, the other question we still have about these guys is we were left with three because the rest of the diagram collapsed, but can we distinguish these? Can we distinguish these three? And now, of course, once we know this, that I mean, in all models, I know this is true, of course, that's why it's a conjecture. Yes, we can distinguish them. This is now a relatively easy task. It's basically the task of monkeying around with these guys for different. So, of course, the upper index is C, but the lower one can be changed for different. Change for different relations. So we have to make the bounding number for the different relations different and then also these dominating numbers different. So, what is the model? So, we have this consistently, this is smaller than this is smaller than this. So, for simplicity, this will be RLF4, this one RLF5, and this one RLF6. And how do we do this? We assume GCH. We first had RLF5 coin subsets of RF2, then RLF6 coin subsets. Then RLF6 co-subsets of RLF1, then RLF2 hectares is a finite report iteration, and RF3 random reals. And then we added in our stuff. So then we have them all. Oh, why did I erase something here? Okay, then we get, first of all, we get this. That's clear because the HECLA and the random, they don't do anything with additivity of null. That's additivity of null. Of null. That's additivity of null, that stays at RLF1. The HEC loss make this RLF2, and the randoms make this one. This is non-mere, so it's above covering null, so it will be RLF3. And that's exactly what we want. And also DC omega1 is RLF6. Why is it RLF6? Well, because of these RLF6 cone subsets of R omega1, I mean. And DC omega 2 is RLF5. Why is it RLF5? First, we make it RF5. It is RF5. First, we make it RF5 by this, and then it stays at RF5. Why? Because the remainder of the forcing, this one is RLF2CC, and the other one is CCC. So they are bounding in the space of functions to RLF2. So they will not change the dominating number there. And then for the same reason, this one just stays at RF. It was originally RLF4 and it stays at RLF4. Four and it stays at RF4. And then because of this, I mean, this is basically the conjecture on the earlier slide that this is this one and this is this one and this is this one. Of course, I cannot use the conjecture for the proof, but basically I've been just analyzing this in this situation, the assumptions of what's needed for the conjecture to hold this true. So we can just compute them. Just compute them. Okay, so this completely settles the right-hand side, except for the last question that I really want to know what these cardinals are, and there we only have a conjecture. Okay, so let's continue. We go to the unbounding numbers. Here it gets more complicated and also more interesting. You may already guess that because I drew all of them, they are really. Them, they are really there, all of them. I mean, nothing will collapse anymore. The first fact is that if the unbounding number is less than the covering number of the ideal, then the unbounding number of R is actually simply equal to the unbounding number of R. And this is a very simple proof. Oh, so first of all, it means that the unbounding numbers can be smaller than C, so that's very different from the domain. So that's very different from the dominating numbers, which are always at least C plus. Why is this true? Well, you can, well, almost all of these considerations, you can force that B of R is less than covering I, and then you get this. And the proof idea is very simple. You just think the constant functions. Okay, so you have this unbounded family. So you have this unbounded family, and here you then take in this space, you take the constant functions which take the values exactly in this unbounded family. And why is this unbounded? Well, if you have another function, and if another function was above, then the exception said, okay, I mean we have all these constant functions here. We have all these constant functions here, b of r many constant functions, and now you have another function. But the exception set here, where it's not above, this has to be in the ideal. And all of these exception sets have to be in the ideal. So all of these exception sets would have to cover, but there are only b of r many exception sets, and they cannot cover. So immediately we reach a contradiction. Another thing, which is also quite simple, which Which is also quite simple, which is also from our original paper: is if you have a family in the ideal, which is covering in a very strong sense, so it's a family of size kappa, kappa may be anything, such that every subfamily of size B of R is covering, then B of Ri is strictly bigger than kappa. Of course, this assumption may be void. It may be the case that B R is strictly larger than kappa. Strictly larger than kappa, then of course, but then this conclusion is trivial anyway. So it is not. This also isn't. Actually, such families are called kappa B R R R families. Of course, typically Kappa is much bigger than B of R. That's when we apply this, or at least they are equal. And they were originally introduced by Jihon. There's an old paper by Jihon on two cardinal properties of ideas, and that's where he originally started. Ideas, and that's where he originally studied these things. What is the proof? Let's take a family of functions of size kappa. We have to show it's not unbounded, so we have to find a bound for it. And how do we define the bound? Well, we define this g such that gx bounds in the original relation r f alpha x, where x is not in a x alpha. And why does this work? Why can we bound these guys? Well, Why can we bound these guys? Well, you see, there are less than B of R many guys here because I mean, this is just using that g expound, yeah, advanced f alpha x such that x is not in x alpha. This is because X alpha, this is because of this property that any subfamily of size P of r is covering, and therefore this set has to have size strictly less than p of r. And therefore, we can bound it, and then it's easy to see that this function actually is a bound of all of them. Okay, now these two results are actually quite useful, and they are useful for what for And they are useful for what for computing some of these cardinals in some models. And of course, there are a lot of classical models where we add real numbers. And we computed them, I think, in like 10 or 15 models and got lots and lots of independence results about these guys. But let's just look at two of them, of course, the best known models. First, the Cohen model and then the random model. So, what happens in the Cohen model? Happens in the Cohen model are the B of R K and the B of R M are R L F 1. So all of these guys are now R le F1. And these guys here are Kappa plus. Oh, so what I mean by this, if we add Kappa many coefficients for some kappa, well, kappa is, well, not to be kappa is some regular colour. It could be, it could be singular of uncountable cofinality. And we also assume that GCH. And we also assume that GCH holds in the graph model. And then we can say these cardinals are RLF1, and the other ones are kappa plus, or this is C plus. I mean, they cannot be more than C plus now because here's GCH. And the reason is, well, the reason for the first result is this lemma here that. That B in the cold model, B of any of all of our relations is RF1 of all the three relations. And on the other hand, the covering number of meager ideal is continuum and of the compact ideal also, because it's a dominating number. So we get this immediately. The reason for the second one is this one, namely we have this Rhodberger family for the null idea. So we have a car. So we have a kappa omega one Woltberger family for the null ideal. That's actually quite easy. It's a standard argument that if you add a cone real, you had a null set which contains all the ground model elements. So you have these, the cone reals code these kappa many null sets and they will be a Rothberger family. That's a well-known fact. So that means that it has to be at least kappa plus. Has to be at least kappa plus, but because of GCH in the ground model, it can't be bigger. So that's how we get it. Very simple. Now, in the random model, actually, things get already a little bit more interesting. Instead of two cardinals, we can have up to four. Well, if the continuum is at least RLF3, what will happen? These two are RLF1 now. These two. These two are RF2, then these two here are kappa, this one and this one is kappa, and the rest here is kappa pills. Okay, so what is the argument? Of course, the first one is the same. Here, the B number is small and the cover number of the null ideal is. Curving number of the null ideally speak, so it has to be RF1. That's the first lemma. And also for this one, it's the last lemma, it's the Roltberger family. Now we get a Roltberger family for the meager ideal, and that's why it has to be strictly bigger than continuum. And if you assume GCH, it must be exactly continuum plus. Now, what about the others? For this one, For this one, so this is for example B, the usual, well, it's B less or equals var kappa. Of course, it has to be, it's less or equal than B to the non-K, but non-K is RF1, and that's also RF1. So this is RF1 to the RF1. One, that's well no, this argument doesn't really work. That would be continuum, but actually, you can use the ground model stuff. And then the ground model, this is RF2, and that's why it works. So it's a little bit more complicated. But the upper bound is given by such a computation. And the lower bound, so what is the lower bound? It has to be bigger or equal than RLF2 because of the Rhodeberger family. You get an RLF1 Rhodeberger family. Get an RF1 Roltberger family for the sigma compact ideal. And finally, this one has to be at least kappa continuum because this is the original cardinal is non-meager, so a non-meager is bigger in the random model. But also, there is an argument that it's not bigger. That's also, well, I'm not going to go through all the details, but it's not difficult. Through all the details, but it's not difficult. Now, note one thing, and that's quite funny. If you look at this, we saw that the unbounding numbers can actually be quite small, unlike the dominating numbers. They can actually be R le F1. And in the current model, all of these were R left one. In the random model, these two were R left one. So the only one which is So, the only one which is never, which is not RF1 in either of the two models, is this cardinal here. Now, it turns out that actually this is a ZFC result. This cardinal is the only one of the nine cardinals, which must be strictly above RF1. And this is again very easy to prove because there are two situations. Either the original one, so one situation is that this one is. Situation is that this one is already bigger equal than RF2, then we are immediately done. The other one is when B not equal is RF1. And remember, this was non-mig, which is bigger equal than covering null. So covering null is also RF1. But if covering null is RLF1, then we have again a Rhodeberger family for RF1. And then we get with a Rodberger family, we get that this has to be at least RF2. That's the result. That's the result. So, this is actually quite funny. Okay, so now there's one more result which is more recent, which is sort of funny. Assume we have a kappa which is strictly less than C. It's important that it be strictly less than the continuum. And the cofinality of the ideal is less or equal than kappa. Less or equal than kappa. And we also assume there's an eventually unbounded sequence. This was defined earlier. It's a sequence of lengths kappa such that given any y, there is an alpha zero such that every x alpha for alpha bigger than alpha zero is unbounded over y. Then p of r i is less or equal than kappa plus. You see, you can think of this a little bit as the sort of dual to the As the sort of dual to the result about the Rhodeberger families. If we have the Rhodeberger family, we get bigger or equal than Kappa plus. Here we get less or equal than Kappa plus. And of course, we may already imagine that if we have both this assumption and the one about the Rhode Belger sets, then we can actually just compute the carbon and compute it down to kappa plus. That's quite helpful. I was actually first thinking of doing this proof, but this proof is a little bit, it's a bit tricky. This proof is a little bit, it's a bit tricky. I mean, it's not a long proof, it's maybe half a page or something. But then I decided against it. I mean, I don't have it on the slides. I could do it on the board, but I only have 10 minutes left. So I don't, I think the proof itself would probably need 10 or 15 minutes. So let me not do this. Let me rather continue and see what we can get out of this. I mentioned that. I mentioned that, of course, there are still some open questions here, and I will come back to them later. But I mentioned at some point that ideally what we would want is to compute, to write out compute the cardinals. About the dominating numbers, there are only three of them. We already have a conjecture. Now, about the unbounding numbers, I haven't said much yet about computations, but this last result is actually a little. Last result is actually a little bit helpful for this. And let me first look at this cardinal, which is the very bottom cardinal here. And so this is the one I look at. And I will not just say what it is. We can compute it, but it's a distinction in two cases. If additivity null is less than d, then this cardinal is. Then this cardinal is simply additivity now. If additivine is equal to D, but it's strictly less than continuum, then it's actually the success of additivity now. And if additivine is equal to C, so that's the last case, then it's simply B C. So we get three things. I mean, the second and third are both edit V now equals D, but you see there's a distinction. There's a distinction whether this is smaller than C, then it's just L it V now plus, or it's equal to C, then it's actually B C, it's one of the higher Bearspace. So it's quite interesting, this distinction. So what is the proof? One and three are quite easy. Why? Because if additivity null, of course, you should now remember. So let me sort of give a proof of this instead. Additivity null is the same as. And it divided null is the same as v of this epsilon relation, and on the other hand, of course, d is the same as the covering number of k. So we have the b number is strictly less than the covering number. And I explained earlier, that was the explanation with the constant functions over there, that in this case, the b number is simply the b number of this is actually equal to that b number. This is actually equal to that B number. So it's simply additivity of now. That's the first case. The last one is also easy. This is sort of the CH. Well, this is not CH, but it's close enough to CH, so that works. That was on the CH slide. So I only have to explain the second one. And here we have to prove two inequalities. And you may already guess, one is going by the Rhodberger families, and the other one is going with the. And the yellow one is going with a result, which was just on the previous slide. The one with the Rhodberger families, why do we have Rhodberger families here? Let me see. So we have the compact ideal, and of course, we have B equals T, and so we have a we have a And so we have a if this is kappa, so we have kappa equals p equals t. I mean, they are all equal because additivity null is equal to them. So we have, of course, we have a kappa-kappa Krotberger family for the compact ideal. I mean, that's quite easy. And that gives us that the Carlton has to be at least additivity n plus. It must be, well, bigger equal than kappa plus. That was the result. equal than kappa plus. That was the result about rockweiger families. Now we also have to show it's less or equal than kappa plus, if this is kappa. And this is exactly done by the previous by this one, y. So now kappa is less than continuum. It's this kappa which is equal to additivity null and also to d the cofinality of the compact ideal is d. So that one holds. And we get an eventually And we get an eventually unbounded sequence that's also for this epsilon relation. This is this exists in ZFC, and therefore we get the conclusion. So very nice. We know what the cardinal is. So this one is done. We don't need to look at the models anymore. We can immediately compute it in any model of ZFC. We just need to know what the other guys are. This has a very This has a very funny consequence. And the funny consequence is that this cardinal is in ZFC below that one. And this is the last ZFC relation on the left-hand side. We know already there is no other. So everything else is consistent about the order relationship of these cardinals, which is not connected by lines. But there is this line. But there is this line between the lowest one here and the biggest one there, which is sort of funny. Okay, what is the proof? Of course, the proof now just goes through this case distinction here, basically. So let me just say it quickly. In the first case, the first case is trivial because, of course, then this is additive and this one has to be because equals zero. There's nothing to prove. The third case is also trivial. The third case is also trivial because if this is this is B C, this will also be B C because if we have this, this assumption is strong enough to also make this one B C either. That was the CH slide. So again, one and three are the trivial cases. So what about two? Well, you see, there are two situations. And one situation is a trivial one, namely if Namely, if covering null, or actually, if the V relation of this one is already bigger, kappa is again the cardinal I'm looking at here. So kappa is additivity now is D. If P of non-equal is strictly bigger than kappa, then of course this must also be, this one must also be strictly bigger than kappa, so it's at least kappa plus. Bigger than kappa, so it's at least kappa plus, so we are done. So this is sort of the trivial situation. So the situation we are really looking at is when covering now and P of this one is also equal to kappa. But then, because additive now is equal to coupling now, we actually get a kappa-kappa-Rothberger family for the null ideal. This is enough to get the Rothberger for the null ideal. But the Rothberger is But the Holtberger implies now that we have to be at least kappa plus. So again, this one is bigger equal than that one. It's sort of funny. I mean, this proof, this is a proof which goes through a case distinction. I don't know of any direct proof of any. I don't know if there's some Tukey connection which proves this or anything. Maybe not. Now we look at the next cardinal here, which is this one. Which is this one, and actually, it's very nice. We can do the same thing. So, let me do it quickly. This time, it's the assumption is B less than D, then it will simply be B. If B is equal to D and less than C, it will be B plus. And if P is equal C, it will be B C. Very nice. So, of course. We have computed two of the nine here. Computed two of the nine here. Maybe we can just continue, but as a matter of fact, I do not know. I'm still working on this, but it's not that easy. These two are easily computed because we have the right Holtberger families, because we have this assumption on the previous slide is satisfied in the right situation. That's why we can compute it. In general, we cannot. For the others, we cannot do it with that. So maybe we need something else. But then there's. Need something else. But then there's a disturbing result which says that it's not always so easy. Can we compute all unbounding numbers in this fashion? The answer is no. And the counterexample is actually that cardinal here, the one which sits here. Now we have a funny model for this cardinal. Assume GCH and lambda is anything less than kappa. Typically you would assume anything less than kappa. Typically you would assume that kappa is some big cardinal, some big enough cardinal lambda is somewhere in between Lf1 and Kappa, anything what you want. Now we first force additivity in L equals to kappa. I mean make the continuum large, make it just kappa. So kappa is some regular column of course. And then we add exactly lambda many random values. Now what does this mean? It means of course for Chikon's diagram it's completely decided because It's completely decided because of the random reals, none of the null ideal is RF1, and all the others in Geoffrey cycle are. So, covering of null ideal B and D, everything above is cover, right? So they are all, so they are completely decided. And actually, all the other eight cardinals also, they are sort of decided. I mean, they are either RLF1 or maybe RF2 or they are kappa or kappa plus. But this cardinal here is actually lambda. Is actually lambda plus, and lambda can be anything. So here we cannot compute this one just from the geon diagram cardinals or any other, because this model, I mean, the classical cardinals, it does not distinguish. I mean, if you change lambda, the classical cardinals would just stay the same, but you can monkey around with that one. But again, I only know it for that one. I have tried for other cardinals. I have tried for other columns, but somehow we didn't get that. Okay, I think I'm close to out of time, maybe two minutes or something. Okay, so let me quickly. We have seen that we know that B of R and D of R dual in a strong sense, but these two are not dual. I mean, they are dual in the CH context, but if CH fails, we saw that the B numbers, they may be whatever they may. They may be whatever, they may be RF1 or whatever. These are always bigger than continuum. Also, these do not depend on the ideal, those do depend on the ideal. Here we have nine, there we have only three. So the duality is quite badly lost. So let me explain this a little bit. So why is duality true on the lower level for the standard bare space? If you have a relation, we always have the dual relation. So what is the dual relation? What is the dual relation? It's inverting the order and negating, right? So X is in dual relation with Y if and only if it's not true that Y is in relation with X. And then we have this very basic fact that the unbounded number of the dual relation is the dominating number of the original relation and vice versa. And that's why this is sort of the essence why the duality works on the duality. The duality works on the lower level. Okay, now let's look at the duality on the higher level. So we can look again at the dual relation. What is going on here? Can you do it? Oh, thanks. Let's look at the dual relation, and of course, we can again take the dual relation and associate it with the ideal i. And this has a definition, this was defined earlier. And notice this is equivalent to saying that the x is such that gx is in relation, in the original relation with fx, that this is in the ideal eigenvalue. That's easy to see. And so we get the unbounding number for the dual relation. But of course, it has this definition, that's a standard definition, like before. Standard definition like before. I just replaced the R by this R r whatever. So if you rewrite this a little bit, it means that, well, there's this family such that given any G, there's an F in the family such that the X is such a G X is in relation with Fx is not in I. Now, this is not equal to D of Ri. It's just less or equal than D. It's just less or equal than d of ri because in the definition of d of r i, exactly this set here was in the dual ideal. Now we just say it's a positive set. And similarly, the dominating number, it's bigger than the b of r i, but if the deficient of b of i, we just said that this set was not in the ideal, and now we say that this set is actually in the dual filter. In the dual filter. So, what's the conclusion? Now we get four cardinals instead of two. So, in the lower level, we just had two. By this dualizing business, now we have four. And I see this as sort of the reason why this variety broke down. So, the two unbounding numbers are still sort of dual to each other, and the two dominating numbers are still dual to each other. And if you look, for example, at this relation, which is the simplest less or equals star. Which is the simplest less or equal star, then we have these inequalities. And now, okay, so this is the final slide. I said already here, this part of the diagram is completely settled. Here we have consistency. That part is also settled by this last line. Everything else on this left-hand side is consistent. Everything which is not connected by lines. But I actually do not know. About the lines which are in between here, the question is whether some of the dominating numbers can be strictly smaller than some of the unbounding numbers. I have no model for that. Of course, the dominating numbers are always bigger than continuum, but the unbounding numbers sometimes also are. So there may be some model where, for example, this one, which is at the bottom here, I mean, it could be small, could be in some models, strictly smaller than that one, but I don't. Was strictly smaller than that one, but I don't know. No idea about that. Okay, thank you very much. So on your previous slide, if I'm understanding it right, would the duality be restored if I were the dual of an ultrafilter? If I was a... Oh, I see. And is that an interesting situation? Situation. Right, you're right. If I is an ultra filter, then it's actually the same. Good question. I haven't thought about it, but that's a good question. Because for us, it's not so interesting because you look at classical ideas. We wanted to look at classical ideas. So an ultra filter on the bare space, what would it be? But of course, it's true on the lower level, we also have these. If you have an outer filter, then the dominated and unbounding number are the same on omega to the omega, the original bare space. And they have been looked at a lot. Yeah, I don't know what happens in this, but probably, yes, and then all of these colours are probably bigger than C. Thank you for the nice talk, which connects, I think, a bit to what I was saying at the end in my own talk. I was remembering the paper by Cummings and Shellach from around 95 when they looked at B and D. Right, they looked at B kappa and D kappa. That's right. So this is very different than what you're doing then. Well, of course, we have in the dominating case, we have this. Dominating case, we have this conjecture that these are some dominating and numbers, but not exactly those because they are, I mean, they just looked at V kappa and D kappa, right? And they showed that they got a global result, basically saying that you can freely monkey around with them. That's what I was remembering. They used Waitenforcing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They have because, yeah. But of course, the cardinals here. Cardinals here, of course, on the in the CH context, then we get exactly cardinals of this kind, where kappa is the continuum. That's what I explained before. And in the general context, the idea was that on the unbounding side, we can get whatever, but on the dominating side, we get this DC kappa, something like that, which is basically the one in this space, which is more general one. And monkeying around with this one is different. Around with this one is different from that one because this one typically you can make it large with co-a nor no, no, you can make it small actually with making first two to the kappa large and then doing a short heckler iteration. But there is nothing analogous for that one. So making this one small is much harder, but of course it can be done. It's basically done by adding lots of cohen subsets of a cardinal which is smaller than kappa. Smaller than kappa. That's the way of making two to the then two to the C or two to kappa large and then this cardinal small. No, yeah, I think their technology is limited somewhat to what you can do with coin forcing because radio enforcing is like so thank you. Sure. Any other question? I have two questions. One is: Can you make all of these simultaneously different by some, but not by not doing much work, but by looking at, because there's been some work recently about making all as many as hard to coherent simultaneously different. Good question. I haven't really looked at this yet. Because the right-hand side, yes, but I think the question is mainly about the left-hand side. And of course, the idea would be, first of all, force the basic numbers all different. The basic numbers are all different, like doing this Jihon's maximum, and then hope that we get as much distinction as possible here. But no, I don't know because I only have looked at classical models, and the one where actually we get most cardinals is the random model. I already mentioned that if the continuum is at least RF3, we already have four different cardinals here in the random model. But you are right. And, but you are right. I mean, if we make more difficult models where you have a finite support iteration, where many columns are different, then we should actually get more. And that's also one of the tasks. And another question is about another very natural ideal, but very different. It's just the idea of finite sets. Is there anything interesting that happens with that ideal? Finite sets. I would assume this is almost like a probably like. Probably like the empty, like the trivial angle, but I wouldn't. And I have looked at countable sets and started with this a year ago, but then I don't remember the results now. But as Juris pointed out earlier, the countable sets, I mean, there are other interesting ideas. Okay. So, anybody else in the room? What about on Zoom? What about on Zoom? Nope. Nope. Okay. Okay, so let's thank Jörg once again.
