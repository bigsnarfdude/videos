Um so uh I want to start by uh reminding you or maybe introducing you to the algebraic approach to talking about quantum mechanics, quantum physics. Uh and in this person in this paradigm quantum systems are described by some kind of associative star algebra. Often it'll usually be some kind of operator algebra like a C star algebra or von Neumann algebra or something. And the self-adjoint elements of this algebra are the bounded observables. They're actually things you can do measurements with in your system. And if you don't know what a C-star algebra System. And if you don't know what a C star algebra is, the kind that will be relevant for this talk are actually finite-dimensional C-star algebras, which we all know and love. They're just direct sums of matrix algebras, and star operations come differently. So states in this perspective are just linear functionals on the algebra that are positive, so they satisfy this positivity condition, and they're normalized so that the unit is minus 1. And, you know, to do physics, you actually need time evolution or something like this. And in this framework, it's given by. This framework is given by usually a homomorphism from R to the automorphism group of your algebra. And this doesn't look exactly like the standard picture of quantum mechanics with Hamiltonians and Schrödinger equation and things like that. But actually, if you have a strongly continuous one-parameter group on a C-star algebra, you can take its derivative and get a derivation, and this unbounded observable is the Hamiltonian. And so actually, you can recover standard quantum mechanics by if you set your algebra to be the bounded operators on some Hilbert space. To be the bounded operators on some Hilbert space, you get everything in the usual picture. The states become density matrices taking trace against density matrix. And the Stone-von Neumann theorem, the fact that actually that the only automorphisms of B of H are inner allows you to recover unitary time evolution from this more general sounding picture. Okay, but so this is actually a generalization of the standard quantum mechanics picture that applies in different settings. And we'll see on the next slide what kind of settings we. And we'll see on the next slide what kind of setting we want to apply to. But I also want to mention that something that's not part of the standard textbook, undergrad physics picture of quantum mechanics is discrete time evolution. And here, instead of evolving continuously, you just evolve your system in discrete jumps. So, you know, you would describe this as a homomorphism from C into automorphisms or just a single automorphism, telling me where one goes. And the reason that this has become something that's important is because of quantum computers. Universal quantum computers, when you do a quantum computation, Computers, when you do a quantum computation, you're applying a single-step time evolution when you apply a computation or when you implement a circuit. So, if you're trying to simulate quantum systems, continuous-time quantum systems with a quantum computer, you have to first approximate them with discrete time things. And so, this has become, in the quantum information community, an important kind of time evolution to study. And it's qualitatively very different from the continuous time picture, because in the continuous time picture, you have a Hamiltonian that generates a thing, and you can study properly. That generates the thing. And you can study properties of the Hamiltonian, like in Yoshiko's talk. You can have great gaps Hamiltonians and all kinds of stuff. But in discrete time evolution, oops, we don't have any of that. Okay, great, all right. So quantum cellular atomics, I'll get to them in a couple slides, but they're an example of discrete time evolution. The motivation for studying these is from our quantum computer, quantum information paradigm. So let me tell you about an abstract system, an abstract spin system. An abstract spin system. So, first, we have to pick some kind of discrete metric space. And there's some technical conditions you want this to satisfy in order for a quantum cellular atom tie to work nicely. In particular, it should be uniformly discrete and have bounded geometry. So, if you want, you just think the Cayley graph of some discrete group. And actually, if you want, you just think Zn with like the path metric. And this L is short for lattice, because usually in the physics world, we just think of this as a lattice inside Rn. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's your metric space. And then associated to, so we're going to have some star algebra. Sometimes it'll be a C star algebra, but in this case, we'll just think of it as a star algebra. And for every finite subset of the lattice, I'm going to call it a lattice, but it's just a discrete metric space. We have some unital finite-dimensional C-star sub-algebra of A. And it'll satisfy these axioms. So if F is contained in G, then I should have the corresponding inclusion of subalgebras. Algebras, this locality condition, which says if two sets are disjoint, the operators assigned to those regions should commute. And the union of all the finite-dimensional sub-algebras over finite subsets should be all of A. If you were doing a C star version, you might say the completion of this union is the whole algebra, like the union's dense. But for the purposes of our talk today with quantum side or Tom Tau, it doesn't matter. You might as well just use this non-complete algebraic here as we think. Okay, and the intuition here. Okay, and the intuition here is that the algebras A sub F are supposed to be the observables and the operators that are localized in the region F. So if I do, if I have an observable that's in AF, the measurement that I do shouldn't depend on stuff that's happening in my quantum system somewhere far away. So these are the things that are localized. And then this axiom just guarantees that you're not having weird quantum uncertainty relations between stuff that's happening at disjoint points in space. Okay, and so these axioms are. Space. Okay, and so these axioms are totally borrowed from algebraic quantum field theory. Yeah. Why are you not posting the purpose big A? Because I just don't need to. But there's no reason, like, some unbounded operations of E or something like this? No, it's just for convenience. It's because I don't have, you don't get anything from completing it, so I'm just not completing it. For other things, if you were doing one-parameter automorphism groups, you need to close it for topological reasons to take derivatives and stuff. But for discrete time evolution, it doesn't matter. Okay. For my discrete time. Okay, from my discrete time image. So, what's an example of this? So, the canonical example of an abstract spin system is a concrete spin system. Okay, so pick an arbitrary, you know, discrete metric space and fix some natural number. Then you can define, for every finite subset of the lattice, define the AF algebra to just be the tensor product of the D by D matrices, where the tensor factors are indexed by the elements of this finite subset. Then, when I have an inclusion of finite subset, When I have an inclusion of finite subsets, I can just have an inclusion of the algebras where I can just stick ones kind of in the tensor slots that weren't being occupied. So if we, you know, if we're doing, you know, if this was like a little tensor category picture and I was doing it over Z, kind of just sticking ones outside everywhere to include one algebra inside the other one. Now to get the big algebra A, just take the collimit. This is a directed system. You can take the co-limit and the category of star algebras. And then you identify this AF with this image inside there. This AF with this image inside there, and you'll get something that satisfies these axioms. And so, when a physicist is talking about a spin system and they're trying to prove something about spin systems, there's a good chance that you can reformulate what they're talking about in this language feasible. Okay, so this is a concrete example of an algebraic thing. And notice that this algebra A is in no case is the algebra of operators all bounded operators on Hilbert space. It's really a different algebra, and that's why you need to talk about. And that's why you need to talk about this algebraic picture when you're studying spin systems beyond the standard quantum mechanics. So, if you're just a Hilbert-space Schrödinger equation person, it's hard to do the thermodynamic limit of spin systems, which is what this is capturing. Okay, so that's kind of the confusion. Okay, but let me tell you about another kind of abstract spin system that probably a lot of you are secretly familiar with. So, take a unitary multi-tensor category and pick some object. Then we can get an abstract spin system over. X-bin system over Z. So Z now I'm just thinking of, you know, as just the standard, you know, as a subset of R with the standard metric. So for every interval, we're going to do something very similar to what we did in the previous case, and we'll define the algebra assigned to that interval to take the tensor power of the object x and index the tensor factors by the points in the interval. So there's an ordering here. And just take endomorphisms in my category. This will be a finite-dimensional C-star set out, a multi-moral C-star step algebra, the multi-matrix algebra. And yeah, so those are our local algebras. And then you do exactly this picture to include one inside the other. You just stick the tensor ones on the other side. You take the co-limit of AI and you identify the AI with its image. And then for a more general finite subset, you take a finite subset, write it as a disjoint union of intervals, and take the sub-algebra of A generated by the intervals. Okay, so that's how you define it for an arbitrary finite subset. And this is what I would call a tensor spin system. If C was a fusion, Call a tensor spin system. If C was a fusion category, I might call this a fusion spin system. Okay, so I just want to point out: if C is braided, you can actually do the same sort of thing on the two-dimensional lattice, on Z2. It's a little more complicated, but you can do it. And if C is symmetric, you can actually do it on any metric space. You can do it on tensor spin system using the problem. Okay, so why do we care about these things? Okay, so, oh, whoops, I got cut off there a little bit. But the main motivation is that. Off there a little bit. But the main motivation is that if you have some kind of on-site symmetry of a regular spin system, so either a group symmetry that's acting on-site, maybe a Hof algebra symmetry, maybe a weak Hof algebra symmetry, maybe a categorical symmetry or a matrix product operator symmetry, any kind of symmetry you can imagine on a 1D spin system, then you can take the local operators that commute with that symmetry or invariant under that symmetry, and that will almost always form one of these things. It'll always give you an abstract spin system. In any of these particular cases where you have a concrete Particular cases where you have a concrete kind of symmetry, you almost always get a tensor categorical thing. So, for example, if you did this with a Hop algebra or a group, then what's the tensor category? It's the representation category of that Hopf algebra, and the invariant operators are just the intertwiners, and so you end up with something like this. Okay, so if you're trying to, if you have some symmetry of your system, and you're trying to study the physics that's invariant under that symmetry, or maybe defined on the the symmetric, only defined on the symmetric operator. Only defined on the symmetric operators, this is sometimes called gauging, working with the gauged version of the symmetry, then you have to work on one of these more abstract spin systems instead of a concrete spin system, which is just factorizes as a tensor climate HP. So when I use the word symmetric, like when I say symmetric QCA and stuff, I'm really just working in an abstract spin system, but I want you to think of abstract spin systems as this. They're abstract spin systems, in a sense, you can actually make precise. In a sense, you can actually make precise are always the symmetric observables under some kind of generalized symmetry of a concrete spin system, morally speaking, at least. And this is a familiar theorem from algebraic quantum field theory, the Doppler DHR theory says that any AQFT is always the orbifold under an action of some symmetry of some kind of holomorphic E-type, something with trivial supersonic. Anyway, okay, there's also. Anyway, okay, there's also other motivations for these as boundary algebras of topologically ordered spin systems, but that's not super relevant for my talk today, so that's just story for a different day. Okay, good. So these are the kinds of spin systems I'm interested in. Now let me tell you about what quantum cellular automata. And the word symmetric just means if you use an abstract spin system and do quantum cellular automata on an abstract spin system, I'm going to think of that as symmetric because it's defined on the symmetric. Okay, so if you have an abstract spin system, So, if you have an abstract spin system, then a quantum cellular automata is just an automorphism of the big algebra, a star automorphism of the big algebra, so that there exists some constant r, so that if I do alpha or its inverse to the sub-algebra AF, it's contained inside AF plus R. Well, here, AF plus R just means essentially the R ball of the set F. It's all the points that are distance less than or equal to R at some point. And the point here is that this R is uniform. So, of course, if I just So of course, if I just took any old automorphism of this algebra, it'll send AF to some AF plus R, just because the thing is a union of these AFs. But this is saying I can uniformly take the R so that it doesn't everywhere. It's not expanding the support of my operators too much. And the smallest R that works for one of these things is called the spread. Okay, so what are the motivations for this? So, as I said before, this is just a single automorphism, so you should think of it as a discrete time evolution, but it's a discrete time. Time evolution, but it's a discrete time evolution with local causality built into it. So when I do a time step, I'm not going to have some observable that's all of a sudden supported across all the space-time in one time step. So there's a local causality. Like I can only, if I want to affect something far away, I have to do a bunch of time evolutions to get there. Okay, it's kind of a uniformly bounded thing. And this is extremely useful when you're simulating, you know, continuous quantum field theories or something like that, also have this local causality. You have the, you know, when you have the time evolution. You have the, you know, the time evolution isn't moving stuff very far. So, if you're trying to do a quantum simulation of a real, say, like quantum field theory or something on your quantum computer, you first approximate it with a QCA. And you use QCAs to study these kind of temperatures. A third kind of completely independent motivation from thinking of it as a time evolution is actually you can think of it as a symmetry of the moduli space. So I didn't talk about local Hamiltonians, but local Hamiltonians are a kind of derivation on these algebras that preserve local algebras. Local algebras, they don't necessarily fix local algebras on the nose, but again, they send them not too far away. And these are the kind of Hamiltonians that are typically studied in people studying spin systems, they're usually worried about local Hamiltonians. When you conjugate a local Hamiltonian by QCA, you get another local Hamiltonian. So these kind of are symmetries of this moduli space of local Hamiltonians. And you can get what are called duality. So sometimes, so if I have a Hamiltonian and it commutes with a symmetry, then it'll define. Commutes with the symmetry, then it'll define a symmetric Hamiltonian, so it'll give me a Hamiltonian with respect to one of these kind of abstract spin systems corresponding to the symmetry. And sometimes you can find a QCA on the symmetric algebras that relate to Hamiltonians that don't extend to the full original system. So you can only see them by looking at QCAs on the abstract spins. You can't see them in the original system. These are what are called dualities. And the most famous example is Kramer's Wannier dualities. is Kramer's Wanye duality. You can rephrase, I mean, that has a lot of manifestations, but you can rephrase that as an example of this kind of QCA symmetry. A fourth motivation, and so this is one of the reasons that people who are actually physicists care about QCAs is for this symmetry of moduli space reasons. And then another reason that physicists care is that it gives you an interesting notion of equivalence on states. If I just take a state on this algebra A, Just take a state on this algebra A, just a random state. Usually, in things like topological phases of matter, your states aren't random states. They're ground states of Hamiltonians or something. And so you define equivalence by talking about, oh, I can perform Hamiltonians, keep gaps open. But what if you don't have a Hamiltonian? What if you're just a state? You need some various notions of equivalence. And this is one notion of equivalence that's super interesting. Two states are equivalent if there's a QCA, so that if I apply the QCA into one state, it gives me the other state. And that gives you an interesting notion. That gives you an interesting notion that people are thinking about in topological work. And I'll get back to that. So, some examples, you can do translations, or more generally, like if I just take my algebra, my lattice L, and I pick some bijection on L that moves things around, but not too much. So there's some bounded R so that every point doesn't get moved away too more than R from itself. Then I can just apply that and permute the tensor factors on my concrete spin system, and I'll get, oh, I can do something a bit more fancy where. I can do something a bit more fancy where if D has a factorization into P and Q, I can take two of these things from the previous one and apply one of them to the P factors and another one to the Q factors. And so I'm doing this kind of split permutation. And this will also give me a non-trivial example of QCA. And you can try for these tensor category abstract split systems, you can try to play the same sort of game with a bit more work to get. Sort of quoted. Yes, you're not thinking of both numbers. Not like you can call fermions. No, no, but everything's bosonic here. But if I wanted fermions, that commutivity relation I would have given in the definition of map check spin system, I would have to have a grading and a commutative. And another thing is if I just have a group action, like, you know, on each factor, and I take the product and it's a global action, this will obviously be a QCA, it'll have spread zero. It's not moving anything else. Spread zero. It's not moving anything. Okay. Good. But the main class of examples that I want to explain to get to the point, you know, what is a topological invariant of a QCA, are finite depth circuits. So the idea is you pick a partition of your lattice by finite subsets, and the diameter of all these finite subsets is uniformly bounded. For each i, pick a unitary that's localized in f sub i. So pick a unitary in A sub F i. They all commute with each other because these are all disjoint subsets. Other because these are all disjoint subsets to partition. And then you can define an automorphism from this data that just conjugates by all the unitaries where the UI is intersecting the support of the operator X non-trivially. Oh, that should be not equal to empty set. Sorry. That should be not equal. Sorry. Otherwise, this would be a trivial automorphism. But the point is, and then you conjugate by all of these things. So the point is, let me give you. So the point is, let me give you an example. So let's work on L is Z. Okay, and I have, say, my partition, I'm just going to do like a nearest neighbor type partition. So I'm going to block all these things together. And then I'm going to pick some unitary that lives in each one of these algebras. Okay? So I have this unitary. And these could all be different unitaries if you want to, but for convenience, I'll just make them all the same. It's just some unitary like this. Unitary like this, then if I have some x that's say localized like here, this automorphism alpha is just going to conjugate by this sort of infinite product of unitaries. But the point is that for the unitaries that intersect trivially with UI, they just cancel with each other. They commute with x, so they're going to cancel, and so I end up with just the things that have non-trivial intersection with their support. Have non-trivial intersection with their support. So these all cancel. And so you can just consider the stuff that has non-trivial intersection with the support of x, and that's what this is supposed to say, with the not equal to answers. Okay, so this is what's called a depth one circuit, because I just have this layer of unitaries that are all commuting with each other and supported in disjoint regions. A finite depth quantum circuit is a composition of these. And these can get really interesting because the partitions don't have to be compatible with each other. Don't have to be compatible with each other. So I could pick another layer where I take partitions like this and I conjugate by these V's. Say, you know, when I have my V stars down here. Here's my V stars. And this, of course, is a bit more interesting, but it's always going to be a QCA because there's this kind of light column picture you can draw. It's always going to be supported and not too far. For a depth one surface, And not too far. For a depth one circuit, it's just that the diameter of the set is going to be the spread. And the minimum of the diameters of all the FI's. For this, and spread is sub-additive. So the spread is going to be bounded in this composition by the sums of the spreads. But you get this kind of nice little light cone picture and you want to explain what's going on. Okay, so these are QCAs. They form a subgroup of all QCAs. And one way to think of them is that if I One way to think of them is that if I, this is maybe a little technical, but if you take a time evolution coming from the local Hamiltonian, and you say, okay, which time evolutions coming from local Hamiltonians are QCAs, you get a set, and then if you take the subgroup of QCA generated by that, that's where you get finite epsilon. So these are the kind of QCAs you can see using time evolutions from local Hamiltonians on your spin system. But the real reason that physicists consider these sort of things is because it was proposed. Consider these sort of things is because it was proposed to use finite depth circuit equivalence as an operational definition to define what you mean by long-range entanglement. So two states are going to have the same long-range entanglement structure, but there's a finite depth circuit that relates them to each other. So in particular, you may have heard the word short-range entangled state. That means there's a finite depth circuit that I can apply the finite depth circuit to a product state and get that state. That's what short-range entangled state. But this was proposed as one idea for what we might mean by... As one idea for what we might mean by a topological phase when we don't have Hamiltonians and these sort of things going on, gaps Hamiltonians. This is a state-based version that was proposed by Shaogan and Shichen and some of their other collaborators 10 years ago. Okay, but the key point, and this is where you actually use all those assumptions about the metric structure, that it's bounded geometry and uniformly discrete, but you can show that this group, this FDQC stands for finite depth quantum circuit. It's actually a Finite depth quantum circuit, it's actually a normal subgroup of QCA. And because this kind of idea that two states that are related by a finite depth quantum circuit are in the same, you know, I'm going to use quotation marks, topological phase, because that means a lot of different things in different contexts. John Won Haas pioneered the sales pitch that you should think of this group as the group of topological phases of QCN. So that's what we're trying to understand here is. This group. And so the basic question is: what is this group? So I would like to, if you give me an abstract spin system, I would like to be able to compute this group. But just tell me what the isomorphism class of this group is. In general, that seems pretty hard. So we're looking for what I call topological invariance of QCA. So there's some kind of thing you can assign to a QCA that will give you the same answer if they're related by a finite depth circuit. So it's invariant under finite depth circuit equivalence. And so because we're calling these topological So, because we're calling these topological phases, I'd call this a topological. Okay, so what do we know? So, the thing that kind of kicked this whole study of QCAs off was this result by Gross, Nesma, Waltz, and Werner, I think more than 10 years ago, maybe in 2010-ish time. For 1D concrete spin systems, so these are where it's literally the tensor product of matrix algebras, of d-dimensional matrix algebras, then this group is actually isomorphic to this group, where what is this thing? So, take the ring at Z, throw in. ring at Z, throw in 1 over D, take the ring adjoin 1 over Z, and then take the group of units for that ring. And that's actually what this group of QC modulo finite depth circuits is. And in fact, you can represent every class in here by one of those generalized translations that I've earned in my example where it's not quite a translation, but you factorize the local algebras into some products, some divisors, and then you shift one of them and don't shift the other one. And those represent all the things in this class. Represent all the things in its class. So, the way they did this is they defined the numerical index on the QCA, and then they're exactly here. And then they showed it was just that its kernel was exactly finite-depth colours. So that's how they did that. In 2D, if you use a more general equivalence relation, more general than finite-depth circuits, it's called stable equivalence. Mike Friedman and Matt Hastings showed that this group is just generalized translations, but generalized translations. Translations, but generalized translations themselves are complicated. This group is also just generalized translations, but we can characterize it. Here, there's not a clear picture for what generalized translations are, but there's nothing more than those, whatever that means. The first group was finally generated. This group is. Is this group finally generated? I mean, something about number of generators should number of final devices? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right. Yeah, so don't be expensive. Do we expect the second group as well? No idea. I don't I have no I think not actually. But I have no idea. And maybe we will expect it to be ideal? Yeah, well that's coming. It will be so in 3D things start getting super interesting. So from the definition you can get a homomorphism from this group to invertible states which have a precise definition. And if you believe physics talk, invertible states with this with this With this finite depth circuit equivalent, it should morally correspond to fully extended TQFTs. And so most people believe that this group here is equivalent to the WIT group of modules categories. So then you get a homomorphism from this group to the WIT group. And the conjecture is that this is surjective. And this is essentially equivalent to the question about whether you can disentangle a wrong model by a QCM and not a funny device. I think this last thing is what really, like this is objective method. Like this objective map is just cautioning out whatever the translations are? Not quite. So, what happens is the kernel is going to be the QCA that map short-range entanglement states back to short entanglement range states, but they might not do it in a way that's conjugated by a finite head circuit. So it's not a uniform way. So it's not actually clear. Certainly generalized translations are in there. It's not clear what else is in there. It's not clear what else is in here. But conjecturally, I think Jung 1 is conjectured, but that's everything. Is this available in an article, or is this work in progress for number three? Like, what's this? This is trivial. This is a complete wave your hands physics conjecture. This, disentangling walk-1 by QCA, John Wong has several papers where he's done that in some cases. But the conjecture would be that this is surjective. And so that's the same as saying you can disentangle any walk-wong by QCAs. I think it is known that the with classes are pointed getting at a starting date. Yes, yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, so Dom Williamson and some of his collaborators have shown that if you take pointed monitoring categories, you can also disentangle those with what we're wrong, and therefore they're in the image base. There's a lot of non-trivial stuff in the WIT thing that is known to be in the image, but it's just no general kind of construction. That should say, disentangling modular rock width. Yes? I'm going to ask another question. In 3D you mean like really z to the power 3? Yeah, I mean 3 plus 1D. What is the local algebra you're using or is this independent of the algebra? So yeah, so this, so that's a good question. It's not going to be independent of the algebra, but the conjecture should really be stated if you take this up to stable equivalence. And there, it's concrete and doesn't depend on the algebra. But it's because you've done a stabilization. So I'm brushing some stuff under the rub. Brushing some stuff under the rub. If you fix a local, it should be for concrete spin systems, but if you fix a local D, then you don't actually expect this to be true. But stable equivalence allows you to change your D by tensoring stuff on, and there you would expect this to be true. So let me put it back on. So I slightly lied to you. The search activity is not quite right unless you take stable quality. Okay, and finally, sorry, a big result by Friedman, Haad Hastings is that if this is all for concrete stuff. If this is all for concrete stuff, but that this group in concrete case is abelian. So that's what we know in the concrete case. So now I want to tell you about what we know in the symmetric case. So this first index thing is based on joint work with DeepMAR student Chung Kui Lim from this year. So suppose now we have a net with the property that this a less than or equal to x, so this is, I'm picking some point in my, I'm in 1D here, so I'm on z. I'm in 1D here, so I'm on Z, and I'm picking some points. And the Ax less than or equal to X is I take all the operators to the left of X, and I take the sub-algebra generated by it. That's some big influence dimensional in algebra. I'm going to assume it has unique trace, which is kind of a weird assumption, but it's just, it works in all our examples, and it's what we want to use subfactor theory. But the idea here is when you have that, if you pick some y so that my QCA, alpha, since a less than or equal to x, it contains a less than or equal to y, which you can always do from the definition. Which you can always do from the definition of QCA. You can define a numerical quantity which this bracket represents the Jones index. And I'm abusing notation. You really should take the von Neumann algebra completion with this unique trace in the G and S representation and you get a 2-1 factor. So this is actually a Jones index of 2-1 factor of subfactors. Okay, so this is an index of subfactors over an index of subfactors. And it's in R times. And it doesn't depend on any of your choices. It doesn't depend on X, it doesn't depend. Your choices. It doesn't depend on X, it doesn't depend on Y, and it has finite depth quantum circuits in the kernel, so you get topological invariant. And the point where this came from was this, the GMVW index, when they did this paper. They didn't phrase it this way at all, but you can rephrase their index as this. This is a generalization of the GMVW index. And so, actually, again, using this index, if you reinterpret what they were doing, they said this index is an isomorphism. So you might ask, okay, for X is an isomorphism. So you might ask, okay, for symmetric spin systems, abstract spin systems, is this also going to be an isomorphism? And we proved that if you use the fusion spin chain built from the Fibonacci category with, you can actually use any tensor generator, but in the paper we actually just used the standard object, the non-invertible object, which took tensor powers of that. Then this is an isomorphism. So the index, its value, and powers of the So, the index, it's valued in powers of the golden ratio. So, as a group, it's just isomorphic to C. But this actually gives you an isomorphism. And the point is that, okay, so that's the first result. So, we pause there. So, you might say, okay, does this generalize to other fusion spin chains? And the answer is a resounding no. So, in work I had done actually a bit earlier, associated to an abstract spin system, you can define a braided tensor category called the category of THR bimodules. If yeah, and so you get a homomorphism from the QCA to braided auto equivalences of this DHR category. If you build this from a fusion spin chain, the DHR category is the Greenfield center, and you can use this to show that this group is not abelian, okay? Because you can surject onto this, you can build examples that surject on the braided auto equivalences of the center, and you can just pick an easy example where that group's not abelian. So actually, the index that we had before can't possibly be every. Index that we had before can't possibly be everything. That was valued in an abelian group, right? It was valued in our times. So, this in general is a non-abelian group. And so, the idea is that, hope is that if you combine the previous index with this index, that will give you complete Ethereum for frequent spin systems. Yeah, and this might answer your question. Secretly, what's going on, there's a higher category. If you take n-dimensional abstract spin chains, these should assemble into an n plus 2 category. QCI are one morphisms, DHR is end of one. DHR is n of 1. This homomorphism is a dimensional reduction. You know, draw a circle around n of 1. And the reason the other groups were abelian was because in that case, it's actually a monoidal n plus 2 category, and so it's a hiomorphic. So anyway, there is a higher category of way to understand this, but it's much harder to write it down precisely. But that's working practice. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So earlier you you said you work on a metric space. What were the requirements on the metrics? Is that a metric space? So they have to be uniformly discrete, which means that there's a lower bound on how close any two points can be. And then bounded geometry says if I fix, there's a function that tells me if I take balls of radius r, there's a bound on the number of points in a ball of radius r that only depends on r. So balls of radius r, I can't have them growing larger and larger in cardinality. Like there's a uniform bound. Cardinality, like there's a uniform bound as a function of r on how many points are in there. And that's your notion of dimension as well, if it grows as like r to the d to the d dimension that you're referencing all of. No, when I'm talking about dimension, I'm working on z to the end, and I'm talking about n. Just specifically. Yeah, yeah, and yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, when I talk about n. Really, it only matters up to coarse equivalence. There's a large-scale geometry. All these things only matter up to large-scale equivalents of metric spaces. What is going on as you also have to notion of stabilization? It stays not abelian in the stabilization. Because it's not pi one of a monoidal object. So the stabilization, you're stabilizing with concrete things. Yeah, so it's like, yeah, so stabilization doesn't fix the abelianness. You can't, the idea is you can't take the monoidal product of two abstract spin systems in a nice way. That's the problem. There's bad ways you can do it. There's not an expert in the answer. Yes? You kind of went over Um you you kind of went over it in a while. Are these portions uh abelian? There's like a high-level explanation of that. But I guess going back to the very definition of your spin chain, is there a way to like instead of doing it with M D, you do C to the D and somehow see why that quotient is abelian based on. You're talking about why this quotient is abelian? Yeah. So if you did it classically, say, so classically, so if you just use abelian algebra of each of these points. Just use abelian algebras at each of these points. This group is not so interesting. Well, no, this group is interesting, but it's just integers. It's more trivial. But no, the reason that this is abelian is actually a stable thing. So in the concrete case, I can take my spin chain and take itself, tensor them together, and like slide them into each other. And so I have an isomorphism from this spin chain tensor, this one, back to itself. Tensor this one back to itself. And so, what you can do is you can take two QCAs, tensor it, flip them around, they commute with each other on the separate factors and bring them back to each other. And then what Hahn Hastings did, sorry, this isn't the right slide. What Hahn Hastings and what Mike, Matt, and John Won did is they were able to get rid of the stable ancilla and came up with a clever algorithm to get rid of it. So you don't actually need the ancilla, but it's actually not so hard if the stable versions. And then the trick is just removing the stable version. I don't think classes. I don't need classicality. So is this notion of stabilization in the very general case? Does this reside in something which is completely independent? So I think the problem is that what's the right notion of stabilization in the concrete case is the wrong notion of stabilization in the abstract case. And so to do the right notion of stabilization in the abstract case, you have to actually tensor with compact options. Case, you have to actually tensor with compact operators, which are non-unital algebras. So you have to redo a bunch of the theory. So I can't give you precise statements about that, but that's clearly the correct notion for various reasons. But what was your question about the step, Joseph? The idea should be after civilization, it should be completely of the choice of algebra or still depend slightly on the algebra. It should still depend slightly on the algebra actually. But the question to what extent is a very interesting question. Is there a way to completely get rid of the depends on the algebra is the proportion that I would like to? Completely get rid of the translations? Completely get rid of the translations? I mean, you can just quote in by the translations or whatever. Sorry, I have some confusion to understand the meaning of those quotients. Because we got weighty covered, that means you quotient not all some kind of marinite covered. But this is the finite finite step of this bottom circuit can only d distinguish a multiplicity. Can only d distinguish a morphism and obstructive morphism, not normal basically. So I would say it this way: so finite depth circuits corresponds to equivalence of fully extended topological orders. So like, you know, if you have a fusion category and you build a 11-wheim model, my claim is that if you take finite depth circuits, okay, no, no, so it's a little bit more subtle. Sorry, let me step back. What was your question? Sorry, I missed your question. That. What was your question? Sorry, I missed your question. So, maybe in terms of a level model, using Fanada's quantum circuit, would you be able to go from one phase to another in the same class? So, it depends on. So, my claim is that you actually can't, let me think, let me be careful here. You're allowed to include answers. Are you allowed to like include anceilin? Yeah, so that depends on stabilization or not. Are you allowed to include ancillary? Okay, so you you have then then to reach there you need further culture, I guess. Yeah, that's right. Any more questions behind? That's a classic version proper.
