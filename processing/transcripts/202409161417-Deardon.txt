To speak. So I'm going to start. Well, first off, I should say this work is done primarily by Caitlin Ward, who was my postdoc, who's now on DOTA. I'm co-supervised around Schmidt. I'm also going to start talking about the SIR model, which I'm very glad has been introduced by other people. But I come at this from the point of view of a statistician. So statisticians, generally, what we do is we take a relatively simple model. A relatively simple model, we fit it to data, we try to capture the uncertainty we have about parameters, and then use that to do something useful. In this case, it might be something like a forecast. And the part I'm going to concentrate on, as Ian was talking about, was a book, use the finger, is this false of infection term, right? So I've got this. Fourth of infection term, right? So I've got this transmission rate and it's multiplied by the number of infections and all. And Ian mentioned about how you can't really get multiple waves if you don't count for the angle change. Actually, that sort of model is quite difficult to fit to single waves if you don't count for the angle change. Because if you simulate from a model like that, this is a stochastic version, you get this inflection occurring when you run out of susceptibles. out of susceptibles. When you look at real data, so this is Calgary Covid data, you've got all these peaks occurring, but obviously the infection there is people changing the way they behave. Obviously that's common to lots of different diseases and the usual way to think about trying to model that is to use some external intervention. We know when an intervention occurred so we can make our beta We can make our beta change at that point, or we might have to implement mobility data or things. Unfortunately, if you want to use this model for forecasting, you don't know this stuff in the future. And also, in a lot of situations, you won't have these covariates anyway. So just going back to this, and this idea of a statistician essentially trying to extract information from time scale. From time series data, like this. It's quite clear when you look at this that there's information about the disease process, what the transmission rate is, and we can fit our SIR model to an epidemic curve. But there's also information about the behaviour. So I was wondering, can we jointly estimate those things from data like this? And it turns out you can, and you can do it quite well. So a couple of years ago, we started. So, a couple of years ago, we started working on this. We introduced this idea of an alarm function. So, this is sort of trying to model how scared the population is. And we set this up so it's bound on 0, 1, fingering in. Whereas if the alarm is 0, that means the population is behaving in its usual state. If it's equal to 1, then it's in some sort of maximal alarm state such that the disease tracks. Such that the disease transmission can't occur anymore. And you do the obvious thing, which is you make that thing vary over time, depending on recent incidents or prevalence, you know, yesterdays or averaged over a week. And then if you just put that 1 minus a into your model, you can see that if a equals 0, you get the old SIR model. If it equals 1, infection stops. So the alarm function itself, well, The alarm function itself, well, there are assumptions we can make about what it looks like. We could have something like a step function or what we call a threshold, where the amount of disease in the population increases. At some point, the alarm goes from being zero and jumps up to some value. That might be good for modelling the introduction of a new government policy, stay-at-home measures. We might want to make it smooth. So, this is just one parameter. So, this is just a one-parameter curve. We can have more complex curves than this, but the idea is the alarm goes up slowly and then comes back down, changing the force of infections as it does. And what we really wanted to do was to avoid making too many assumptions about that LARM at all. And so, we can use things like olomos, blinds, processes, which are essentially smooth but very flexible functions. Flexible functions to try and use the data to estimate those things. Skip over that, I'll say I'm actually a Bayesian statistician. We used a package called NIML to code all this up, and the code is all available within the original. It's relatively easy to implement this models. Just to show you what some of the epidemic curves look like, some of these different alarm functions, you get Alarm functions, you get the sort of thing that you'd expect. You know, the air protector takes off, the alarm goes off, goes up, it comes down, and you can get this sort of oscillatory behaviour. With the threshold, you get some really weird behaviour, which isn't realistic, the alarm jumps on and off, but maybe good for modelling extreme behaviour change at the beginning. Alright, so what the reason Well, what the results I'll show you here are a situation where we've simulated an epidemic from one of these behavioural change models with a known alarm function. And then we fit, actually I think I'm just showing you the results for the spline alarm, where we assume we don't really know what's going on. This slide is just showing you that we can estimate the alarm pretty well. These are posterior realizations, so this incorporates our uncertainty. The black is the true alarm. The black is the true alarm. We struggle a bit with the threshold because it's got that discontinuity. But the more interesting bit is if you think about the forecasting, so if I fit my SIR model to a curve like this up to time 0.50, it really doesn't understand why that inflection occurs. It gives me something like at least squares and then project forward completely misses the true epidemic curve. I fit the correct model. If I fit the correct model, as you'd expect, I do very well. But if I fit the model with the spline or the Gaussian process, I assume I don't really know the alarm function. We also do really well. It's probably hard to see. There's a bit more uncertainty in the forecast, but not a lot. So we did lots of simulation studies. This works in simulated settings, which is great, but obviously, real life has been noisier than your simulation study. Study. So we've also been looking at data sets to see what happens. Do we get sensible results? So Caitlin took New York data. She's basically analysing these waves or peaks separately. She divided the first 18 tiny months, whatever that is, into four peaks. You can see the Omicron one here where everything goes a little crazy. And then we can look at things like what does the alarm function look like? What does the alarm function look like for those different waves? You can see for the first wave, well, we get something you might expect. The behaviour change goes up very suddenly. It's almost like the threshold alarm, the step function, but not quite because it's a spline. But it sort of makes sense. In pigs two and three, the alarm function does seem to go up as the amount of disease goes. Up as the amount of disease goes up, but much more slowly. Well, that also makes sense because our baseline behaviour had changed a lot by then. A lot of us were working from home, distancing much larger. And then with the omicron, we also, if you look at this without noticing the scale, you might think they're relatively simple. This is actually over a much larger, similar scale. Because the alarm function goes up quite high, it takes a longer time. It takes a longer time to get there in terms of the number of cases. That also makes sense because Omega was when we were getting vaccinated, and a lot of us have decided, you know, we have to live with this thing and get on with life. We can also ask about this. We can use information criteria to choose between the different alarm functions. What this slide, I said let's skip over this. What this slide is basically shows. Um what this slide is basically showing you how much better the fit is with the alarm function than the SIR model. It's the lower value of this WAIC compose, but a better fit. You can see that for all four things. Right, so what are we doing? Because we've been working on this for a couple of years now. So one thing is applying this to more complex academic models. The SIR model is not a great model for COVID. Great model for COVID, but you can put in a lane period, you can put in hospitalizations and deaths, put the alarm function in, and it seems to fit pretty well. So it gives you good forecasts or better forecasts. We can have more complex alarm functions. So Madeline, who's over there, she's also a ward, but not related to Caitlin Ward, she'll be giving a poster on some of this stuff. So one thing On some of this stuff. So, one thing you can do is think about things like lockdown fatigue. So, you've got this alarm function, but maybe it itself should be changing over time. Maybe we get fed up, staying in our apartment. You can also have the idea of a mixture where you have different subgroups in the population, some who are risk averse, some who are what's the opposite of risk averse? The opposite of risk averse. Which seems strange in an epidemic context, but anyway. So you can allow for groups, and we can try to infer what proportion of the population goes into each of those groups as their own alarm function. And then the other thing that Madeline's been doing is taking the alarm function idea, but also incorporating things like Google. The fact that we do know when lockdown measures were introduced, and that does tend to. Introduced. And that does tend to improve the fit, but not as much on itself as having the alarm function. I'm not giving your results my. And then you can apply this to other diseases. We see this really strongly in something like Ebola. We get alarm signals in seasonal influenza and measles. We've tried this with foot and mouth disease and spatial models. See the the models seem to fit. The the models seem to fit pretty well in most situations and and improve on your not behavioural change model. Alright, so for those of you who are interested, Caitlin's work, which is really focusing on those springs and Gaussian process alarms, that's published in Infectious Disease Modelling. And you can get to the GitHub page with all the code from there. Madeleine has a paper about to be published on spatial Spatial, a spatial individual-level version of those models, and there are another couple of papers on them on their way. All right, thanks very much. Thanks a lot. The alarm function is essentially just reducing the contact. And I'm wondering if there might be other data sets that you might consider that cause that reduction. Cause that reduction number, including education or some other sort of media kinds of information. So, for example, you could use something like articles appearing online and so on over time that mention COVID and so is there any you know anything like that? 'Cause it's an independent data set that you can use. So so yeah, so in a sense the Google mobility data is a little bit like Mobile. A little bit like that, right? A little bit, a little bit, yeah. But no, but um, we haven't done that, but it would definitely be a useful thing to do. We were sort of thinking of the extreme situation where you don't have any external sources, but yeah, if you've got that information, tying it to something that ties behavior.
