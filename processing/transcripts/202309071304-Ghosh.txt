Welcome to the venue and for all your talks. So, welcome many things. So, what I'm going to tell you about intrinsically disordered proteins, shifting gear a little bit, and we will talk about shape of this, but in a very rudimentary way that we're really going to talk about the size, actually. That's as close to the shape we're going to get. You will see in a little bit why that's the case. Bit why that's the case. Also, another important point is we're not necessarily trying to interpret the data, we're actually trying to predict the shape. Just to set the state. So, what problem am I looking into? So, IDBs, unlike folded proteins, do not have a well-folded structure, right? So, here is the folded protein, and here is this mess. It's actually in some ensemble of states, so it kind of keeps on fluctuating, it stays in. Keeps on fluctuating, it stays in many different conformations, so that's its sort, right? So, very different from what we have been seeing so far in the structure. And alpha fold is not useful for this kind of things. Discuss later, why not? For now, I'll move on. Okay, so the next important thing what I want to hammer home is, and it's probably something you're all familiar with: proteins are not homopolymers in a sense, we have amino acids that are different. We have amino acids that are different, that are not of the same type. And what's critical for proteins is the order of this amino acids matter, right? So here I'm showing you six reds, greens, blues. But in two of the examples, they are stitched in a different order, right? That's what we call sequence, and that's going to be the main essence of my talk, right? The sequence matters. So before I take out my toolboxes and all that and bore you, let me just tell you. That and bore you. Let me just tell you how sequence can matter. Despite it being disordered, sequence matters. Here, what I'm showing you: two computer simulation of two IDPs, one in cyan, one in red, and they literally vary in one position. But if you do this simulation, and if you believe in simulation, there may be good reason not to believe in that. So, all that's happening here at 41, this negative average. 41, this negative amino acid became positive, and here at 4, this negative amino acid became positive. So, you literally have a difference in one position, otherwise, it's identical, charge composition, everything, and you have a difference in the size. And what is that quantity that's going to come up again and again? It's the end-to-end distance. If I take that protein, N terminal and C terminal is dancing around, right? You go out ensemble average, and that value difference. Okay. Also, from function. Also, from function, the sequence matters. So, a lot of you probably know about this thing called liquid-liquid phase separation. So, when this ID and these IDPs participate in liquid-liquid phase separation, so when it does form droplets, it looks like the left. When it doesn't droplet, then it looks like the right. So, here is the sequence I'm showing you. This is the wild type. And all I'm showing you here is the location of charges. So, the red ones are negative and the negative. So, the red ones are negative and the blue ones are positive. What they did, they took the same protein but they shuffled the charges. And when they did, what they saw, so again, it has the same number of charges, right, as the wild type. Cs is the charge scrambled version, where they shuffle the charges. The original one face separated, and the CS did not. So, you can see also on function, it doesn't make any difference. So, the new paradigm. So, the new paradigm here is you have disordered proofs, you have their confirmation, that predicted function, but all of that under the hood, what's happening is the culprit is the sequence. And what I will try to do, I'll try to show there are some mathematical functions of the sequence, which basically ultimately going to give me some insights to confirmation. And if I can get to the end, then the function. Okay, that's kind of the The main paradigm or dogma of my thought. So far, so good. Okay, so what are the experimental tools? People probe IDPs. So one of the very common ones is a FRET. All-atom simulations are also another avenue. And we do all-atom simulations. But today what I'm going to talk about, because it's a mathematical conference, analytical theory. Conference, analytical theory. And we course grant things and we do paper and pencil calculations. So, what's the starting point? Where do we start? And we take a physics-y approach. So, we start with the Hamiltonian energy function. And, in a very broad way of talking, we have the first thing you have to take care of: these proteins are connected, the covalent relief, which we call chain connectivity, which is taken care of by a term like this, which is very. Care of by a term like this, which is very much like kinetic energy, but let's forget all those details now. This term takes care of the fact that if you have two amino cities, they're going to interact, right? So two-body interaction. And the two-body interaction here you see, this is like an exploded volume or delta function. Then you have a three-body repulsion, so the protein cannot, in case the two-body is very attractive, it doesn't become a point. And the final one is actually very critical. It's what Coulomb told us: it's electrostatics, how charges interact. And IDPs, by the way, are rich with charges, you've got to think about that. That's kind of going to be our focus for the things that are built. Okay, so it looks messy. This is what you have to deal with. And for the mathematicians, this is a coordinate at the location. At the location, S would be administered, but we'll work in the continuum space to make things a bit easier. But then we go down to the discrete space. The whole idea is this messy thing, and you have to, by the way, do Boltzmann with. So you really have to do something like that, right, for all these different paths or conformation. So you want to rewrite this in a form that you can actually. Rewrite this in a form that you can actually handle, which is this. Get rid of all the junk, but of course, there is no free lunch. The way you get rid of the junk, you get an effective bonding. This is a measure of one. And why do you want to write it in this form? Because if you do, it basically eventually becomes Gaussian, which we can do. And all the details of the sequence, by the way, you see what I write here? Q and Q. So that's the charge of an angle. So that's the charge of an amino acid here, an amino acid there, right? And they're going to interact. Product divided by pistons. Okay, so that's where the sequence specificity will come in. So if you go through all the math at the end of the day, when dust settles, we're going to write a free energy as a function of x, and this x will be related to the size. This is where you're going to have the electrostatic term, the charge term, and explicitly, I'm going to take. And explicitly, I'm going to take a little bit to explain what's hidden under the hood. It's a term like that, and that's where the sequence specificity comes in, which we call sequence charge decoration. So, how does that work? So, imagine you have an amino acid here and there, M and N. So, that's Qn, Qn, and by how much they're separated in the background. So, clearly, depending on where charges are, that quantity will change. And that will ultimately affect your size. So that's where the sequence comes in. And how do you determine size? Minimize this with x, not so important, and put that in some formula. This is the number of n masses, that's boundary. That's coming in the integral. So that's how this machinery works. And if you know the sequence, you know where these charges are, and you can calculate this sequence. Okay, so we're going to turn the crank based on that. So, we're going to turn the crank based on that thing. But let's do a test with some toy sequences, which has got nothing. It's not going to look anywhere near like real life. So, Das and Kaku did this work almost 10 years ago, where all they did, they took this two-letter code. So, these E's are negative and K's are positive. These sequences have 25 pluses and 25 minuses, but they're shuffled in different order. And they really wanted to see how the shuffling of the sequence patterning affect. So they did all atom simulation. That's on the y-axis. In the x-axis is what we can now do with our theory. And you can see there is a very good correlation. Now, if you go back, look, remember I said the culprit under the hood is this decoration metric. You can simply You can simply, for each sequence, calculate that, plot that against the simulated radius of direction, radius, some size measure. And you can see there is a very nice trend. So that shows this metric is actually managed to capture how these charges are patterned, even though you have the same number of charges in all the sequences. Is that clear? Yes. Do you know why there seemed to be like these two patterns? Yeah, that's one, you know, because there are non-electrostatic effects, possibly, which we don't exactly model. So there is some scatter for sure, but there is a very strong trend. In the second curve, the Rg comes from simulation. Here we can also turn calculating the thickness. Okay, so at this point, you know, I used to give more and more comparison with simulation, but after many. Simulation, but after many years, I managed to convince an experiment to do the experiment. So I'm going to tell you something really in the furnace. It's still cooking. We're writing the paper as we talk. So Martin Rubella's group decided to help us with some experiments. So we chose this protein, which has 22 positive and 31 negative charges. What we did, we created two variants. Two variants. So, variant one, what we're going to do here, you had some negative ones. We're going to flip, put four positives. In variant two, I'm also going to put four positives where there were four negatives, but at a different location. So now variant one and two are going to have same number of negative and positive charges, but in different orders for sure. Alright. And we can calculate that S C D. And we can calculate that S C D. What we from the calculation, you know, this one has a lower S C D than that one, okay? And actually, you may ask, how the heck did I come up with these combinations, right? We actually came up by shuffling, going through all different possibilities of 35,000 or so and calculating that, which can be done very easily within seconds. Okay, so what's the prediction? The prediction is variant one will have a lower S C D, hence. Variant 1 will have a lower S C D, hence it will have a lower size than variant 2. So then Martin did this experiment and they do it with freck. And the simple idea is basically if it is more compact, the fret probes will come closer, there will be more exchange of energy, you will get a high signal. So high signal, meaning they are more compact. So now I'm going to show you the data. And this is what Martin found out. So let's look at variant 1 and 2, red and blue. Red and blue. So the red one has high signal, fresh signal, but this is more compact. One has predicted. So we are working on many other variants and all that right now. But so now let me move on from this very basic description. So they can't estimate the RT? They can, they can estimate also the size, but that means calibration and lot of nuances which we haven't done yet. We have to subtract backgrounds. You have to subtract backgrounds and yeah. But with somebody else, I'm sure you're working on that kind of stuff. Okay, so what I just told you, I told you this metric and a way of figuring out the distance between the two metals. But you could possibly ask, what about distance between anywhere else? And these kind of experiments are possible. What they do, they fret pairs. So they would put a probe here and a probe there, and they can Here and a probe there, and they can see both the energy exchange. So, potentially, these things would also be useful. So, now we have managed to do the math for that one as well, which is going to look a bit more complicated. Just like before, you get our free energy, but now pay attention, there will be an index ij, because that will depend on where inside the protein you're going to grow. Okay, and when you do that, again, there is a culprit, this is the electrostatic term. This is the electrostatic term that depends on ij. If I really open that up, that looks a bit messy, but the whole point is again that depends on the patterning of the charges, where the charges are. And now for each ij, you have a pattern in terms. Is that okay? So now, based on that, and you know, you could potentially ask how can I do this now? This will go back in some function, and that will. Go back in some function, and that will give you the distance between two monomers ij. And why there are four terms? Because of their different diagrams that show up, that will like Feynman diagrams, which some of you may not know or may not. Let's ignore that. So now from that theory, what we can do, this is a theoretical prediction now, between different residues, right? At i and j. I can vary, j can vary, and what you can see, there are regions where this is very. Regions where this is very bright, that means it's more expanded. There are regions where it's more dark, where it's more compact. So the bottom triangles, and these three triangles are for three different proteins. The top triangles are from atomistic simulation. And as you can see, you know, it's not perfect, but it does get the regions of expandedness and compactness. So then what we do, we actually, so this is kind of the size, right? But again, what's happening under the hood, right? What's the metric that's really doing things? It's that metrics that I showed you, the S C D M metrics. If you go and look up, you will see, let's take this one for example, right? Some areas where it's negative, some areas is positive, and it's electrostatics, right? So some areas it's attractive, some areas is repulsive, right? And you can actually plot this map. And that's basically it's reflecting, right? And that's basically what is reflecting, right? This bright red area, it's repulsion, so it should be more expensive, right? Makes sense. Blue areas, more attractive, so are dark. So those, and now I'm going to come back to these. These metrics are starting to give us a handle on how to think about these systems. Okay. So now, what we did, we take again, we're looking into another possibility called phosphorylation, right? So the white. Called phosphorylation, right? So the wild-type sequence I'm drawing on top. So what phosphorylation does, right, if you have residues like S, it can become negative. So the S54, S56, the green one, is having those two S's in the wild type right there, becomes E. And here you can have a different phosphorylation where these S and T has changed to E. So again, you're going to have two sequences with very similar composition. With very similar composition but different pattern. And biology can phosphorylate in different locations. So, what we are going to show you is, oops, for two of these, right, depending on where you phosphorylate, you get a very different kind of pattern, right? And this one is from the theory, this one is from computer simulation, and this one, again, the lower triangle from theory, the top one from very expensive computer simulation. So, you can see. So you can see there is a vast difference. And moreover, there is another interesting point. Look, where am I making the change here at 2 and 15, right? So that's going to be somewhere here. But that change here reflects bigger change somewhere far away. So this is a bit like our story, right? You make a change here, it can propagate far. Okay, so these things are now helping us serve as a molecular blueprint. Helping us serve as a molecular blueprint. So, what we do is, you know, NIH is not very happy with all those diagrams and the physics behind it. They want to understand function. So, we're going to, we've started using this front-piston IDP function. So, let me tell you the story here, and let me just first tell you what is the challenge for IDP function. So, usually, if you get two proteins, so one protein, you don't know the function, what do you do? You go and sleep if that sequence is a. You go and see if that sequence has any alignment in the database. If you find an alignment, you say, okay, I think this works that way, right? Or if it is a folded protein, you can also try to see alignment with the well-known structure. Now for IDP, okay, so just to tell you what do I mean by the alignment, because not everybody doing proteins every day, right? So these are different sequences of proteins from different organisms that does the same thing, and you will see there are many alphabets that is very highly conserved, right? So when you Highly considered, right? So, when you do that for folded proteins, you will get a very nice alignment. For ITPs, that doesn't work. And I'll tell you in a little bit how bad that is. So, we're going to consider this IDP called ST50, which works in some pathways, customer adaptation and making. But here is the sequence. So, this region is IDP, well, actually, it's IDR, because it's sandwiched between the two folder domains. Two fold agreements. These are folded, that's the disorder curve. Now, the next thing that we'll show you, if you consider that region from all these different organisms and try to align them, it looks horrible. It doesn't align except for some of these parts. There are huge gaps. They vary vastly varying length. And obviously, there is no structure, right? So you cannot compare the structures either. So, what do you do there? So, now. Okay. So now what happened with this thing? So people did some experiments, very clever and beautiful experiments. So this is the wild type IDR. It also has these phosphorylation sites. What they did, they knocked out those phosphorylation sites by alanine. Then what they did, and when they did that, this thing functions fine because that's boil type, this thing did not. And I'll tell you what function means. So there are many markers of function, but one of them is these are the yeast cells. They grow normally or they grow abnormally. So when this one, you have this one, it doesn't, it's abnormal. Now, they took this region from a different organism, but in the same class, they slice that portion, put it in here, and then it grows again. Is that clear, everybody? Clear everybody? Okay. So, what I'm telling you here, I'm showing you three examples. The wild type is normal, five A's are normal, and this one is normal, although that comes from a different organism. Even better, what they did, then they took these two ideas, which has got nothing to do with this series. So, imagine one of them is like a kidney, another one is like a lung, and we're listening for heart. For hard. And just to show you the alignment of these two with the wild type, it's terrible. When you put this one by cutting that one off, it rescues function and this one doesn't. So the red, among these five, the red ones don't function, the blue ones function. That's the moral of the story. So now the sequence alignment doesn't work, there is no structure. So what do we do? So we said, well, perhaps we can use our SCTM. Perhaps we can use our SCDM matrix as a molecule of nuclear. So here are those five sequences. For each one of them, I have that matrix. We flatten it, so we make it one DRA. Put them in a big matrix. Now, this is where I was asking earlier somebody for help. So these are also of different lengths. So we kind of interpolate them and then bring them all the same size and then put them in. And then put them in metrics like that. And then what we do, we do PCA and then we cluster them. And then, indeed, now you see the ones that actually function, they're falling to the one cluster, and the ones that don't, they're separate. So again, you want to go back and see then, you know, what's happening. So remember, I told you there is that matrix where you can see all these electrostatics. The red is repulsive, the blue is attractive. So this is that matrix. So, this is that map for all these five proteins. If you look at the functional ones by eye, you can probably see there are these regions of three repulsive loads, whereas the non-functional ones look completely different. That's probably what's being preserved, right? And these are just the first few steps to figure out evolution of IDPs, right? And why evolution of IDPs so different? Because they diverged a lot. Their sequences don't align, destroy structure. Let's try structures, right? So, we're actually doing this also with some other families of proteins now. We're also looking into this for large data sets. Lily is working on this, do some machine learning. But one of the challenges right now here is, I'll skip this, the sizing, right? So, if somebody has some better ideas other than interpolation that we're doing, that would be very We're doing that will be very helpful. Let's see. Do I have a few more minutes? Or what's happening? Five minutes? Yeah, it has a few more minutes. Five minutes, four minutes. But before I say something else, maybe another story. Any questions at this point? Yeah. Okay, so question that maybe a bit naive. So I think if you replace the sequence and the residual. If you replace the sequence and the residues just by charge information, right? And you try to do some alignment. Don't you think that would work better then? Based on the physics that you described? But we cannot really align them because they are so different in length. Okay, so another thing, instead of getting, for example, I'm taking lysine and arginine, which are both positive, right? So if you just identify them as the same residue, you see what I'm saying? You see what I'm saying? Identify them as what? Like the same residue. Yeah, yeah, we do. In our theory, also, we do take care of the same residue plus one. Yeah, so that that would help? No, so the alignment really, because of different length, they even have different charge content. So it's really the regular alignment at least is not clear. People have counted like net charge, and people have come up with some. People have come up with some ideas. So, actually, this is a good question also. So, for some system, they have found out maybe the net charge really works. For some systems, they have found out how the charge is spread around on the sequence, like a cluster of plus or minuses. What we found, so the one I showed you only one example, there are two other examples we dealt with. For all three different examples where people had different ideas, all of that is explained with this SCDM map match. Achieve. Second question is that do you have you thought about the solvent? Solvent, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good. So right now all I'm doing, I'm doing this charge thing, right? And again, because these are very highly charged systems. Indeed, so what we're now doing, just like SCBN, you have another matrix, which we call SHDM, sequence hydropath matrix, which comes from basically the messing with. Comes from basically the messing with, remember I have this other non-electrostatic two-body term? So that's when you deal with that, yeah, and actually it's in this term. So the only problem is, you know, with charge, you know, Coulomb told this, right, how the interaction works, right? So here we have to parametrize, and that's what we're working on. So they are actually recently working on from simulation data to parameter. From simulation data to parametrize this. Yeah, but that's how we are trying to think of chromosomes. I do. How much of this can be extended to chromosome organization? Well, so one of the proteins, one of the families that we looked into, it does help. Yeah, so this is a P family called PSC. So this one actually helps, it prevents chromatin remodeling and it helps chromatin compaction. And what happens in this one, this is this IDR region that actually basically they find out the binding. So then they classify all these sequences from all these different organisms. Sequences from all these different organisms. Again, no correlation, no alignment, nothing, but this is the CDM map. You actually get a pretty good cluster. So this one, for example. So all these sequences, you have a binding constant and something at what percentage it inhibits the remotely. So you see, for example, those two are far out there, and those two are also far out in our. And then there are all these different clusters that more or less. These different clusters that more or less work layer one-of-cloud layers. We don't know why. But short answer is, for some cases, it works. Long answer, we don't know yet. Yes. So we have those three guys that have the same heat map loop, but they are not the same size, right? Correct. So what is actually concerned between them is somehow their internal structure. That's right. Their internal structure, that's right. So, if they both lead to a functional activity, so does it mean that they interact with one another or do they interact with something else? If they interact with something else, then it doesn't make sense because it's size would be different, right? Correct. Yeah. So, in this case, they don't interact with each other. There are also examples of where they interact with each other, and that's the communicative test perhaps that I may talk if we have time. That I never thought of at the time, but um, yeah, in this case, it's quite strange, right? So, what happens? This is um, upon they do get phosphorylated and then they don't form some complex, and then they change the behavior. So, somehow, whatever complexation happens, probably it needs this kind of morphology, or maybe this morphology helps it be in some conformation to interact with the binding partners. So, it's all speculative. It's all speculative right now. It's just a bit weird because it would interact with the same thing, supposedly, but this thing has a characteristic. But that thing can also actually vary from organism to organism. So there is a co-evolution happening. Yeah. Another idea about trying to compare those matrixes. So why not use a randomization group in polymers, right? In polymers, right? This is how we can go from one leg to the other. Yeah, well, we are trying that with a separate. Well, this is one type of renormalization, but because of heterogeneity, it's harder to do the RG. Right, but then you would have to have partial charges or something like that, but that's you know. That works for homopolymers, but the math is very difficult for this kind of heteropolymers. This kind of hydrovoltimize. Okay. So I think I should stop, right? So okay. However, now I'll just put that knowledge on its left. So thank you.
