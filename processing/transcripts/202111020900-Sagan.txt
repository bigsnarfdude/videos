Okay, Nathan, thank you for that spirited introduction. And thank you to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak. And this is all joint work with Sergi Elizalde, Matthew Plant, and Tom Roby, who are in the audience. And so I can fob off any questions on them, which is always useful. And if you're interested in this stuff, and I hope you will be, you can find a copy of the preprint on which Find a copy of the preprint on which it's based, either at my website there or on the archive. And let me give you an outline of the talk. So I will start by defining what a fence is. For those of you that were at the problem session yesterday, you know what a fence is already, but I'm not assuming everybody was there. And then one of our primary tools for doing row motions on fences, which are a type of poset, Which are a type of POSET is via certain tilings. So I'll describe those tilings in the second section. And we also have some results in the paper which are actually more general than just for fences, but which have nice application in the case that you have a fence floating around. So I'll talk about one of those in the third section, which is a result about self-dual posets, and then I'll end with the traditional comments and future work section. In the future work section. So, and please, we've got lots of time. Stop me at any point if anything is unclear. So, what is, let's set some notation and tell you what a fence is. So, suppose I've got a finite group G acting on a finite set. And of course, we're going to be interested in statistics on the set. So, ST will be a statistic. Will be a statistic. And of course, then if you look at the orbits of the group action, you can apply the statistic to the orbit by just summing up the statistic values on the individual elements. And one of the things that is much studied in the dynamical algebraic combinatorics community is this notion of homomessy. So statistic is homomessic if the Statistic is homomessic if the average over an orbit is always the same. And in particular, sorry, moving along from there, when we're looking at fences, we find this new notion, which as far as we know has not come up before. And if somebody knows of a place where it has arisen, we'd love to know about it. We'd love to know about it. We call it being homometric rather than homomesic. So the statistic is homometric if whenever you have two orbits of the same size, you get the same statistic value. Okay, so of course homomessy is stronger. If it's homomessic, then it's definitely homometric because you just multiply this equation by the cardinality. Equation by the cardinality. But the converse is not true, and as I said, in this setting of row motion on fences, we find statistics which are homometric but not homomesic. Okay, any questions about this notion? This will be important for us later. Okay, so again, just setting up some notation, P will be a finite poset. I'll use Post set. I'll use this triangle less than or equal to for the partial order on P. Script A of P will be the set of anti-chains. And of course, we'll also need ideals. I'm mostly going to be talking about lower-order ideals. So when I just say ideal, I mean lower order ideal, not filter. And I'll let that set of those be I of P. And then row will denote. And then rho will denote rho motion on antichains in the usual way, right? You take your antichain, you take the ideal it generates, you take its complement, you take the minimal elements. And if I want to talk about row motion on ideals, I'll put a hat on the row. And this you'll see throughout. If I have something on addi-chains, it will be. If I have something on anti-chains, it will be without the hat. If you have something with anti-chains, it will be with the hat. Okay? So that's the general setup. And now let me tell you what a fence is. So a fence is a partially ordered set, F. It's got elements x1 through xn, and the way it's constructed is as follows. You take a sequence of covers, x1 covered by x2, etc. Covered by x2, etc., up through xA. So you take an S, think of this as an ascending chain going up a chain. Then you attach to that a chain going down. So XA covering XA plus 1 down through XB. Then you go up XB plus 1, etc., etc. And you do that as many times as you feel like. So for example, here's a chain, right? I go up three elements, down four elements, up three elements. Elements, up three elements, and down two. Now, aside from these being nice simple posets, there are good reasons to study them because of their connections with other areas of mathematics. These are extremely important in cluster algebras. This is just another way of viewing Jim Prop's snake graphs. They're important in the theory of Q analogs. There's a series of recent papers by Morchie-Zhanu and Ovsienko where they use these posets to. Where they use these posets to define Q-analogs not just of integers, but of rational numbers and even real numbers. There's an interesting unimentality conjecture floating around, which I can talk about more later if there are questions concerning these. And they're also connected to Young diagrams. In fact, if you think about it, this is just the Young diagram for a border strip. That's just the partially ordered set. That's all it is. And if you prefer to think of it that way, that's perfectly fine. That's perfectly fine. And we already know that, you know, row motion on a product of chains is nice. And that, of course, is a rectangular Young diagram. So you might expect that something interesting would happen here. So just to give us some terminology, these maximal chains in F are called its segments. So, right, this chain has four segments. This one, this one, this one. This one, this one, this one, and this one. Now, I'm going to give you, I need a way of describing this fence in terms of, you know, roughly how many elements there are on each segment. There are, in fact, many different ways to index fences. How you index them depends upon the theorems that you're trying to prove about them. Some theorems look nicer with one Some theorems look nicer with one indexing set than with another. So we had to come up with a special indexing set for our purposes that made our theorems look nice. And this has to do with shared elements. So two elements that are on an element which is on two segments is called shared. So, right, I put in red the shared elements. X3 is on the first two segments, X6 is on the next two segments, X8 is on the last two segments. X8 is on the last two segments. All other elements are unshared. So I put in black the unshared elements. And then here's the indexing system. And it will look a little strange now, but you will see why this is a good indexing system in a bit. So suppose F has S segments, little S segments. Segments, little s segments. Then I will write f as f brev. I use the brev symbol because it has to do with the unshared elements. And I've feed it this composition. So this composition has one part, alpha i, for each segment, for the ith segment. And alpha i is just one more than the number of unshared elements on the ith segment. Now, this looks bizarre when you first see it. Why don't you just let alpha i? When you first see it, why don't you just let alpha be the number of unshared elements? There is a good reason for that, but you won't be able to see it until we've done a little bit more development. But just believe me for now, this is the good indexing system. So for example, going back to this example, this would be fBrev of 3322, right? We have two unshared elements, so that gives me 2 plus 1 or 3. 2 here, which gives me 3. 1 here plus 1 gives me 2. 1 plus 1 gives me 2. Gives me 2, 1 plus 1 gives me 2. Everybody understand the indexing system. This is, of course, going to be important. Questions. And this is a good place for questions because I'm about to go on to the next section. Everything clear? Good. I like that. So, to motivate the tiling representation. The tiling representation of the orbits, I'm going to start with an example to make life a little bit clearer. So let's take a particular anti-chain in this fence that we've been using as our example. So, right, it's x1, x4, and x8. And notice I'm continuing to color, and this is important, this will be important in a second, I'm continuing to color code things with black elements being unshared. Elements being unshared and red elements being shared. So, think about what does row motion do to this? Well, I generate this lower order ideal. The only two things not in the complement are these, and so when I do row motion, it's going to just give me the minimum element here, which is x2, which is unshared. Okay, now here's how I'm going to make so yeah, so. So, yeah, so just row motion on that anti-chain gives me A2, X2. So, here's how we're going to represent this. I'm going to take for each anti-chain a column of four boxes, four because there are four segments here. So, the ith box from the top will represent the ith segment, and I'm going to use S sub i for the ith segment. Sub i for the ith segment. That will be my notation. We color the box for SI black if that segment intersect the anti-chain is an unshared element. I color it red if the intersection of that chain with the of that segment with the anti-chain is a shared element, and otherwise I color it yellow. I color it yellow if there's nothing on that segment from the anti-chain. So, doing that, we now see this row motion as follows. Right? I had a black box here for the X1, a black box here for the X4. This is on two segments, so that means we're, right, we will, these red boxes will always come in vertical pairs. Will always come in vertical pairs. And then here I have a black box for the X2, and then the other three segments, there's nothing on them, so they all get yellow boxes. Questions about how I'm color coding these guys? Okay, so this then will lead to our tilings. Lead to our tilings. So, what we're going to do is we're going to take all of these columns and we're going to put them together on a cylinder, right? Since it's an orbit, it's going to be going round and round. And that's going to give us, so I'm calling the cylinder C sub S, because S is the number of rows. And then we're going to see how do adjacent tiles coalesce. Less either in rows or columns. Okay? So, for example, here is one of the orbits for FBrev of 434. So I've got three segments, so I'm going to have three rows. As we saw before, the red tiles are always in pairs, so I'm going to think of, I'm sorry, the red boxes are always in pairs, so I'm going to think of that as a single tile. Since it's Since it's a cylinder, I am identifying this edge and this edge, which is why this tile starts here and reappears here. And now look at the lengths, look at what happens to the black boxes, to the unshared elements. Right, this box would represent the smallest unshared element on the first segment. This would represent the next smallest and then the largest unshared element. They always occur. They always occur in these length 3 tiles, if we put them together, interspersed with yellow tiles. And that's why I wanted to use a 4 here rather than a 3. We've got 3 unshared elements, but these guys can be matched with having no element. And so the lengths that we're going to be using. And so the lengths that we're going to be using are these lengths for bits. Similarly here, we have two unshared elements, right? So we get tiles of length 2 interspersed with nothings or with red tiles, and similarly for the last row. Everybody see how these things are now starting to match up. So what we're going to try and do is give you a way of Give you a way of describing exactly the tilings that arise from orbits. And then we're going to be able to prove things using just the tiling and not having to worry about the orbits themselves directly. So here's how we characterize the tilings. So I've got my composition alpha, and then the corresponding tilings will be called alpha tilings. Alpha tilings. So the tiles will involve one by one yellow tiles, right? The yellow tiles are just single boxes. Two by one red tiles. And one by alpha one minus one black tiles, these guys. Remember, so this alpha i minus one is the number of unshared elements. So one by the number of unshared elements. And the rules that these tiles have to follow are, there's Have to follow, or there's two of them. First of all, if you've got a row where there should be some black tiles, that's what this condition is telling you, and you forget about the red tiles, exactly what I was talking about holds. The black and the yellow tiles always alternate. So, right, remove that red, forget about that red tile, and then it goes yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, black. And that's true in every row. And that's true in every row. Second condition is, whoopsie. Where do the red, so this tells us about the yellow and the black tiles, what about the red tiles? Well, the red tiles either occur just before a pair of yellow tiles or just after a pair of yellow tiles. That's essentially what the second condition is telling you. And whether it's before or after depends upon And whether it's before or after depends upon the parody of the row of the, I call this the head box of the red tile is in. Okay? And any tiling that satisfies these two restrictions comes from an orbit and vice versa. Any tiling that we get from an orbit satisfies these two restrictions. Questions about this characterization? Yeah, can there be two red tiles next to each other? No, there cannot. No, there cannot. There cannot. Because of the fact that I so, for example, if I had to try and put two red tiles in this row and they were next to each other, it would violate the condition that any red tile has got to be followed by two yellow tiles. But I thought it was either followed by or preceded by. Yes, but in a given row, depending upon the parody, it's always followed by or preceded by. Or preceded by. So in the first row, if the head of the tile is in the first row, it's always after. And if for things where the head is in the second row, it's always before. You don't get to choose. Got it. Does that make sense, Jim? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Great. Excellent. Other questions to clarify these guys? I think another answer to Jim would be that you you have to alternate yellow and black. Yellow and black. No, that would. If I put another red here and had two yellows here, that would still do the alternating of the yellow and black, but it would not. That rule doesn't give it to you. This rule doesn't give you a gift. You would have two yellows following each other. I'm saying insert a red. Yeah, okay. Okay. Other questions or comments? Comments. Okay. Gabriel has a question. I don't know if it's been answered. Gabriel, yeah, I don't have my, I can't see the chat. So if you put things in the chat, it's not going to get answered. Please ask. Please speak up. Oh, sorry. Sorry, Bruce. Not a problem if you didn't know. So I was wondering why you can't have two red tiles in adjacent columns that are In adjacent columns that are staggered by one row. Because then you'd have the same problem. Suppose I tried to put a red tile here, then you wouldn't have this red tile preceded by a yellow tile in both of the rows. What if the higher red tile was after? Aha. Let's see here. If the higher red tile is after. If the higher red tile is after that, yes, if the higher higher red tile. Okay, now Francois's comment holds if. If you put the higher red tile after, then you are forced to put a yellow tile after that. Oh, and then the yellow turnation. So yeah, Francois actually had a point. In order to disallow that, then the alternation comes in. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks. Pardon Francois. Okay. Autre question. Any other questions? Okay, so let's see what we can do with this fancy little new tiling gadget that we've... Well, it reduces calculating the things you want to calculate to just calculating the number of tiles in each row. Of tiles in each row. So let's just give some notation for that. Bi is going to be the number of black tiles in row i. Ri is going to be the number of red tiles whose top box is in row i. And chi of O, so chi here, there's a defining chi, chi of O is for anti-chain elements in the orbit. Well, then it's almost trivial to say. Almost trivial to see that if you want to calculate chi O of the orbit, you just make this nice sum here, right? Because think about it. If the sum in the RIs gives you the number of red tiles, right, each red tile corresponds to an element, either a maximal element or a minimal element of the posset. This is a sum of alpha i times, sorry, bi times alpha i minus 1. But remember, alpha i minus 1 is But remember, alpha i minus 1 is the number of unshared elements on each of the black tiles. And bi is just telling you how many black tiles there were. And of course, you don't need to consider the yellow tiles because the yellow tiles were when the intersection was empty, when there wasn't anything there. End of story. And you can similarly write down formulas for the sizes of the orbits, for the number of ideal elements in the orbits, right? All these things that you can do. Right? All these things that you care about. You can also compute more refined things, such as chi sub x. So chi sub x would be the number of times a particular element x appears in the anti-Cherry invariant of the orbit. And then this gives you, you can then just rattle off a bunch of theorems. Let me give you a couple so that you can see what they look like. That you can see what they look like. So, suppose you have three elements on the same segment: x is the unshared element and y and z are the two shared elements. Then one always has, and suppose they're on the ith segment, S sub i, then the statistic alpha i times checking how many copies of x plus how many copies of y plus how many copies of z is always one messic. And it's a straightforward calculation using these formulas. These formulas. This has become, it becomes, it makes things almost automatic. You don't have, Jerome Zeilberger would like this. I'm glad some people got that joke. Okay, so let me also give you the very simplest case of a fence that has got just two segments, say A and B. What is the orbit structure? Well, again, we're going to see this homo magic. We're going to see this homometric versus homomesic thing. Almost all the orbits have size L, which is the LCM of A and B. And this also shows you why I picked number of unshared plus 1. If I had just picked number of shared, this would be a little bit not so not, it would be less pretty. It would be the least common multiple of a minus 1 and b minus 1. Here it's just the least common multiple of a b. And then there's this one. B. And then there's this one lonely orbit, O prime, that has size exactly one more. Right? So most have size L, one has size L plus one. For the orbits of size L, if I calculate this beast, I get this fraction dividing by the G C D. And if I call that M, the size of the number of anti- The size of the number of anti-chain elements in O prime, this lone orbit of size L plus 1, is m plus 1. So this is almost like a logarithmic homo messy, right? The differences work out to be constant, but not the ratios. So this is the the kind of stuff that we keep seeing as we analyze these guys. Any questions about the Any questions about the tiling model before we go on to the next section? Okay, so as I said, we have also some results which are more general but apply to certain fences. So let me show you the one that we have about self-dual posets. So P star as usual will be the dual of P and suppose that And suppose that P is self-dual, isomorphic to its dual. Again, let's take a particular example fence. I mean, obviously this here, P does not need to be a fence, but we're doing things with fences. So here's P, and P is self-dual, right? If you just rotate P 180 degrees, it comes back onto itself. So that means there's an order reversing bijection from P to itself. From P to itself, right? This says that there's an order preserving bijection from P to the dual. Well, now if you just consider the exactly the same bijection, but to P, it becomes order reversing. So, right, here is kappa for this poset, right? When I do this rotation by 180 degrees, it just takes x sub i to x sub 9 minus i, right? x sub 1 to x sub 8, x sub 2 to x sub 7, etc. X of 2 to X of 7, etc., etc., etc. So now we're going to define a strange type of complement, which is not your normal complement. So we're calling it ideal complement. So if I take an ideal, its ideal complement is gotten by first applying this bijection kappa and then taking normal complement in the poset, taking everything that's not. Taking everything that's not in kappa of I. So let's take a look and see. Notice this is going to give you an ideal back. Why? When we apply kappa, since it's order reversing, it's going to take this ideal to a filter. But then of course taking normal complement of a filter returns you to the ideal land. To the ideal land. So, this is a map on ideals. Let's take a look and see what it does in this particular case. Suppose I take the ideal here consisting of x1, x2, x4, x5, and x6. I apply kappa, right? I rotate this diagram. So the x1 and x2 become the x7 and x8. These guys become x3, x4, x5, and now I complement. So, right, I get x1. So, right, I get x1, x2, and x6. So that is I bar. Everybody see how we're doing this complement type thing. Okay. Crucial observation. The number of elements of i plus the number of elements in i bar is the number of elements in my partially ordered set, right? Because we at the Because this stage does not change the number of elements, and when you take complement, that's what complements do for a living. Okay, so chi-hat, now we're calculating not the number of things in an anti-chains, but the number of ideal elements in an orbit. So here's the theorem. So suppose P is any self-dual poset. Let n be the number of Let n be the number of elements of p. Fix your order-reversing by some order-reversing bijection, doesn't matter which one. Take any ideal. Then, if I and I bar are in the same orbit, then the number of ideal elements in that orbit divided, right, the usual average is exactly n over 2. To. Why is that? Well, essentially, what you're doing here by us making this assumption is you're assuming that this can be used to show that if I and I bar are in that orbit, then for any ideal in that orbit, its bar is also in that same orbit. So you can pair up all the ideals in that orbit with their bars, and therefore you're going to get n over 2 because the sum of, as we said, Because the sum of, as we said, the cardinality of I and the cardinality of I bar is N. And there's two of them. I have a question. Yes, Prop. Are I and I bar always halfway around the orbit from each other in this case? No. And in fact, they go in opposite directions. So what happens is you, they, um, yeah. So at some point, you will have either an ideal who is its own bar, or you will have Is its own bar, or you will have I and I bar next to each other, and then they move out from there. So those two are adjacent, the next two are going around the circle in opposite ways. That's how it works. So yeah, other questions? So, well, obvious question is: what happens if I and I bar aren't in the same orbit? Well, that's also nice. Well, that's also nice. If I is in some orbit and I bar is in some other orbit, O bar, then this map sets up a bijection between the two orbits. And if you look at their union, the number of ideal elements in the union over the cardinality of the union, which of course was just double this, again you get n over 2. So, So, we have actually now a new group action. So, what's happening, the way to think about this is: consider the group generated both by row motion on ideals and the bar map. And now look at its orbits, which I'm going to call super orbits because, right, they contain the original orbits of rho bar, sorry, of rho hat. Rho bar, sorry, of rho hat. They're unions. So the super orbits are either orbits of rho hat or unions of two orbits of rho hat. Question? So then this? Yes. Are these just orbits under a dihedral group action? I'm not sure where the dihedral. I mean, we've only got one reflection here. I'm not sure how I see the full dihedral, and which dihedral group are you seeing? Yeah, I guess I'm not sure either. Dihedral group. Yeah, I guess I'm not sure either. Okay. But it was a nice idea. I liked the idea. I just can't see how to make it work. So the way to really think about this theorem is that if P is self-dual and n is the number of elements, then chi bar in super orbit space is always n over 2 messic. Okay. Okay, and that's all I've got to say about self-dual things. Are there more questions before we go on to the last section? So for that last theorem. Yes. I mean, isn't it true that if you look at the group generated by um complementation and any other anything at all that um you'll get this homo messy. You'll get this homomessy. So if you add an extra action or you don't add anything, anyways, the orbits are just going to be unions of things that are complements of each other, right? I guess you could, there may be a way of souping this up to other ways of complementing. You just have to be careful that you have. Careful that you have one and two satisfied by however you do some sort of complement. So I'm not sure whether that answers your question. Yeah, maybe we can discuss later. Sorry. Yeah, not a problem, Sam. I'm more than happy to discuss ideas about this because I consider what we've done just kind of the beginnings of some of this stuff. There's definitely other places it can be pushed that. Places it can be pushed that we just didn't we had enough stuff and we just said we need to go into other projects and so we wrote up what we had but that was not because we had we were you know didn't have things that needed to be done any other questions okay so let me talk about other things so this is just a review uh of Review of the open problem that I gave yesterday, but some of you weren't there. So, one particularly nice choice for this composition, alpha, is when it's constant. So, let alpha be A to the S, which is shorthand for A repeated S times. Then we have the following conjecture about the fence, the corresponding. The fence, the corresponding F brev. We conjecture that the statistic chi, the one on antichains, is always homometric. It is not, repeat, not always homomesic. We have examples where it's not. But all the examples we've computed, it does seem to be homometric. However, if S is odd, However, if s is odd, then we conjecture that chi hat on ideals is n over 2 messic, where as usual n is the number of elements of the fence. Now, having seen the previous theorem, remember when s is odd, this is going to make this a self-dual poset. So you would say, well, why can't you use the previous theorem? And the reason you can't use the previous theorem is the previous theorem would only apply. Is the previous theorem would only apply if all the super orbits and the orbits were the same thing. We only had n over 2 messic on super orbits. And this is not true. We have examples of A and S where the super orbits actually combine orbits from ordinary row motion, and therefore we cannot use that to get this. This. But it still seems to be true. Another thing that I wanted to mention was another one of our more general results, which has to do with toggles. So just general setup, S is your set. You've got some toggle group associated, right? So you've got some family of sets which you're toggling over. And then the base graph of your toggling. Of your toggle group denoted g sub t, so it's vertices of the toggles, and you put an edge between two toggles if they don't commute, just like in a Dinkin diagram for a Coxeter group. So here's a theorem that we can prove about looking at, right, and usually what you're interested in is Coxeter elements and applying these Coxeter elements. So if this So if this graph is acyclic and I take any two coxeter elements of T, say they generate groups W and W prime, then essentially what we're saying here is you get homo messy or homometric things for one group if and only if you do for the other. So once you have it for one So, once you have it for one set of toggles, you get it automatically for the other set of toggles, if that's something that you want to have. And in particular, to apply this to fences, it's not hard to show that the base graph for the toggle group on ideals is acyclic, and so this. Is acyclic, and so this theorem applies in that case. It is not true that the base graph for the toggle group on anti-chains is acyclic. So it doesn't give us anything in that case, but at least it does for ideals. And with that, thanks so much for listening. Hey, let's thank Bruce. Thank you, Bruce. My pleasure. Thanks for coming. All right, there was a lot of questions in the chat and during the talk. Does anyone have a question now? Feel free to repeat what you said in the chat since Bruce can't read it. Yeah, because the way I've got my full screen, I could not see the chat. So yeah, if you've got any that you'd like to have me answer for real, I'm happy to do so. Or maybe some of my co-authors got answered some of the ones in the Bruce. Yeah. Bruce, I must have missed something at some point, but when you were talking about the I and I bar and getting N over 2 homo messic there, N over 2 messic. Right. So this is the situation with self-dual, right? So that so that the size of the So that the size of the ideals are just alternating between k and n minus k, right? I mean, they don't. I wouldn't say alternate, but what I would say is that you can pair up ideals so that they're... I thought when you were describing it, you... I'm asking. Yeah. When you were describing, you... Oh, maybe I must have missed something in the description. So you were first applying the rotation. Applying the rotation, and then you were taking the complement. Exactly. So you're always going, so if this is size 5, this must be size 8 minus 5. Right, exactly. Right? And then if you apply it again, you get back to 5, right? Yes, yes, yes. So I bar bar is yes. So you are pairing up. I wasn't sure what you meant by pairing up. I wasn't sure what you meant. Now I understand what's going on. Okay, right, right. I just figured out. I was using the bar operation and the row motion. Ah, okay. Yes, this is not row motion. In fact, I very specifically pick this example. This is not row motion, right? If I take the complement here, take its minimal elements, and generate an ideal, you do not get this. Okay, good. That's fine. Very nice. I've explained as usual. Oh, thanks so much. As usual, oh, thanks so much, Peter. Great to see you. Okay. Other questions? Yeah, I'm still trying to track down the... I'm sorry. Why don't you go next? I've talked before. So, Bruce, in a sense, these two notions of homomestic and homometric are two special cases of the more general notion that you could have if you replace the way you count. If you replace the way you count the number of elements in an orbit, say if you count them all up mod one, then they're going to have the same number of elements. So you could have a counting that would be with weights for in general. Have you considered this? No, no, we did not look at that. We did not look at that. But that's a very interesting idea as a way of trying. As a way of trying, because I kept trying to think of a way of, yeah, getting some sort of general structure and then saying homo messy is this part of the structure and homometry is this other part of the structure and maybe this weighted idea of yours is the way to go. We definitely did not think about that. Thank you for a very nice talk, as usual. I won't repeat what others say, but I'm used to you. Praise to you. Merci beaucoura, François, c'est. Tous journal pleasier. Okay. Jim? Yeah, I just want someone to remind me of the situation with examples of cyclic actions that don't exhibit homomissy, where if you extend it to a dihedral action, suddenly you get homomissy along orbits. Because somehow Bruce's talk reminds me of those examples, but I can't remember what they are. I can't be of a help with that. So if Sam or Melody would chime in. Well, I guess I'll track down Sam or Melody later and ask them. Sounds good. Sounds good. Other questions? Other questions for me or anybody else?
