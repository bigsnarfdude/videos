That I did when I was a postdoc in Daniel Weissman's group at Emory University, using his money but not advancing his research purpose. And then I will also talk about an extension of, whoops, an extension that I've been using, an extension that I've been doing at my new job at Elmer Street. So, I'm going to start with a little story. It was 2020. It was the depths of COVID isolation. It was the depths of COVID isolation. This was before I got a cat. I was very bored, very lonely, very sad. I was on a Zoom call with an aerospace engineer, so not a biologist, not a mathematician, aerospace engineer. She was telling me about a very bad day she had with a guy who talked only about sea cucumbers the whole time. So he didn't have a TV, only talked about sea cucumbers. He was a grad student, worked on sea cucumbers. A little bit related, right? So that conversation, she was ranting a bit, and then she said, She was ranting a bit, and then she said something that I'm going to paraphrase the second part, but not the first part. Sea cucumbers are stupid. Won't the predators just want to keep approaching them to eat the guts anyway? So, this didn't reference the fact that sea cucumbers, some of them, when approached by predators, will spit out some of the respiratory system and then to distract the predators, to give the predators a little snack so they can get away. They're so stupid. Why don't the predators just want to keep approaching the seed numbers so they can get the snack? Not really a predator deterrent. So, that So, that is a verbal hypothesis. And I was like, aha, I can model that. So, I did. And so the actual term for this process of on purpose losing a body part is called autonomy. I didn't know that before I started this project. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right now, but that's what it is. So you can see here that this is a lizard. This is the least gruesome image I could have gotten. This thing, here's a lizard. And if you look very closely at the pattern of the tail, And if you look very closely, the pattern of the tail changes from the relative pattern of the rest of the skin, which indicates that at some point this lizard lost this part of its tail and then regret. And so that's one of the ways in which these organisms can get rid of one body part on purpose for various different reasons. Very dramatic behavior, and there's many possible benefits, including a big one, avoiding prediction. That's the one that we usually think of when we think of autonomy. You get rid of a body part, Frederick gets distracted, and eats the body part, Julie. Distracted and eats the body part, you lose it. There are other potential uses for this, including if your body part is infected, you might want to get rid of it so you don't die. And in some very specific cases, you can actually increase your reproductive success depending on what you use that body part for. And there's also many possible costs. So, this is a behavior that has very big benefits. Hey, maybe I don't get to eat me. And very big costs. What if I lose a leg and I can't? What if I lose a leg and I can't move around? And maybe it's more likely for me to get eaten next time. Also, if I want to regenerate the body part, that's a huge cost of metamorphism and energy. And then because biology is irritating, it also decreased reproductive success in performativity depending on other circumstances. This is usually a sexual selection thing, which you're less likely to dedicate if you're losing lost body part. So, big dramatic trade, lots of big costs, lots of big benefits. Costs lots of big benefits. I'm going to be focusing mostly, entirely, on predation avoidance and regeneration costs in this model. So, as a trait, autotomy is very widely distributed across the animal tree, but it's very rare. So, it shows up in a couple of lineages in each of these types of invertebrates, and actually it's. And then some vertebrates. But yeah, so organisms as diverse as the sea cucumbers over here, and then the various words. Over here, and then the various worms, lizards, arthropods, jellyfish. So it's all over the tree, but it doesn't happen very often. So it's sort of interesting, it's an interesting trait that way. So distributed widely but rare, big cost, big benefits, very dramatic. So it's worth thinking about what factors could be involved in the evolution of this trait. There's been almost no theory on this. This review from 2019, which is a very comprehensive review about all we know about economy, it even says, like, hey, there hasn't been a lot of theory on this. Says, like, hey, there hasn't been a lot of theory on this, and almost everything has been in optimal escape theory. And so it's like, okay, so there's plenty of space for me to do to just make up a bunch of models and see what happens. So the thing that was going to specifically answer this herbal hypothesis was a game between the predator and the prey. So there's two strategies for each. So the predators can either avoid this focal prey that we're thinking of and go eat something else or approach this focal prey. Or approach this focal prayer that we're thinking you have and eat the thing but may possibly perform autonomy. Prey, on the other hand, can either just be normal, not lose any limbs, don't do the autotomy strategy, or they could perform autotomy and lose a body part, pay the cost, and then maybe get the benefit of increased escape possibility. So if you look at the paranoia, the things in this table here, little V is the value of the alternative prey. I don't really model that. If the prey want to go over and eat something else, that's out of scope of my model. It's just a little V. My model. It's just a little V. C is the cost of autonomy. This could be anything, but I usually, in this case, it's sort of conceptualized as a metabolic or energetic cost of regenerating part. And so that's what we'll see there. That's only present in the autonomy strategy. A is the probability that if you encounter a predator, you die. B is the corresponding value to V. It's the value of the focal prey that we're thinking out, as opposed to the alternative prey. And then R is the effect of autonomy and kill rate. See, it's multiplied by K, so it's less than 1. So you generally decrease your kill rate if you perform autonomy. And that's measured by this parameter R. So the predators get a payoff V if they avoid these prey and then get this payoff if they approach these prey. Sorry, sorry, there they go. And get this payoff if they approach these grays. So, this is like a normal standard grade thing: kill rate times value. And this is value times the benefit you might get from performing autonomy. And that little F there is the actual value of the autonomized part to the predator. So this is the snack that the predator gets as opposed to eating the whole thing. And this is where this behavior differs from any standard anti-predator behavior, in that most of them. Predator behavior, and that most of them are neutral at best and bad at worst for the predator. But in this case, the predator can actually get some sort of benefit from the prey performing this anti-predator behavior by getting to eat the body part. And so that's the difference between this and any other anti-paradetric behavior, and that's why this verbal hypothesis is interesting. So, this is a diagram of the Nash equilibria of this model. It's described in terms of these composite parameters, V and K. Capital V is just the relative value. Capital V is just the relative value of the alternative prey to the vocal prey. And capital K is a sort of a measure of the intensity of the importance of the autonomy strand. So it's high when kill rate is high, so you'd want to try to escape. And it's also high when the effectiveness of autonomy motion by the local R parameters is high as well. Or the R parameter is low, meaning the effect of autonomy is high. So the interesting case here is this one. So the letters here are... So, the letters here are: this is the predator strategy, this is the prey strategy. So, capital A means the prey is performing autonomy, alpha means the predator is approaching this prey. So, there's some cases where you settle into an equilibrium where autonomy happens. This cycle you can ignore. This can occur in any anti-parader situation. So, you can take f to zero and this will still happen. So, that's not particularly interesting for this model. This is the interesting part, where you have a bistable situation where Where either all the predators approach the prey and the prey have to perform autonomy, that's the thing they want to do, or these predators avoid the focal prey and then the prey don't have to perform autonomy. And so that depends on the initial conditions. If, population-wide, the prey provide too good a snack to the predators, initially, then they get stuck. Now they have to keep doing it because the predators are going to keep wanting to approach them to get the snack. And so that is exactly the situation. And so that is exactly the situation that that aerospace engineer proposed in that grant. So, yes, the answer to that hypothesis is: yes, these organisms can get stuck having to perform autonomy in the presence of predators when otherwise they wouldn't have had to if their stack wasn't good enough initially. That's the game theory model. But so I did this, and I agree, I answered the question. But this is an ecological interaction, this is a fair-created headache. Why did I Interactions. It's a fair-pray dynamic. Why would I do a ferritopray model? So I stuffed all this stuff into a locked-up Altera model. This is a standard locked up Altera model with the parameters modified a bit. So the actual benefit the predator gets, this is the population of predators that approach the focal prey. The benefit that they get now depends on the possibility of getting a snack and then the decreased probability of killing a prey that is performing autotomy. So that's a little more complicated. That is performing autonomy. So that's a little more complicated. The mortality rate is the same as usual. And then these are the two prey populations. This is the one that performs autonomy, this is the one that doesn't perform autonomy. So these strategies are fixed in this situation. And then the one that performs autonomy has to pay the cost, but also gets the benefit of a decreased kill rate. Couple of things there. Now, this is a pretty simple. The results here are pretty basic. So these are just the outcomes of this. And you don't really get any cycles. The outcomes of this. And you don't really get any cycling, you just get a bunch of stable or stable, one stable like livery or one player. So, on this axis here is increasing autonomy costs and increasing C. In general, high-cost autonomy is difficult to maintain in a population. It's high cost. So, there's usually some sort of critical cost beyond which there is no favorite or not favored to perform autonomy, and below that cost, they can. So, in this case, it's value here. Of this value. And then this y-axis is increasing predator death rate. So this was just the simplest way for me to plot this, not the most interesting parameter of this thing. But you can think of this as a measure of predation pressure. So like down here, the predator death rate is low, so you're going to have more predation pressure. Up here, the parameter death rate is very high, so you're going to have less predation pressure. And so you can see up here, we have situations where the predators die out because their death rate is too high. You only get them at their chemical capacity. But in some cases, But in some cases, you can get, so if your pressure is high enough, you can get very great coexistence, and in particular, you can get autonomy. And depending on how good the stack is relative to the importance of autonomy, you can even get situations where you're more likely to coexist if autonomy exists in the system than without. So, overall, ecological parameters such as parameters effort can influence whether parameters and prey coexist and whether or not autonomy exists. And whether or not autonomy exists in the print. So, I didn't do a ton of deep thinking here. I thought, okay, I have a game theory model, I have it locked up Altera model, let's smash them together. So, this is what I did as I made an eco-evolutionary model here because I'm ultimately interested in what conditions are necessary for this trait to evolve, not just to exist. So, ever, but in a given set of parameters. Right, so this is a, it's an equal. This is an equal tree model because I have here the population of the predators, here the population of the prey, and then here are the frequencies of the approach strategy in the predator and the avoid and the autonomy strategy in the prey. So these are equations I got from the ethological analysis of ecological analysis. This one is not obvious. It's so not obvious that I had to write in the paper: this is not obvious. This is how I got it. See appendix for details. See appendix for details. And in fact, this story here, there's another little story here. I had initially submitted this paper with a different, much worse equation. This is a non-standard model, so I was just making it mistake. And a reviewer came back and said, try this, this is much better. And they was like, oh yeah, it is much better. So now this is thanks to an anonymous reviewer who very much helped out this model. So these are the writer and cray population sizes, and these are the strategy frequencies. And this is just basically. Frequencies, and this is just basically. I forgot to click through the parameter names, but there they are. So, okay, so those are the questions. Those are out of the way. Now we have the actual results. So I'm only looking at one case where the alternative prey is not so valuable. If it is always valuable, then the predators will only want to go there. And so that's not interesting. So when you combine the ecological and evolutionary model, The ecological and evolutionary model together, you get an interesting thing where you get the same sort of structure of what happens when with the ecological model, but that the things that happen during coexistence are reminiscent of those Nash equilibria in the evolutionary model. So again, here on the x-axis here, we have increasing cost of autonomy. On the y-axis, we have increasing priority death rate. So high predation pressure, low predation pressure. Low permission picture. Oh, and this regime does not model well by this model, so just ignore it. So, in general, there are always these critical costs, these C0 and C1 stars, that have a lot of ecological parameters hidden within them because the equation is kind of a mess. But over here, like for instance, prey growth rate is in there. And that will affect these critical costs below which autonomy can exist, above which it can't. And then these three panels depend on how valuable the autonomized part is to the predator. And so, roughly, if you have low cost and high predation pressure, you're going to get autonomy at very rate coexistence. You have high cost and low predation pressure. If you get the opposite, and in between, you can still get, you can get intermediate frequencies of autonomy in the population. You can also get these bistable situations that I've talked about before. So, that suggests that That might be an explanation for why autography is distributed the way it is on those philanthropies because it kind of acts like a ratchet. It's very easy for you to get stuck performing it, and then you can't get out. So, and so like, so over here the prey growth rate can matter, so that's the ecological parameter affecting the evolutionary outcomes. And over here, the predator death rate can matter, so that's another ecological parameter affecting evolutionary outcomes. Parameter affecting the outcomes. So, the conclusion for this part is that prey can get stuck with parameter approach under low enough autonomy cost, compared to benefit, and high value of the snack, which answers the original question in the affirmative. And then ecological parameters can influence the evolution and persistence of autonomy populations. And then, if you have like a very high birth rate for prey, or very low predator death rate, you would expect them to be more likely to exhibit more possibly autonomy. A bit more costly on time. So you can make a specific prediction about where you would expect to find his behavior in real systems. How am I doing on time? Five minutes. Great. So, that was that project. So, what's next? So, what if instead of the organism's own body part, the organ loses something very, very, very, very important, an offspring in some sort of developmental stage that it is carrying? So, usually this would be like, well, I'm not going to develop what the whole thing is. Well, I'm not going to advocate for all the things. So, yeah, oh no, I did. I spoiled already. Okay, so there are external eggs or young on either your back or pouch can be a burden with respect to predator avoidance. And in some cases, you might want to drop your offspring so you can escape predation and knock it. So, this is a huge, extremely direct fitness cost in the standard way we would think about fitness, as in you literally lose an offspring, because the offspring gets eaten by the paradigm. And it's even more extreme strategy, it's very dramatic. Even more extreme strategies, very dramatic in this case. And so, why am I doing this? There was a clip on the biology subgrad. Somebody asked, hey, why do kangaroos do this? And I was like, oh, wait, I can put that in my model. So this is how I get my ideas. I talk to random people and I go on brand. Okay, so now the question is: does this actually happen? Yes. This happens in mostly macropods, where a type of marsupial that includes kangaroos, wallabies, aquoka, and then the Aquoka, and then this other small macquoka, I forgot the name of. But so these are the ones where it's actually been documented that they will loosen their pouches to drop offspring from outside from the pouches when startled by predators. Predators? Foxes, dingoes. Yeah, those are the ones that have been talking. Foxes and dingos. Yeah. So non-native predators is just the. Yeah, I get it. That's an interesting point there. That is an interesting point. Yeah, that's an interesting point there. That is an interesting point. Yes, I didn't think of that. Yeah, yeah. It would have been another prediction. Yeah, yeah. It's just such a quarter city of predators in the scribe. Nah, 90 predators. They're not near the predators. I guess. Yeah, yeah, they're not. I mean, yeah. When I said boxes, I didn't do a double dig in my head, so I was like, wait a second. So, yeah. Yeah, so, and then, so other organisms carry offspring. We have this toad that. Carry offspring. We have this toad that carries eggs on its work on its back. But of course, there's no duck hidden there. There's also fish that carry young or mouths, although they have been known to swallow instead of just cut out the fossil young in these situations. So I could maybe incorporate that into this model as a little F for the mom. But and then like plenty of originals carry young on their backs just as like a little piggyback rise. And also with all of the embarrassment sometimes. Right. There's more earlier along with the development of the cycle things that I'm not considering interest, but I don't really go there. But yeah. But Arthur Pozz is quite a bit you might interpret it as an attempt to save the offspring if that mother is felt to be related by the But it's also worth it. Yeah, so there's so the actual model I'm using here is: I'm going to skip this through the. So I'm not asking about a game theory question here. No, I'm just asking like this seems like a really extreme strategy. When could, when, under what ecological evolutionary and life cycle parameters would it be expected to work? And so I have a Markov chain model. Here's a song in the game where you have three different states. This is basically modeling the life cycle of a herb. Life cycle of a, or part of the life cycle of a prey in the context of predator approach. And so you could, D is dead, you and U star are different versions of not having an offspring burden, and then E is when you have an offspring burden. So then you can transition between these states. You can either, if you abandon your predator, you can go back to this state with the post-vibrator. Otherwise, the only way you can get Get, like, not have offspring of the burden anymore is by actually successfully producing something that moves on to the next stage of its lifestyle. So that's what this use dice means. And then eventually you end up dying. But so this is, I'm going to, so I've been already, I've started working on this, I'm going to incorporate this directly into a logo volterra type model where the interactions are defined by this model. It's supposed to standard mass matching rates and stuff like that. Okay, so that's it. Thank you to Julie Krauss, the engineer who I was talking about already earlier, and the call from the management. Daniel Weissman for letting me do this project. And the anonymous reviewer for suggesting a much better equation for an equivalent. And this is Daniel's money, not mine. Like I said, I picked something buttons. Something else that prey. You said that it was easy for the prey to get stuck performing autonomy and to not be able to get rid of that behavior. And that suggests that maybe a predator strategy might evolve where the predator just tries to scare the prey, but not actually eat it? Yes. Right. So, and that actually. Right, so and that actually, so that probably fits better with this because you could easily incorporate like one of these transitions as the predator startles the prey and the prey drops the offspring, as opposed to, and the prey doesn't have to eat the offspring at this point. So yeah, so I could, I could, so I didn't incorporate any sort of predator strategy evolution or learning or anything, but that would be an extension. And I might try to think about that at this point. Yeah, and just along those lines, kind of like the next. Along those lines, kind of like the mixing this in with the optimal foraging theory and with the kind of different value seems at a promising direction. So there's an extensive literature, massive literature in economics on a game theory of bribery and of shakedowns. And the payoffs look pretty much exactly the same as yours. So did you look into that? And what are the comparisons? So I did look at the economics literature. The review that I put The review that I decided did have an economic model of it, but they didn't really too much. They just showed two straight lines crossing. But yeah, so that happens a little bit. That's all they do. Sometimes the lines are curved. Very occasionally they don't cross. Yeah, no, I didn't know there was that in the economics lecture. That's what. That's what there's on this. No, it's a nice tale. Shadows something else. Nice tail. See you on something else. It's not up there. But you can that could easily become a game theoretical model just by incorporating the parameter. Instead of having two separate things, just a. I would take the probability of the problem in the act. Oh, yeah, yeah. You could squash that into a game. And then of course you see what the Because you see what the the reward is as a function of paying pick paying so yeah no I I just started working on that so yeah yeah I kind of clicked at that yeah yeah yeah I want to ask yeah maybe that Mark may somebody else but why are you not looking again for your next thing oh uh I haven't uh thought about it but that's the only reason yeah I oh I was initially answering a different question I'm At answering a different question, I mostly focused on just the viability of the strategy, but not a problem. Oh, like, okay, given existing rates of gestation and birth, like very, very approaching actual animals that do this, like, is this, could this be, I don't have a question for this. I just started writing on this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I guess the answer is I don't have a good reason why I'm not going to game for it yet. I don't have a good reason why I'm not going on the game port yet, so I'll think about it. Yeah. Thanks very much, James.
