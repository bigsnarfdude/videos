Like it's been like deeply studied in there. So this may study for several spaces, for several cross-manifolds, like lens spaces, some sort of recent trifle and some cipher-friendly spaces. And also in recent years, it's this dimension because when your QA is a field, so you can think about this. Is a field, so you can think about this space as a vector space. So now you are just thinking of this vector space, and it was proven that for the tree tortoise and for surface cross-a circle, you actually can compute the dimension of this space. Okay? And why I'm telling you this, because some years ago, there was this conjecture that popped up, which is the, I mean, I call it the, I learned from it as the Witten finite conjecture, which just states that for any closed Which just states that for any closed manifold, this space, this vector space over the rational functions on A, is actually a finite dimensional vector space. And don't try to prove it because this was done in 2019 by Guniga and Jordan and Safranov. And here's some story if you're interested of like why this question was relevant because of some deep math. But the important thing that I want to point out. But the important thing that I want to point out here is that though this Jordan, Safernass and Gunningam proved the result, they actually, this result was using like very heavy math, so-called like factorization of what, very heavy math. And I'm sorry, and some and so it was this very heavy math. And the main idea was to take like a gigara splitting and then. Take like a heart splitting and then break it down, like this cane device as a tensor. Like this cane, this cane of a manifold is going to be like the tensor of the two handle bodies. And it's not quite that because like you're not looking at links, you're looking at tangles and stuff happens. So the point is because these are somewhat finite in some sense, the tensor is going to be a finite number. And what I'm trying to say is that this proof was not explicit. So the numbers and the Not explicit, so the numbers and the basis elements or the generators are not quite there, it's not clear what they are. Though, in Jordan's page, there exists an algorithm like to compute this dimension. So, if you're interested to study this number, you can try to study it using their computer program. And that's all for closed manifolds. So, right now, I'm going to tell you about manifolds with boundary. And in order to do that, And in order to do that, I need to tell you about the scan algebra. The scane algebra of a surface is just the scale model of the surface crossing interval. A surface crossing interval is something like this, right? Like Scott was drawing yesterday. Okay, and when you have an interval, you have like an you have a direction, a preferred, I don't know, post, you have a direction, so you can take like a knot and then stack. A knot and then stack it on top of the other knot, right? So you can talk about the product of two pictures on a thickened surface by just putting it on top of each other. For example, in Taurus, you can put the meridian on top of the longitude and you get something like this. And for the longitude on top of the meridian, you get the other. In general, these things are not commutative, except for like very particular cases. And these things are And these things are called for right now, this guy is going to be called the scan algebra of the surface. Cool. And what is this? Let's make some facts about this algebra. It's freely generated as a model, meaning like every scale, every element in this guy is a linear combination of simple. Combination of simple diagrams, meaning diagrams that have no crossings and not trivial components. And that's a research title that there are no relations on these guys. And just to see an example, you know, the handle body of genus 2, you all know that this is just, you can think about it, it's homeomorphic to asphere with three holes. Sorry, a sphere with three holes. Crossing interval, and in this space, you can see that the interval direction is like I can't, I don't know, so I don't draw it, and all the this is a perfect, and every simple diagram with no trigger components is just a bunch of parallel curves, right? So it's going to be generated by linear combinations of powers of x, y, and z. This is kind of interesting because these guys do not intersect, so they actually commute in this case. So, they actually commute in this case. So, it is the fact that the algebra of a pair of pants is going to be isomorphic to the polynomial algebra in three variables. If you want to know more about this algebra and other things, like what has been done, because a lot of work since in the last years have been developed recent work of Charlie and others, you can read a survey by Tangli and that happened in Eglin. And that happened like last year if you're interested. Okay, so now we know the scan algebra is just the multiplication by stacking. So now I care about the three manifold. I have a tree manifold, right? And my three manifold has boundary. So then I can embed pictures in the boundary, think about them as pictures in the manifold, right? That is just. Right, that is just saying that the inclusion induces an action from the scale algebra of the boundary into this into the scale algebra of the link. It's just by something in the boundary times something in the manifold is just think about them like together and extended linearly. For example, this is just a pre-picture. This is a handle body, right? Like I was telling you. The pink guy, the purple guy is on. The purple guy is on top of the orange guy. If you think about it, it has a handle body, like the purple guy is living in the genus 2 surface. So, this is just the purple guy times the orange guy. Right? This is nothing fancy. But now let's do something fun. So, I'm going to show you a little bit of computations, some examples. So, let's start. I'm going to try to understand the scan model of the two-bridge node complement. The two bridge nod complement. Think about it for a second. So, where is the two bridge nut, right? It's just two maximum and two minimum. I'm thinking about it as a ball below with two arcs removed and a ball on top with two arcs removed, right? The ball below with two arcs removed is not, I can think about it as a pair of pants across an interval. And two of the boundaries, these two arcs, that I'm thinking they have just the arcs of the Have just the arcs of the nodes, right? So, this arc is going to be this arc, this other arc is going to be this other arc, right? So, then why are we doing this? Because now I want to see the other arcs. For example, I want to see like this purple arc that is happening here, right? What it's going to be is it's going to be a link, an arc from this dot to this other dot, somehow, right? It's going to go somewhere and come back, and it's living on the sphere. And it's living on the sphere. This is kind of the this cube is the sphere of this tango, right? So then I just drew the example here for you to see. So this would be like a 5-3 tub rich knot. This is just a shadow. What I'm thinking here is that this arc goes from this, this does one of the tangles. And the other arc, I can imagine it, right? It's going to be like another curve, something at the back. It's going to be the only unique arc that appears in there, right? The only unique arc that appears in there, right? I can draw it as well. Where do I care about this? Well, I can thicken that arc and get a compression disk for my bridge knot, right? So what I'm trying to say is like I have my knot here, I have my B2 minus L here, my B minus minus L in the bottom. I have my, this is my handle body of the NS2 that I have been drawing here. And then I'm drawing these blue. And then I'm drawing this blue curve that bounces disk, right? That curve bounces disk, and that curve is this curve that I call W. So, why do you care about this curve here in others, right? So, you should think about this as well. The complement of a tub rich nut is just the handlebar in the bottom. You need that to handle that disk that I'm re attaching. Right? Why do I think that? Because, like, when I add this disk, these two. When I add this disk, these two components get connected, right? And then I need to add this other disk, right? Which are these two components get connected? But because it's a tub, those two disks are isotopic, so it's kind of the same. So what I'm trying to say is the conclusion is that the complement of a tuberish knot is the scale model of a handle body of genus 2. And then plus a two-handle attach. So, what that says is that links on the complement of a tubbish knot are going to be just links on the, I can think about them as links on the Venus2 handlebody. And what that says is that as the links are generating sets, right? So the generating sets for the complement of a tubrich node, I can think about it as generating sets of the handlebody, which are just the ones that I told you, the ABC. The ABC. So I have the generators and then I'm going to build some relations, right? Because I attach a two handle. This circle that I have here is kind of in the outside, right? It bounces a disk in the outside manifold. So what that says is that this circle is isotopic to an unknown, right? It's because it bounces a disk. So in the scan algebra, it's just a number. So that gives me a So that gives me a relation. I can, then this guy, there is a lemma that says that, well, you can actually express it because when you try to, this is, this is a curve, so this curve lives in where? Lives in the skin algebra of a thickened of a thickened surface. So it gives a linear combination of things that look like x to the a, y to the b, and z to the c. It's a linear combination. To see the linear combination of these things, so it is a fact that there is only one leading coefficient which has degree five on set, and all the other sets are less than five. So if you get that, then you can you're saying, well, when you divide by the power of a, you get that this z to the five is a linear combination of x, y, z monomials where the z power is. Where the set power is at most form. And you can do kind of the same game again. Now, instead of adding the set, you can now think, sorry, you can add more copies of the set like I just have here. In this case, I just have, like I said, this W times set cube and argue the same. This is going to be like, if you see it from here to here, it's going to be like a braid. And that braid index is going to tell me like how many, what's the monomial, the leading. What's the monomial, the leading coefficient of the monomial? But that's going to tell me that this monomial can be written as a linear combination of other guys where the set has no more than seven powers. So why do I care about this? Because in this case, let's look back. This is X, right? And this is Y. But those guys are copies of the meridian. Meridian. Here in this picture, this is X and this is Y, but those are isotopic to meridian. So in the complement of the NOT, they're isotopic circles. So what that says, it just says that, sorry for movement, it just says that x is equal to y. So all this wording, I'm sorry for the mess, is just to explain that the scale of the complement of the Turkish knot is actually a linear combination of these things. Of these things. But I have like infinitely many powers of A, of X. I do not control the meridians, but I do control how many sets I can have. This is kind of a more general result. This argument is not mine is from Tangle, where he proved that for togglish nodes, the complement is finally generated over the integers if I are allowed to multiply with them already. So this is kind of like a finiteness conjecture. Of, like a finiteness conjecture, this is kind of like a finiteness result in the sense of that now. I don't take my coefficients, I extend them, and I let my things that are in the boundaries certain things to be coefficients now. And Marche also proved the same for Taurus nodes, the proof that for Taurus nodes, the complements of the finite generated over these over the meridians. And this was supposed to motivate you and see the start. You and see the start. And this was supposed to motivate you and explain you that for in 2019, the cherry asked several versions of this question. And he started studying like what the possible generalizations of Witten's conjecture for closed manifolds could be for manifolds with boundary. And he came up with three. The first two are the following. The first one is the Two are the following. The first one is that the scale of a manifold is generated, finds generated over its boundary if you allowed rational coefficients. And the same thing happens with, and the same conjecture happens for links, like in here. If you remove, if you have my link, I take my meridian up to finitely many pictures that I can draw. Sorry, there exists finitely many pictures. Sorry, there exists finitely many pictures so that every scane is a linear combination of those pictures and powers of this ring. So I am allowed to add finitely many variables. And these are conjectures about the scale with Michael the boundary. And that's what Nathaniel and I studied in, well, the whole semester during COVID, we were working. And we understood this conjecture for manifolds that look like. For manifolds that look like surface with boundary plus a circle, and also like manifolds that look like surface, like surface area spaces. So we put an interval base. So basically, these guys plus two handles along the boundaries. Thirteen two handles, not all of them. So we proved that we actually gave an upper bound, which is given by this number. So I have. So, I have three minutes, so I'm not going to tell you the proof of the result. I'm just going to tell you like the main technique that we used, which is kind of like very interesting. Oh, sorry. There is another conjecture which I don't have time to tell you, which is about, it's the same, it's more like instead, what happens if I have a bound manifold, the boundary instead of being tori, I have like other gene surface. What does meridian mean? So, you could as you could conjecture that, well, you can just take half of the boundary. Can just take half of the boundary and span the whole thing. And Natania and I also proved that conjecture for a sub-class of these manifolds. Okay, so just to tell you the main, like, how do you call it like the main tool that we used was arrow diagrams. Arrow diagrams are just a way to draw things on a surface cross circle with boundary or not. Circle with boundary or not, regardless, how to think, or a cypher fabric space, how to think of them as pictures on the surface. And the way I think about this is like about like a roller coaster, you know, like because one is a narrow diagram, it's just a picture of a knot in the surface, there's nothing else in your head, and arrows away from the crossings. So, but you should think about it: say, well, if I'm a knot in the surface, I'm just going up and down, up and down, you know, following the knots. And the moment I get in. The knots, and the moment I get into an arrow, I kind of go all the way up. And if I see an arrow against me, I go all the way down. That's what it is. So these pictures have their own scale relations, sorry, their own randomized moves, which are the same together with these relations. And what we did was to just And what we did was to just study this, to exploit this trick, this one, to get algebraic tricks, to get algebraic relations in order to get finitely many elements for our basis. And I'm going to leave you with these thoughts, which are about what you could do with these questions, like possible extensions of these ideas, which is like, well, whenever you have Tori, this. Whenever you have tori, there are these thoughts of ideas about like whenever you have incompressible surfaces, there should be torsion over the Lorentz polynomials, which kind of tells you that there should be relations. And when there are relations, there is finite stuff. So the next possible thing would be like, well, if a NOT satisfies any of the conjectures of the cherry, maybe it's comp in any all but many cables also satisfy this conjecture. This doesn't look hard. Connector. It doesn't look hard. And also, if whenever you have high-fibrous spaces, the boundaries are very well understood in our work. So maybe just glue them and start seeing how the tensor behaves. And I think I'm running out of time. So if you have questions, please let them know. Thank you very much. I think we have time for a couple of quick questions. Are there any questions? Do you think about how to prove it or how to understand your stuff? So things go well when you have a product region, right? Yes. So are there more general manifolds where you can see cutting, you know, cutting along surfaces towards getting to a product where you might be able to? Able to get similar results? So I don't know, but I was thinking, I mean, we talked about this, like, there's other approaches to this conjecturing, you know, like because you have a circle structure, you exploit it. You can also have like, I mean, you have to have like a more so like a open boom composition. And let's suppose that I have an open booty composition. This is my binding, right? This is my, this is my surface. And then, like, well, say that the complement is hyperbolic, so like the monodrome. Mean is hyperbolic, so like the monodromy is like some pseudonymous of math. So then, what do you want to do, or at least I wanted to do for a while? It's like you have your links in the complement or your links in the manifold, you push them inside, and then you, this is just links on the ticken surface. So now you think about the gradient as multi-curves, and now you have the following: you have a you have a simple closed curve or a multi-curve in. Simple closed curve or a multi-curve in here, and you flow it or flow this half of it until it intersects itself. And then you resolve and then repeat. That gives you relations, which at least depend on the mapping, maybe we can give you finite exponentials as well. But I don't know. Actually, I was just thinking, could you explain Um could you explain you know
