I also like to apologize to people whose talks I missed yesterday because of the flight disruption. I'm going to catch up watching videos. And another thing, so this is going to be a general introductory talk about breeding. Key the creator is the right people in the audience who are experts and they would not probably learn anything new, but are still. But still, they're useful because if I say something wrong, you will correct me, right? So I'm counting on you. So, yes. So, I was asked to give a panoramic talk. This is a panorama of Ben's National Park. I took the speech a couple of years ago, so we can talk about this as well. But, right, so the idea is that I will try to. The idea is that I will try to explain why people are interested in branded categories, why do they care, what are interesting examples, what are problems people are thinking about. So things like that. So, well, we will be talking about categories where you can add, take direct sums, and tensor products of objects. So, examples of such. So, examples of such things would be representations of a group or of a hopeless algebra that we have seen earlier this morning in our hectares talk. So, for instance, if G acts on two vector spaces, V and W, then it also acts on the tensor product diagonal. There is one more. Furthermore, about the regionalization of that, if you have hopes. Generalizations of that: if you have Hopkins algebra, then this diagonal map is replaced by multiplication, and you still have an action on the tensor problem. The rationalizations of this are, and there are numerous, basically they are throughout representation theory. So, whenever you have Lie algebras, Vic or quasi-algebras, etc. Well, there are examples that do not IPRIT are very simple. That do not IPRIT are various representations. For example, one can take Tilton models over quantum groups or integrable representations of finely algebras where a tensor product is more are involved, but still we can have it. Okay, so these are major things we are looking for from categories in crochet. So, how can we possibly access? So, how can we possibly axiomatize such categories? Well, for once, we would like the tensor product to be associative. But what does this really mean? You see, asking that the triple products, two triple products like this, are equal is a bit too much, because it's not even true for vector spaces. So, if you have two vector spaces, then these two triple products are isomorphic harmonically, they are not equal. They are not equal. So, instead, the whole spirit of this theory is that you replace equalities by natural isomorphisms. So, we ask for a natural family of isomorphisms relating the triple products from U tensor V tensor W to another triple product. Now, these isomorphisms are further required to satisfy certain coherence. Certain coherence. So, what kind of coherence? Look, so if you have four objects, then it's a basic combinatorial result that there are five ways to parenthesize them. And we can go between these parentheses by using these associativity constraints. And we in fact there are like two different paths, right? From here to here. Here. And they require that these two parts coincide. In other words, this diagram can use. So the structural isomorphisms are required to satisfy certain conditions, certain coherence. Conditions of this is appropriately called BEMW. So if you are looking for a grant from the Defense Ministry of the Earth, that could be helpful. That could be helpful. Now, so there are also isomorphisms involving the unit objects. So, again, instead of asking that one-tenth of u is equal to u, we ask that there are isomorphic, right? So, the rule of trivial, I mean, usually it's clear from the context what the trivial representation is, right? So, trivial representation of a group or a Hoch algebra, etc. Okay, now. Okay, now, now that we have an associative product, can we try to make it commutative? Well, we can, but we have to use the same caution. So we are not going to use equalities, but rather isomorphism. So that's nice. Inequality explains the essence of category. And so, right? And so, right, so we asked for a natural isomorphism between two products, U tensor V and V tensor U. So, we call this isomorphism a commutativity constraint, similarly to how we called the previous thing, associativity constraint, or braided. Now, the name braided will become clear from a later discussion, and again, just as before. And again, just as before, we require these constraints to satisfy some additional conditions. So they are represented by these two hexagons. Now, what these hexagons are all about are very easy to explain. Look, so when we have three objects and we want to permute, let's say, second, this, sorry, first, the second and third, we can do it either at once, permuting it as the product, or step by step. It with the product or step by step, you're muting this one factor and then with another. So, this would amount to this isomorphism being a composition of these two. So, it's not like multiplicativity condition on the second argument, if you want. So, and associativity constraints here in this hexagon make sure that we have the right domain, a domain for everyone. So, the second hexagon is just So the second hexagon is just uh a of course a close relative of the first. So here are the permuting last object with the first two and we require you know this kind of this sort of a consistence. So this show this kind of brings to mind bilinear forms, right? Because you know this is by characters. So we will see them later on, but that's what he required. Now note that Now, note that a particular category with standard product may or may not have such a commutativity constraint. Furthermore, it can have more than one, right? So it's an additional structure on the kitty. Now, we do require some additional things. Now, in principle, one can study KTRIS as before that only have tensor product necessary. Have translated product associativity and chemical activity constraints. That's categories are called braided manoeuvre. Now, but well, we would prefer to have a category where we can take direct sums and which is linear over a certain field in some sense. So we have direct sums, so we can take direct sums of objects, and we require that this category is abelian in the sense. This category is abelian in the sense that you have corners and cacornals of morphisms. That's what I mean. So we are aiming to be able to do linear algebra in such a way that's what we are done. So we also required that tensor product is bi-additive with respect to the diraxon. And finally, we require that all the morphism spaces are vector spaces and then the product is bilingual. Again, think about. Product is bilinear. Again, think about representations of a group or a Hoch algebra or any other linear object, and you will have all these properties. Now, another question. So, where do you use the fact that it's a catchphrase building? I was always intrigued with the fact that when modern catchphrase were defined, them being a building was not a restriction? Because, like, you do not have to use the. You do not have to use this. However, all the interesting examples are like this. You see, like, so having kernels and cat kernels is essential. For instance, if you want to define something like tensor product of bimonns, right? Which is defined as an equalizer and you want to make sure it exists. So, for this instance. Does that answer your question? Maybe discussed later. Okay. So now, next. So now, next we want to have dual objects. Okay, now the issue here is that the objects are no underlying objects are no longer vector spaces. So we have to postulate the existence of such things rather than just explicitly construct it. So this is done as false. We require that for every read there is an object in the star, along with certain evaluation and co-evaluation. And co-evaluation map that are related to each other in a certain natural way. You also ask for, I mean, there is a distinction between left and right rules, but it's rather technical. I'm not going to talk about this. So the resultant thing is called rigid. Now the name rigid is not particularly fortunate, okay? It does not really explain anything that's going on. Anything that's going on, and there are other notions of rigidity, but that's already somebody gave this name and starts, so we hope to now. Also, like, well, so what I just defined would be called a tensor category. Now, if in addition this category is semi-simple and has finitely many simple objects, then it goes under the name fusion category. And the name fusion are And the name fusion uh has the following um justification. So I well, it's related to physics, believe it or not. So think about objects as particles. So two particles collide or fuse with each other, and as a result, like new particles are born or annihilated or whatnot. So that's what happens here, right? So we fuse two objects V and U, and we get a A direct sum of several copies of other simple objects. Okay? So that's what fusion is. Alright, so now I said in the beginning that we are not going to require that the transact category is strictly associated. Associate and everybody seemed to agree, however, there is nothing wrong with it. And in fact, there is a theorem of Maclean that any enzyme is equivalent to a strict one. To understand or believe this, think about what we teach students in a linear algebra course. Course. So we teach that linear transformations between vector spaces can be realized as matrices in a consistent way. So how do we do it? Well, we replace an n-dimensional vector space, and there are many such spaces by standard. Let's say polymer space with n entries, and then linear transformations become matrices, then their products become chromatic products of matrices, and so on. So that's an example of this. So on. So that's an example of this Maclean street mistier. Right, so it can be done in greater generality for arbitrary hands archaeological, not just that, for that of the vector spaces. Now, important thing, unlike SSC activity braiding, I'm sorry, braiding cannot be strictified. Okay, so which means that we have to keep track of the ways in which Keep track of the ways in which two possible products of a pair of objects are resembled. Now, the hexagon axioms that I had on the previous page, they give rise to the following equation here, which is sort of like a, looks like a young boxer, also looks like the bread group relation, right? And it becomes. And it becomes precisely that if you set all these three objects to be the same. Now, this explains the name braiding, because in particular, what we can do for any object in such strict braided category, we can have an action of the braid group by atomorphisms of the Terms of powers of this object. Well, in principle, you don't have to assume that the KTGA is strict, but then you need to exert some care about what the braid group generators are. You have to interact with society constraints in the picture. But now, the presence of the braid group here is what makes this theory interesting and I hope relevant to. Hope relevant to the subject of this workshop. Okay, so now what would be the very most simple examples of such things? Well, we have heard earlier this morning about pointed Hopfi algebra. Well, there is an analogous notion of a pointed fusion category. So that's a category in which every simple object are involved. So whenever you multiply. So whenever you multiply x with x dual, you get the unit object. So you can think about one-dimensional representations of a group or a Hobbes algebra. Now, well, in such categories, simple objects, if it's braided, they form an abelian group. And associativity and breeding constraints are certain scalars. So associativity given by a scalar and breeding given by a scalar. And Braden given by a skewer. Now, when you translate the pentagon and hexagon axioms, you get certain relations between this, which do have a homological interpretation. They produce what is known as an abelian trica cycle. But let's not go into this now. Instead, Now, instead, we made the following part. It's not us, Jayad Street, who did this, but know that if you take a self-grading of an object with itself, then because in this setting it is a scalar, it does define a quadratic form on A. So now, so quadratic form is a form such that the Q of AB and Q of A. Q of AB and QA times QB differ by a symmetric bilinear form. And in this case, the symmetric bilinear form is double brain. Okay, so the square of braiding. Now, square upgrading is extremely important here. We will encounter it later in this talk many times. But it turns out, and that's the theorem of Joy Arden Street from the 1980s, I believe, that there is an act. I believe that there is an equivalence between pointed braided fusion keytes here and pairs and quadratic, basically abelian groups with quadratic forms on this. I will refer to such pairs, abelian group and quadratic form, as a pre-metric group. Because you can use this data sort of like a metric, like a metric on a group. Now, well, the importance of this is that this brings Is that this brings certain geometric flavor into the theory of braided kitings, right? So, in particular, we can talk about things such as such as Arthaganard. Well, at least in this example, but it gives you the right idea how things should be looked at in general. Any questions so far? All right, so again, th this is a motivating example for what is going to follow. For what is going to follow. But there are more examples. So, some of them, this already. So, the representations, well, let's say of a group, say of a finite group over a field of complex numbers to make everything semi-simple. Now, this category certainly has tensor products. Furthermore, it has a very natural symmetric braid, right? Just by transposition, you take two vectors, you and the Vectors u and v and u just transpose them, right? So symmetric here means that once you do this, that this map coincides with its surface. You do it twice, you get identity. Another example would be taking a semi-simple Hopfer algebra that is an R matrix. Now, R matrix is something that gives rise to a Young-Baxter equation. So in this case, there is a parallel There is a parallel between Young-Parsy equations and braid group relations. We just invert, sorry, you transpose the R matrix, you replace R by R to 1, permutant extender factors, and young Baxter becomes braided and vice versa. So there are more and much more interesting categories of braided categories. So I think of them. I think of them as categories of intervariable representations over the affine algebra CGA. They can also be obtained from certain sub-quotients of the representation categories of quantum groups that are also fit. So here are some examples. So what would be the simplest non-pointed examples of this type? Well, one of them would be so-called easy. Is in kateggling where you have three simple objects 1, A and X. 1 and A are invertible and they form a group Z2 and X is not invertible and its tensor square is 1 plus A. So such this category is important in physics and it goes by the name of Eason critical. There is even smaller category in some sense, the Fibonacci category. Which is also obtained from SL2. Where there are only two simple objects, one R and X. One is the identity object, and the fusion roles of tensor product is determined by this. So both these categories are braided, and they actually lead to interestingly interesting representations of the breakdown. Just to well, what I Just to, well, what I meant here is to emphasize that there are examples of braid diffusion categories that are not just group TA. It goes much beyond. Alright, so square operating that I mentioned before. Well, like I said, having seen quadratic forms, we can think about which Can think about what should be a categorical version of Orthagonal. So, Michael Müller came up with the following definition. So, let's start with a braided fusion category C and the param objects inside it. Then we say the two objects centralize each other if the squared braiding between these two objects is identity. Again, centralize perhaps not the best term here, but Not the best term here, but again, this is already established terminology. Now, if you remember that example that I had with quadratic forms, that would precisely mean that these two elements are orthogonal with each other, with this quadratic form. So, now of course it can happen for some pairs of objects and not for others. So, we have also the notion of a centralizer of a sub-Katiby, which is Centralizer of a subcategory, which is an analog of the orthogonal component. So, pick a subcategory D and consider the collection of objects that centralize every object in D. In the example of this quadratic form, it's precisely the orthogonal complement. Here it's a new braided subcategory of C, which is parallel to the orthogonal complement. Now, using this. Now, using this definition, we can consider two extreme cases. Namely, a category is symmetric if it coincides with its own centralizer. That is to say, every pair of objects centralize each other. Such categories are known, thanks to Deline, and they all come from finite groups onceever I understand. To have a longer story. The other extreme is when C is non-degenerate, which means that its self-centralizer is as small as possible. So the only simple object that centralizes everything else is the identity object. So that, of course, corresponds to the notion of a non-degeneral quadratic form. So in particular, this pointed category CAQ. This pointed category CAQ is non-degenerate if the quadratic form is non-degenerate. So the categories that come from quantum groups and are finally algebras are also braided non-degenerate. As you imagine, if you are interested in bread group representations, then the symmetric categories do not produce very interesting breakgroup representations. In fact, they produce representations that factor through the symmetric group. Well, non-degenerate. Well, non-degenerate ones, on the other hand, they do produce interesting things, so they deserve to be studied in more detail. How to produce non-degenerate categories apart from those that I mentioned? Well, one way to think of this theory of transerr categories and branded categories in particular is that it's an extension of ring theory, right? So you have like rings and you have community, right? Rings and you have commutative rings, and you study them. So, ransom categories are analogues of rings, random categories are analogues, mostly speaking, of commutative rings. Now, you can associate to every linked center which is a commutative link. And there is a similar thing here in the realm of tensor categories. Namely, given a category C, just the fusion category, not necessarily bright, you can consider at its center, which There are its center, which I denote here as DC. Now it's going to be a collection of all pairs, but X, an object of the K etcad that can be permuted with any other object of the KTG. So the two tensor products are equal. Well, are isomorphic, sorry. But we also keep track about the particular way in which the R isomorphic. So it's in the spirit of this theory. In the spirit of this theory, it's not right just to say that they are isomorphic and not remember how exactly they are isomorphic. Now, it turns out that this category is a tensor category, and furthermore, this permutation we call this gamma decentral structure, so it gives you a braiding on this kitty. So it's naturally braiding, and furthermore, this braiding is non-degenerate. Non-degenerate. So there is a big source of non-degenerate credit categories that appear this way. Now, this center construction is familiar to those who work in Hopf algebras because to every Hot algebra, we can associate its double of H. And the representation category of this Drinfel double, which is also called. Taro, which is also called the category of Yetter Blenshard modules, like Hercastop this morning, is precisely the center of the category of representations of each. And it comes with a canonical R. Okay. Now one thing you can do, well, let's see. So here is how the theory of related categories differs from that of Read. Categories differ from that of rings. Like in ring theory, the center of a ring is a sub of this ring. Here it's otherwise. So here a braided category is embedded into the center, which is typically strictly larger than. So namely, if you have a category with braiding C, then you can, this very braiding provides a way to permute every object with any other object, which is the center of the architecture. So. So this can be done. So C is embedded with center. But now it's also important to realize that unless the braiding is symmetric, then it comes with its reverse, the counterpart. So instead of C U V, we can take the inverse of C V U. And unless it's symmetric, it's a new bradence. There are two bradings on the category. And the reverse category is also embedded into the cell. Category is also embedded into the center. So you have two orbits of C sitting in the center. Well, they may or may not coincide or overlap, but in case the characterization of non-degenerate categories is that in this case, they are disjoint from each other, and the center of non-degenerate category is equivalent to the tensor product of C and C diversity. This is another result of my. This is a result, another result of micromicrometer who contributed greatly to this to this theory. Now, well, in general, if you have a non-degenerate category sitting inside the braided category, you can always split it. So, see what becomes into this non-degenerate part and its art of ancentralized part of an alcohol. Again, this is a counterpart of a Basically, is that linear? So, C doesn't need to be non-decided. No, so C can be R, right? But as long as there is a non-degenerate ad Katie, there is C-spirit. Okay. So, right. So, now there is one construction that I'd like to mention here. It's called localization. So, what's the idea? So, let's start first with the Group TLD example. So here is a basic fact for linear algebra. So if you have a metric group, that is to say a Belian group with a quadratic form and an isotropic subgroup inside. Isotropic means that it's contained in its orthogonal complement and the quadratic form is trivial on it. Then you keep, you can take this. You can take this sub-quotion, the orthogonal IV, and it's again a metric group. So, what we do here, we chop away the copy of an isotropic subgroup and stuff. Now, we can try to do the same thing in general. And then, here the role of anisotropic subgroup would be played by an icon-kating. Are tanaching category representations of a group sitting inside? So, what's the purpose of it? Well, we'd like to separate the part of the braided category that comes from finite groups. So, kind of leave, you know, the interesting non-group theory property. Well, this can be achieved in this fashion, right? So, this procedure is called localization. And now, so I write here a sound, right? So, you take a certain A certain tensor categorical tensor product, but never mind what it means, but what it really corresponds to is this procedure of taking this sub-quotient by an isotropic part. There is a categorical anonymity of this. Alright? Now, there is also a construction, well, one can ask at least, for a construction in the opposite direction, so namely having a kategy can. Namely, having a category can be enlarged by adjoining to it some representations of some finite group. And yes, there is such a construction, it's called gauging, but it's a bit more involved because it may or may not exist, and if it exists, it may not be unique. Okay, so I'll probably mention it later on. Now, so that was a basic introduction. Was a basic introduction to braided fusion categories of what they are, what are the basic structural things about them. So, now, because it's like I said, it's a panoramic talk, I'm going to mention more or less in a random order different parts of this tier, you know, different programs, different techniques that people are using. So, again, I'll probably miss a lot of things, but at least I'll mention some of them. You know, I'll mention some of them. There is no particular order or ranking of such things. Now, well, first of all, what would be the biggest problem of all? Well, the biggest problem would be to classify all braided fusion categories. But unfortunately, that's not possible. Just simply how it's not possible to classify all finite groups, right? So instead, well, you do something similar, you classify all simple groups and then explain how an arbitrary group. Explain how an arbitrary group can be constructed from its Jordan-Herberger series, for example. So, here we try to do similar things. So, one thing that is quite popular here is the with group of abraded fusion categories. Now, what is that exact? We have seen examples of non-degenerate abraded fusion categories. They can be tensor with each other, similarly, how. Similarly, how one can take direct product of groups of hope values. Now, so they form a manoid. Inside this manoid, there is a sub-manoid consisting of the rinfield centers. Sub-manoid of centers. So, here is what we do: we throw away all the infield centers and we ask what is left. Okay? Well, turns out that if you take the quotient in an upper That if you take the quotient in an appropriate way, then the result is not a manoid, not just a manoeuvre anymore, but it's a group. So again, this is a categorical counterpart of the construction in the theory of quadratic forms. So, well, what can we say at this point? Well, we cannot classify operated fusion categories, but at least there is an interesting. But at least there is an interesting group structure that appears on this classification. So we call this group W, which is called the categorical width group. Now, well, surprisingly, we do know the abstract, its isomorphism time as an abstract group, namely. So it's a part of a a short exact sequence with the kernel being a cyclic group of order sixteen. Simply group of order 16 and the quotient being this. So here you have W classical, which is the classical with group of quadratic forms, one abelian groups. And then you have an infinite three part and an infinite elementary abelian two group. So this is a consequence of work of several people, including the work of David of Mueger Ostrich and myself, and also Austrik and myself, and also recent work of Rovo and Wong and Jen, as well as an even more recent work of Johnson Freyd and David Riotis. It was an effort of many people now, but it's good that we know this is an abstract group, but the real problem would be to describe the generators, to find a basis, or at least a set of generators. A basis, or at least a set of generators and relations for this group. And in particular, it's conjectured, but I think it's very far from being established, that this group W is generated by this classes of, by the gidd classes of braided categories coming from affine the objects. All right. Another thing that people are wondering. People wonder about is the theory of non-degenerate extensions. So, you see, like I said, non-degenerate extensions are some non-degenerate categories are somehow better because they give rise to more interesting braided representations. So, and we can ask this: well, given a braid diffusion category, possibly degenerate, can we embed it into a non-degenerate one? Degenerate var of a minimal possible dimension. Well, you see that this minimality assumption is necessary because the devices I explained, one can easily embed it into its own sample. Well, there is a precise minute, what is minimal because dimension of such category cannot be smaller than dimension of C times. Smaller than dimension of C times dimension of its self-centralized. Now, it is a bit surprising that such minimal extensions do not always exist, but when they do, we know exactly how many of them are there. So they form a torsor over a certain group. That's a result of Lam Kwan. And again, a very recent theorem of Johnson, Freud, and Reuter says that categories that are they go under the name of slightly degenerate categories, so those with the symmetric center being the category of supervector spaces, they do admit minimal extensions and furthermore such minimal extensions form a torsor over the group. A torsor over the group of Z6. This refraction before, by the way. Alright? Again, I'm not trying to go deep into this theories, I'm just mentioning things that exist and are of interest to people. Okay, so bread groups, right? So every category, braided fusion category affords a representation of a bread group for any single object. Representation, I would rather say it's a homomorphism from the bread group to the group of bred detamorphisms of V to the tensor power M. There are lots of questions one can ask and this in particular is relevant to topological quantum computation. So, if you want to know more about this, you can ask Eric. So, here are the questions that one can ask. So, whether when Whether when this image is finite. So, there is a conjecture of Nido and Robert that this happens precisely when the dimension of the category is an integer. So, this conjecture was confirmed basically in all known cases by Etringoff Roberto Witherspoon and by Ardin and myself for group theoretical and liquid group theoretical techniques. Alright, but now, well, once we know they are finite, one can ask what are these. Precisely what groups appear in this way. So, well, this goes back to work of Bon Jones. It's one of his less known papers, I think, who computed the image of this group for what we now call the presentations of UQRSL2. And again, I might be wrong here attributing the credits, so please forgive me. Now, for the twisted double, for the twisted intro double of a group G, of a P group G, the work of Eden GoFrower and Witherspoon shows that bread group images are P groups. In particular, you know, for Nippon groups, you get Neim Pott. Important groups, you get important bread group images. Well, one might ask whether the same is true for solvable groups. Turns out no. So in particular, you can obtain symplectic groups over finite fields as such images, and I think they're associated with hydrographs or something like that. Oh, that's right, yes. Oh, that's right, yes. Yeah, of course. I mean, because there is always that, of course, because that's right. Well, you can always reduce this thing to pure bread groups, right? So pure pure bread group has finite index inside the operate groups, so you know, but the finiteness is just reducing it. Okay. So, uh, well, there are a few more things I'd like to say, but I probably wouldn't have time. So, another thing, well, you probably often hear the name of a modular. Here, the name of a modular fusion category. Now, where does it come from? So, it was introduced by Toraev and it refers to braided fusion categories, non-degenerate braided fusion categories, which in addition have what is called a Riban element. So, it's a natural isomorphism of the identity functor satisfying this condition. Now, what does this condition represent? Condition represents? Well, if you look at it, it is, of course, very similar to the definition of a quadratic 4, right? Yes, it's kind of like non-commutative analog of a quadratic 4. So, once this is present, we can talk about morphisms in the category. So, you can form what is called the S matrix and the T matrix. And together, these two matrices generate a representation. This to matrices generate a representation of SN2Z of the modular group. Now, it is a recent result by, well, again, there are several groups of people. Samarfeus proved that for representation categories of algebra and M and Schauernburg generalized it to the case of arbitrary modular. Kai taken this. Keygar is so they showed that this representation factors through the representation of a finite group, the congruence sub. And that's very important, in particular these and similar ideas were used by M. Rovel recently also, and Roble Wong and Van to reconstruct modular data from representations of Of this congruence the sub. So you see that the issue here is this: it's hard to construct new non-trivial exotic examples of such of modular kit case. But we have such a rich theory behind them, so that there are many tools that allow us to approach and to conjecture when they can possibly. When they can possibly exist. So that's one of the things, one of the approaches to that. Okay, TQFT or skip. Okay, so one last thing probably. So, well, like I said, so ideally one would like to classify them all, but this is hard. But on the other hand, classification is, well, let me put it this way. Let me put this perhaps not entirely hopeless for the following reason. So, such kitten, disfusion kitten, they do not have non-trivial deformations. So, there are no continuous families, so to say. So, this is known as Ocnion rigidity, which is different from the rigidity that I mentioned. Okay, so as a consequence, for instance, there are only finitely many up to equivalence breaks. many up to equivalence braided just fusion categories this given set of fusion rules. Or for any given category there are only finitely many braidings which makes classification up. At least you can try, right? There are finitely many, you can try to describe them all. Another approach is to classify them with respect to a rank. With respect to a rank. So, the rank of a fusion category is the number of isomorphism classes of simple objects. So, we have seen before example of an isn't category that has rank 3 and example of an archipelago that has rank 2. So, there is a long history of classifying braided, non-degenerate braided fusion, creating a list of small rank. Of small rank. So, and one very important result in this direction is due to Broiler, and Rovo and Long, who showed that once you fix the rack, there are only finitely many non-degenerate braided fusion categories of this rack. So, this is another sort of rigid result. Not only you cannot deform them for a fixed For a fixed fusion rules, but you cannot really find infinite families if you bound the number of simple objects. So, this extends to arbitrary braided fusion kating, that is, which is more or less routine, but the important result, of course, is rank finiteness of braided non-degenerated quantities. So, all this being said, that you know, at least in some cases, You know, at least in some cases, one can try to classify them at least of small dimension or of small rank. But that's fine, of course, and lots of progress was made. But of course, like in general, if you want to understand them more, you should think of some other methods which are probably now out of reach, right? The way one classifies, say, uh, simple real algebras or finite groups, they are not nearly uh closed at that point. Are closed at that point. All right, well, believe me, there are many more things I'd like to say in this panorama, but I think it's good. Thank you. Would anyone like to ask any questions? What were you going to say about T30s? Well, Well, I wanted, okay, so yes, so here, like, I wanted to explain what that is. That's one, of course, of the main applications of modular ketography. So, again, Trotora was the person who pointed this out. So, well, you can consider the following things. You can take an array into manifold, this whose boundary is divided into. This whose boundary is divided into two components, and such manifold is called the Cabordis. And what we can do now, we can view this three manifold as a map between closed-oriented two manifolds. So now, given a modular category, one constructs the following things. So one assigns to every closed-oriented to manifold the vector space. To manifold the vector space and to every comborgism between pairs of such manifolds. A linear map between such vector spaces. So it's a functor from this category of comportism to the category of vector spaces. Sort of representation of this very important category. So, in particular, if you start with a closed remote, then the corresponding vector space is trivial, and what you do, well, and the And what we do, well, and the corresponding map is just a scalar. The scalar is an invariant of three magnitude. Okay, so that's you know one topological application of modular katica. Thank you for this question. I have a curiosity about metric groups. Yes. Are they torsion-free? The only deal here is finite groups, the torsion. Only finite? Well, for fusion categories, yes. Now, in principle, you don't have, right? You can consider a quadratic form some arbitrary Ribelian groups are not necessarily finite, but of course, there are way too many of them, right? So it's beyond our possible classification. But for application of fusion, But for application of fusion katris, finite abelian groups is all that you need. And there is a restriction, assume this time. Are there a restriction for abelian groups to be? Well, it's all, yes, of course. So for any, let me put it this way. So it's from the work of Wall from 1960s, I think. So there is a concrete description of There is a complete description of all quadratic forms on Iberian groups. So, uh, they're completely oh, yes. Oh, question? Yeah. So, uh, I'm just wondering for non-summer simple, non-degenerate predicted categories, can you still define the with group? I mean, it's easier. Oh yes, like I mean, so it ends was done, right? I think last night there was his collaborators. Uh His collaborators did this, so maybe someone else also. Yes, you can, but here is the issue, you know, like in the non-semi, we don't, at least, okay, I don't know any with classes that do not contain SMI simple fusion category. So it's not clear that this group that would include all braided attends are category Braided at answer category, not necessarily semi-simple, if it's certainly bigger than the one of fusion theatre. For example, you can take quantum groups that are also of unity, right, which are of course not semi-produced non-semise simple the but they have equivalent to their torts in sign. Okay, so they get equivalent to a semi-simple. We don't know if that group that can of course be defined actually, you know, larger than the industry. All right, so we'll thank Dimitri again.
