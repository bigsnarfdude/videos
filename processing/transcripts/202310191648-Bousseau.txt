What I will talk about today is containing some papers, which is on the archive since one year. And the goal of this talk is to give an overview of some conjectures for monomorphic curve theory, which is about algebraic structures underlying complex aggressions in holomorphic syntax. And much of this conjecture will be quite unprecise, formulated at some characteristic level. But the real point of this talk is to explain the connection between this conjecture. Is to explain the connection between this conjecture and some more established topic, which is the topic of DT environments, which has something to do with innovative geometry of color-biosomats. So, if you ever try to make precise this projecture, I will talk about you like something concrete to test them again. And actually, if I arrive at this complete thinking about this side of the story, the BT invariants, but the structure you arrived at should make sense in a more general context. I will start there and come back to BT invariants in the semantic at the top. In the several part at the top. Here we start in general with M sub holomorphic syntactic plan. It would be non-compact or compact. And I will denote by I, the corresponding complex structure on it, and by omega i, the corresponding holomorphic symplectic two form. And once you have such a holomorphic symplectic manifold, you can consider Some manifolds. So they are complex sub-manifold and of middle dimension. And the version, in the sense of the symplectic holomorphic symplectic form restricted to it, is zero. And you can consider all of them, all possible complex Lagos of manifolds. Complex agonial submanifolds, and ask in which algebraic structure should you put them all together. So, somehow, for real symplectic manifolds, we know the answer, because they are all put all like versions. They should be the object of a category, which is the Foucault category of the symplectic manifold. Now, we're asking the same question in the complex situation. And the expectation is that you should be able to use these complex Lagrangian manifolds. As objects of something which is no longer a category but a two-category. And more precisely, you should be able to do that in two different ways. So, the first way, you should be able to cook up out of this thing something identified by Rw of M with Rw for Rosensky Witten. And this thing should be a two category. And it's something which has a B model flavor. Which has a B mode as a flavor. And you should be able to also construct another two categories that will denote by F of L, where F T is for filter. And it's something we should have A model there. So the construction of both of So the construction of both of these things is highly conjectural, and I would say nothing uh precise about it. I will only try to give an idea of what they are. But at least for the first one, the fact that this thing should exist was kind of known since a long time. So Rosowski Whitney is like 25 years ago, and in the meantime, Kapolstein and Solina and they discussed the heuristic for the existence of this object. Of this object. Or the fact that the sum of one should be interesting to consider, it may be more recent. So I arrived at these things from thinking about the GT side of the storage. And independently from the one on Eschnikov. And so I arrive at the physic picture from a kind of more evolution or something like it. So what are these objects? So they are supposed to be two categories. So I will not give any precise. Category, so I will not give any precise definition of what it should be exactly. But whatever it is, given two objects, it should associate some home, and the home should be an ordinary category. So in a usual one category, if you take a home between two objects, you get a vector space. And now if I take two objects, which will be like complex but like erosion, we should be able to attach to these two objects on first category. First, the category. So this thing should be a usual category. And this should be the corresponding home, the semantic. And of course, there should be higher compositions because there are more objects structured in this sense, which are a composition. So my goal is to. My goal is to try to say what is heuristic for the existence of these two categories. I fixed L1 and L2 complex equations, and I want to prove a story which will lead to the definition of these two things. And essentially, it is a version of flux theory, so it starts as in flux theory. So, one way to think about the usual flow theory of the syntactic manifold is like some infinite-dimensional version of MOS theory, where you do MOS theory for the infinite-dimensional manifold of pass between L1 and H2. So mark D from some interval to M and 1 n is of L1 and the order N is on L2. So you existing some infinite dimensional type manifold. And in usual fluoride, if you have a symplectic manifold, you use your symplectic form to define a To define a real-valued function on C is manifold, which is an action functional, and then you do more theory for C is a real-valued function. And we do exactly the same, except that we're in the complex setting. So actually, you can think of this P as some kind of infinite-dimensional Kelly manifold. And the holomorphic syntactic form Holomorphic syntactic form, you can use it to define some holomorphic action functional on C space. We can define on W. So let me say that if I draw some picture of this infinite-dimensional space P, and if I fix a reference point, let's say P0, someone to define the value of this function. I want to define the value of this function at t is another point. So in the original picture of m, we have l1 and l2. Then p0 is some path m. P is another path m and I can pick a path between p0 and p in size is infinite dimensional t. Insize this infinite dimensional t, which is a path of path in M, so which is on her surface, and we denoted by T. And the value of this function is simply the integral of the homomortic syntactic form on a cis surface. And essentially, because you want to enter a Lagrangian, you can check that this quantity only depends on the homotopy class of this path. And if P is not simply connected, this thing might be multivalued. This thing might be multi-valued, and you may need to go to some universal cover. And for now, we forget that this thing will be important later. Okay, so at this point, the story is completely parallel to the classical real setup. We don't accept that we no longer have real-valued action functional, but you have some complex-valued action functional, which is actually holomorphic on this infinite-dimensional candidate manifold. So we have this pair of some telemetries and some polymorphic functions. Why are you choosing D? Yeah, I've been saying it's independent of the two. Yeah, that's right. So the claim would be that if I take a different path, a different D, but essentially by the Stokes theorem, because L1 and L2 are Lagrangian, it will be independent. So it m it might it might depend on the homotopy path. Depends on the omega of the class, so in general, I might need to go to some universal problem. So, in the real case, we have a manifold in some kind of C-infinite function, and then we have a Morse theory. And now we have a Kelly manifold and some polymorphic function. So, what we should do is some complex version of Morse theory. And there are various ways to do that, but in particular there is a categorical way to do that. You can think to this KL manifold and this homologic function are the kind of objects which appear in ordinary homological emerald symmetry. And to such data, you should be able to associate some kind of M-modal type category and some kind of B-modal type category. So if you can manage some online. So if you have a Kalama default with some one mortic function on it, in the finite dimensional situation you can define some category, which is a category of matrix actualization. So this thing is really the kind of p-model category you will attach to such data. So if w were zero, this thing would be derived category of current shifts. Derived category of current ships, the B model. But there is also the A model story where once you have the Foucault side on category, there's again some A model of it. So if W were zero, it would be the kind of usual Foucault category and this thing is a kind of deformation when you have the extra data of some function. You have the extra data or something. So if you were in a finite-dimensional setup, where the T was finite-dimensional, and you might want to process these two objects, and this is what appears when you do multiple neural symmetry for this kind of objects. And now we would like to think that maybe this object still makes sense in this ancient dimensional context for a bit. In this infinite dimensional context, where B, where T is this infinite-dimensional set of paths, and where W is this polymorphic action path. So we'd like to define this first velocity-wheelen category, two category, in such a way that the pump categories should be given by the category of matrix factorization for the corresponding special parts. And in the footer category, The home category should be the Foucault subcategory of this spectral class. Here let me make some physics intermediate, which is that if you have M, a holomorphic symplectic manifold, from a physics point of view, what is natural to constant is some three-dimensional integral form. dimensional and I go for sigma model. So it is a series of maps from R3 and if you have two Lagrangians L1 and L2 you can replace R3 by R2 across an interval where at the end of the interval you put boundary conditions determined masses like Regards L1 and L2 and then from the two-dimensional And then from the two-dimensional point of view, you will get some two-dimensional integral 22-sigma model, which target exactly the space of paths between L1 and L2, and coming with this potential W. So, this story of two-dimensional sigma model is a usual story for neurosymmetry and categories appearing in homological neural symmetry. Neurosymmetry, and the claim that this category is naturally come from a three-dimensional story when you start with something which is homomorphic. So now my goal is to say something. So I will not say much about the category of the B model side of the story. My goal is to say more about the A model side of the story. In order to do that, I want to say more. And in order to do that, I want to say more about this Fourika Seller category in the usual finite-dimensional setting. So, again, we have P, some kind of tender manifold, some W, some kind of holomorphic function on it. And I want to say something about this category attached to it. And there are sports of UNC's category, one of them, maybe the most traditional one, involves left-shaped symbols. Left symbols and homomorphic curves with boundary of the Left Shell symbols. And what I will talk about is a slightly different version, which was first suggested by Heidis, just developed by Wong. The kind of version that we really follow is really someone which is suggested by Gary Moyen Witter. And as far as I understand, even this finite emotional story has not been made fully mathematically rigorous yet. But the point of this. Rigorous yet. But the point of this point of view is that this kind of avoid talking about Lagrangian in P, which is better because when P will be infinite-dimensional, it would be more difficult to make sense of middle-dimensional thing and something infinite-dimensional. So the point of this description will be that it takes as inputs only things we can't, and which will have some kind of natural infinite-dimensional generalization. So let me. Okay, so let me describe what happens in the toy model case where W as financing in the treatment points and P, and assume we're in generic situation where we have distinct critical values. So I have my manifold P function W on it, and this function, I assume it has finitely many isolated critical points. And so we will not define directly this category. We will first define some intermediate objects, which will be actually quite important later. So given two critical points, Pi and Pk, first I want to describe something that will be denoted by Dk. To describe something that will be denoted by BPS from PIPJ, which will be some chain properties. So the name BPS come from target C-sync is really the space of BPS states in the two-dimensional sigma model with target G and F. What is that? So, what is that? It's supposed to have to be a chat syntax, and I want to say what are the generators and what is the differential. So, the generators will be uh gradient flow lines. from pi to pj of the function real part of w divided by zeta ij, where zeta ij is the particular phase determined by the difference between the triple values. So, what's happening here? W is a complex valued function. And if I take its real part, or real part of it rotated by a phase, I get a real valued function. And I can try to do Morse theory for that, to look at gradient floor lines. But because this function is a real part of a holomorphic function, all the critical points are the same MOS index. So generically, there is no gradient floor lines between them. So here, if I have the generic So, here, if I have the generic zeta, then the gradient flow line will just go to infinity. But if zeta is tuned to this particular value, zeta j, there is a chance to have a gradient flow line connecting pi to pj. And so to define, as in usual most theory, to define this gradient flow line, I already pick a metric. And if my metric is generic enough, you can hope that there are files in many There are files in many objects. And I take these objects as generators of my virtuous objects. And now what is a denotial? So I think your first age will be okay. First the rate will be obtained by counting some strip. If I have pi and pj, and if I have two such a greater four line for this particular function, the differential will be obtained by counting selections, so kind of strips, so which interpolate between these two equivalent flow lines, so there's some kind of map U. So there's something of marked u from r cos 0 1 to p xt goes to u of xt and this map should be a solution of some kind of problem of the curve equation perturbed by something involving the function w. So, if you are looking for some t-independent solution, it just reduces to the equation to the gradient flow line. And in general, there are some t-dependents, and here j is a compatible, a complex structure. So, if we were doing like usual the fluorescence theory with no functions, the thing would just be the Bolmoffica equation. But here it's kind of perturbed by the Is kind of perturbed by the perturbation. Compatible to fixed indexes. Okay, so here I'm in a setting where the P is a K manifold, so there is already a KL form, and J is compatible with respect to C is the particle. Okay, so for every pair of critical points, we construct these channel complexes. This is a chain complex BPS EIP chain. So this thing is not yet our category, just some auxiliary data. And the claim is assembled from this data plus extra counts which are some counts of some kind of polymer. Polygons, which are solutions of this equation, but for now for generic choice of zeta, then from this data, there should be an algebraic way to reconstruct this UK silo category. So I will not give any details about it, so there is this version of the story what is in this KOTUMO-written paper where they suggest. the written paper where they suggest uh a way to do that. Maybe a very rough idea. You adjust something chain complex, you can start, you can define some infinity category, which is the wrong thing. And then from this count you can define some more captain equation to deform your naive category to get the correct category. And something quite important, because later I will talk both about this kind of object and this kind of object, is that in general this thing Object is that in general these things are not easily accredited to this category. It's not true that c-sync is a home space in this category. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it is not. And so later I will talk about both data, c-sync and sysync. And in general, c-sync is a kind of initial data for the construction of a cis object. So now staying in the finite dimensional setup, I want to make a comment about the relation between these categories, the A model category, and the B model category. So starting from PMW in the finite dimensional situation, you can also consider this B model category of matrix factorization. And you might ask if there is any component. You might ask if there is any compatibility between cis category and cis category. And there is one which conceptually is more easily described in terms of arch theory of this category. So you see something where dp core of a variety, you could talk about arch theory of this variety. And just for some kind of abstract theory, you have a version of non-cognitive arch theory, and in concrete ways, Theory, in a concrete way, if you're saying that usual Hoch theory has something to do with integrals of algebraic differential forms, Hoch theory for C-sing has to do with exponential integrals. So it has to do with expression of cis form. And for precise arbitrary data, if I use some language may be familiar for expandable person, there is some beta data, which is some kind of college of Como G of P valued in differential forms, where the differential is just cut product with P of W. Here is a Duram, sorry, which is a kind of homology of P in differential form with usual Duram differential, but deformed by VW of theta. And there is finally a Betty story, which is homology of your space. Which is the homology of your space P, relatively to the place where the function you are trying to integrate is very negative. So what I'm saying, an object in this beta group is exactly the kind of cycle in which you can try to integrate and make sense of this integral. Because if your function is very negative, this exponential will decay, and you might try to make sense of it. In BW or do we mean PW? BW or do you mean PW? What's on the top line? Ah, sorry, it's T, that's correct. Okay, so as mixing with the fact that it's saying it's a kind of P model. Sorry, the fact that's why you bet you want B. Sorry? It's like Betty or Betty. Betty? So 50 seconds. Um, so the first betty should be perfectly. You are perfectly correct. Perfectly correct. Thank you very much. And so, in the usual optionary language, you have Dalbo, Durham, Betty. Not Betty, once. Okay, so Betty is like places where cycle you want to live. And Durham, so if you think about things which are closed, they're exactly the form that C-sing is closed. So they're exactly the kind of thing you might try to integrate on it. So if you want to have some kind of correlation between derivatives, By correlation between the kit given by 5C states. And now you see the story. You also have something which appeared in many talks, in particular in the previous talk, here some stock phenomenon. So one way to look at the asymptotic of such integral is to take your cycle gamma. If you take your cyclote gamma and to expand it into so-called Lefschless symbols coming out around the triple points. But when you change zeta and gamma changes continuously, this expansion in terms of Lefschless symbol might jump in a discontinuous way. You get this Stokes phenomenon, which are some Stokes constants, which are some integer which controls the jump of this asymptotic expansion. And the basic correlation between C story and C story, it has a Stokes constant exactly, and we write it like Not exactly, then you write it like other characteristics of these chain holders something to do with counting critical lines from PI to PJ. So there is some kind of compatibility condition between the A model story and the B model story. The stocks phenomenon for the B model story and the integer stock constants where P are related to or are related to some of the A model story. Yes, what was the grading on the DPS? Yeah, so I will not go into any of this details. Your equation is defined on R cross 0 1 tau, right? Yes. Is it true is that on R square? Yeah, I think here it really matters is R cross 0 1. So it's really R. So it's really ah so in perfect equation has slightly different properties than the usual polymorphic curve but I think if you want to improve that boundary square is zero, you need to prove kind of zero one direction, right? Yes. That looks a bit difficult for me. Yeah, and and maybe and maybe it actually is, so I I'm not sure how to properly answer uh this question. Answer this question. So, maybe a comment, maybe you might be more familiar to the kind of mirror side of the story. Sometimes a scalar manifold with the potential is mirrored to some fano. And then this thing now has to do with the kinder category of the phano. And this thing has to do with the quantum homology of the funnel. And then this thing has to do with the Stokes phenomenon for Phenomenon for the quantum T module. And then the Feiger-Stokes constant, now they are related to some Homer space in the P model category of the fan. And this single version of de Brobin conjecture. So here, so if you like this muro setup, you can think about it, but in the case we'll apply it where Pn is infinite-dimensional, I don't know an infinite-dimensional final mirror. So I will stick. Are we sticking or not? So what is the BMO B side? In is in some typical case like that with the most function. In this case, the battery's factorization kind of in the usual sense rather than just one. But you may think that there are something like a more global effect which makes it more non-trivial in this story. Yeah, that's like non-trivial. So yes, I mean definitely there is something non-trivial in the sense that Not true in the sense that, like, this hard story, for example, knows something was integral, that's talks in a minute. Yeah, that that that's so any kind of triggered global sense, no, but it makes sense by the case. That kind of thing is known in a case where W has I can pick the generations. Yes, yes. I think I don't train it. But but yeah, it's like yeah, if you look for such a thing, maybe it should satisfy. If you look for such a thing, maybe it should satisfy the properties. But those pieces which propose this kind of thing say some set of controls. I'm not sure. So this thing was a kind of sketch of in the finite dimensional setup. One way to think about this M model category and some validation with the B model transparent. And now I want to come back to my original setup when I have M and M and L1 and 2. And we want to apply this story to the special path between L1 and 2. And to W this homotic action functional. And now let's assume we're in the ideal situation where the two dimensions intersect in finitely many points, di. Then as in usual first theory, the critical point of W, Firstly, the critical points of W will be the intersection points between the two equations. And then we should be able to define this EPS of Pi, PJ, the chain complexes. And so to do that, in the finite dimensional setup, I could pick a compatible complex structure on P. And so to do that, I need to make some extra chunks in the original M. In the original M, and I will assume that omega i is part of some hypercalc structure. So I will assume that actually it's not only all morphic syntactic, but there is actually a full hypercaleous structure which contains our particular syntax structure and our particular monomorphic symplatic form. And then you can use this data on the And then you can use this data on M to get some kind of data in the infinite dimensional setup and just write down the gradient flow equation you are looking at in P. And what you will find, so here it's like as in usual first area, you will just find the polymorphic curve equation except you find it for a particular complex structure. You find it for a particular complex structure and this particular compact structure that I define by J zeta is simply a combination of J and K. So in particular, it is never the original complex structure, it's always a complex structure with the orthogonal to the original one. To the original one. And what is the correct phase? Zetaij. So then if I have Pi Pj, I can detect some kind of surface between them, maybe called that vetta ij. And then the correct phase is a pair of omega i on the surface. And so it's only for this particular complex structures that you have some change. That you have some chance to have some holomorphic curve with boundary, it's like a holomorphic curve, with boundary on L1, N2 going from Pi to Pj. So this thing is like the gradient flow lines in the infinite-dimensional picture, which are holomorphic curves in the original picture. And then the differential here is validated with this kind of perturbed. To this kind of perturbed holomorphic curve equation in the infinite-dimensional space of paths. And so, if you translate it into the original geometry, you would get some map from something three-dimensional, which is the surface of paths. And these three-dimensional thing satisfies some partial differential equation. Which has the following form. So now u depend on x y t. So map from three-dimensional thing to your manifold f. And again, if it is t-independent, it just reduces to the form of a curve. And in general, it's t-dependent, and there is this original complex structure I, which appear in this equation. So this equation mixes the complex structure you look at with The complex structure you look at for the element of curves, and the original complex structure half. And this equation is a version of something called the Fourier equation. And so the exact proposal is that if you are going to define this space, you should somehow count solutions of such equation to define your differential. There's maybe historical points against Future where the Historical points, I guess Future was a student of Gilbert in the early 20th century. It was actually a number theorist working on class field theory. He was very interested by the fact that one way to engineer the series of complex multiplications. One way to come up with extensions of, I guess, purely imaginary quadratic fields is to add algebraic numbers, which are special values of elliptic functions. And at some point, he tried either a generalization of that with the elliptic function. He tried either a generalization of that whether elliptic function or instead of some kind of quaternionic type functions. So he started thinking about this object. I think he never arrived at the conclusion, so it's never theory motivation, and so on, starting thinking about this function. Okay, so the basic point is that the BPS PIPJ should be defined in terms of this kind of curves and this current of solutions to the Fouter equation. That's the question: is this. Is this three manifolds in Ken? Are they calibrated some manifolds with some sort of calibrated freefall? I don't know a reformulation of this condition in this language. I don't know. Okay, so this thing should be one way to define these region complexes, and then if you cook up the like all the cook up the like other numbers, which is like solving against this equation with like various boundary conditions, at the end of the day you should produce this category of the notion of thing, which you take a definition of the harmon category. This is hypothetical two categories and one each. And now I want to uh describe To describe the version of the relation with the P model side. That may be quite interesting. It's on the P model side, there should exist this resource of written two category. And you might ask by analogy with a finite dimensional situation, does it make sense to do architectural products? So, as in usual archiving, now it should not make a mistake. Here, I have Delbo data, Durman data, and Betty data. And in the finite dimensional situation, C S thing was just an ordinary category, and C thing were like vector spaces with structures on that. But now we start with the two category. Now we start with the two category. So priority structures should be themselves categories. And the conjecture is that if you can make sense of a Baus theory of the two category, the Dolboy data should be the deal of category of current sheaves on the original holomorphic symplatic multiple or complex structure. The durable data should be around category of Q modules. Our category of TQ module. So something related to deformation and quantization of this holomorphic symplectic manifold. And the BT data should be a category of n for the real symplectic form obtained by taking real paths of the allomorphic symptomic form possibly rotated by the n. And as in the final dimensional situation, there should be some kind of aim and deliver time, of course. Be some kind of Fiemann data type correspondence between the Durham and AT data. And the fact that such a thing should exist is some physics argument first predicted by Kapuskin and is the object of some ongoing work of conservation solar. So here what is maybe new is the fact that the relation between crosses is the fact that the relation between all these data should be an example of Hauch theory to have two categorical B model set. And finally, in the comparison between this Durham and this Betty's story, they should be a version of the Stocks phenomenon. And so the analog of what I've done is a finite demercial story that's a stock. The finite dimensional story that the stock story should be related to this kind of PPS space in the A-model category. So it should be related. So it's quite a vague statement, and I will not try to make it more precise, but it is a context where essentially you can put together, I guess, most of the projects you might think about attaching to the holomorphic Okay, so I guess I was planning to talk about connections with other stories, but I will just skip that for a calendar. I was planning to mention that here we are just doing an instant-dimensional version of a saddle category, and people have been doing have been seeking. And people have been thinking about doing something similar in other contexts. For example, they have been thinking about doing that for complex value Chen Simon's functional, or the three manifold, which is something which was mentioned this morning in a rather historic. Or you could try, sorry, something which then has to do with four-dimensional and five-dimensional gauge series. Or you could try to do it for some holomorphic channel summons functional on the space of Delbar connection on the Calvius threefold. And then it has to do with seven and eight. To do with seven and eight dimensional cache series. And some of these stories should be compatible with these other stories via some kind of Plateau Fleur, complexified version of Plateau-Fleur conjectures. I will skip that and I will arrive at the point which is to discuss the evaluation with the chain points. So until now the discussion was quite general. It was about essentially any all-morphic symplectic manifolds. And from now on we'll focus on the special kind of the all-morphic symplectic manifolds which are the complex syntax. Fitching type varieties. And here, let me make some physics-motivated comment, which is a general almost exyntactic manifold appear when you have some physical theory, quantum physie theory, which at long distances looks three-dimensional. Each time you have a physical quantum phase theory, which at large distances looks three-dimensional. At large distances, it looks three-dimensional. At low energy, it would look like sigma model. The targets are hypercandescent. But if it looks three-dimensional at long distances, but if you look at short distances, actually you see a circle, but you see something four-dimensional. Then the corresponding arpeckelet geometry should actually have a distinguished complex structure. The complex structure, and for distinguished complex structure, you get as an integrable system picture. And why I'm mentioning that? Because in many cases, these integrable systems are related to non-compact Carabio three forms. So, in many cases. So JINA is related to some non-compact where the collaboration is threefold. So for example, this is the morning in the architecture talk, there was, for the case of inching input system, there is this kind of non-compact collaboration which was built from the spectral curve. And the kind of basic reason for And the kind of basic reason for this correspondence is essentially the fact that you can cook up this four-dimensional series by starting from a string series, which is in ten dimensions, and putting it on some Calabier string. So essentially the basic connection between this 4D he and these complex immersion three things is 10 and all four pluses. And so you can have a non-compact caliber threefold, and more precisely in general. And more precisely, in general, there will be what is known by C, the kind of category which will be called of dimension 3. And depending on the precise correspondence, this thing will either be the derived category of your collaborative 3 folder, or might be the separate category of your mirror collaborative. Your mirror calibrate. So depending on which side of the mirror you are, this category will be like current sheets of calibration and calabio 3. So for example, in the occultation of stocks is non-compact Calabio coming from a spectral curve, I should look at the corresponding Foucault. And now each time you have a calabios threefold, or more generally you can. Threefold, or more generally a category which looks like a category coming from a tabular threefold. You can do a DT theory. You can try to count objects in this category satisfying various kinds of stability. So more precisely, you can take some class gamma, let's say in the K0 group, of a category just a kind of topological data, let's say a chain character, into a sheaf case. Chain character in the sheaf case, or Omoji class in the Lagrangian case. And you can fix a point U in some kind of abstract space of region static condition attached to this category. And from this data, you should obtain a number omega gamma of u, which is counting use level objects. Of last time. And this omegas is the same omega appearing this morning in gravitational stock, and it's also the same omega appearing in Iwaki's talk just before. In particular, from a physics point of view, this thing has to do with count of ETF states in this four-dimensional set. But from a purely geometry point of view, it's something which has to do with inner rate of geometry of Calabria Swift. And now what I want to describe is the relations between C-side and some of this integral system. What's the relation between the two? First, I need to explain some basic compatibility. I'm claiming there is some kind of correspondence between integral systems and non-compact Calvius threefold. I need to establish some dictionary between the two. Dictionary between two. What is a basic dictionary? So first of all, the K0 of your category, so the kind of space of possible topological data for your any range of invariance under threefold, should be related to the relative homology of your all-worthy. Of your all-mortific manifold relatively to fiber of the integral system. So I have phi, the integral system, I divide by Fb, the fiber of the point B is the coefficient. And maybe up to some details. So roughly, in the system situation, this thing has to do with H1 for the spectral curve. And this thing roughly has to do with H1 for the fiber. And if roughly the fiber And if roughly the fiber is a Jacobian of the spectral curve, and in the H1 of the Jacobian, it's the same thing as the H1 of the spectral curve. So the point you can think about is gamma in two different ways, either specifying a kind of topological class for your object, in a kind of your three category, or geometrically you can think about some relative homological class or something which would be actually. Class for something which would be actually a disk in M, which is saying it's a class for a disk in M with boundary on some file. So in this DT story, I essentially have two parameters. I have a discrete parameter, which is gamma. Parameter, which is gamma. And so I explain how to think about this gamma in terms of the geometry of M. And I also have this kind of continuous stability parameter. So I need to explain how this stability space related to the integral system. And the expectation, which is known in a few cases, for example by the work of Regional Smith for SA2C itching systems, is that if I look at the base of the integration If I look at the base of the integral system, and if I remove the discriminant lockers, maybe take the universal cover, then this thing as a natural map is a space of stability condition on the attached Calabios 3 category. So I can say to every point in the base, U has a particular stability on my category. So, if my goal is to understand this omega grammar of U, this is pt in right, in terms of the geometry of M. So the first point is that I can think about u as being a special point on the base. And somehow the way I want to, what I want to do is to So now the way I want to, what I want to do is to relate this dt environment to what we discussed previously, so the kind of polymorphic flow story for M versus integral system. And so to do that, I would like to pick two holomorphic, two complex conversions in my integral system, and then run the holomorphic first story for it. And I will take the following two holomorphic. The first one, L1, will just use fiber. Okay, maybe I change my notation. Maybe I change my notation because now it's P, a point in the base, E interface, E in the base. And I would take from my first like motion to be simply a fiber of the fabrication. Actually, by definition of complex interval system, the fibers are like motion. So I can take C is like margin. And I need a semantic margin. And I will take a semantic margin some section of the integral system. Of the integral system. And I would like to claim, I guess, from all the physically remote examples, there is a natural section. And in the etching type of system, it's something called which is an etching section. So I take L1 to be a fiber and L2 to be a section. To be a section, so it intersect the fiber in a single point. And now, if you believe this monomorphic flux theory business, you see the two collagen, you should attach a category, which is this home space. You can see his footer too because it's essentially a category. And the question I want to ask is what is I want to ask: Is what is this category or what it should be? And to construct this category, the first step was to compute these EPS complexes between intersection points of the two Lagrangians. And maybe this example looks a little not so interesting because these two Lagrangians intersect in a single point. So maybe it looks like if we try to do flow theory, Maybe it looks like if you try to do flux theory, you will get a single geratier, it will not be very interesting. But actually, the setup is exactly one of the cases where if you look to the spectral path between N1 and N2, it's actually not simply connected. And roughly, under reasonable assumption, the fundamental group of the space Assumption: the fundamental group of this space is actually exactly this relative H2. So essentially, this thing is not simply connected because the fiber is a torus, which is not simply connected. And so the correct thing to do in such a case is to look at the universal cover of this spectral path. So in my infinite-dimensional spectral path as this constant path at P But to have a univalued monomorphic function w, I really need to go on the universal cover. And here this thing is typically some kind of lattice, z to the power r. And so this single critical point becomes a lattice of critical points. And if I pick the origin, maybe I pick some zero, then I can index this critical point by element here. And now I can run the previous story. The previous story is that there should be a space, that will be a chain complex BPS between any pair of these critical points, but essentially because it's equivalent under the action of this group, it's only interesting is between zero and gamma. I can look to this object. If I try to think how do I construct this object, How to reconstruct this object by running the general definition. I should look at polymorphic curves. So as generators, I should look at polymorphic curves. This is a geometry with boundary on n1 and 2, and which are essentially class gamma. That's in that gamma as being some form of class. And essentially, you can show or you can rewrite this. This polymorphic curve with two boundaries on L1 and L2 as a curve with a single boundary on L1. So the claim is that what you get are exactly some of the big disks with boundary on the fiber and of cascade. And they're automorphic. And they are allomorphic processes a particular J Zeta complex structure where the particular value of zeta is related to actually what is zeta. Zeta is a phase of the integral of omega i consistently. So again, they are not holomorphic for the original thing. They are holomorphic for the complex structures in which this vibration is real divergent vibrations, which is something natural. You want to count holomorphic curves. Something natural. We want to count on a curve with boundary on real microjoints. And it is what appears in the definition of this. And then distributed differential, having to do with countenances. But you're type equation. And then the first main conjecture is that 3G in range should be actually equal, or maybe there's two ways to phrase it. So maybe there's two ways to phrase it. If you really think for example as being a number, then maybe it is another characteristic, but it's kind of complex. Or maybe if you think maybe on the DT side you can come up with a more refined chain level definition than this chain level object replaces EPS zero gap. So the point of this conjecture is that the two sides are very different. One has to do with DT invariance, that's one called their threefold. So that's one part of the threefold. And the other one has to do with this kind of complexified flow theory of M. It has to do with this, in particular it has to do with this monomorphic disks. And n is binary. And you say that there is some, just at this level, there are many other reasons to delay this conjecture actually independent of the bioclassical aspect. So for example, since the T invariants, there is a wall-crossing story for algorithms dependent on B. Consequently some other wall crossing formula for DT invariance, but there is a similar wall crossing story for But there is a similar wall crossing story for all of this. And the kind of basic claim is that these two wall crossing stories are compatible. So, actually, in the talk by Julia days ago, there was a concrete example, like mathematically rigorous statement where on the one side there was something having to do with DT or some quiver. And on the other side, there was something having to do with polymorphic curve in some cluster varieties. And the proof was essentially that they are both controlled by the same scattering diagram. And this is a conjecture if you want to just generally. Is a conjecture if you want to do the generalization of this kind of correspondence. Ah, yeah, that's all. So I cannot state this conjecture. If I just start with an arbitrary holomorphic symplectic integral system, I don't know how to produce a Calabius freefold not. So I assume that I have inside one of the many examples where there is a Calabius freefold. Maybe you might hope that every intimacy. Maybe you might hope that every internal system comes from some non-compact kind of three form. Maybe. Maybe I'm not sure if I know a couple example. But uh yeah Joe, I don't know. So I just take it as input of the conjecture. So I don't understand why this corresponds to the boundary of relator. So you have a you have two but the boundary operator should be between two final gradient lines, right? Obviously? Yes, yes, yes. And then the one should be zero and the other should be. One should be zero, and other should be gamma, or so I you know. So I don't know what's what about the greater and about the gem of flexible things. Yeah, that's why both are zero and gamma. The thing is kind of the same as the middle. So how many how many barrels line between zero and gamma? Yeah, that's in general. You expect that maybe generically they're finitely many of them. Uh yeah, that's the thing like as in usual uh picalation. So if you take your generic for the phase data chain, you will be finally mini gradient all like I'm saying to say. My feeling is just one, something a geologistic, no? No, I don't think so, because the thing is really supposed even the finite dimensional setup is supposed to produce some kind of stokes constant. It's really is kind of in some cases it's related to some intersection number between left shape thing. Intersection number between left share is signal. It does not have to be signal. Again, we can't. And yeah, we just had this thing as a basic conjecture where you use a part of the categorical structure, which has these DPS states. But then you could ask about higher structures. Like, for example, you can ask what about this category home with S and S. And this thing, for example, should be And this thing, for example, should be the categorification of the algebra functions of m with such a j, so something like the cluster or capture variety. And as very last comment, so one of the reasons starting to think about that is actually very much related to the previous thought by New York, AYCD. Previous thought by New York AWS dt environments kind of appear as, or seems to appear in many cases as Stokes constant. And there is one case where you understand geometrically the Stokes constant is in this finite dimensional setup of holomorphic function on some space. And then you understand the Stokes constant as the counting this present forms. And so my question was: can I find a setup where these detinance I really realized like that? And the proposed answer is that yes, if I consider Proposed answer is that yes, if I consider this is space P, which is infinite-dimensional space of paths, between two dimensions, or more precisely its universal cover, and whatever else is infinite collections of critical points. But at least heuristically gives some kind of reason if you believe that, it's some kind of reason for why this giddy environment should be stole constant of something, because they are related to counting points or line since it's in two dimensional lines. Okay, we'll stop there. Thank you. What is S in your? Sorry, what is? Yeah, what is S in? The S? The S is like a structure of this. And yeah, that's for example in X panel situation, maybe it is a HN section from the HN Panuto T is omega. You can't radiate the flow point to what the value of gradient to mass. So yeah, so the claim is that is this conjecture is omega. So there are two ways to think about it. If you think about it, either you think about this infinite-dimensional space of pass between this FB and this S, you know, this infinite dimensional space of pass versus holomorphic action functional, which at least on the universal cover has infinite critical points and exactly as many critical points as possible choices of gamma. So what if W is the case? And so W is, for instance, almost W is, in this homomorphic cluster, it's like the holomorphic action function. So this infinite-dimensional span of pass is obtained by integrating omega i. So something I can say that the critical values of w are exactly the integral of omega i o gamma, which in the dt language is really the sort of charge. So actually if you think about analogy, if you try to realize the dt stop, If you try to realize the TT story as a special case of the Taliban story, and this is the condition should be the critical values of your hypothetical function should be exactly the solar charge. But do you have some complete expression W? I mean, so W and charge it is only is like infinite-dimensional space of paths. So I mean it is given a path P. Maybe there is a reference for pass zero. And if I have a pass P, then yeah, I consider passing. Then, yeah, I consider some path of R, which is on surface, and then I integrate omega R across the surface. So it's really like some holomorphic action functionality with this infinite dimensional space of R. But some other claiming that density quadrant four line can be retranslated in the finite dimensional geometry as just some ball-morphic disks. So at the end, this thing is just related to volumetric disks against like finite dimensional volumetrics in plastic geometry. Just some more common question. So you were you were conjecturing everything what system should come from? I'm not sure, but if you have a counter example, I would no it might be one example. It's fine, I know it's pretty far from the it's known in the case of just look at the hitching system. Just look at the hitching system? Yes, yeah, you add some more stuff. If you collect AB and E, it's okay. If you look at other kinds of histories, there's actually trouble that you can construct, for example. You can construct plateaus to which that can be nosy. So it's a very basic example. So maybe a more reasonable. So so maybe a more a reasonable conjecture is maybe there is a way to category which is maybe yeah more typical often than it's not general sense. Maybe this category does not exist, but it would be a category maybe not existing. Let me stop here. Let's thank the Billy Harry.
