So, I would like to talk about Meromorphic insulination of Iser Sexes. I would like to describe ideas in the recent proof, which was published by myself and Elis Leppit. So, the idea is that this proof is based on some general proposes of some. Some general properties of the morphic forms that I think are of independent interest. So I will discuss these properties and maybe some extensions of these properties. Okay, so one of explicit goals of my talk is to explain that continuation of iste series is easier. Is easier by this, I mean that it doesn't require spectral series, not the spectral series of atomorphic space, or the spectral series of self-agility paraders, or it requires some functionalities, some version of thy volume series. In particular, we can work with Banach spaces instead of Gibbs spaces. So, the other hands the knowledge of this negative continuity. Of this linear integration is very helpful in describing the complete spectral decomposition for the aftomorphic space. So, another goal of my talk is to formulate some general properties of the morphic forms that are used in this proof. I think that they will have many applications, and we will see that these properties are simply slightly stronger versions of the properties formulated and used in the original language. In the original language paper, okay, so let me remind the setup. So if G is a locally compact group and usually any model, the gamma discrete subgroup, we can consider automorphic space, which is G mod gamma. We have a natural action of G, so we can consider the corresponding representation some space. Is pointing the presentation some space of functions of g and some space of functions on x. So the typical example, so you can consider, for instance, when g is a real group and gamma is some integral of subgroup, or you can consider situation, a Daelic situation. So I will discuss a Baelic situation. So the proof essentially works in all cases. So if things go. So you fix global field A, denote by A, it's a thing. You fix reductive algebraic group, define the OK, and consider group G is equal to G of A and gamma, discrete subgroup gamma, which is G of K. So for simplicity, I will consider case number 30 case when case field of characteristics is 0. Case field of characteristic is zero, but this is a dramatic case and case of positive characteristic is in a sense will see that in fact main step is much easier so I will denote x homogeneous space quotient. Homogeneous space quotient g by gamma and the instant representation in the space of functions of model laws. I will not repeat standard definition. So we'll fix a maximal good maximal compact subgroup. It can decompose our space with respect to action of k. So we can fix some useful representation sigma and consider space of model functions of modular loss of type sigma. This space is not a g invariant, but it can be constructed the presentation of g using Keke algebra. Then you can see the Keki algebra smooth, completely supported. Smooth computer supported meshes, and it acts on the space f of x. And if you consider subalgebra, there's some subalgebra H sigma in this algebra, Peservsky type sigma, and it will act on this space. So it will work mostly in this situation. So, our main object study is a space. Main object study is a subspace of the morphic functions. So there are many of the morphic functions of k-type sigma. There are many Kuian definitions. For instance, one of them is that F, when you act by this Heke algebra, you generate finite F is atomorphic if by action of this Heke algebra. By action of this KT algebra, engineer is finite-dimensional space. Another definition is that in our number therapic situations, and for instance, with respect to action of center of universal groups, but of you part of our group, it is finite. So, in fact, the So, in fact, the properties which we consider here for them, all the difficulties are already in the case where sigma is a TV representation. So you can always consider that this is the case. Ah, by the way, so if somebody asks, Candace wants to ask some questions, then I can try to answer. Okay, so. Okay, so you'll fix parabolic, minimal parabolic subgroup and fix it levy with decomposition such that K and M naught are in good position. There is finite number of subgroups that contain, we know they're called standard per balloon subgroups. So every standard parabolic subgroup has standard decomposition, unique decomposition of this type and this of such group M, standard previous subgroup. So if you consider rate of characters of this group or not. The group on a node. Lattice of characters, then we could consider the real vector space generated by this lattice. It's called Cartan space of G. And in a standard way, the dual space contains a system of our group G with respect to M naught and all standard parabolic subgroups and weigh group of G. Of G are defined in terms of these root systems. Now, important that the space, this space A star, dup Cartan space, has a different genetic interpretation. For any group H, any reductive group H of OK, denote A star of H, this group of continuous gamma modifisms from. from H, positive, positive radiated characters, which are trivial on subgroup H of K. This naturally vector space over R. And it's easy to see that A star of M0 coincides with the dual quotan space, A star, which is which was defined. Above just so using this interpretation, we should see so using this interpretation, we immediately see Immediately see that, for instance, if you have any standard body groups, then this space A star of M of Leibniz group, A star of center of Leibniz group are the same and it is naturally a subspace in A star of M0, which is our dual catalog. How dual-Katan space is that so it means that to every parabolic standard parabolic sub loop, we associate some subspace in dual-katan loop, which is which is the same association which is given in using code systems, but it's somehow much more dramatic. So we would like to study atomos at forms on our space X. So for this, we use standard diabolic subgroups. For any standard subgroups, we can see the space XP, which is defined in this way. And we can see the space of functions, of model laws. Of modern loss again, decompositing is a presentation of g, it can decomposite into k types. As before, you define subspace of atomorphic functions on xp. So then we have the constant operator from functions on x to function on xp. Which is given by just by integration with respect to the abstraction. So in other words, from any function, we can try to deduce study of functions. Study of functions on X to study on space X P, which is somewhat easier. So function, as usual, function f is called caspital if constant term of width is equal to zero. So if constant term of equal to zero for all non-terior parabolic. Non-zero parabolic standard parabolic subgroup. So for all standard parabolic subgroups, which are not equal to G. This space we denote by FX caspetal and Ax caspital denote of space of caspole topological forms. So now one of the important results of language is that Is that casual atomos forms rapidly decaying modulus center of G. This applies that there exists some kind of some canonical orthogonal projection A of X into A of X C to any atomostic formula can associate its caspole path material uses this map. This map. So now let's fix the caspetal parabolic, standard parabolic. In a similar way, we can define the space of casual themorphic forms. Yes, casual part of atomologic forms on X P and Casper projection. So in fact, this space is this spaces are very similar of the tomato forms on X and the Motor Forms on X P. In fact, if you, for instance, In fact, if you, for instance, if you if sigma your k type is trivial, then you can identify atomosic forms on XP with atomosic forms on corresponding level subgroup. Now we have canonical action of center of labor group of P on the space XP action on the left. Hence, it acts to space A of X P. In fact, it's nature to modify this X. It's nature to modify this action by a character rho p of the group m. This is a standard law shift which appears in all places in the presentations here. So we will mostly work with this modified action. But sometimes we will see that sometimes one needs also to work with non-modified action. Modify things. Okay, so now if you have atomosphere form on XP, you can consider its partial, its caspot part, and then decomposite with respect to different characters of the group Z. So this is it is Z finite. Is it Z finite, and we can decompose that finite set finite sum of components corresponding to different infinitesimal characters. So the characters which appear in this decomposition, non-trivial contributions, we call caspoil characters of F corresponding automorphic forms, F kappa, which appears as the compression we call caspoid. Appearance is the potentially called casual components of F. So now, given Caspian character of F, you consider its absolute value, just given character of the center, we consider its absolute barrier as a positive warrior functional on Z. It means that it's a positive. It means that it's a point of the vector space A star of Z is equal to A star of M, which is A star of B, which in, so it's point in A star. So it means that to any atomosic function of F on X P, we can attach some collection of points on In A star, we call such point Caswell exponents of f. So these constructions allow us to define some important invariants of atomic form f on x. So now we come back. So we started with atomosic form on x, and we would like to describe some invariants of it. Namely, we It namely, we do the following. For if you pick any standard parabolic subgroup, consider constant term of p, which will be a massive form on xp, and then define casual characters which corresponds to this thing, components which corresponds to this thing, and exponents for this form. So it means that we have some, we cover some tools how to describe, how to attach to automatic form f on x, you attach some kind of objects. So first of all, you attach collection of casual exponents, which is collection of vectors in A star. A star. Also, for each parabolic subgroup, you attach some characters of the center of M and to each of these characters you attach some atomic caspole atomorphic form on X P which corresponds to this F. Okay, so now London's proves the following result: that if you have any non-zero commercial, then it has some Caspel exponent. So the set of Caspel exponents is non-zero. So, but we claim that we can strengthen this result to prove. Namely, the result is that if f Namely, the result is that if f is a non-zero atomic hormonal x, then it has an exponent such that e of f plus over lies in the white chamber. So A studies dual Calton space, and the claim is if you add to it vector law, then it lies in the white shape. In fact, it's connected. The value chamber. In fact, it's correct that if you add to it, it will be in wheelchair, but it doesn't matter. So exponents of this method, you're called legitimate exponents. So if you have some exponent element in A star, say that it's literally if it is close to white chunk. And then so the proposition is that if you have non-zero arithmetic form, then not only it has non-zero exponent, that it has casual exponent, but in fact it has casual exponent which is linked. So if we will use, so this is important. New strengthening of this Lendless result. Okay, so now what I just see is, so we have constant term operator, functions of x into functions model loss on x sp. And this has formal adjoint operator. So this operator is given by summation or gamma mod gamma. or gamma mod gamma appear on the left with respect to left action and we call it the strain operator. Since this infinite sum, it does not always absolutely converge. When it converges, it commutes is action of g. So we have some formula g interpreted, but it's not defined everywhere. It's defined on some subset, and we would like to. Subset and we would like to extend it to okay. So, given the the most form phi, we would like to try to define the atomorphic form F equal to pi u phi. In other words, we would like to, even if this sum diverges, so this relative formula is not defined, but you would like to utilize it to use. To using some legalization procedure and defined now, there is a following legalization procedure, which is standard legalization procedure, which is solved as you can see. It is as follows. We include our form into family of forms, phi of s, who are mostly dependent on some parameter s, where capital S is a connected complex main. S is a connected complex manifold. We checked that for some area of parameters that function is well defined and glamorphic in S. Well defined by it means this sum which the points is just an editor is absolutely convergent and then we try to. And then we try to show that the familiar F of S has meomorphic extension to all the manifold S. So this is standard procedure. Now, what we propose, we propose slightly different procedure legalization procedure. Maybe we would like to characterize the form F of S. So the main idea of this. So, the main idea of this approach is we would like to define Isaiah series not by analogistic intonation, by some properties. Namely, we would like to describe a set system of equations that holomorphically depends on parameter S. So to show that this system has a solution f of s in some area of parameter s. them to S. In some area, some area S E, S E means existence. In some area S U it has no more than one solution. So this system of equations will be linear but not homogeneous and it will have just exactly one solution. And then we would like to invoke the following lady's general continuation principle. General costination principle that under conditions one and two, if you have somewhere exists somewhere uniqueness, then this implies that for this principle, that for every parameter s for almost every parameter s, the system sorry, the system of equations has Equations has unique solution f of s, and moreover, these solutions extend to a Meromotic function s goes to f of s and the whole manifold s. So this is continuation principle. Now this is a principle, this is not a serial, like Lefschetz principle, for example. However, I believe that it holds in most Holds in most natural situations. So, of course, we have to develop tools to show that it holds, for instance, in our case. Okay, so let me describe the system of equations which we use. This I premise the system of equations. So, our variety S is a complication of the S is a complication of this dual dual atom space. So every point S defines a character P just character of the Character of the group here is very good as she studied trivial on gamma p so we extend it to the right and so it can be unique extended to right k-we had function which we denote on the on the space xp we denote this function Xp with the notice function by chi s. So now we consider the final of the morphic forms phi s, which is equal to psi s times phi on the space xp. And we try to characterize the function f of s, which is Eisenstein image of this function phi of s. So, for every S, I would like to write down the system of equations ψ as follows. First, this system says that F of S, I will say it in words, but these words can be translated to actual actual actual linear equations which can Equations which calmly depends on this. F of s is an atomorphic form satisfying the same equations that satisfy the form phi of s by isomorphic form phi of s. So what does it mean that, for instance, for that's important that if you have any atomostic form, you can converg with some elementary algebra such that. Such that it multiplies by one. And so if you have function phi, you choose the element of Kecki algebra such an application to this element, to this function. Phi s is equal to phi s. Uh is equal to phi s and that's a you want that you apply it when you apply it to f of s you get again f of s second condition that second equations all caspole characters of w s lie on w orbits of caspole characters of function phi of s. Function phi of s has collection of casual characters. Of casual characters is put into different parabolic subgroups. And then we apply W to this caspoid, some elements W. It will not specify here. W is a weight group, but only some special elements of the weight group will work here, which map one layer of group two. Lead it subgroup and to other leads subgroups. And we would like that all casual characters of f of s lie inside this set. And the third condition, if you have casual character corresponding to the unit element w e so then the caspetal So then the customer component f of s chi just exactly equals to the custom component f of phi casual component of function f is exactly the same as function casual component of function phi function f atomic so this is atomic function on x this is atomic function on xp but under this condition when w is equal to e Somehow these components will lie in the same on the same parabolic loops. So it makes sense to say that they're equal because they are just actual functions of the same set. So here, so this is our system of equations. Joseph, I don't understand what do you mean by f of s satisfies the same equations as i of s so i this i point i yes yes so i told you what i meant by this equation so phi of s as any atomos in form As any atomic form, satisfy equations of the following type. So you can find some function in Keiki algebra such that convolution with this function gives this form. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, and do you want that if this holds? So, in fact, if you have. So, in fact, if you have frame a file frame, you can find locally in S Ramote function S with values in Heke algebra, such that when you convolve them, you'll get phi of S times some constant. The constant is dependent on S and not zero. Okay, okay. And then you want that F of S satisfies. And then you want that f of s satisfies the same. If you have such equations, then you require that f of s satisfy this equation. Again, if you have malfunction E, so that's how it should be. We would like to say to mimic that we have operator E from this form to this form, which can be used with action of G. Then it has to have this property. Has to have this property holds. Okay, okay, sorry, sorry. Okay, so now the claim is that. So now we claim that this system so now we have to check three different statements. So what's convenient on this group is that we want to check three different statements which Check three different statements, which in substance have nothing to do with this answer. Just three separate statements. First of all, we have to show that when real part of S is very dominant, then the system has a solution defined by absolute conversion as it's changed operator. That's the first statement. Second statement, again, when Second, statement, again when EU part of us is very dominant, that the system has no more than one solution. And the third, that we have to show the continuation principle holes for the system. Okay, so let me explain what all this means. So suppose it's the real part of S is very Suppose it's the real part of S is very dominant. Then this is some known fact. It's not calculated trivial, but known fact that in this case, is just an epidata is defined by series which is absolutely convergent. And now it's absolutely convergent. Now we can use this. Can use this by direct computation using bioretic composition to prove item one, what are its components and so and so on. So in fact, this is very similar to the proof of geometric layman local CD. It is more or less identical to the proof of local zones, geometric. The only thing in local C, geometric lemma is factor about factor functions, so it is a little bit more difficult. Here it is just about function. So this function. So you just apply this H10 with it, and you can see that it's constant with respect to some different parabolic subgroup. And you just compute. And do everything. So, in the paper, this is the script modules. This is the direct analog of geometric lemma. Now, item two, so suppose that real part of S is very dominant, then the idea is then all cusp will be. All caspetal exponents is some. So then the idea is that all caspital exponents of our function will be so all customary exponents of function phi of s will be very close to s. Close to S. Very close to S. S plus caspetal exponents of function phi, caspetal exponents of function phi, line sum bounded set. So if you if you consider phi of s, then casual exponents will be close to s, so it will be very dominant. Now, all possible Now, all possible casual exponents of function phi of s and hence of function f of s will line W ordered to this set. But then it's quite clear that those of them which lie inside deep inside the chamber will be exactly those which corresponds to element W. element w is equal to e because if w is not equal to e then you'll move this outside of the chamber so hence that the item two follows on the fact that atomological form is completely described by its digital classical exponents so we see that Item two is uniqueness. So the idea is that we know all possible exponents of our function. And so if you have, for instance, two solutions, if you consider the difference of them, then you will see that all digital exponents will be zero. And by the participation before, if you have atomic If you have atomic form such that all digital exponents are zero, then it's zero. Okay, so how to check continuation principle? So here we need some criterion which will allow We allow sometimes the continuation principle actually holds. That's not principle, but C them. So, suppose we have a complex topological vector space and the family of topological vector space is WK. Suppose for every index k we are given a homomorphic family of homorphisms V into nu k of s v into V to Wk and the global family of vectors in Wk. So then we can define a system of equations for vector W for each S. We can see the system psi S. system psi s which solution is vector in v which satisfies the purposes of mu k of s of v is equal to w of w of s supp every index k so this is our system of equations which clamor changes with s It changes with S. Okay, so now we say the system is of finite type if there exists a galomorphic family of subspaces L of S in V that contains all the solutions of the system. So, suppose we have such a nice situation that we don't know what are the solutions, but we can find a global But we can find a clomorphic system of subspaces in V, which definitely will contain all the solutions. And you say the systems of locally finite type if at every point S there exists neighborhoods such that in this neighborhood the system is a finite type. Okay, so proposition criterion. Suppose we have a system of locally finite type, then Find the tab, then satisfies consideration principle. Okay, so okay, so here I would like to, so I can comment on previous thing, but here I would like to comment on this thing. So the ideology here is the following. First, remark is that if you have system of linear equations, system of linear equations sigma s on finite dimensional space then it satisfies continuation principle so this is easy to see from just from commercial rules namely the claim is if you have some small neighborhood and if of parameters s and in if in some if this finite dimensional spaces and if at some At some area, you have a unique solution. At some area, for instance, you have a solution that is unique, then automatically almost everywhere it is unique and it is given by such you can solve the system by just by clamor solving. And then for locally finance, you put it by just as usual, some kind of analytic integration. If somewhere has unique solutions, then in neighboring neighborhoods, it has some area that has unique solutions, and it is a unique solution almost everywhere, and so on. So, this finite dimensional system is very easy. But now, if you have a system of finite type, then essentially what does it mean? It means that you have this system of spaces L of S, then locally, which contains all solutions. Then you can locally strengthen the system and see. Strengthen the system and sh and assume that this is just the same the same space and so we have then you reduce everything to finite merge situation so this is the thing and last thing which I want to say is the focus can I uh this is Peter good morning yes uh this part of your This part of your argument is always, I feel, can be upgraded a lot. You're using this very soft argument where you lose control of the growth rate, which is something that should come out of this method as well. You mentioned Kramer's rule. If you keep track of the Fredon theory that you could be using here, or whatever compact operators you're using, but you use it in the form where you write down a Fredon determinant. Where you write down a Fredelm determinant, then you would get control of the growth rate at the same time. But you have over the years told me you don't know how to do that. Why? Okay, because I don't know Felgone determines. I don't know. Okay, then that's a fair answer. But that means... No, because I don't quite like this method. I prefer to think about some other methods. But the point is that this is very. But the point is that this is very soft and of course that makes it conceptually very nice. But if one is doing this theory, which is supposed to avoid and the issue of the growth rates is very important in many things. So you do want to have a soft treatment of the growth rate as well, which I'll make comments at the end. I'll make comments. Okay, okay. Okay, so now I would like to comment here. Like to comment here. So, as I understand, let me just one point in short. I think I don't know. I should I do. I should then draw just one more. Okay, so what I want to say is that, in fact, here that is something interesting. So we have our system of equation. So we have our space V this morphisms nu kappa into W kappa. Into W kappa. So, in fact, in our case, we can combine this. We can just it is enough to take a finite number of elements, kappa, and so you get just multiple say one equation, W. Now we have here system L of S subspaces in V, such as solution of nu. Of mu of s lies in L of S. So this is our condition, local definiteness. But in fact, as I understand, in cases which photomatic forms, we can choose also homotic familial subsets N of S in W finite dimension. Such that nu s of L of s lies in n of s. So this means that well our space of solution of s we can write as a kernel of malfism. multi-fishm L of S into N of S. So we have two vector bundles on S. We have mathism between them, two finite dimensional vector bundles and our solution space of just this space of here there's no uniqueness, it's just space. no meanness it's just space of space of heteromorphic forms with given which corresponds to parameters so i removed all the non-homogeneous equation so but what does it mean it means that you have also mathematical dual spaces n star into l star affected by Into L star of vector bundles. And then you can write the solution of sigma of s so atomic force with parameter s is equal. So this space is equal to the bool, so this co-image But now what you can do, you can take quotient, you can extend this to some coherent shift f. shift F gradient shift on S and then you see that atomothic themothic points that atomos The atomos works. This parameter S is just fiber of this sheaf dual space. So it means that if you have a parameter S and you are interested in a somewhat points, if you want to this parameter S, for instance, infidel character, something like this, then this is some shift F on parameter space S such that Such that it's fibre at every point, dual space will give you an answer to your problem. I think that this interesting thing. So, that's one thing. And the second thing is that in all cases which I know in the presentation theory, this shift F has some kind of what's called Coin-McCoy property. It means that if S is smooth variety, then this shift F will be This shift F will be will be locally locally free as so so I think that subsequently this is true and in fact I can in many cases I can prove this but I cannot prove this in general and Cannot do this in general. And I think that, in principle, this coin-mcolu proposition in the presentation is very standard. I think here it is also should hold. And this might be, this is a good purpose. Okay, so now I can also explain that why our system is of locally finite type. So, how to see it? So, how to see it? I will not give the proof because technically this is the most difficult and most unpleasant part of the proof. But I want to explain that in some sense, ideologically, it's trivial. Namely, Ladis has shown that if you fix a k-type and infinitesimal character, then clearly this pointing space of automorphic forms is finite-dimensional. In fact, how he proved this, he constructed a finite dimension. This he constructed a finite-dimensional subspace L that contains all the solutions, all the automatic forms of this type. Now, if you follow arguments of language carefully, then you can construct this space L such that which depends on parameters, so that it will columnologically depend on these parameters. Depends on these parameters. This exactly means that our system is of a finite state. And but again, in fact, you can prove that it's modern. It has certainly better purposes than locally finite data. You can find this not only this space L of L but also the system of spaces N of S in W. Okay, so this. Okay, so that's all I want to see.
