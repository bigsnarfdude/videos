I really noticed this was too specific. For our first talk today this afternoon, we're Today, this afternoon we're happy to have Juan Mu Brux and she's gonna tell us about from the KPZ equation. Thanks for the introduction. Please let me know if you cannot hear me clearly from the back. Okay, yes, so it's a really great pleasure and great honor for me to be here for the celebration of tomorrow. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about the convergence of the KZ equation. And the perspective that I'm going to take is the view of KT. Take is the to build the K equation as a Daryn polymer. So I'm going to start with Daryl polymer and we introduce the Kipzy equation. I'm going to tell you the main results and tell you the ideas that I'm going to improve. Okay, so this is the Dirichlet polymer. This is the Dirthead polymer in the disk study. So you can see that there is a display lattice, you know, one plus one dimensional. And then we consider this upright pass. And then we're going to associate an energy for each pass pipe. For each pass pi, and then the energy is just how much weight it collects along the trajectory. Just sum them all. And then we just take an exponential of this weight and then sum over all possible tasks with how people define partition function. And then you take the logarithmic of the partition function that is the free energy. And among all of these quadratic apolymers, the most important and most special one is the one introduced by Timo. And yeah, so this. Timo and yeah, so it is called the inverse gamma polymers, and it's by choosing omega ij to be IIE minus omega to be IIE low gamma variables. And yeah, because for this integral case, due to the ID structure, it is still being extensively investigated nowadays. We will hear a lot more talks of this later on. Okay, so then let's look at the semi-disclined regime. And then, so it is And then so it is that um very similar using Yakan. Um so being semi-discrete that means we split the horizontal direction into this continuous one and then the environment is this collection of the continuous functions. And then we also consider such a path and fpi is how we associate the weight to it. Yeah, it's not that important how precisely how we should define it. We should define. The message is you associate the weight to this path and then raise to the exponential and then sum over all paths and then you get the partition functions. And then taking the logarithmic, we get the great energy. Okay, and also among all of the systematic disk quadratic harmonies, the most important one is introduced by Hanover, and it also introduces our very elevated structures. Okay, so now let's move on to the fully continuum regime. To the fully continued Moguchi, where the space and time are both continuous. And now, what you see here is the brownie bridge traveling from the origin, the bottom left to the top right. And so here, this cassi is describing the environment with the white noise. And what do we do here? We consider this path integral, is how much weight this path collects in this white noise environment. And then you take the exponential. And then you take the exponential and then take the expectation, that's a partition function. And then taking the local raise, make that the free energy. Okay, so now we're going to talk about the relation between those three different polymers. So there is a wake KPZ university result by Aber Connie Castell. It says that if you look at discipline derived polymers, and under a suitable scale it goes to the continuous derived polymers. Goes to the continuous direct polymers. And then in the semi-discrete setting, it is shown by Mihan Nika, saying that if you look at the Okama-UR semi-discrete direct hip polymers, it goes to also the continuum of direct hypolymers. Okay, so now let's reinterpret the direct hypolymers as a KPD equation. So yeah, so let's start from here. We can immediately recognize this as the Fennine Half formula. And that means the source is following the Cassiac Heated equation with multiple. So Cassius Heated equation with multiplicated noise and also with this data initial cognition that is traveling from at time zero study from origin. Okay, so then we can take this non-rhythmate and then this PDE directly translates to this following fully non-linear, non-linear PDE. And then this initial condition is known as a narrow-watch initial condition. And yeah, so now we have a PDE, then we can view this as a neutral. Now we can view this as the initial value product. So now, so consider this the following general initial data. Since the introduction of this KVZ equation, it has extracted so much attention in the physics and the mass of the community. So as far as I know, this is the first rigorous mass result regarding the fluctuation of this solution. So it was shown by Flash, Costello and Satan, that if you studied the state. That if you start with the stationary initial data, then this height function is fluctuating at a scale of t to the one-third. Okay, so then what about the exact limiting statistics shown by Mill Corwin and Costello that if you start with a narrow wide image condition, and then yeah, they due to the symmetry of the fixed point, they all go to the trace-width of GOE. Yeah, and then what about the count? Yeah, and then what about the convergence as a process? There is a recent big progress by this independently by these two groups, one by Costa, Zakar, and then the other by Verac, saying that you can consider a very large class of initial data and then you view this solution as a one plus one dimensional process that converges to another one plus one dimensional microprocess as the KE fixed point introduced by Mattel. Point introduced by Matansky on Postal Yemenik. Okay, so it seems that the story is quite complete right now. And then actually, there are further questions we can ask. So the question we want to ask is this follow-in multi-initial value problem. So you have a PDE here, and you consider more than one initial condition, and starting at different times, how can you talk about a correlation of all these solutions? And they are all correlated through the same mechanism. Are all correlated through the same like noise? Okay, so and the answer to that is the fundamental solution. So, because of the relation between Keys equation and the Cassi-Hilly equation, the Cassi-Hilly equation has a fundamental solution. But that translates to some sense also a fundamental solution for the King-Z equation. That means there is a four parameter random field, and if you look at an arbitrary initial value problem, An arbitrary initial value problem, as long as you do such this following convolution, it solves this following equation for you. So that means the allocoration is encoded in this four-parameter random field. So now we want to study this four-parameter blended field. Okay, so in order to, yeah, so let's first interpret this four-parameter blended field and this is the polynomial picture, because that's the main perspective for today. Perspective for today. And then it comes from the fundamental solution for the Sikhs-Hidden equation. It also has this follow-up interpretation. So previously we started from this origin. Now we are going to, instead of just moving the endpoint, we also move the starting point. So that's naturally how we obtain this four-parameter field. And then take a log resume of that, that is the four-parameter field corresponding to the KZ equation. So for the chart today, I'm also going to call an error. Today I'm also going to call it narrow edge solutions. People have called the two parameter field or narrow edge solutions before. Today is a four-parameter field. Okay, so in order to justify this convolution relation, we also need some nice results from this upper grave ras and tumor. And so they show that this four-part field is a random continuous field. Radmont continuous field, and together with many other nice populations which I rely on a lot, but I don't have space to list them all here. Okay, so now I'm ready to tell you the main result. So yeah, because this four-parameter field, it calls all the correlations with different individual value problems. And then it's natural to ask what's the large time asymptotic behavior of this ambient capabilities in the KVC scaling. And then this result shows. And then this result shows that under this scale, you converges to the four parameters in the field, and that is called a direct landscape, which we have been saying a few times in this talk. Okay, so then the direct implication of the result is that no matter how many initial value problems you consider, they all converge simultaneously. But KPZ fixed points are coupled like this, very elastic. Landscape. Okay, so then let me also briefly talk about this direct landscape. It was first constructed by Delbert, Ottoman, and Barack. And the margin of the directed landscape are also very important. This one point in marginal is the traceable GUE. And if you vary one of the spatial parameters, you get A2 process. And we can also fit the trivial result to. So, in order to show this result, I also need to rely on the previous results a lot. So, this one-point convergence by Anne-Corby and Costel, and then this one-plus one-dimensional process convergence independently by Questile, Sakara and the reactor. And today we are going to show the convergence at four parameter field. Okay, so let's first, in terms of how to prove this, let's first simplify the result. simplify the result. So here is a four-prime field that we are going to do reduction. So we will fix the two temporal parameters to be 0 and 1. That means we will review this as a two parameter field, only varying the two spatial parameters. And then if you only vary the two spatial parameters, that is called the error sheet. And then in the Kbz region, that means you fix a T units of time and then vary X on Y, that is called a Kz. Very x on y, that is the capacity sheet. And what we will be showing today is this convergence. So the convergence on the ship level. Okay, so let's reinterpret this problem again using the polymer picture. So this is a derogatory polymer setting from plus one. Previously if you look at the one plus one dimensional case, that means we only vary this point. But for the K v z sheet, that means we QVC that means we vary this ending point, the spatial parameter, and also vary the starting point, the spatial parameter for the starting point. Okay, and now naturally you get this two parameters, one in X and one in Y, the KPC sheet. And then why we cannot talk about the joint convergence of them? The reason is because if you only study one polymer, there are some other ways to compute the, to get information of this. To get information of this, but if you want to start with drawing the correlation, that means you need to somehow record actual information from the environment. So, then what is the what can provide sufficient information for us about the environment? And there is this KBZ line so you can build a KBZLAN on someone else. What do you get when you apply a version of the RSK correspondence to this white noise environment? And the KBZLA on someone will. And the KBC-Law ensemble looks like the following that was introduced by Corinne and Hammond. It is a countable collection of continuous random curves. And then the top curve here is the time t is proportional to the KZ region, narrow wide chain initial condition. And yeah, and then we're in the KBZ regime and then the relation between also under the KBZ scaling, the KZ Launch ensemble converges, converges to another Gibbs-Laun ensemble called Aerial ensemble. Gipscha La ensemble called Ariel ensemble. If result is proved by combining all of this work, so my work here showed that under this scale is tied in the local uniform topology, and then you need to categorize all the subsequent total bits. And then this Dimitri of Matowski work showed that as long as it knows the dimensional line ensemble, and then the top curve, you know the law of the top curve, you know the law of the full line ensemble. And then, yeah, so we saw earlier these two weren't independent. So earlier, these two weren't independently showed that the convergence of KPZ coefficient to KPZ fixed point, which definitely implies the convergence of the Paul curve to the R2 process. Okay, so that is the KZ Launch ensemble, and this is the area Laun ensemble. So the finite dimensional distribution has a long history. It was first introduced by Hopper and Shubong in the finite dimensional sense, and then it was proof that it is actually continuous. Prove that it is actually a continuous object by Kohli and Hammond. And also, a beautiful technique called the Bernie Gates resembling was also introduced there. Okay, so then why we care about these line ensembles? Because they provide us a very efficient way to record the information we want. Yeah, so there is this explicit way to go from the area line ensemble and the area sheet. So it looks pretty complicated, but yeah. Complicated, but yeah, but the message is there is a closing relation, which we'll go back to that later. So the area sheet is decoding in the area level sample. That's the message. Okay, so then now I'm going to give you the big picture. This red arrow is what we want to show. And then this arrow is the relation, so how every sheet is encoded here. As long as we can show that the KBZ sheet somehow is also encoded in the KPZ sheet. Somehow is also encoded in the KVZ LAN sample. And then suppose we get a relation here, and then take a limit, suppose they satisfy the DOV relation, that should help us solve the problem. And then that relation comes from the algebraic manifest of the algebraic structure of these models. And then to extract the algebraic structures, we need to do the discriminator. But the way we do the discriminatorization is the common more polymers. So, yeah, so first let me tell you, we call the Okavario polymer. It is a semi-disclosure polymer, and then this is the path of travel in this semi-discovery environment. And then, yeah, so this is the notation I'm going to reside on later. It's defined this following way. So, the interpretation is that it's a logarithmic of partition functions, that's the free energy. And you should think of it as the free energy of the polynomial charging from. The polymer traveling from this point to that point, and how much energy the collapse in this environment has. Okay, so this is a positive temperature model. So we can associate a temperature, which is a beta here, in this classical way. And then when beta is the inverse temperature, so when beta goes to infinity, that's the zero temperature case. And then we get the maximizer of this path. Pass. Okay, and that is the lesser passage recognition. Okay, so then let's show that these are indeed the discretization of these two objects. So Nika showed down to the organization sheet. So let me remind you what a sheet is. Sheet just means that we view it as a two-parameter, spatial parameter process, so we only vary x and y. Yeah, so then Nika showed that the Nika showed that we get this convergence with arrow. And then for this line ensemble, so line ensemble is nothing but outcome of a geometric RSK applied to some environment. It was introduced for this case, it was introducing this outhoner paper, that if you apply the geometric RSK to this IID boundary environment, then you get a fusion process. And the generator was computed there. And then later it was entirely. And then later it was interpreted as a gift property. There's a Courtney-Hamman paper, where they also show the tidiness. And that was what KBZ allowance of what was introduced. And also the Mika work shows the finite dimensional convergence. Altogether, this shows the convergence. So now we have all the convergence results. What is missing here is this relation. And this is, yeah, this is working by according. Work by according. So on the left-hand side, this is the sheet because you vary X and Y in this environment, which is deterministic result, but you can replace it by the motion. And then when you, this is exactly WF, this is exactly the outcome of the RSK. So it is a viral sample. And the uh zero temperature version of this was uh already established in the DOV paper, and this is a positive temperature analog of that. Steel temperature analog of that. Okay, so yeah, so then we have every ingredient we need, and how do we show the convergence? Yeah, now let me tell you the ideas of the truth. So let me first identify the difficulty for you. And on the left-hand side is the alconio sheet and the scaling, and then this is the alconio line sample and your scaling. So everything is already well normalized. Yeah, so in two Yeah, so intuitively we want to let m go to infinity here because they are all scaled, so I can drop these two indexes. And then the difficulty comes from here. So if you let n go to infinity, this starting point travels along this parabola, gives you a semi-infinite polymer. And apparently, this quantity will diverge. It goes out. And so we can not naively take a limit here. Naively take a limit here. So, a similar difficulty was also appeared in this DOV paper. So, yeah, so our idea is also heavily inspired by the DOA paper. So, we'll do a truncation here at the final level k. Then, let me introduce some notation. We will call the top part the free energy of this top part from level k to 1, the g term, and then the bottom part, the f term. And then the relation between f and g is as follows. Between F and G is as follows. So if you do this following convolution, you get the free energy of the whole path. Okay, so then let's see what we need to do. This is the crucial relation between the area line ensemble and the area sheet. This means the two lesser passage values across k levels, which is also called a Busman function. And then if we can establish this relation for the limiting subsequential limiting terms of the KPZ objects, Terms of the KPZ objects, then we are done. So the analog of this one is the G term. G term is the primary energy which travels K levels. This is the Bozeman function. And then the H term is the Kz sheet. So this is the limit of the area sheet. And also intuitively, naturally, we want to control the difference between these two positive metrics. And then this is the first idea in this paper. This paper. So the first idea says that even though polymers, the behaviors are pretty wild, but there is one big continuous statistic that can help you to control that term. And the one this statistic is this one. So the point where this polymer jumps to the K level is a random variable, the continuous random variable. And that's called a law um called a law mu. And then the law is just uh written this the following way. Written in this following way. And then the, yeah, so these are the three main ideas. In this paper, the first idea tells us that we can use mu k to control the difference between these two boots maintenance. And then we will see that when this when the bounds here are useful. And then we will be able to determine this one, these statistics by the lower part of the polygram. And then we can compute the limits of the lower part. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is the first idea. So in the middle, that's the difference of the two Bozeman terms, and then there's upper bound, there's a lower bound. And so these are true for all of these parameters, but they are only useful in a few cases. Most useful when it's a new term is a delta mass. So if there's a delta mass, you can take Z to be the center of the delta mass, and then most of these two. Delta mass, and then most of these two integrals give us one, which means the upper bound and lower bound they're both zero. That means this term has to be zero. So then, yeah, I only put a flow here in case anyone is interested. Let's give that. Yeah, so yeah, so the second idea is to observe that this could be indeed very close to a delta mass. So it is the pinned down by the lower part of the pointer. Down by the lower part of the polymer, and philosophically, we can say that the bottom part is much more sensitive in X compared to the whole free energy, so H term. In the ideal world, we can assume H does not depend on X and also assume everything is differentiable, and then we know exactly where this delta mass is concentrated. This is the solution to this equation. Okay, and then from this lemma and natural, yeah, we. So now we need to understand the last time behavior of this FK term. So that's the third idea. Okay, so let me recall to you that the F term is the bottom part of the polymer. It also travels to so many levels. So it starts from level into a finite level. And then we're able to show this There's a distributional convergence and is related to something we can do on QZLA, for example, that in protein. And then the message is that this is a large, this is a very deep polymer. It is related to some finite level object. And then the key to this one is this is following identity. The zero temperature case was also established in the BOV paper. This is the positive temperature. This is the positive temperature analog. And the message is also: so, this is a very deep polymer, and most of the two objects on the right are fanatic level objects. Okay, so then I don't have time to talk about the proof this, but there is a main ingredient I want to show it to you guys. It is a concentration phenomenon. So, if you look at the outcome of the geometric R state, that's a line sample, and then you can do the polymer. Actually, the line. Polymer, actually, the lateral symbol is not defined as the origin. What we can do is, so you cannot define a polymer starting on the origin, but you can shift the starting point closer and closer to the origin. And then we see this concentration phenomenon. But this is a key ingredient in the proof of the last element. And it is also true when you consider multiple paths. We always get this concentration. Always get this concentration when you shift the starting point to the origin. I had been able to find the reference where this has been, I could identify somewhere where there's a mapping span condition, but when I do just prove it directly. So I know that there's many experts and RSK in the audience. I think this is the perfect time to prove it to ask if there's... Okay, yeah, so in the end, let me use this opportunity to say happy birthday to you. To say happy birthday to Timo, and also thank you for being so supportive and inspiring and happy. Are there any questions? I was just gonna ask if you could um if you could just uh If you could just explain the last concentration point again. Oh yeah, the concentration is yeah, if you do a polymer on the environment, if you just do a general environment is a polymer path, unlike lots of pathic relations which concentrate on the geodesic, this blue curve just represents some polymer paths. And then when you shift the starting point to the origin, it has to travel all the way to the top, like to travel for example. To the top and control horizontal. So that means all other configurations are of width zero. This is the only one which contributes to the total weight. This is on the water biological plus plus the collation. This is on the Ocano U alive sample. It's a deterministic. It's a deterministic result, so it's it's it's for the positive temperature? Yeah, for the positive temperature. Here's a measure, or postman measure. Postman, polymer measurement. Polymer measure. This doesn't happen in the discrete. In the discrete you have to start from the top line, I think. There's no jumping at this sort. Yeah, in this crater, you get this kind of like this trap and this shape. Right, so if it doesn't happen at all in the speed, I guess, I think it's just somehow somewhere. How some factor? I haven't looked into the details of this quick case. Either it's hardly defined or something like this has to happen. What do you mean that it concentrates? That it's close to it or it jumps very close? So you can define the Polymer measure with this starting at this point. And then when epsilon goes closer and closer to zero, that Polymer measure comes in. That polymer measure concentrates on this pass. So that it's completely there? Yes, it's completely there. Ah, because it's very steeply, right? Yeah, that's what I show it. The lines are what? The only emotions? Oh, they are deterministic ones. So f is just a collection of continuous functions, no matter just the continuous functions defined on the interval, say from 0 to t, and then you look at. To T, and then you look at the outcome of the generation R escape, get a watermelon. So then that is a W F. So the lines are the watermelon plants. Yeah, the lines are the watermelon. They are not horizontal. This is why it concentrates on the drop line. The reason why the concentrate, so it is not defined, so I put zero plus here, it's not well defined, it is single. And then, so if you have 5. And then, so if you have Viker here, this too will blow up to minus infinity at the scale minus log. So if this is F, this is minus log N, and then this is log epsilon. And then this blows up to positive infinity also as a log of this rate. Is it related to looking at what happens near time zero for that for the diffusion? And I don't know, but if you are. No, but if you view RSK as a composition of a piecemeal transform, and even if you just do a switching, so one single piecemeal transform is already not well defined as zero. Yeah, no, I think but maybe we can we can discuss the same thing. Okay, let's thank our speaker again. Uh we're still back at you guys.
