Please make caps and continuity of being introduced to the states. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction and the invitation. Today I'll talk about the stability of non-critical spectral properties, the arithmetic absolute continuity of the integrated density of states. And it was based on our joint work with Lin Rui Guo and the Swedish Lana James Kaya. And we'll focus on the analog one frequency shooting operators, which is given by the equation one. Here alpha is the frequency, theta is the phase, and now we consider v is one periodic kinetic function. Then we define the integrated density of state. Defines the integrated density of states. And it is defined by this equation and denoted by NE. It is the average of spectral measure. Here, mu theta is the spectral measure associated with this operator and delta zero. Now for IDS, we want to consider, we focus on the question, is the IDS an absolutely continuous function? And for this, function. And for this problem, a complete answer was given for the almost Mazell operator, which is given by the equation 2. Here the potential is equal to 2Î» cosine 2 pi theta. And now for this model, there are some important results as follows. If lambda is equals to 1, then I d s is not absolutely continuous. This was proved by last and other By last, and the albeda and the Creek variant. And if lambda does not equal to one, then we need to add some arithmetic condition on alpha. If beta alpha equals to zero, then I ds is absolutely continuous. This was proved by Avila and James Kyle. If beta alpha is larger than zero, then it is absolutely continuous. This was proved by Avila and Domenic. Furtherly, we want to consider Further, we want to consider if some similar results hold for general analytic one-frequency trading operators. And to study this general model, we need to use Avila's global theory. Here's two definitions. The first one is the complexified Lyapunov exponent. Actually, Ling Ri and Qi has introduced this and I'll quickly. uh i'll quickly uh skip this our way we are denoted by l extra e and it is the limit of the transfer matrix of a here a has this form then we can define the acceleration denoted by omega e equals to this equation 4 now let's see our last globe theory it says for general one frequency shooting For general one-frequency shooting operator, one can divide the spectrum into three regions. The first part is the subcritical region, corresponding to L equals to zero and omega equals to zero. The second part is critical region, corresponding to l equals to zero and omega is larger than zero. And the supercritical part corresponding to l is larger than zero and omega is larger than zero. And then And then, with these three regions, we will have some important results. If we restrict IDS on the subcritical region, then it is absolutely continuous. Actually, this is a corollary of Avella's almost reducibility conjecture. And if we restrict n to the critical region, then it is not absolutely continuous. Since the background, The back measure of the critical region is zero. And this was proved by Avella Fired and Quickorian. If we restrict n to the supercritical region, then it is absolutely continuous for almost everywhere alpha. And this was proved by Gudense and Schlag. Now we can see the results for the first two parts, the subcritical region and the critical region. The answer is complete. However, for the However, for the answer about the supercritical region, it is not complete since we only can prove this for almost everywhere alpha. One can even not fix alpha. And now our aim is to study the general analytic one-frequency shooting operators. And for this general model, the answer. And for this general model, the answer is not complete. In the supercritical region, the result is nearly theoretic. That means we cannot fix the frequency. And for the almost massive operator, one actually only proved absolute continuity of IDS for the subcritical case. And for the supercritical case, it follows directly from operate duality. And they didn't give a But they didn't give a direct method to prove the supercritical almost massive operator. So we want to ask if operate duality essential for the almost massive operator. If not, which quantity is interesting? And this is our first motivation. And up to now, there are few methods to direct methods to prove the absolute... Method to prove the absolute continuity of I ds under some arithmetic condition on alpha. So it is worth it for us to study this problem, to propose a new method to solve the supercritical case. And this is our second motivation. And actually, if we want to study the general model, the To study the general model, the first step for us is to study the analytic neighborhood of almost the massive operator, which is given by the following equation. Here, the potential equals to 2 lambda cosine plus epsilon v. Here, v is a one periodic real kinetic function. And we always assume here, epsilon is small enough, so it is a kinetic perturbation of the almost massive operator. And let's explain. And let's explain why we need to study this model firstly. As I said before, it is the first step to study the general model. And it's natural to expect all the almost massive operator spectral properties hold for this neighborhood of almost massive operator. Since AMO comes from physics, thus, all the spectral properties should be stable under some magnetic. On the some magnetic conditions. And in this paper, we want to develop a method to deal with the supercritical spectral problem without using self-dual property. That is why we need to study this model firstly. And here is our results. We proved if alpha is strong dietine and the lambda does not and the lambda does not equal to one and the way is real negative then there exists some epsilon zero depending on lambda such that if epsilon is smaller than epsilon zero then the integrated states the integrated density of states is the neighbor of the neighborhood of our mass mass cell operator is absolutely continuous that means if alpha is drawn by fantasy then for the analytic computer then for the analytic perturbation of almost the mass field operator of non-critical note that it is non-critical almost massive operator then we will have its ids is absolutely continuous here we say alpha is drawn definite means the distance between k alpha and the integer has this lower bound and we denote this sdc to be the union set To be the union set, we can check it is the follow-back magnetic set. This is our results. And excuse me, can I ask a question? Okay, sure. Can you go back to the theorem, please? So it says that epsilon naught only depends on lambda, does not depend on v. But for this to be meaningful, someone needs to normalize v. I mean, you cannot, right? If it's independent of v, you can just subsume the epsilon and v. I mean, or. Just subsume the epsilon and v, I mean, or rather, take v of size one over epsilon or whatever. Yes, it's all it is only depending on lambda. No, no, but then I don't understand the theorem. So somehow v needs to be bounded. I mean, needs to be in some bounded set. Otherwise, if it's independent of v, you can then vary v and make v very large. Or at least on the bound on the size of V or something. On the bound on V, right? Yeah, on the bound on V. Okay. Thank you for your question. Actually, episode zero should depend on V. And here are two remarks about our theorem. Actually, the strong diphantine condition can be relaxed to die condition or even to Berma condition. And we believe our methods in this paper still work, since we only use the existing homogeneous results. Results. And in this paper, we mainly deal with the supercritical part. For the perturbations of the subcritical almost maximal operator, the absolute continuity of IDS is a corollary of the almost irreducibility conjecture, which was announced by Avela. And to keep our paper self-contained, we will give a short proof of this, independent of this conjecture. And now let's explain why we can deal with the neighborhood of almost massive operator. Actually, since it has a nice feature by global theory. So wait, I have a question. So why you can prove that completely independent of AIRC? If them. I will explain later. Since we will use the openings of almost reducibility, but the first step is ARC. You prove that it's almost reducible. Right. Things we consider this model, the neighborhood of the analytic prediction of almost massive operator. Also, you mean you use almost the position to imply almost visibility, right? No, you use almost the localization to imply almost the visibility of lambda smaller than one, then you use openness of almost visibility. Yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly. Okay. Okay, I'll introduce the nice feature of this model, neighborhood of almost massive operator. Since from global theory, for the almost massive operator, we will know for E in the spectrum, we have if lambda is smaller than one, this corresponding to L equals to zero and omega equals to zero. And if lambda is larger than one, this corresponding to l is larger than zero and omega equals to one. And for the To one. And for the neighborhood of our mass mass operator for all E in the spectrum, we will have if lambda is smaller than one and epsilon is small enough, this corresponding to L is equals to zero and omega equals to zero. If lambda is larger than one and epsilon is small enough, this corresponding to l is larger than zero and omega equals to one. And from the two results, we will find now the neighborhood of all material. Now the neighborhood of almost massive operator is different from almost massive operator since it is not self-dual. So we cannot invoke the almost massive operators to get the results. And second to prove the result. And secondly, the exact same feature is that the neighborhood of almost mass cell operator and AMO has the same acceleration on the spectrum. And both of And both of them are smaller than or equal to one. So we find the most important and interesting feature for the almost massive operator is that the acceleration is bounded by one on the spectrum. And in fact, it is exactly the feature that prevents the occurrence of double resonances. It confirms the importance of acceleration. It confirms the importance of acceleration in the spectral theory. That means once we have this interesting feature that acceleration is bounded by one, then we can get a more general result as follows. We suppose E in the spectrum of the operator with real analytical potential is non-critical and it satisfies this condition. The acceleration is bounded by one. Now we let bounded by one. Now we let w is real magic. Then there exists some euphosonal zero depending on potential, depending on v and the w this function, such that if r phi is drawn by 15 and the epsilon is smaller than epsilon zero, then the ids of this operator, now the potential is the v plus epsilon v, is absolutely continuous. So, this is our general results if we add this condition. And in the following, I will introduce the proof.
