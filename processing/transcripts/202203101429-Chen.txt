  And so we're happy to have Wenzhou Shen from the University of British Levy who's going to be telling us about. Let's be telling us about not farming while ledging yourself as curtains. Thanks a lot. So thanks a lot for the opportunity to speak. And today I want to talk about something Jonathan and I have been thinking about. It's going to be a malphrobology of satellite nuts. And it's an approach to computing these objects using immersed curves. And on Tuesday, Jake Really told us a nice approach in that direction. And today Direction and today I want to tell you about the like a slightly different perspective. So to start, to record that like Chikenstra said right now, we need a nut in the source path, which we call the pattern nut. And then we also need a nut K inside a free sphere. Inside a free sphere, which we call the companion. And then the seller null is just basically just obtained by boolean the sorry plus containing T to the complement of the convenient map. And the right S g minus the neighborhood that That's green minus the neighborhood of k. I'm going to denote like a pair. Let's create p of k. And since Monica already told us a bunch of mass examples, it's funny. So I'm going to skip drawing any diagrams for that. So, and the GNOME power true for getting not for chain complexes or not. Forgetting non-frogen complexes, non-fromology of sapphire nodes comes from Borderhegaphromology. So that the relevant theorem, most relevant theorem, this one due to left shift. I'll just go off there's no um Which says the version of the non-Russian complexes, which I'm going to write G Cfk minus, of the separate node is quasi-isomorphic to the false potential product alpha and A infinity module associated to the cell phones containing P uh bulk tensor P Bounce tensure of the type V structure of the non-component of the companion. So here by GCFK minus just mean integration of non-profit complexes that only has horizontal arrows, no vertical arrows, and no diagonal arrows. And you can think about this. And you can think about this. This is a migrated chain complexes, free and dynamically generated chain complexes over and so I won't talk, I won't say more about these algebraic structures because James already said something on it. But some the underlying topological The underlying topological inputs for the steer on assembling cord for the Hager diagram. So the idea is for these errors, say if you have a pattern nothing S1 cross D2, then you can sort of represent them in terms of the Border-Higger diagram, which is the surface with one boundary component, and then you also have the Bunch of arcs on that. So there are two alpha arcs probably embedded in the colours. And suppose you have a genus G surface, then there's also G minus one alpha circles and two beta circles and two base points. I'm gonna put maybe D here and And somewhere there's a base point W. And the reason that this kind of diagram encodes not in three manifold boundaries is the same as the reason that a boning diagram encodes not encodes free manifold. And you can do the same thing for the spotlight diagram. But this was a border diagram. And now this closed header diagram is the one that encodes the circling nut. And so you can define non-rotating complexes using this closed header diagram, which is generated by intersection points of the alpha and beta curves. And then in this case, we come from mobile curves that do not close the T. That do not close to the base point. And then these CFA minus and CFB halves is just the relative invariant coming from each half of these four digital nickels. So there are some very successful applications of this theorem and I want to mention about because they're really my favorite theorems. So, um let me start with the first one. Uh there's a theorem uh due to uh Jenkoff and it's a theorem on uh um tally variants. So there's this tally variant that you can get from null Brushing complexes. You can basically think about this as a group homogenism from the null concordance group um to the integers. To the integers. And so people were interested in understanding the relation of the time variant of the cable node and the time variant of the original node, K. And so many people sort of studied this question, including Manhattan and Bank of Ecola, who Ecola, who gave children partial answers to this question, and Jen, using the skill, was able to give a complete answer to this question. So she found out there are only three types of behaviors that can occur. And in each of the cases, you can sort of write down this time variant in terms of the radius allergic formula that involves the time variant of the original nut. Invariant of the original knot. And these parameters P and Q they look something like this. And moreover, depending on which type of behavior occurs, she actually associates to this original dot k an invariant, which she called epsilon. And my favorite part of the story is this epsilon invariant is also a concordance invariant. And this is the one that inspired the proof of the there exists an infinite random summary of probability slice node in the smooth node concordant group. Um oh and um another theorem due to Adam Lovin says uh it's a similar um set by formula, but in this case I want to write one for uh the epsilon invariant. So uh he says uh if you look at the epsilon variant um of a set I node uh m of k of a set I note M of K, where this N refers to the pattern, which is the maser button. Then the epsilon invariant always takes, like, only takes 0 and 1. Negative 1 never occurs. And 0 occurs if then only if epsilon k is 0. King STRL. And today I want to talk a little bit about the proof of these theorems. I won't really prove them for you, but like the proof of these two theorems, of course, it uses this formula, but they're still quite involved. Involved in my perspective. You have to be quite smart and patient in order to get to proof of these formulas. For example, when Adam was trying to obtain this formula, there are certain modules, certain A modules, that right he kn when he computed them, he actually needed to use computer program. Needed to use a computer program to get a module. So it is something quite like how to compute. And in particular, suppose you want to study questions that involves a family of pattern knots, like not just specific pattern knots, then it would not be reasonable to do that one by one by using that formulas. So the hope is to make That's to make life easier and the hope just comes from using these immersed curve planning introduced by Jonathan, Jake, and Rio. So to say a little bit about what that is. So in the simplest setup, let's say you have some closed three manifold tips coming up. Suppose you have a three manifold and that's the union of the two And that's the union of the two free manifold with torus boundary. We have M1 and M2, and then boundary of M1 equals boundary of M2 and with some torus. Sorry. And then the general board Higgiaphrology package tells you that the pair version Higgins have a free metal. Here from a log of the three manifold y is isomorphic to an infinite module C of A hat of this M1 box tensor product the I D structure of M2. And this is due to, I mean this is due to a leprosy clause by Thurston. Then Jonathan Jay and Liam says, okay, these algebraic structures actually has a geometric integration. Actually, it has a geometric interpretation. So the C of A or C of D of these manifolds, Mi, you can actually interpret them as immerse curves. On the right, gamma and I decided boundary. Boundary of these three manifolds in the complements of the base point. And moreover, now if you do this pairing, it also has a geometric interpretation. So this is the Lagrange for homology chain complexes of the piano immersed curves. The pin of immersed curves for M1 and M2 inside tortus. And the torus is the common boundary of these two free numbers. So let me just think about this is gamma of M2 and then this is gamma of M2. So you can think about these two inverse curves at the alpha beta circles in a regular Hager diagram and just go and compute the chain complexes. And surely we would like something like this for cell phone notes as well. Um yeah. So basically, I mean the advantage of this theoretical stuff now we can sort of understand these uh we can have these structures. These type A and type D structures geometrically and globally as immerged curves. And otherwise, you see a bunch of arrows and dots and differentials like that. But now you see this geometrically. So it's really a great option. And also the boss tensor product, I mean, the pain of doing the boss tensor product just goes away. Because you can understand that in terms of how these curves intersect on a toilet. Insect like Polis. And okay, so back to the story of central nuts. So the demon-pyre theorem, Jonathan and I have been working on it. So there will be a general case, but for now I want to restrict to a special case where I'm going to let this P be a cabinet. Have a number that admits a genus one that we pointed here at Act. So schematically, I'm going to have something like this. This is a torus. And it's easier to think about. These are the alpha arcs, which I cut open a lot of the alpha arcs, and I get this tortoise. The boundary. Here's schematically my beta curves. Here's one on my base point. See, and some base point W somewhere in the middle of the diagram. So I have a diagram like this. And then the theorem says if I look at C of K of Of the siline of P of K, then this is Qing top equivalent to C of K R of the not like of the Hager diagram obtained from just stacking the spore-Hager diagram corresponding to this. Corresponding to this panel P goes to like this and the inverse curves corresponding to the complement of K. So you're right, alpha K for that. Alpha K is the uh nerd's curve. Of the dump complement. You can think about that as CFP of the dump complement. Okay. Um yeah, so um Yeah, so um so here um let me just say a little bit about uh this widening what are the specific terms in this theorem here. So um oh she really did what flavor did CFA right so uh I'll just say that. So here, um this the this R is just the ring um Q V not Q V. So you can think about this flavor of C of K as the one that remembers the horizontal L's and vertical L's, but not only diagonal L's. So so basically over here if you have the genus one diagram, the chain complex is generated by um by intersection point of the By the intersection point of the red curve and the green curve. And now you can count bygones that cross one of the base points, like either Z or W, but it doesn't cross both the base points simultaneously. So that's the flavor of the novel chain complexes we're looking at. And this is really much stronger than the G C of K minus I just mentioned earlier. In fact, In fact, like this is the version of null protein complexes that January and Matt and Lynn, they used this to construct infinitely concordants and more systems. So, I mean, that's one of the reasons that why we are working. That's one of the reasons why we are working on situation of pairing theorems. I should say that a few years ago I proved the reconversion of this theorem, but that only works for 2 sub k minus. And that's an improvement. There we go. And of course you see like the pairing theorem I mentioned earlier won't prove this because that only works for the simplest version. And so I'm going to mention So I'm going to mention a little bit about the proof later if I have time, but that's more related to the general case. So maybe let me make a remark here. So if you have a hyogenous Hager diagram, then you can sort of do the same thing for here. Like if you have this Higger diagram for P, and now you just have just more do you notice? Just more genus here. And let me draw a diagram like this. So these are the alpha arcs. Here's some data curve that I don't care about what they are. And here's some other base point, W. Here's a base point V. Then what you can do is you can sort of do the same thing by replacing Facing these off arcs and the boundary by the immersed curve of the companion node. And then if you go ahead and compute the non-verbal chain complexes of this figure diagram, this is going to give you the non-viral chain complexes of P of K. It's the general case. The general case. So indeed, Charlotte and I, I mean, to make sense of this theorem, Charlotte and I actually define malcroching complexes in the case where you have one of the alpha curve E inverse. So there's certain technical things going on there, but I won't say too much about that. And also the applications. The applications have in mind, mostly in case where the pattern is not a genus 1 diagram. So I want to focus on this theorem for the rest of the talk. And maybe the second remark I should say here is if you haven't seen, if you haven't thought about this genus 1 node before, you sort of want to ask what kind of a pattern node Pen and not genus 1 W pointing diagram. So let me just say a few examples. So genus 1 pen and notes they would include the examples they would include all the cable links. And it also includes the one-hat double and includes the major patterns. So in particular, if you want to reprove some of the theorems I mentioned earlier, you can use this theorem. Save you some time. And for the next public talk, I want to give you an example, like why this theorem would make your life slightly easier. And before doing that, I'm going to say some very, very general about immersed curves. Right, let's balance effects. So suppose you have a null k in S3, then Jonathan Jake and Liam tells you we can get an immersed curve in the boundary of the null complement, something like this. And the fact I wanna want to talk about is that suppose I looked this diagram to your covering space of the torus. Covering space of the torus, where I'm thinking, this vertical one corresponds to the meridian and this corresponds to the cycle longitude. And now I lift this diagram to covering vertical regression. That is the base points of PR like this. Then up to homotopy, this immersed curve of K. I mean, one of the problems. Um I mean one of the properties it's going to intersect um this look of the meridian uh geometrically once. So the number of intersection is just one. And then it's going to be symmetric. There's an outreach center of symmetry here. If you rotate it's diagram by 180 degrees, then it just goes back to south. And in this example, this curve is the mere curve for checkline. In general, it can have some crazy curves, but it's going to obey these two properties. And if you are really familiar with the work of Jonathan, Jing, and Liam, then you can kind of see like this is the thing that corresponds to the type D structure of the knock complements. But today I would like to, I mean, I'm going to think about this kind of thing as a knock-chain complexis. As a not chain complexis. So my claim is this inverse curve actually corresponds to the non-pro chain complexes of the null K. And the way you see it is you just pair it with the identity pattern, which is the core of the tollis. In this case, the border hair diagram is just I'm going to draw it like this. The border you get diagram is just a straight footing curve going down with base point W and Z on the left and right. So I'm going to put W here. And then Z, I mean, so I should put Z here, but I'm going to move it here just for convenience. And now once you pair this with whatever immersive curve you have, And the theorem tells you the non-frog-chain complexes of this A diagram is the non-frog-chain complexes of K, because the pen and this is just the core. And I should say that you don't really need to use the theorem to make this point, because this already exists in the paper of Jake, Jonathan, Jake, and Liam. And they already know that. And they already know that if you have this picture, then this guy gives you the approaching complexes. So, anyway, so the point I want to make is now if you look this diagram up here, then you see a picture where you can somehow relate the malfunctioning complexes and immerse curves. So, um I'm gonna have And here, so you see the generators at the intersection point at the green and the red, and we're calling x1, x2, and x3. And you can see these icons are relating these generators and make a few. Relating these generators and they give you the check the differentials. So this so for now I'm going to identify these two kind of pictures. So this is, I would say this is a more CFD point of view of the diagram, and this is a more narrow chain complex point of view of the same diagram. Okay, so that's my very general comment on immersed curves. So the example I want to consider is, I think, Cora. One bridge break. So here's an example of one bridge break. I'm going to call it B422. And it looks like this. So you have that. And in general, I can have one bridge way parametrized. One bridge break parametrized by these integers P, Q, and B, where P is just the number of strands, in this case P is 4, and Q is the number of twists, going in the diagram. So Q is 2 in here. And B is this number of strands here. So there's a short branch that doesn't quite make a twist. The number of strands. And the number of strands it crosses its speed. And then, if you take a closure of this braid, then it's going to give you a pattern inside of the toilet. And some of you might have noticed if I set B to B, but I'm going to be able to Some of you might have noticed if I set B to be zero, then this recovers the tortoise and not to PQ. So if I study this kind of patterns, then automatically I'm going to get results on cabling as well. And I should say that in addition to the cable formula for the time there that I mentioned earlier, Jonathan and Liam also has a really nice workout cable. Really nice work on cabling where they described how immersed curves of a null transform under cabling operation. So, actually, that's the motivation, like one of the motivation of this project, which should be clear later. And also, if you look at the set of one version rate, then it's going to contain all the Body Ricky Devinot. So this is the set of nasty sartardis that emits narcuvial tartal surgery. And also Chen Tai and Ferry has a result on when you search When we search uh um Safari nodes, uh, L space knots. Okay. Um They're still genus one, right? Right, exactly. Uh yeah, and yeah, right. So yeah, so in general if you have uh like something like this, then uh you can decompose it as two arcs, Diana and Delta, where um I'm gonna take delta to be the short bridge. Delta to be this short bridge. And you can think about this delta as an arc property embedded in the torus. While the rest of it is like a tortoise nut, so you can put the rest of it through the boundary of the toilet. And this is exactly like a genus 1 language decomposition, so it emits genus 1 diagram. And the fun thing is now if you actually draw the genus diagram, then you can see the same thing you can say about an upright gene complexis. And then you just do it here. I'm going to just do it here. I'm going to call these genus 1 pagerotic ones HPQMB for the grade. And then, indeed, I'm just going to, instead of telling you how to get one of these, I'm just going to give you an example. The example I wrote down. And in fact, I'm going to tell you how to draw this in universe. How to draw this uh in universe in universe power. Um so here, uh like this so just join a grid of the universal cover. So uh So uh here the horizontal quantity of this is 0, 1, 2, and 3. So in general you only need like like p minus 1 p minus 1 vertical plus here. And then I'm gonna put the W and T by the X. I'm gonna put the uh W T base point here around the uh integer point and then uh this Bayer curve, the left of the Bayer curve. Bayer curve, the left of the Bayer curve is going to look like this. So it goes down here, and then there's a finger going up like that. And then here's finger going up like that. Here's finger going up like that. And you can imagine like replicating this diag this curve. This curve as you move on. So let's go so if you also want to join the alpha curves. If you also want to draw the alpha curves, it's going to look something like this. But I'm not going to draw the alpha arcs, since we're going to erase them when we do pairing. And the key thing here is you have this bunch of fingers, the tips of the fingers are at the integer point, and the slope of these fingers. They're doing by P times Q plus P over G squared. And now suppose you kill this Hager diagram with a merge curve K. Let's say, let's take K to be the track row. Suppose you want to consider this K42. K422 and take K to be the shortcut. Then you just lift the trendboard curve over this diagram. And then the novel chain complexes of this kind, its novel chain complexes Complexes of the ZYNOT. But another good thing is if you look at this for a while, I realize actually I don't need to, I mean, I shouldn't try to write out this too algebraically. In fact, if you if you observe how this green curve behaves, How this green curve behaves. It sort of goes down and goes through, like, imagine there's a short arc going between Z and W, then you just go past that short arc for each of them, and it just never returns. And so if you notice this thing, then you can say, I'm going to do a planar transform. I'm going to do planar transform that pull this green curve straight. Politics green curve street. Dan, you're going to see a diagram like this. Photographing curves jades, and here's the curve. Photographing curve shades, and here on the left and right at this Z and W base point. I'm gonna stop writing Z and W. I'm just gonna draw a bar between them. So we can imagine you can push these fingers back and then fetch this. Shut this diagram a little bit. And then you can see this red curve is going to become something like this. And then this is exactly the type of diagram where you identify immersed curves of a non-complement and non-broaching complexes. So this red curve here is the immersed curve of the Ceph Island. Of the set of K422. So what I've done here is that we showed from this example, I mean, we can conclude a theorem which says So there's a planner transform which I minimized F P Q and E that sends the immersed curve up to now K maybe the lift of the Merse curve Um 2D MERS curve 2D Mers curve at the semi-comp. And just in general, and this is going to recover, if you take B to B 0, then this recovers the theorem by Jonathan and Niam. Which is okay now. So there's a planar transformation that takes the merge curve down to its cable. So that's why I say this is one of the motivation of the theorem. Basically, we notice something like this, and we really want to understand why this. And we really want to understand why this happens. And I think one nice thing about Java and VMs DRM is that this also recovers trans cable formula for both the time variant and the absolute variant, which we didn't put down. Basically, the time variant is just the height of the first intersection. The burst intersection, the red and green. And it also tells you, for example, Steernight says that, which says that if you have a cable now, KPQ, then this is an L-space node. If only K is an L space. Um K is the nail space now. Uh and then um Q o g squared M equal to 2G K minus 1. And then now since we have a more general theorem actually we can say We could say that if you give me a one-bridge braid, then do the step by now KPQ and P is a down-space napped if that only of If and only if KSL space now and then the slope pq plus b over p square is greater than equal to 22k minus 1. And this also requires a theorem by By Jen Kai and Perry, which they proved this criteria for good burgundy notes. So I take the In fact, they also have some kind of tie-in formula with that, and we can deduce that using our theorem as well. But I'm not going to say too much about it. And also, I think, I mean, I sort of prepared a proof, but I don't think I should go for part of the proof. Let me just stop here. I have a sweet question. I have a silly question. Uh you all your immersed curves are embedded. Um so why are you calling them immersed curves? Well, that's a good question. So like this embedded, I mean for this particular one it's embedded, but uh there do exist cases where uh even if you've left to the um you to the covering space is still in the uh they do they have sort of a like with a winding number? Yeah, right, with the velocity vector. Yeah, like the velocity record. Yeah, like for the, for example, if you look at a figure A naught complement, then you're gonna see a piece of figure A here. But even for this, if you look at them in the toilets, then the studio emerged. Preparing the like the curve on the first curve, right? With the inverse curve, right, in the picture to just erase on the left? Oh yeah. That you mean the green curve? Yeah. The green curve, that one isn't the one that wear a lot of fingers at you. That one is not immersed. I mean, if you look at it, that's the one that coming from a Higger diagram. So a Higger diagram, on this Higger diagram, the beta curve would be an embedded curve for us. But in general, I can imagine if you have a more challenge. I can imagine if you you have a more general pattern then. So in your proof, do you show that um at least for one bridge braids they're like an isomorphism? Like the beta curves are the same as the immersed curves. Do you have that? Like maybe I didn't. Can you say it again? Do you have that the um the figure diagram curve? You can basically use that. You can basically use that instead of the immersed curve for that. Right. Like I didn't say, yeah, I didn't really go and pick out immersed curve for pattern now. It's just the hair diagram. Did that answer your question? I think I'll just ask you later. Oh, sorry. That was very cool. Yeah. Sorry. So, one of the virtual participants, what class, this is from Jen, or what class of patterns? Yeah, or what class of patterns do you expect satelliting to give a blinker? That's something Jonathan and I thought about. We don't know other examples than lumber spread or iterations of lumber break. We sort of, yeah. We sort of hope, like, hope these kind of thinner transformations Somehow characterizes these pattern notes. Like, I mean, the general theme of the questions you can ask is: suppose you know the action of the pattern on the merge curves. So does that characterize the pattern? Like a detection type theorem. But we don't know. Sorry about that. Okay, uh it's that for me. Uh I'll just ask. And uh I've got uh yeah thanks first for talking. Yeah, thanks first for the talk. I have a question about two things. So first, can you did you th think about town variance for these general patterns that you that you described? Do you have some kind of formula that tells you how to do the pattern from the two pieces? Like the pen and the pattern? Um um so I don't know like what how channel sorry I don't know how to like uh you want the formula you want, but uh for sure you don't have something like uh so you have some numerical invariant from P and numerical invariant from K and you can sort of have some uh simple formula and gives you the time variant of the set hymns. We don't have that, but back in my paper I wrote a few years ago, I think when I restrict one of the patterns to, sorry, when I restrict the companion knot to the trephy node or the left-handed trephy node, then there's a general formula when this pattern P is a class of true bridge, it's a class of genus 1 patterns. So there's something like One patterns. So there's something like that in very restricted sets. Okay, thanks. And in another direction, sort of have you thought about restrictions, imposing restrictions from winding and mapping numbers? So does that so you you look at the genus genus one case, but other yeah, do do restrictions from mapping and winding number help you somehow? Help you somehow? Yeah, but yeah, but that would come up in a later project. Okay, thanks. Thanks for the joke. That answer your question. I have another question. What about epsilon of satellites? I'm not going to all take them out to be values. Is that easier to get a general formula for? No, yeah. Not yet. Not yet. Still a little bit difficult to... I mean, I mean, I mean, this I mean, the one version of one break case is like the, I guess, one of the best case one can ever have. Because you can see epsilon, because you know what the curve is. But in general, if you have a pairing diagram dash-offs, you need to figure out which intercession point corresponds to the time variant. And then I To the tau invariant, and then I look at the differentials connected to that intersection point to figure out what x and y is. That's still maybe somewhere people can think about what to do. Hope for some nice description. In general, no, not yet. Well, let's thank our speaker at her time. He tried to finish on time, but we wouldn't let him. So we'll break for another 25 minutes. I the the more happy talking early suggestions today of this thing operation.
