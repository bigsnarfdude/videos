Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you very much. So, yeah, I would like to make a kind of overview of some recent and less recent works on spectral triple applied to the standard model and in particular kind of variation of spectral triple, which are the twisted spectral triple. So, these are several works which are in collaboration with Sir Manuel Effilacci, who is actually a postdoc in Clarko, Devashi Singh was. In Craco, Deva Schisting, who was a former PhD student in Genova, and Jacopo Zanketin, who is a PhD student in Trieste, Eruben Zetun, who is a PhD student in Paris. So, okay, maybe I will just flash the first slides because I guess everybody knows that. So, just to remind, in case in the audience, there are people not so familiar with that. When I hear, I'm talking about non-commutative geometry in the framework of code, and so it provides a Of Kohn, and so it provides a unified description of the standard model of fundamental interaction, which is minimally coupled to general relativity, which is, I mean, Einstein reduction, and it includes right-handed neutrinos. And let's say maybe the most interesting added value of all this model is that the Higgs field comes out as the gauge field, exactly at the other gauge boson, but a gauge field that lives in the non-commutative part of the geometry. So all this works well, but So, all this works well, but as we have seen already in the previous talk, it works well for Riemannian manifold. So, if you are in 4D in a metric, plus, plus, plus, plus. And as we have heard before, the generalization to Lorentzian manifold is far from obvious. I mean, there are some attempts, but there is nothing which so far is settled down. And so, when we say that this is Einstein-bet action of general relativity, this is Einstein-bet action in a T-Dian signature. So, that's basically roughly. So that's basically roughly the state of the art. There are some various attempts to play with the rule of the game of non-commutative geometry to try to go beyond the standard model. So here I have listed several of them. So you can add new fermions, so you modify the dimension of the hilt space. You can play with a mathematical condition. So this I will discuss more in detail. There is a first order condition that you can play with. You can modify an aspect of the spectral triple, which are the structure. Which are the B structure. You can try to build some non-associative geometry, or you can play with the characteristic of the Clifford bundle. I mean, there are other versions, so I do not pretend to be exhaustive. I mean, other tentative to go beyond the standard model. And also, the one I would like to talk more in details is to use a twisted version of non-commutative geometry. And all this possibility, they share one characteristic: that the idea, except the first, the idea is not to add Except the first, the idea is not to add new fermions but to try to add new bosons. Okay, so that's also the framework I will imagine. So the idea is not to add new fermions because, as far as I know, there has no indication so far, experimental indication that there should be new fermions. But we will see there are some indication. I mean, some people may discuss about that, but that there could be new bosons. In particular, in particle physics, there is this problem that the mass of the wigs is quite low, and we are in a We are in an area where the actually the vacuum of the electronic vacuum is not stable but metastable. Okay, this is because the Higgs field has a mass below 130 Gb. And for some people in particle physics, this could be seen as a problem or as an indication that maybe there is something else just around the corner because we are close to the phase transition. And so maybe there should be new and one possibility to solve that is to have a new bosons that avoid this metastability of the X-free. So we will see how. Of the X field. So we will see how with a twisted version of incomputer geometry, we can, like the other attempts, obtain this new field, but that's not the most interesting thing because the most interesting thing that we were motivated to obtain this new field, but during our procedure, we obtained something new, which is a new form of one field. And we will see that this form of one field has two interpretations, which and the link between the two is still mysterious for me. On the one side, Is still mysterious for me. On the one side, it can be seen as a torsion in the spin connection. And if we compute a specific action, we can also see that this allows to make a transition from the octagon to the Reinsen signature, not at the level of the spectral triple, but at the level of the action. So I will come back to all this. I didn't make this. Okay, no signal of the talk. Okay, so let me begin. We just recall the very basic of aspectual triple that we will need. Basic of a spectral triple that we will need. So, as we all know, a spectral triple is an algebra which acts on input space together with the self-adjunct operator that we will call the Dirac operator, which satisfies the list of properties. And here, I have listed a property that will be useful for us. The most important one is that the commutator of D with an element of the algebra should be bounded. Then the spectral triple is graded. It exists this operator, gamma, self-adjoint with square to one and which satisfies anti-commutation or commutation property with the algebra and the Dirac operator. The Zirac operator. There is also the squad wheel structure, which is another operator, antilinear operator, which satisfies this property here. So it's square to plus or minus one, commutes or anti-commutes with a direct operator, it commutes or anti-commutes with a grading, and we've got a choice of sign which define the so-called cow dimension of the triple. This will be also relevant later. And there are two other conditions which links all these objects: the order zero condition, which tells you that the wheel structure, if you The real structure, if you it can allow you to define this g b star g minus one, which actually is a representation of the opposite algebra, and this opposite algebra should commute with the representation of the algebra. So this commutator should be zero. This is the other zero condition. And there is a first other condition, which is this one, which tells you that the commutator of the operator with an element of the algebra should commute with an element of the opposite algebra. And okay, this is a condition which is requires to guarantee that the Dirac operator, the operator D. Guarantee that the Dirac operator, the operator D, is a first-order differential operator. So we will play with all this condition. Let me, okay. Just so very briefly recall our work, the description of the standard model in non-commutative geometry. So the spectral triple is a product in the sense of spectral triple of a spin manifold of that. We will take dimension four, okay? Although it works, everything works well in even dimension with a finite dimensional spectral triple. So here you've got the formula. Spectral triple. So here you've got the formula of the product of spectral triple. So the algebra is just the product of the algebra. AF is this finite-dimensional algebra, which acts on the product of a Hilbert space. So here L2 of Ms is a Hilbert space of square integrable spinners on a Riemannian manifold. We are all in a Riemannian signature. Hf is a finite dimensional Hilbert space. And the Dirac operator of the product is a bit more complicated than just the product of the Dirac operator. It has this formula here. So it is the first operator multiplied by the identity of the second Hilbert space here. The identity of the second hilot space here, I put 32 because the hilt space is high dimension 32, but it is just the identity of this of the finite dimensional hilt space plus gamma 5 is the grading of the first spectral triple times the recuperator of the second spectral triple. Okay, and if we make these things, for the standard model, we have to choose what is the finite dimensional algebra. So there has been lots of work on that and to arrive to the result that the algebra should be the complex number. Algebra should be the complex number plus the quaternion plus the three basic matrix, which act on a nilbus space of dimension 32. And the Dirac operator related to this is a 32 by 32 matrix. And we can divide it in two pieces. There is a block diagonal piece and the off-diagonal piece. And in the off-diagonal piece, there is a 16 by 16 block, which contains all the parameters of the theory, which are basically the Majorana mass. No, sorry, it's the opposite. On the diagonal part, there is a matrix M which contains. Part, there is a matrix M which contains all the parameters of the theory. So, the masses of the Yukaba coupling of the fermions and also the component of the mixing matrix for neutrinos and for the Kabibo matrix. All the parameters except one, which is the Mayorana mass of the neutrino. So, we are in a model of the neutrino as a Mayorana mass. And this Mayorana mass is the only component which is on the off-diagonal part of this dirac operator. This is all motivated by the action of non-commutative geometry that I will not discuss here. We did not discuss here, but so we arrived to this description here, and it is important to note to stress that there is one only one parameter which is on this off-diagonal part. We will see just after a while. So, we've got here, we've got the fermion, the mass of the fermion. How do we generate the bosons? So, the bosons are produced with a so-called process, which is called a fluctuation of the metric, or it's a way of building a covalent Dirac operator. So, you substitute your operator. And Dirac operator, so you substitute your operator D with this operator D plus A plus G A G minus one, where J is this full structure that we have seen, and A is an element of the generalized one form which is given here. So it is a sum of an element of the algebra multiplied by a commutator of the Drag operator by an element of the opposite algebra. So there is a whole theory below that explain you why this operator, the covariant operator, should be like this. And by doing this, we can build a new spectral triple, okay, where the algebra and the Okay, where the algebra and the Hilbert space are the same, but the operator, the initial operator D, has been substituted with this operator DA, covariant operator. And if we do that for the spectral tuple of the standard model, so which is we call here, and we make this computation and we compute this A, and this A will mix the internal, the elements of the finite dimensional spectral triple with the element of the spectral triple of the manifold. And this is here that will come out, the bosons. So we will obtain this split. Obtain this A split in two parts, one part which is a one-form field with value in the Lie algebra of the unitary element of a finite-dimensional algebra. And this is just a complicated way to say that this is a gauge field. Okay, this is a one-form field with value in the Lie algebra of U of Lie algebra is exactly the definition, the mathematical definition of the local form of connection one form. And here, the U of AF gives you precisely the gauge work of the standard model, modulosome condition of unimodularity. So this is how we find back with this framework the gauge boson. With this framework, the gauge boson of the standard model. But there is an extra piece which is this gamma phi tensor H, where H is the scalar field on the manifold with value in the finite-dimensional algebra. And in the standard model, this is this part which will identify with the Higgs field. So this is really here that we see that the Higgs field comes out of the model exactly at the other boson as a gauge, as a connection one form, but the connection which lives in this non-commutative part of the geometry. More exactly, a connection which makes the finite-dimensional part which The finite dimensional part, which is non-commutative because it is matrix algebra, talk with the commutative part, which is the manifold. So, okay, that's also just to remind you, there is the spectral action. So, I will define the action, we take this formula here, where f is an approximation of the characteristic function of the interval 0, 1. So, basically, one is counting the eigenvalue of this operator, which are smaller than a given scale, lambda, and one send lambda to infinity. And so there is this etiquette expansion, and from here, what one Canal expansion and from here, what one finds back the boss-like algorithm of the standard model coupled with the Ashton impact action in a T-M signature, including solid sector. So, that's the framework for the standard model. So, how we now, why do we want to go beyond the standard model? So, there is this problem that here I've not said it, but since the Higgs boson is, let's say, depending on the other parameters of the theory, that its mass of the Higgs boson is no longer free. It's not a free parameter. Is no longer free, it's not a free parameter, can be computed. And so, for a long time, there was a prediction which was one around 170 GB. And so, this prediction was wrong because the Higgs is 125 GB. So, at this point, the idea was that the model was dead. But then it comes out that the people from particle physics explain that there is this metastability problem for the Higgs field, and that actually this problem could be solved if there exists another scalar field. And later on, in a paper, just after the discovery of the Higgs field, Shamsedin and Kohl noticed that. Field, Champsyden and Cole. Notice that if you remember this coefficient kappa L, which is the Mayo animals of the neutrino, it is the one which was in this part here, the only one that was in the off-diagonal part. So if it is a constant, okay, if we turn this constant into a field, so Kappa becomes the constant plus a field signal in the manifold, then and we conclude the action, then this is exactly, we obtain exactly the kind of field that particle physicist wants to stabilize the electronic vacuum. And in addition, since we are adding a new field, Addition, since we are adding a new field, we have a new parameter, and some CDM cons shows that they can quite naturally feed this parameter to make the computation of the mass of Linux field the correct one. Okay, so that was this field. Solved two problems. For practical physics, it's the kind of solution to make the vacuum, the electronic vacuum stable rather than metastable. And in non-commutative geometry, it saves the model because it tells you, okay, finally, the mass of the X, we can have the good one. The question is: why do you arbitrarily save? Why do you arbitrarily say that this constant becomes a field? Because what we have seen is that the fields are obtained from this process of fluctuation of the metric. This is here that in the operator D, there is only constant, but if you make this commutator here, this generalized one form, it's like if the constant becomes a field. But actually, this doesn't work for this kappa A. And why? Because this part of the Dirac operator, in which there is the Majorana mass of the neutrino, commutes with the algebra. So it is completely transparent. The algebra. So it is completely transparent to this process of fluctuation of the metric. So this is why this coefficient, this Majorana mass of the neutrino, did not produce a field, okay, following the rule of commutative geometry. So then it's a problem. You say, okay, if it does not produce a field following the rule that are here to produce bosonic field, why should we say that now arbitrarily we say it is a field? And so that was a kind of a problem. So to say it was a kind of logical problem, internal logical problem in the model. them in the model. There has been several proposals to make this field generate, to have this field generate in a natural way in the model. And the one I would like to present, the one that we got with Fedelizzi, Agostino de Vastato, and then later on also with Emmanuel Filacci, is to use a twisted spectral triple. So I will just make a very short mathematical parenthesis to explain you what is a twisted spectral triple. So the idea is you take exactly also this definition of a spectral triple, so algebra, hidden space. So, algebra equals space delac operator. But instead of asking that the commutator of D with an element of the algebra is bounded, one asks that the twisted commutator is bounded. And what is a twisted commutator? It is defined by you fix an automorphism of the algebra, and the twisted commutator is given by this formula here. Okay, so it's like a commutator, except that in the second term, you make dA minus rho of ad. So you act with your automorphism before after the minus sign. And your automorphism is fixed once for all. Sign okay, and your automorphism is fixed once for all. So, this has been introduced by Kohn and Moscovichi in a paper of 2008, and it was not at all not related at all with the standard model, slightly with physics, but not so much. They were dealing with purely mathematical problems because they wanted to develop spectral triple for a kind of fundamental algebra, which are the type 3 algebra. And for this kind of algebra, one cannot impose the boundedness of the commutator, but one needs to make this twisted commutator. And this was also relevant for. And this was also relevant for conformal transformation of the work operator. So there are lots of motivation, mathematical motivation. And this was this paper of Connamos Kobishi, they showed that by allowing you this new definition for the commutator, the bondedness of the commutator, the mathematical structure of non-commutative geometry was still here. Okay, so there are some on the index theory and stuff like that, and they show that that was an interesting generalization. So now, later on, what we have done with Later on, what we have done with what we show with Janilandi is that one can extend also all this framework of twisting spectral tuple to include the real structure. Okay, so this is not very difficult. We have a paper in which we show that we can adapt to the twisted case all the object structure. And you obtain in the same way that we have the covariant Dirac operator, which was D plus A plus GAG minus one. We have a twisted covariant Dirac operator, which has exactly the same kind of. Operator, which has exactly the same kind of formula, except that now a rho is an element of a twisted one form, so it is exactly the same formula as before, the one form, except that everywhere where you've got a commutator, you put a twisted commutator. Here, okay, you see that the twist is row, uh, row naught, because actually, this is a twist of the opposite algebra, but it's all it's all canonic. Once you've got an automorphism of the algebra, you can induce for a minute a canonical twist of the opposite. For a minute, a canonical twist of the opposite algebra rowfo, and you can define this twisted commutator. And we also show that there is a twisted version of the first order condition, which is exactly the same as the other condition, except that we have twisted the first commutator and we have twisted also the second commutator. So all the theory of fluctuation of the metric works very well, and we can make a twisted fluctuation of the metric. So why do I introduce that? So now I just will recall a little bit what brought us to this idea of twisting the spectral triple. Twisting the spectral triple of the standard model. The idea, the initial idea was by Fidelizi and Agassino de Vastato. And they were working on that when I arrived in Naples, and so I joined this project. And at the moment, we were not thinking about twists, but the idea was a bit different. The idea was to say, if you take the Hilbert space of the standard model, it is spinners multiplied by a finite-dimensional algebra. But now, if you decide, so the spinners are dimension four, we are on a four-dimensional manifold. And you can say, okay, we could mix if we put all Could mix, if we put all the degrees of freedom together, so the four degrees of freedom of the spinners and the 32 degrees of freedom of the finite dimensional Hilbert space, and we can say, okay, let's take all these degrees of freedom together. So we obtain an Hilbert space of dimension 128. And it turned out that if you look at the classification of the finite dimensional algebra, which are allowed in non-commutative geometry to describe the standard model, 128 was precisely the dimension required to represent a bigger algebra, not the one of the standard. Not a bigger algebra, not the one of the standard model, which is the smallest one. But if you look at the classification of Chansey, Linux Poin and Marco, there is, it's not the next one, but the next one precisely requires a library space of dimension 128. So this algebra, we call it the ground algebra. And then the idea that if we do that, if we work with this algebra, this would give us a way to generate this extra scalar field signal. Okay, because basically we increase the algebra. So when we make the fluctuation of the metric, we should obtain more. Make the fluctuation of the metric, we should obtain more field because we have more elements that play and that commute or that are not commute, and so we could generate this field. And so, the idea here, I will make it very short, but I would like to explain what happened. So, basically, you take this big algebra, which is made of quaternions, of complex numbers, of three by two matrices, and if you just focus on the complex sectors, okay, and you look how this big algebra acts on the finite dimensional hilbert space, and you divide the hilbert space. Space and you divide the helo space in two pieces: the particle one and the anti-particle one. Okay, and so if you look here, P of C is a representation in the standard model. So you've got a complex number and it acts on the Hilbert space of the particle Hilbert space and the anti-particle Hilbert space. And this I2 here means that it acts on the same way on the left and right component of spinals, the part of the finite of the commutative algebra, the I2 of MS. Okay, that's really at the very definition of. Really, at the very definition of the product of spectral freepo, that the algebra, the commutative algebra, should act on the same way on the left and right component of spinners. But now, since the idea was to mix the components, the degrees of freedom of spinners with the degrees of freedom of the finite dimensional algebra, we allow ourselves to act differently on the left and right component of spinners. And so we take, instead of taking one complex number, we take two complex numbers, one which is labeled by the right and the other by the left, so right and left component of spinners. The left, so right and left component of spinners, and on the particular subspace of the finite dimensional Hibbert space, we act differently on the right and left component of spinner. The first element of the complex number, the first complex number will act on the right component of spinners, and the second will act on the left spinner. But on the antiparticle, we act just with one complex number. So, why this? That would be a long story, but this was what we needed to generate this extra scalafene. And we try to make the Scara field and we try to make the more the slightest modification. And we observe that to obtain the scara field and just the scara field, we just need to allow ourselves to act differently on the left and right component of spinners only on the particle part of the piece space. And what happened that if we do this, now we keep the same Dirac operator, the standard model, but the commutator is no longer bounding. Okay, but actually what one obtained that if one suitably defined One suitably defined an automorphism of the algebra, then the twisted commutator is bounded. And what is this twist? The twist that we use in the paper with Sedeli and Agostino was just to exchange the two complex numbers, but only on the particle part of the Hilbert space. So this is the formula which is here. So you take your element, your complex number here, an element of C2, so two complex numbers, they act on the Hilbert space in this way. And your twist, you just switch the two which are here, C L and C L. Are here C L and C L, they become C L and C R. Okay, but you don't touch here, and that was the origin of all the problem in a way. And by doing this, we make the computation, we computed the twisted commutator, twisted fluctuation, and we obtained the sigma field. But now, if you look well, the problem that this element here, C L, C R, C R, is not obtained from C R, C L, C R by an automorphism of the algebra, and the algebra is C2. Because the automorphism with C2 is to exchange the two components, okay? Exchange the two components. Okay, so row of this is what I've written here. If you look now at this representation, P of an element of C2, P of C R C L C L, and you switch R with L. So now you want to represent P of C L C R. And this is automorphism of C2, an automorphism of C2, the only automorphism of C2 is to exchange the two components of C2. But if you look at this and you apply our definition, which is above, you will obtain C L, C R. C L, C R, C L. But we work with C L, C R, C R. We didn't change the one which is here. But if you apply the automorphism at the level of the algebra and not at the level of the representation, then it doesn't work. So this we did not notice immediately, but we noticed afterward that doing this, we can generate the extra field, but what we are doing in a way is an automorphism of the represented algebra. This is why here I have written a row. Have written row in front of pi here, row in front of the representation, but you cannot view that as a p of rho of something. Okay, this doesn't work because there is this problem. Actually, you could view it, but it would be an automorphism of C3, not of C2, because you have an automorphism which allows you to go from R L R to L R R. And so, if you embed this into C3, you can lose that, but we don't want, we didn't want to do that. So, that was a point. Then, what we did with Jovanir Andy is to say, okay, maybe. With Giovanni Andy, is to say, okay, maybe there is a more systematic way, forget about the standard model, and there is a more systematic way to twist a spectral triple. And the idea that if we start from a spectral triple, and the idea is to say we keep the Hilbert space of the Dragon operator untouched, because this is the idea to keep the fermionic sector of the theory untouched. But we want to build a twisted spectral triple from the spectrum, from the non-twisted spectral triple. And the only freedom that we have is to play with the algebra. We can show in the paper, we show that we can play with the representation of the algebra, but it's. We can play with the representation of the algebra, but it's not enough. And the minimal thing that one has to do is to play with the algebra. And the most simple thing that one can do is to double the algebra. So you multiply your algebra by C2. And why does it work? Because there is a grading. Since you've got a grading, actually, the grading commutes with the algebra. So the grading tells you that on your Hilbert space, actually, you have two independent representations of the algebra. And see, if you've got two independent representations of the algebra, you can represent two copy, two distinct copies of the algebra. One on the first eigen space of the break. One on the first eigen space of the grading, and the other one on the second eigen space of the grading. So, this is exactly what we did. And here we make the full theory, it works very well in full generality. It's great, it's nice, and the rich structure works well. But then there was a problem that if we apply this construction to the standard model, it works well, but it does not generate the extra field. So, the really nice mathematical framework, which allows you to twist, let's say, a spectral people, works well, but does not give you the extra field. Works well, but does not give you the extra field. And if you want the extra field, you have to make what we have done is make these things here, which is not really a twist. It is a kind of twist of the representative algebra, which is not the thing. We want to act with the algebra before. We want to act with the automorphism before representing it. So here there was this kind of problem. And so basically, then this is a work that we're still finishing with manually filled. Actually, the idea is to say, okay, maybe we can repeat the construction without using the grading, but just use an operator which has all the properties of. Use an operator which has all the properties of the grading, so the property which are here, except that we don't ask any relation between this operator Tf and the Dirac operator. So this is not a grading, but this property here that I have stressed are exactly the one that we want to have two representation of the algebra. If you've got an operator self-adjoint with square to the identity and which commute with the algebra, then, and this is operator, it's not a multiplier of the identity, you've got an eigen space minus one, an eigen plus one, and you've got enough space to represent two copies of the. And you've got enough space to implement two copies of the algebra. But again, we do that. And what this result is still not totally finished. But what happened is that even if we do that, if we allow ourselves to use an operator which is not a grading, the first order condition for the standard model will not be satisfied. Whereas, if we make this process for the grading, the first order condition was satisfied. I mean, if we want to generate the extra scatter field, we have to violate the first order condition. And so at this point, it is. And so at this point, it's not so terrible, but it's very pity from my point of view. Because there is a way to go out is to remove the twisted first-order condition and just following what Cohn and Fan Sund and Chamsedin has done for the spectral triple. Because this I did not say, but I said that there were several proposals to justify how to make this new field sigma came out from the model. And one was to remove the first order condition. So this is what I've done. This is what I've done. So, Connor, push the connection CD. And they show in this way that there was a nice obtained field. And our role here was to say, okay, but we can obtain the field preserving the first order condition, maybe in a twisted version, but we still have it. Actually, no, we cannot. We have also to remove the first order condition. So in a paper that we have made with Jacopo-San Kating, we showed that we can really follow all the paper of the Fan-Fuel form, Shamsidin, and Colm in the twisted case. So we can make twisted fluctuations without the first order condition. All the structure, all the results. Condition. All the structure, all the results that Colin and the other obtain, we obtain the same with the twist when it's debated. And in this way, we are back and we obtain our scala field. So, okay, from this point of view, one can say, so what is the interest of the twist? If at the end of the day, you have to also to remove the twisted first order condition, then just follow what Kohn and the other have done and do not go to the twist case because it's just more complicated. The fact that there is an added value to the twist, which is another Value to the twist, which is another field which comes out, which is this field of one form, and that is the one I would like to explain now. So, and this field is nice because it has relation to two very interesting aspects. First, the transition from the T giant to Bohr's and signature and also the torsion. So, before doing that, I will just make another brief mathematical parenthesis, just to talk about this twist inner product. So, very generally, if you've got So very generally, if you've got a twisted spectral triple, so you've got an algebra with a chosen automorphism which acts on the Hilbert space and the operator D, if this automorphism extends to an inner automorphism of the full algebra of bounded operator on your Gilbert space, it's not always the case. I mean, you can have an automorphism of the algebra, the algebra act on the Gilbert space, but nobody says that this automorphism could apply to elements of B of H which are not a representative element of the algebra. But it may happen that it is. Algebra, but it may happen that it is the case. And if it is, if this automorphism extends to an inner automorphism of B of H, so it can be written in this way: the action of this automorphism now on any element of a B of H is given by the conjugate action of some unitary. Okay, that's the definition of an inner automorphism. Then, if you've got this, you can define a new product on the Hilbert space, what we call the raw inner product or the twisted product. And simply, what you do, you take your initial product, which is this one here on the right, okay, this bracket. Here on the right, okay, this bracket, and you put the this unitary R in the middle, and this gives you a new product. Okay, and this new product, uh, basically, what is the notion of adjoint operator for this new product? It is the one which is written here. So, it is the adjoint of the automorphism of your operator. So, it is a way to define a new definition of adjoint. So, why do I say that? Because if you go back to the smallest, to the simplest example, so a manifold, you just take the spectral tuple of a manifold, so a smooth function on the manifold. Manifold, so a smooth function in the manifold which acts on the square integral with spinners, and the Dirac operator is just this slash the usual Dirac operator. We are in the Riemannian manifold, even dimension, and we make this process that we have defined with Gianni Randy. So we double the algebra, we multiply by C2, but we act on the same input space, but differently on the left and right component of spinners, and we keep the same Dirac operator. And the twist is just the switch. So an element of Cm tensor C2 is two functions, F and J. C2 is two functions, f and j, and the automorphism is just switch f and j to g and f. And the representation is given here. So f acts on the left component of spinner, j acts on the right component of spinner. And if you compute, sorry, if you look at this automorphism, you can extend it to an automorphism of b of h, and it is in use by the gamma zero matrix. Actually, then we just we notice this later, it is induced by whatever action conjugate action. By whatever action, conjugate action of one single gamma matrix. It can be gamma zero, it can be gamma one, or it can even be an even odd number of product of odd number of gamma matrices. But for the moment, just say that a way to produce this twitch of two elements is to act R the inner the by gamma zero. And if you do that, then the twisted product that we have defined in the slide before is actually exactly the inner product for spinners but on Lorentzian signature, which is not uh Which is not Hilbert's product, it's a time product. But it was quite surprising to say that by doing a twist, which was not at all related to this problem between Riemannian and Lorentzian, by doing a twist, there is a natural product associated to a twist. And in the simplest case of the manifold, this twisted product is exactly the product on the Lorentzian for spinners on Lorentzian manifold. Although we started from the Riemann stuff, okay. And now, more even more interesting, if you compute this twisted fluctuation of This twisted fluctuation of the Dual Copper. It is well known that for usual spectral triple, if you just fluctuate the commutative spectral triple of a manifold, there is no fluctuation. The time cancels. This is clearly explained in a paper of in a solid. I've got a problem with my computer. Issue he took in the paper of gravity coupled with matter on the foundation of non-commutative geometry. He stressed this. Geometry is stressed this point that if you make a fluctuation of just this slash, the term which is given by A will cancel with the term which is given by GAG minus one. And so just the footer recognition does not fluctuate, but it twists fluctuates. If we are in chaotime zero or four, there is a non-zero self-adjunct fluctuation, which is given by this term here. Okay, and this is a novelty with respect to the non-twisted case. And now, so we notice it in a paper with against the delay. Again, Fedelet, Agostino, and Arsene Francworth. And when I presented this some years ago in Fraco, André Citar said, this is a torsion, this is a torsion. And I say, well, okay, I don't know. And now I have to make full justice to him. Yes, actually, he was right, of course, this is a torsion. And how do you see that? Actually, this term, E F mu, gamma mu, gamma phi, with playing with all the property of the gamma matrices and all that stuff, you can rewrite it in this way. Okay, so here I Okay, so here I define d slash is minus e gamma mu, and there is d mu plus omega mu where omega mu is in connection. So this part here that I underline is just the d slash. And you can rewrite the f mu gamma mu gamma phi in this way here. So minus e gamma mu is in factor and the f mu gamma phi in this way, where r mu nu rho, so if you lower the index with the matrix, is a totally screw symmetric tensor. Tensor and which is exactly this is a torsion. Okay, this is the tensor associated to a torsion. And actually, this is a torsion which is metric and which has the same geodesic as the Levitic-Beta connection because it has this property of being totally scroll symmetric. So what we obtain that if we make a twisted fluctuation of the Riemannian Dirac operator of a twisted spectrum of football, we obtain a torsion. What we have actually is a torsion. This time what seems mysterious to us is nothing but a torsion in the in this main connection. Torsion in the spin connection. So, okay, that's an interpretation. But there was another interpretation because the torsion is one thing, it's purely geometric, but there was this other idea that we have seen that the inner, the twisted inner product is related to the Lorentzian signature. So we wanted to explore a bit more of this idea of Lorentzian signature because, okay, to be able to build a product which is a product of Lorentzian signature is nice, but okay, what do we do with that? And the idea was to say, here the point of view is a bit. To say here, the point of view is a bit different. The idea is not to build a spectral triple, Lorentzian spectral triple, but is to say at the end of the day, what we really want is to have the action in Lorentzian signature. Maybe we don't really care that much to have a twist Lorentzian spectral triple. What we would like is to obtain the action, the Einstein limit action with the Lorentzian signature. And so we try to follow up this way and say, okay, we don't try to build the Lorentzian spectral triple because we already start with something Riemannian and we twist something Riemannian. But it seems that there is. With some single Riemannian, but it seems that there is something Lorenzen which tries to arrive. And the way to have it more clearly is through the action, but unfortunately, not the spectral action, but the fermionic action. So we like to define the fermionic action for a twisted spectral triple. So it looks a bit, I mean, John has already shown some formula for the fermionic action, which are quite the same kind. So we start with a 3C spectral triple with an automorphism. twisted spectral triple with an automorphism and we define this action so s of f means fermionic action associated to the covariant twisted covariant era cooperator so the formula here is the notation are a bit complicated but this strange single i i don't know how to say it actually is just a bilinear form which is given here so it is exactly the same form that john has shown we put the j okay we act with an element of the hibbot space and we take the inner product with an element of the other space and another element of the hilt space we put the operator We put the operator, covariant operator, in the middle, and we take our twisted product. So we put the matrix R in the middle. Okay, so this is our twisted product. And the till is just to say that for the fermionic action, we take the Grassmann variables associated to this. So you take, this is the Billinar form, and if you want the fermionic action, you have to apply this Billinar form to the Grassmann variables. So if you look at the non-twisted case, the fermionic action is the same, but without the R. Is the same but without the R. Okay, here we put the R because we are in the twisted case and we want our action to be invariant under a twisted gauge transformation. And to have this, we need to put the twisted product, so to put the matrix R. And there is another thing when you make the computation of the thermodynamic action in non-computative geometry. Actually, one does not compute these things for any kind of element of the Hilbert space, but one restricts to a given precise element of the Hilbert space. And in the case of the usual spectral triple, The usual spectral triple, you take the plus one eigenspace of the grading, and the justification is to say that this element has a well-defined chirality. There is the same chirality as an element of the spinners, L2 of MS, or as an element of the finite dimensional algebra. Here, we cannot do that. If we work with, if we take this eigen space, it doesn't work. What we have to do is to take the eigenspace of the matrix that implements the twist. And we have to do that. The twist, and we have to do that in order that this form here is v linear because already it has uh oh sorry that it is symmetric, that is anti-symmetric. Okay, this form has to be anti-symmetric to have the correct action since we are using Russian variables and to have it anti-symmetric since there is this R and the D in the middle, so there is all this commutation property, we have to restrict to the plus one eigenspace of the unitary that implements the automorphism. And so, this is an action which satisfies all the mathematical property. Now, does it make sense? Now, does it make sense? Because the fact that we are restricting, for instance, to this eigen space, what does it mean? I mean, okay. So we try to compute this and we compute it again for the simplest case, the twist of the manifold. So again, the algebra of the manifold multiplied by C2, which acts on the usual spinners, always Riemannian, and the Dirac operator, the twist is the switch. We make the twisting fluctuation that we have shown before, and we compute this fermionic action. And what you obtain in dimension 4 is this formula here, which is a bit complicated, but what is interesting, you see. But what is interesting, you see that there is three derivatives, let's say spatial derivative, and one that disappears. The derivation, which corresponds to the gamma-zero matrix, and the gamma-zero matrix is the one that we have chosen to implement the twist, is no longer here, and instead we've got the component of the twisted fluctuation. We've got the F mu here, and the F0 is occurring here. So the D0 derivative is substituted with the component F0 of the fluctuation. So now if you compare this to the Valagram. Compare this to the Valagrangian, which is given here, you see that actually it's quite close. The fact that the D0 has disappeared and is substituted by F0, it's not a problem. You can just say, well, if I assume that my spinners are this form here, that is exponential of IT F0 plus something else, when I apply D0, there is a F0 that will go out. And so this is what I will update here. But here there is a problem that you cannot identify. If on the right hand side of the Weil Lagrangian, you've got C L. Side of the Villa granger, you've got C L. So here we would like to identify C L with our C tib here, but then we cannot identify C L diag with this things here, which is on the left, because there is a sigma 2 matrix here, which prevents from basis. So it's okay, not a problem. We can double. Here, let me interrupt. You have five minutes, including questions. Including questions. Okay, I've almost finished it. So if you take now the double of a manifold, so you double your manifold and you twist it. So basically, you multiply your manifold. You twist it. So basically, you multiply your manifold by c to the four, okay. And you make the whole stuff, and you compute the things, blah, blah, blah. And here you arrive to the fermionic action, which has this form here. And now you can identify here with the Vi-Lagrangian, because you have more degrees of freedom. And so you can tell the element on the right, we identify it to psi L in the Vi-Lagrangian, and the element of the left, we identify it to psi Wagg. And so there is no problem. But see, so what I forgot to say, when I said the Vi Lagrangian, even before, this is a Lorentzian signature. The Lorentzian signature. Okay, and so this is a nice result that the twisted harmonic action for a twisted double Riemannian manifold actually describes the plan wave solution of the Weyl equation in Lorentzian signature. Okay, and we can extend this and if you we apply this construction to the spectral triple of electrodynamics that have been proposed by Franz Hussweckham, Van Lungen and the two of them. So here, this is the same algebra which is double on the Hibbot space and you add the mass term to the And the hilt space, and you add the mass term to the Dirac operator. And if we compute again the fermionic action, we obtain the Dirac action in Lorentzian signature. So it is quite funny that by starting from something Riemannian, by making a twist, we obtain something Lorentzian through the fermionic action. So again, we don't claim that we don't have a Laurentian spectral triple. Our Dirac operator is not a Laurentian spectral triple. It is a Riemannian spectral triple. We made a fluctuation, so we gotta something a bit weird. And if we compute this, we find through our fermionic action, we find something. Through our thermodynamic action, we find something which is formally the action here, the formula is sorry, yeah, this formula here coincides with the Lorentzian action. So just to conclude. So actually the initial motivation of all this twisted stuff was to generate the extra scala film. But actually this is no longer the most interesting point because anyway we need to remove the twisted first other condition. What is interesting is other field. These other fields which come from the preceding fluctuation. And this other field, it has two interpretations. In the simplest case of a manifold, it is a torsion in the Riemannian spin connection. And if we study this field through the fermionic action, we find that at least in the example of errodynamic, it allows us to find a Lorentzian fermionic action. So there are some similar results that seem to hold for the standard models. This is a paper which are we are writing for a long time with Manueli Filacci, which hopefully will be soon finished. Hopefully, it will be soon finished. And another question also: all this is through the fermionic action. For the spectral action, it was a kind of question mark: how to define the spectral action for twisted spectral triple. But if now we go back to the interpretation of this field as a torsion, then you can say, okay, the spectral action for a twisted spectral triple is just the usual action for spectral triple, non-twisted, but with the torsion. And actually, there are some works that has been done on this. On this, I mean by these people here, okay, we have studied and computed what happened to the spectral action, Riemannian spectral action with a torsion term. This is also something that we are exploring. And at the end, the question that remains to me that I don't know, maybe some people know it very well and I'm just ignorant, but here what it said that there is a relation between the torsion in a Riemannian signature and somehow kind of free rotation. And I don't know if anybody has I know if anybody has any knowledge of why the torsion in Riemannian signature could be related to a transition to Bohr and signature, I would be very interested to see it because here we really just obtain it like this. I mean, it was not at all the initial idea, but this is a matter of fact. Okay, I'm just here, some reference for who wants. Okay, thank you for that. Thank you very much. We have one minute for questions. Any questions from the room? I'm sorry, it's a very hard day with many talks. And if we keep five minutes later for every talk, we'll finish midnight. So is there... You can make a quick question, Fedele. Just one question, but make it so. More than a question is a comment. Clearly, things are somehow there are connections between this structure and but Structure and but the physics now are there consequences for this extra boson and so the verifications of the model are there consequences Pierre that now LHC is starting again that we are promising on LHC I don't know I mean for this for this new scalar field uh this okay I I wouldn't know I mean because at least in the model of connecting the mass is very high so I don't Model of cone, I think the mass is very high, so I don't think there are options to view it now, but I'm not sure about that. But what maybe might be interesting that actually this torsion, I mean, I thought for a long time that torsion has to be put to zero and there was no physical effect of torsion, but exploring a bit the literature, it seemed like actually it is not true. I mean, that there is a possible coupling of the torsion with spin or degrees of freedom. So, not in pure GR, the torsion, if the torsion has the same geodesical GR, we don't see it. But if we take See it, but if we take the quantum matter in fair space-time, then it is not clear at all that the torsion is something that cannot be seen. I mean, there are lots of work on that that I'm just starting to study, so maybe I cannot say more, but there is a full, I mean, no community which are working on this model of general relativity with torsion. I mean, we also have this teletoral gravity, but yeah, I'm not sure because they put the curvature to zero. But if I understand well, but if we put torsion and curvature both non-to-zero, it seems that it's not excluded. It seems that it's not excluded. I mean, there is no physics, as far as I know, there is no any theoretical, even experimental stuff that tells us that the torsion should be zero in GR. It's hard to see, but apparently it's not impossible. So maybe that's the kind of things that I would like to explore for phenomenology, so to say. Okay, let us thank Pierre again and move to the next talk.
