Health Ontario. And I'll just say one thing, just because it came up yesterday, I didn't even remember that I met Kevin in person 10 plus years ago because we've had so many conversations over Zoom. And that's true for many of you. It's really nice to be here. So welcome, Kevin, and I'll let you say more about yourself. So this is a pretty practical talk. It's a talk that has kind of emerged from some of the work. Of emerged from some of the work that I've done looking at factors influencing the size of nursing home outbreaks in the course of the pandemic. This was definitely one of the heavier lifts, though, in terms of projects that I've done, in part because of maybe my mathematical incompetence or because of the complexity of delving into the outbreaks. Because, as epidemiologists and as Epidemiologists, and as we tend to try to shy away a little bit from dynamic modeling, everything gets a little bit more complicated for our toolkit. So I'll just explain what I've done here and how I've approached this. So without further ado, some background on COVID, you don't necessarily need to know much about this because you all know everything about this, I'm sure. So, nursing homes were really severely impacted by COVID. Case fatality rates in long-term care were extremely high because of advanced age of the population in there, homophobic burden. Also, because oftentimes there's a reluctance to transfer people to hospital because that's not part of the goals of care of many residents of long-term care homes. And so at an early stage of the pandemic, this was before in kind of the first wave, deaths in long-term care represented 81% of COVID deaths in Canada and a high percentage in the United States as well. Nursing home residents represent actually less than 1% of these jurisdictions. Of these jurisdictions were respective populations. So the relative burden was extremely high. This is just a graph showing Canada compared to the rest of the world. Part of the reason for this is that Canada had very low incidence and mortality related to COVID outside of long-term care in that first wave. So since then, I mean, we've learned a lot about nursing home. lot about nursing home COVID outbreaks. And a lot of this actually completely applies to influenza and other respiratory infections as well. So we can think about factors associated with the introduction of infection and factors associated with transmission within facilities. So we've learned a lot about these structural factors like size and profit size. Like size and profit status of long-term care homes. For-profit long-term care homes tended to have larger outbreaks, largely because of staffing practices and lower levels of staffing for the most part. That meant it was more difficult to follow. Infection control procedures. Also, workforce networks kind of contributed to that. We've looked at some dynamic factors. We've looked at some dynamic factors like how to relate regional incidents to outbreak timing and severity. So, outbreaks in nursing homes tend to occur with a certain lag relative to community incidents. Part of the, oftentimes, community incidence is poorly captured and has been captured with variable levels of precision. But we've been able to kind of show these nice graphs that kind of relate. Graphs that kind of relate the timing of community incidents with the timing of nursing home outbreaks. In terms of looking at factors related to transmission within facilities, some colleagues of mine and I have looked at crowding as a factor. So, looking at how many in long-term care homes in Ontario, at least, there's a wide variety of crowding and by Crowding, and by crowding we mean something very specific, which is the number of residents in each bedroom. So there's a lot of shared bedrooms in long-term care. And this has actually led to some changes in kind of the construction of long-term care homes in Ontario. There's a ban on ward rooms. They're still allowing two-bed rooms to be constructed, but that's also being phased out. So the standard moving forward is going to be in one person, one room, one room per person in long-term care. But we haven't really done that much work looking at how outbreaks actually unfold in long-term care. And in part, at least in the applied health literature, I should say. I think there's a lot of dynamic modeling studies. Of dynamic modeling studies. What we get a lot of in the public health literature and in the medical literature are studies of single outbreaks. You know, there are studies that will inevitably have an epidemic curve that looks like this, where you'll point out kind of when the outbreak was declared and the number of confirmed cases per day. And what I wanted to do with this study was. What I wanted to do with this study was to come up with a more systematic way of thinking about the evolution of outbreaks. In particular, anchoring our thinking on the first time that you actually identify an outbreak, the timing of the outbreak identification. So, when you get that first positive test relating to a long-term care home outbreak back, what is your understanding of the outbreak? What is your understanding of the outbreak at that point in time? So, I'll kind of go into depth. So, we wanted to look at how delays in nursing home outbreak identification were associated with studies based on data from prior to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations. So it's the first wave along with part of the second wave. At some point later in the fall of 2020, we began rolling out COVID vaccines. 2020, we began rolling out COVID vaccines in long-term care staff and then subsequently in long-term care residents. So, we're looking at Ontario, which has 623 long-term care homes, and we've looked at SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. And so the way we've categorized our outbreaks is just based on observed cases throughout time and how, and we've lumped outbreaks together. And we've lumped outbreaks together based on 14-day periods with no cases. We consider that to be the end of an outbreak, basically, when there's a period with no incident cases for 14 days. And then, so each long-term care home could have potentially more than one outbreak. And then our main exposure, our covariant of interest, was looking at when the timing of outbreak identification. And so the way we classified this was based on how many. This was based on how many resident days of infection pressure were present. So we considered a resident in a long-term care home to be infectious from a period two days before their symptom onset to eight days afterwards. This is kind of what we know about COVID-19 infection for the most part. So that was static. We didn't try to vary that in any way. And then we also ignored, or I wouldn't say that we ignored, but we didn't actually. But we didn't actually allow staff-identified cases, because we had data on staff-identified cases in these long-term care homes. We didn't allow them to contribute to infection pressure. And this is partly kind of like a trick, because in theory those staff would actually contribute to infection pressure. But when working with messy observational data, you have to realize that in the data, Realize that, in the absence of any identified staff infection pressure in a long-term care home, that doesn't mean that there weren't staff that were infected. That means that there were staff that were infected that were never identified, because there's always going to be staff cases in the course of an outbreak in this time period, basically, because that's how COVID was being introduced into the long-term care homes. So, this was our somewhat So this was our somewhat outbreak, our early and late outbreak infection pressure based definition. The definition kind of was inspired a little bit by concepts in infectious disease epidemiology, but also in the ecology literature they call this propagule pressure actually. So it's how many people, how many person days of infection pressure have been, are present on the day of Are present on the day that the outbreak was identified. And then we've now broken up our outbreak. We've broken it up from the date of identification and cases that occurred before that date and then into a period subsequent to that date. And so our outcome, what we're studying is the incidents after that outbreak identification date. So we've split up our time period. Time period. And then we have a number of different covariates relating to facilities. So, characteristics of residents, characteristics of the facility itself, like the size, profit status, the crowding index, and whether there had already been prior outbreaks in that long-term care home, and then a community SARS-CoV-2 incidents in the prior couple in the prior two weeks. And so, we've just analyzed this with logistic regression. So, to kind of solidify these ideas, so we have this index period, which is the period before the outbreak starts, and then a follow-up period, which is the period afterwards. We've focused in on the first 30 days after, but I've also shown some results based on a 14-day period and some results based on follow-up until the end of the outbreak. And so, here's an example. And so here's an example under Pullet B, we have an example of an outbreak that's identified early. So that's an outbreak that identified amongst staff members alone before any resident case had their symptom onset. And so we considered any outbreak where that was identified prior to any actual resident case to be identified. Resident case to be identified early. Any outbreaks identified when there were infectious residents already present and after their symptom onset were generally considered late. So these little black squares represent the infection pressure contributed by a resident in a long-term care home. And so you can see at the time that this outbreak is declared, there's only a single Outbreak has declared that there's only a single resident case, and they were identified on three days after their symptom onset. And so you could count up, I guess, six days of infection pressure in this outbreak. So we looked at kind of comparisons of homes and outbreaks that are identified early and identified late. Early and identified late. In general, there were a few different differences in terms of homes. Outbreaks identified in the second wave in Ontario tended to be identified substantially earlier than in the first wave, largely because policies around staff testing had changed and capacity to test had changed in the second wave. Wave. We didn't, there were small differences in terms of the crowding index. So homes that were more crowded tended to identify outbreaks later. You could imagine that homes that are like in more crowded homes, outbreaks tend to take off a little bit faster. And then I'm looking. And then I'm looking at profit status, and yeah, there were slight differences in terms of profit status. So in private for-profit homes, outbreaks tended to be identified a little bit later. So 30.4% or I guess private for-profit homes were more represented in outbreaks identified later. In outbreaks identified late. So, overall, outbreaks identified late had a lot more SARS-CoV-2 infections. On average, 10.3% of residents were infected in an outbreak identified late compared to 3.3% of residents in outbreaks identified. Of residents in outbreaks identified early. And there were similar patterns in terms of mortality as well, where mortality was much higher in outbreaks identified late compared to outbreaks identified early. When you look at outbreak, the overall incidence in Over the course of infection, so that's secondary cases as a percentage of at-risk residents as a function of infection pressure. You can see these are the outbreaks that we identified early, and these are the outbreaks we identified late. You can see outbreaks identified in the upper ranges of infection pressure had much, much higher infection numbers, proportions of cases. Uh numbers, proportions of cases, or portions of residents infected, and uh uh infection and mortality. I've put like an odds ratio per one point increase in infection pressure, but the point being that infection pressure kind of scales pretty linearly with the overall incidence of an outbreak. And I've i in this graph, we've for i in all of our analyses we truncated infection pressure at twenty-five just for plotting purposes and whatnot. Just for plotting purposes and whatever, and not to overextrapolate. So we looked at the incidence of secondary infection as a function of late identified outbreaks. And we had unadjusted analyses, so that's what I was just showing. We adjusted for all these factors, and there was still a strong association between both the binary late versus early. The binary late versus early and the continuous measure of infection pressure. Those are all odds ratios. We also tried to measure what portion of cases would have been preventable during the first and second wave if we had identified all of our outbreaks early as opposed to late. Seemed like Like in the first wave, around 30% of cases and deaths could have been averted with early outbreak identification. And in the second wave, that dropped to around 25%. So there were some improvements in outbreak identification that probably led to some benefits. So, how am I doing for time? We have five seven. For time, we have five seven minutes left. Okay, so basically, you know, this work relates to the role of testing in reducing evidence. So, there's been some nice empirical studies that have come out recently that show that nursing homes that tested more frequently tended to have lower SARS-CoV-2 incidents. And so, this kind of explains a little bit of that mechanism. A little bit of that mechanism where you'll be able to catch outbreaks at this earlier stage, and presumably the outbreak will evolve to be less big. I think that this type of infection pressure metric actually has a lot of uses practically in terms of doing surveillance. So, you can think about it being useful in real time to assist with decision making, so, thinking about resources needed. Thinking about resources needed in the midst of an outbreak. So, whether that's antivirals or the required space for cohorting patients, it can be used for tracking performance of long-term care homes in terms of case identification. And then it can be used to assess the impacts of interventions. Just a few strengths and limitations. Few strengths and limitations and strengths. So the study was really prior to in a period prior to vaccines and the emergence of Omicron. The findings might not translate perfectly to the current period. I think that also represents a strength because we need to think about future pandemics when we may not actually have vaccines that are highly effective. Vaccines that are highly effective. We didn't have any data on testing rates. We didn't really integrate an explicit dynamic model. And we couldn't really figure out a way to integrate the rule of infection pressure or staff-related infection pressure just because of that issue related to case identification. And that's also. And so that's all. So, we're trying to kind of look at these measures more dynamically. We're also doing somewhat related work looking at the role of sick leave policies and how those might drive testing rates with US data. And I'd just like to acknowledge all the people involved in this work: people from PHO, a large number of Ontario IPAC experts, and some science table full of people.
