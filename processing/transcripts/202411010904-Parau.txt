I'm gonna talk about something that probably most of you have seen already in various talks, but uh there's a few things don't despair. I'm gonna try to survey various results in the last, I don't know, 10 years, 20 years, I don't know, 15, 20 years in the heart of astricat waves, normally at once, I should say, and other wave interaction, other wave-wise interaction. So the last bit is. Wave-wise interaction. So the last bit is sort of new issue. So we'll see some stuff in 2D, 3D, and even a couple of slides of internal waves under ice. And then these waves in marginalized zone, like waves-iCE interaction. I have a long list of collaborative thanks for most of the results. Starting with Redridge when I was a PhD, and then continued many people, and the list is growing, including people from the room here. Is growing, including people from the room here. Rafa and Mark and War. So, kind of motivation. So, in 1997, I guess, when I was PhD, so Frederick gave me some paper about ice, waves under ice. And I started looking at these things to try to understand what sort of waves propagate under ice. So, the motivation is that many people use. The motivation is that many people use the ice, the floating ice, as a road or as a runway for airplanes. And when they move on the ice, they create some waves. Ice behave as an elastic within certain parameters. And has the names hydroelastic waves or flexible gravity waves. So I keep changing between the two. So I probably. So uh you're probably familiar if you if you watch the story channel uh the extension series about this stuff. So um uh okay uh they don't particularly look at the waves, but they look at trucks moving in the north of Canada. And they see some cracks in the ice as well, so that's uh yeah, that's pretty neat stuff. And uh it's all like two months so you can go uh in north of Canada with with the truckers. And that's a so called T B two control to Winter Road. Uh usually end of uh January until end of March. January until the end of March and quite a lot of transportation of food and stuff to the north and then whatever golden but there to the south. And 85%, I mean it's easier to build whales on roads on ice than actually proper roads. So 85% of this stuff is over the lake ice. Again, if you want to write a movie about these things, it's kind of try to again. Try to again fight fast. Some people are thinking that some way is critical along this isoloid and they break and stuff. So with all the satellites those days you can actually measure the displacement. So let's say there are tracks going north and south. You probably see the one going north, I think, maybe one, two, three, which are sort of lotterized patterns only. And then going south, you have a bigger sort of patterns of. Sort of patterns of waves created by the tracks like you have a so there's some people from Canada who look at this stuff and then try to look at the theory how to explain the sort of waves. So again, waves. We're talking about here the two centimeters and stuff. So it depends on how thick is the ice. And yeah, the ice will break at some point. So we'll see some results about those ones in the talk. Sometimes ice breaks, so that's people try to avoid this kind of stuff. That's why I look at when it's safe to drive on ice, so that they measure the ice many times during the winter and then say, okay, you know, it's safe and sometimes things are not going well. So they lose one truck every year, I don't know how many years. And sometimes you want the opposite, you want actually to break the ice. So in many places, the ice can damage structures around the lakes. Damage structures around the lakes and the rivers. So, you want to fly this sort of ice-cushion vehicle to break it. And you want to try to create the largest possible waves. So, when you drive on truck, you want to avoid these largest waves, and sometimes you want to create the largest waves. And you can spend your time in Estonia going on the sea ice, driving on ice. And the funny thing is that they recommend to go 25 kilometers or between 40 and 70. So, I don't exactly know how you're going to. I don't exactly know how it goes from 25 to 40 if it cannot, but that's what they say. So, and they actually want to, yeah, there's some resonance waves that can break lights. That's the point, some talk waves. You'll see a bit later what this resonance is. Okay, so apart from more of trucks and cars and so on, sometimes you can have a landslide-durated so-called tsunami under ice. And so, that's here on top of the picture, there is some sort of landslide, and they're creating waves in a And they created waves in a Canadian lake. And there are pretty big waves with the ice flow. And at some point, they break. So, what you see here actually is the result of when the waves are a bit too big and then actually break the ice. So, you see the patterns of breaking. But you see clearly the patterns of waves going from this place in one direction. And you see sort of like refraction and so on by various islands. So. So, okay, let's stop the end of the nice pictures. There are a lot of experiments or observations of moving things on ice. So, this is just some of them cited. Military, non-military, and so on. So, the best one I like is the one done by Takizawa in the Lake Saroma. When he moved, he was driving an ice skidoo. An ice skiddo. The ice is relatively thin there, like 17 centimeters. The lake is pretty shallow, so I was this year there, so actually I have experience of eating oysters on lakes a lot. So what he was doing, he was driving ice skito with a constant speed, and they measure with various patterns in various directions, and this is just along the track. Directions and this is just along the track of the ice skido. And he found out that obviously, when you stationary, you're almost stationary, you just have a small depression around the road. Then you see some rims appearing in front and behind when you go faster. Then you see some waves, clear waves behind, and then later in front. So you have two trains of waves and the complicated local patterns. And then later on, some of the waves disappear, the one behind. And again, you can blow. Behind. And again, you can plot the maximum depth behind the load or whatever, around the load. And as you can see, there is a sort of critical speed. In this case, it's only six point something meter per second. But that's corresponding to the speed that the people on the SOAR say they shouldn't drive. So there is a sort of resonance speed which if you want to be safe, you should avoid, or if you want to break dice, you should drive avoid that that sort of speed. So that's So uh that's uh uh the experiment in elect electron. So again uh that's me uh this temporary driving ice ski. Don't start with the ice just to thick these things. It's like 40 centimeters, so you could not observe too many uh uh waves, but actually you just want to drive the things on the ice. So and actually thanks uh Tatayama and Takuji for taking me there. Um so that's uh the sketch of the problem. So we have uh some fluid or is it incompressible like in the room people don't uh Like in this room, people don't press in this stuff. The question is: what do we have on top? So, we have some sort of plate which you can assume elastic for our problems or viscoelastic for other things and so on. So, there are a variety of models for the eyes. So, having this interpretation rotational and so on, fluid, you can introduce the rest potential. So, this is 2D, but 3D is more or less the same. And you have Laplacian equation, you have the And you have Laplacian equation, you have the classical kinematic conditions, dynamic conditions which have a new term here, the pressure, which is due to this elastic plate. If you assume it's elastic. And then it depends a bit on various models. So the first one we call the Kirkov Love model. So D is the bending modulus. Tells you how bending is the ice. And you can measure it. So sometimes you put a second derivative of the curvature on x. On X, it's sort of leading order approximation for this Kirkovlov theory. You assume that the ice is thin, the thickness is constant. If you have normals on the middle of the ice plate, they stay normal after the deformation and so on. A more sort of mathematically coherent model is the one derived by Plonikov and Tolan, but other people before. Plonikov and Tola, but other people before for different elastic cells like Keller. When you actually do some balance of moments, forces and stuff, and then you assume there is a stored energy in the elastic plate. And then you should put here like a sort of second derivative of curvature button R length. You have some cubic term there as well. And you also have some constant terms times kappa, which Which can be seen as a if you have some pre-stress on the ice plate or it's compression, so it's like a surface tension terms. People are familiar with this stuff. But the beauty is that you can take a positive or negative, depending on if you think of ice as compressed or sort of pulled out or something. And again, most of the studies actually use most of the linear studies use this sort of simple linear fourth derivative of the Deformation, interface, water, ice, plate. So that's the three of them, but there are more. So this is the two one I'm familiar with them. And yeah, I mean, this one, as I say, it's mostly used for people doing just linear studies. And sometimes you can have a linear fluid, linear weight, or you can have a non-linear fluid, linear plate, and so on. So mostly I'm using lazy, this one, but when I started my life as a scientist in the heterogeneous. Scientists in heterogeneous equations did the other one. We have a non-flow condition at the bottom. You kind of assume that the ice plate is there is no sort of gap between the ice and the water. Again, there are various floating airports, so that's not necessarily ice. I'm talking about in the end some elastic plate on top of a floating floating on top of some body of water. So as for the water explorations, you have to find out. Water is problems, we have to find out this interface and velocity, what is the potential in this case. So, having this stuff, we can realize and do the usual business find on the special relations. So, again, for people familiar in this room, we just the differences on these terms compared with the capillary gravity waves. We have a k to the cube, but otherwise, too much different. So, this again, all the model before linear. Again, all the models before linear is the same thing. And the particularity of them is that all of them have a minimum. So, if whatever parameters you choose here, and D and rho, you'll find out there is a minimum, and that's based on the experiments in Takizawa. So, I told you the speed is like six six point something, when you see this sort of uh uh highest uh the displacement. And this one is done by Vermont Square, uh, in uh near Antarctica at McMurdo Sound. Antarctica and make more the sound. And again, you have a minimum, but as the water is deeper, here is 350 meters. This one tends to sort of the long wave unit is growing and blue to infinity because it's infinite water. So I'd say the difference with the capillary gravity you have is that you always have a mean, roughly speaking. And again, if you have finite that you have two critical velocity, if you have infinite that you have just this C min. So you You can consider the inertia of the plate. So, in this case, I assume that the ice plate, the elastic plates, whatever is massless. You can put the bus and then you do some Newton's law and stuff and you find out some zeta tt or eta tt appearing upon this equation somewhere. And you obtain a slightly more complicated relation, not much. So, this is the density of the ice or the elastic plate. This is the depth, the thickness of the ice. The thickness of the ice. But if you plot this one and the previous one, the difference is pretty minimal. And they share sort of similar properties. They have a minimum and so on. So there's not a big difference in them. And I'm actually finding most of my words Ruben Shockers who say that you can neglect it as the water, whatever, if the ice is thin, because whatever, you have completed the wavelength. Also, you may wonder if the thin elastic plate is a good model, and apparently it is. Is a good model, and apparently, it is. So, there are some other guys who was doing studying this thin plate, thick plate approximations. And he found out that in various conditions, you can safely work with a thin plate approximation because it's giving you reasonable results, close to whatever, to the thick one if that particular parameter is small. And in a more speed observation, this is very small. Is very small. So I'm using sort of explanation why I've neglected inertia in my studies and why I use the thin plate approximation. Okay, so probably straight into the thing. So you can rewrite this equation, this, I mean, it's very similar problems looking with water wave problems, with capillary gravity waves. You can rewrite it, as you've seen this week many times, using the Zakarov formulation and create and solemn. uh and uh create and solemn uh uh dependen n nominal operator business. So it's uh so that's the equ those are the equations for the for the uh hydrologic waves as they call them. And all the new things is just in red. And those are again uh you can put them in canonical form and stuff and again you have some sort of energy, elastic energy or wheel or whatever it's you want to call it. So we have the classical kinetic potential and this part of well this part of the potential I think this elastic energy store Potential, I think, this elastic energy stored in the membrane. Or elastic path, sorry. So, having a Habitonian, then you can do your business. So, we have like two we have two critical speeds you have to worry about. One is this long wave limit. You do some scaling and stuff, you expand Hamiltonian and the classical K D V if you want, or bushiness. If you want to go one way, you'd arrive at. To go one way, you arrive at some fifth-order KTV with various coefficients. Again, there's some sort of differences in them, and then we can find out, among other things, generalization values for this KTV. The other one which is more exciting is around the C-mean. So again, in this kind of case, again, using Craig and Suleiman and others' approach, again, you assume a monochromatic wave. Uh monochromatic wave large monochromatic waves with uh some uh wave number K0, slowly varying amplitude, uh some slow scales and stuff, and then uh again expand the Hamiltonian you should obtain some analysis equations usually without any problems, but again the coefficients are more tricky to compute in this case. Um and uh as you again know this stuff, uh if those uh lambda mu are positive we have the supers focusing and is the focusing of lambda mu is negative. Focusing on lambda mu is negative. So I should mention that what are in a natural available derivations if you want. So I think Leon, Moore, and Christensen, it's kind of you obtain the single normal, all of them are the same, but coefficients may depend on which model you're using. People like Marchenko and Shrira in the past, more recently, a lot of people, Paul and other people, have derived. And I think this is the latest one. And again, they include compression on the latest one. So it generally did the coefficient. On the data star, so it changes the coefficients, which change the sign of those lambda mu and things. In the case, like I considered before, lambda mu is positive, sorry, for shallow water. So in this case, as you know, you have this sort of elevation precious. I don't remember what did I take this one from, from VM. So it's a typical families of elevation, precious. Families of elevation, precision diagnosed for focusing NLS. For defocusing, you have dark ones. And as I say, for this particular problem, there is a transition when the depth is very critical. And if it's shallower than that, you have a good NLS focusing one, and the other is a parallel, bad one. So that's the weekly learning category. Now we did compute some comp done some computation Did compute some computation in these things. Steady and unsteady. I was using a boundary integral method for the steady one. People use conformal mapping for other calculations. Philippe, the result from here is work with J.T. Philippe, so he is using some spectral method to advance in time the solutions. And what you obtain again, you obtain the full non-linear Full non-solution of the full non-problems in the form of depression solitary wave, elevation solitary waves. And you can sort of plot the branches of those ones, the solid line from here. Again, this is infinite depth, so this is kind of funny because, again, NLS is the diffocig one there. So you could not find small number of solutions, but you could find solutions basically getting from a finite amount. Finite amplitude. So the depression branch is quite simple. You just start there and go to finish to zero. The elevation one is more complicated, and again, Zam and collaborators have found out the whole structure of the elevation one. The dashboard here you can see actually having the forcing moving uh below the C mean and then uh we actually remove the forcing and the jump on the on the on certain target blank. So they're they're not important in this in this case. Not so important in this case. So, what you find out if you continue, for example, the depression branch, at some point is waves start to overturn, and then they go to the static solutions, which is actually a self-intersected thing. Okay. Ice, so you don't assume that the ice is gonna overturn like that or something. So, obviously, ice is gonna break before that. But elastic for a hydroelastic problem in general, that's what Problem in general, that's what you get. You can look at the energy and stuff, and you find out, for example, that the branch of the depression has a minimum somewhere, actually has another maximum as well. So, which is a sign of change in spinal stability, and you find out in some areas, whatever, C from whatever this point and up to the maximum, that they are stable, and close to here they are unstable. And you find that the pressure, and you find that the elevation waves is. And we find that the elevation range is unstable as well. And you can look at the final depth effect if you want. So the dark one is sort of very deep water, so it's similar to what we've seen before. And then if you reduce the edge, you move up. So this is again the amplitude of the depression rate. And then they start to bifurcate from zero at some point, which you kind of expect when you cross this sort of critical depth. So, yeah, Mark and So, yeah, Mark and Eric, I think people from the room have proved existence to sort of infinite adaptation. Correct, Mark? That's correct. And with Silip again, you just put some pressure in the water in this sort of like time-dependent code, and then remove it. And then you find out that sort of you find some stable solitary waves for the depression, if you're in the right regime. So here is we have a, we move to the right, it's periodic and stuff, it's coming back. Coming back and you have some sort of mess around, but it's kind of like quite stable, a solitary wave moving here. On the positive side, so you try to do the to obtain the elevation branch, but in this case you always go to the sort of the depression evaluation. As I say, as expected, that the elevation rate is unstable and depression is stable. Other solutions are available again. So, this is so over the years we've done many things. We've done many things. So, on the left, it's some graph with the Jean-Mark for one of these models, and the later Tao and the programs have obtained similar things with the general solitary gates for the full problem. On the right is the dark soliton, which I stole from Paul's paper. And that's okay. So, that's the dark solitons. And again, in waterways, you have this sort of if you put some object at the bottom, bottom top. If you put some object at the bottom, bottom topography, you can have a hydraulic fault. And in this case, again, the elastic plates seem to be similarly, so we pay a lot of putting one or two bottom topography and see what happens with trap trails between them and all this stuff. So, towards the end of this study part, there are plenty of studies which I'm aware of, at least. There are plenty of field observations which I mentioned before. The Toni Takeizawa is the one I like. Isaba is the one I like. Linear results started in green here when you obtain some dispensation for these things, and then later people have a point or the rank function or something, times of moving load, or 2D and stuff, and this is like 10 degrees. So people are a lot of stuff to obtain a linear approximation of the solutions. More recently, I guess I said with maybe Larry Forbes and a lot of people from this list, and again, Zahn, Paul, and Jean-Marc. Zahn, Paul, and Jean-Marc and Tao have a number of papers which, well, starting from infinite depth and then final depth and putting even like vorticity, they have plenty of results. And more recently, with Mark and Zahn, we have some stability results for hydrolastic phase, but without gravity, I should mention. We had something with Olga before with gravity. And the theoretical results, again, And the theoretical results, again, there are not many, but they start to appear. So I mentioned Ilichev and Kilgersnell, they done some study early on, just preprinted, I don't know if it was published. And then again, more recent Benakers and David Ambrose, they have actually competed using all this working sheet and some existence of solutions. Only it's like we have an elastic plate, I think, between two fluids, and getting that one magnitude to zero. And yeah, I mentioned Mark and the workers and well Pogdan Matthiok and recently also came into this market and I also worked with Kalin Martin in some hydrostatic problems. Okay, so all this is nice, but h how about if this uh dice is breaking? Uh well the ice breaks. Um so the there is a limit of uh uh all this overturning website obviously it's slightly Obviously, slightly pushing it to see that it's about twice. So, you can actually compute this thing. So, you can compute the strain on the elastic plate. It's pretty simple, formula. So, basically, after you have a formula, you have to compute this kind of stuff. And then, if this is too big, then the ice is expected to fracture, and obviously, your uh had neuralastic assumptions are slightly unrealistic. Uh and there are some numbers which you can compare, and the people have done some this guy good ones. This guy, Goodman. Saul Goodman. And yeah, I mean, in the salty water, you have some values, which is smaller than the pure ice. And one of the referees, which we are very grateful for this, put us to compute some of the solutions for the hydroelastic faults if they're below or above this stuff. And then there is, well, some of them are below these things, which are okay, some of them are above, which means they're going to break. So, yeah, so if you want to, you can. So, yeah, so if you want to, you can test your solution, see if it's realistic or not in the context of ice. And there are other experiments you can do with other elastic plates, which probably will be fine. So, that's about 2D waves. Now, 3D, do the same stuff if you want. So, now you've seen all these nice patterns from the satellites. So, again, it lasts, I don't know how many years, we started to look at what happens if you put a well. Look at what happens if you put a moving load in 3D and move it. Again, you have the classical equation, this is for steady ones. And you have this pressure term, again, coming from the elastic plate, which again depends on what you want. So most of the time you can put pressure, this pressure just to be by Laplacian as a linear thing. Or you can, again, do it more properly. Again, do it more properly, we put up all the full nonlinear stuff as derived by Poland and Plodnikov, which involve various curvatures, Gaussian, and so on. So, we've done it with both of them. I usually use a bondalitran method. So, you have to solve those blue equations for like theta and phi. You have to grid all this stuff, and we obtain this kind of results, for example, when C is less than C means. So, this is forced one, so you just put a pressure here, move whatever. Pressure here, move whatever direction you want. And you get closer to the C-mean, you'll see more and more oscillation appearing and increasing in amplitude. Second is a pepper with Olga, Paul and Jean-Marc. Now, you can remove this stuff and you obtain a 3D solitary wave, finite depth if you want. So that's So that's going in this direction on the x direction. This is the so-called elevation, the depression if you want. So this is like a profile in the x direction, this is in y direction. And this is the so-called elevation one. So this is done with a full non-linear model for the ice plate. So more fun is it if you move on the other side of C min, so if you increase the speed. So you may remember on this graph from the satellite, you see some sort of patterns. You see some sort of patterns. And that's the kind of patterns you obtain. So then my load is somewhere around zero. I move to the left. And in front of it, you have various curved waves. And then behind, again, it's sort of well, longer wave, longer wavelength wave, I think. So and then recently with Claudia we have actually copied Jesus for We have actually computation for variable ice thickness. So, for variable ice thickness, you just the coefficient D, the bending modulus, you can take it as a function of whatever, X, which means that you can have a thicker or thinner ice. And again, with Claudia and with Olga in these papers, we use some method based on Scott McQueen's method of not completely fully the Jacquelopian. We have some preconditioning stuff. Fully the Jacquopopian, we have some preconditioning stuff and make the method run faster because in 3D the problem those things are not very fast. So with this method we can compute in okay, maybe seconds, but before like I don't know how many hours. So what we expect actually to see in this C bigger than C mi, so this is the linear patterns only, so we have the pressure here moving to the left, and this is the kind of curve you observed before and the bit of the one behind. And the bit of the one behind. If you increase this stuff, it looks more and more like sheap waves, but with some waves in front of them. So behind the wave, it is the typical ship waves pattern. This is high speed compared to the C-min. But you always have these sort of like waves in front which curve around the pressure. Again, if you don't do this capillary gravity stuff, it's kind of signal-ish. And you have like various cusps and things appearing behind. So this is, I say, this is just looking at patterns to see what, I mean, this stuff is. This stuff is kind of in this kind of region. Okay, so that's 3D stuff. The trouble is, well, we wanted to see what happens if we actually move these things in time. And we were still working on these things with the full boundary method. But it's easier if you use some fully dispersive models. We heard about those things this week, the kind of freedom stuff in 1D, but this is a Kind of freedom stuff in 1D, but this is a whatever. 2D, well, two directions, sorry, actually in 3D as well. And Evgeny and with Herik, we look at this stuff and then we derive this sort of fully discursive wiki-linear system of equations. But then we can include nullinarity, forcing, dumping, whatever you want, and also make them time dependent. So um that's uh the advantage of using this stuff, it's a bit faster. So uh that's the kind of system it's So that's the kind of system it's, well, what we've seen before, but you truncate a bit faster the expansion of the DNO operator, and you keep only the sort of quadratic non-deality in the right-hand side in this phi t. And then the forcing is hidden in somewhere here, and we also keep some other terms in the equations which sometimes we neglect. So then we did comparison with the Takizabex. Did comparison with the Takizaba experiments we've seen before. So, blue curve, our models, dashed curve were Takizaba's results. So, we just fix the parameter initially and then let it change the speed. So, initially, we fix the parameter so that we have the sensors of what we do at a given speed, but then you don't fix it. You don't fix the parameter every time. And then the position of the load is again red takizaba and blue hours. And it's a reasonable. And it's a reasonable in some cases approximation. This one is pretty good. The fourth one, for example, fifth one hour over approximate over estim overestimate noise in front of the load, the load moved that way. Actually, it's okay, this is in times, but anyway, if you think of the steady waves, it just move that way. And again, sometimes you say it's not so good. So, for example, here again, it's over predict the the the the market of the waves in front of the of the In front of the pressure. This is 1D, but we have also 2D stuff, so 1D, like anyway, 2D or 3D, depending on how we want to measure the dimensions. And the advantage of this stuff is that actually you can vary the speed of your load. So, Bertaus has observed that various drivers have seen ice failures when we decelerate. So, we tried. So we tried the, on the left, we tried something with a constant speed, and on the right, it started from this constant speed and went to zero. And what happened, the waves behind the truck, the whatever moving load, will catch up with the pressure under the load, I think. And then create a much bigger displacement. So top graphs, you see here left-right surface, but some fixed location. And then this is the position of the load. So you can see the load is much wider. You can see the load is much widely varying when it decelerates. Again, which we think is because the waves behind the are catching up with the load. And the other can look at the strain and say that this kind of strain, again, it's on the regional 10 to the minus 4. And yeah, if you compare the previous yield strains, you'll find out if it's safe or not to drive whatever you drive on the ice sheet. So, okay, this is. So, okay, this is what we've done so far. It was mostly going in the straight line, but with this fully dispersive model, you can go in a curved path on the ice. Why you would want to do that? Again, this is some regulation if you have to drive on ice, that you should not approach the short run directly. You have to just take the curve because otherwise whatever. You can blow other ice in in front of you. So the waves, whatever, pressure waves or something, just accumulate and just break the ice in front of you. And just bring the ice in front of you. So, the question is: can we simulate or approximate the trajectories of moving load in curved trajectories? The answer is yes. And again, I turn on the Herding students. You know, then we've done this. So, there are three cases here. You start on the first is the classical going straight line, and they see these patterns, waves in front and behind. This is bigger than C min. And then at some point, you started to curve, if you want, or you just. If you want, or just go in a circle if you want, and then this is the 3D pattern of the same thing. So that's yes, we can do this full dispersive model, these kinds of things pretty easily. Right, so that's the kind of hydrastic waves, 2D and 3D, like what I know so far. Now, you can the water is notified. The water is stratified, so if we can look at the profiles in lakes, and you see sort of clear at least sort of two different areas of different density, with some transition, sharp or not between them. And again, people in the, I think this is in the Arctic, they've seen some signature of waves which are not hydroelastic or physical gravity waves, which are much longer, so which people are interpreting as internal waves. So that's the kind of model. So that's the kind of model I have in mind. That's the simplest model. So we have like two different densities. We have an unknown interface between them and unknown again ice water surface. And we've done some calculations with Zahn and again Jamar Kupol. And we find out all sorts of solitary waves in this kind of regime. Pressure elevation in phase, out of phase, and In-phase, out of phase, and whatever you want. More recently, so we've done actually some experiments around it, it's more fun. So we've been to some past cities in Hamburg. Remember the name. Anyway, Fundy by European Union. And with Magda Kar actually, she doesn't know what she was doing. So we've done some experiments in a tank, no, five meters long, I think. Meters long, I think. You create waves here, so you just have different sorts of height of each layer of fluid. So, this is salty water, so you create two layers of salty water, and then you put various types of ice on top. So, first when you put continuous ice, the displacement was very small, putting it this way, because it's more small, you have to be millimeter, so it's not easy to see. So, it was more fun and actually. To see. So it was more fun and actually broke the ice. And we look at how the ice interact with the internal waves, internal waves, or the other one, how the internal waves affect the ice. So this is just an example from the paper, from one of our papers in the DRL. So basically at the top here, it's obviously this is not the real colours, but this is just for visualization. So this is the ice flow, I believe the ice flow on. And we have an internal wave coming here, so you see the pignot line, hopefully, pretty clearly. And you can see it starts to push the when you approach this ice, it starts to push the ice. And I mean, this is the again difference in time, if you record us at a given point, and you see the internal is passing, and again you see the ice flow moving. So we're able to estimate the ice, how fast is the ice flow. That the how fast is the eye moving due to the internal waves. And the other round, not shown here, you can actually look at how the internal waves is destroyed by the ice. And then you play at different types of ice, just broken ice and so on. So it was pretty fun to do experiments. So you have to be careful also with the server interface. That's the main things I remember from this. So that's again internal waves. Even more fun, you can put elastic places in the middle of the Elastic plates in the middle of the fluid. So this is like two elastic plates. And again, you can, the dispersion relations is quite nice, and you have a gap. Depending on what your approximation, you can have anyway, various types of solitary waves given by the full Manner problems. I mean, what you should do this kind of stuff. Well, this was one of my motivation at some point. So one of the moons of Satun, I think, is Moons of Satun, I think, is they have a hypothesis that is a so-called club sandwich ocean. So you have layers of ice, layers of water, layers of rice, and so on. Okay, like it or not, that's unfortunately what it is. But I mean, in the harbors, people put some sort of plates, some metal plates, which can be seen as elastic. And then maybe if I put a we can put free surface here and elastic by there, and then. Surface here and the elastic paid there, and then it's something which actually people use in our process. So, and again, with Jin Chai and Zhan Wang, we look at this kind of elastic force when we have an elastic weight in the middle of the water and actually use a rigid lead approximation on top. Okay, so that's I think about ha uh when ice was elastic. Now uh we have to forget everything that I say, so the ice is not elastic anymore. So, the ice is not elastic anymore. So, what's happened? So, it's kind of totally different approach to what we said before. So, before you go on to drive more ice or whatever, now the question is, I was looking in the last few years, is what happened to the waves which come from the oceans due to various storms and they go to this zone, marginalized zone, in the head of this punky ice. How fast they decay? And again, this is my postdoc, but this is the stuff that probably seems to go wrong. Maybe not. Okay, sorry. We're too listening to stuff. Okay. So he was so Alberto, he has a lot of fun. So he was so Alberto is in some expeditions in the southern oceans, and you see these sort of like big waves traveling in these things. So it's quite a very long wave compared to this sort of pancake ice. So the question is how much this has to think again. So the question is how much they decay? So, the question is, how much they decay? And there are people who again usually have to estimate this stuff. So, wh where what is this uh so-called M I Z materialized one? So it's uh between the continuous ice plate on all our nice uh hydroxy theories may may work. Rice hydrostatic may work, and the free ocean. And that's sometimes quite a lot of CRIs part of this marginalized zone. People define it in terms of concentrations and so on, so you can have a very few ice flows and say this is ocean, or you can have maybe more than 80% and they say this is like compact ice or something. So depending on some definition, that is a that's kind of stuff you've seen before. And in this region, this sort of light blue region is the one Blue region is the one when this plant can form at various times of the year. And again, this is the area which is quite exciting. All sorts of things happen, 80s things, mixing, and it's quite of interest for various people, not only mathematicians, to study what happens in the marginalized zone. So the trouble is that you want to do some other inheritance, there are too many types of of of uh of eyes. So uh this is the fourth things which Things which you may only know, maybe more or less, but anyway, this is the kind of big form. So when the R dyes start to form, you have this sort of greasy kind of things, like a mushy, whatever, viscous part. And then this one forms fan cakes, which you've seen before, which are like one, two, three, four, five meters kind of measures, diameters. And then together they form a so-called nylus ice, which is again some sort of elastic. Ice, which is again some sort of elastic plate, well, elastic ice anyway. And then at the end of the winter, this one breaks and you have this big ice flow, which can be from meters to kilometers and so on. So the scales are quite different when I talk about marginalized one. So because of these different alternation mechanisms in this MIZ, roughly, we can divide them into when. When the ice flows are bigger or the same order with the wavelength of waves, usually people explain this attimation by scattering. And again, this is my pretty excitation to hide all this. So, anyway, you see these sort of smaller waves compared with these punk egg guys and so on. And you see that the obvious dumping, but you see some waves still moving towards us. So, that's the first mechanism which I'm not going to spend too much time on with, okay? So you have the waves, the waves are smaller than the one you can sort of use some scattering between isoles to explain how the energy is not dissipated, it just spreads around the different things. The second one, which is the one we're interested in more, it's trying to explain the dumping of the waves you've seen in the Dumping of the waves you've seen in that nice movie taken by Alberto. And people have an approximation of sort of dissipative layer on top of the ice as a layer of viscous or dissipative things on top of the invisit water. So then and then, okay, you can put viscous stuff, you can do visco elastic stuff, there are quite a lot of uh of uh of of things you can do there. Of things you can do there. And those ones are actually used for in WaveWatch 3 for predicting these dumpings. Again, those many linear theories about these things. But there are observation of FSG go way beyond the what is from the linear theories. The linear theory predicts an exponential decay, but where's Linoza like one thousand kilometers from the edge of the M I Z in the continuous ice plate. So MIZ in the continuous ice plate. So and then if they're too big, they start to break more the ice and so on. So it's kind of uh an issue for climate change and and so on. So uh there are at least two observations I know of waves quite far away, so that which may suggest that maybe some nonlinearity is important. So the first model, we've done some work with Philippe and with some other later. When so this is the first one in the waves are That the first one and the waves are smaller than the objects or the same wavelength. And in this case, we just simply put a function in front of these elastic terms, which goes to 0 to 1 within some tangent. And then we just put some ice skates, we just distribute them randomly or not. And then we just need a way to go. So, for example, we put the solitary waves in shallow water and let them go to this sort of red ice flows, and then you see what happens. Laws and then you see what happens. You see that the waves is decaying, some 0.3 here or whatever, 0.2 here. And you can estimate also the stuff and detonation rates in this particular problem. So we play with how big is the ice flow, how far is the distance between them. So you find out all sorts of stuff. So when the ice flows are bigger, the elastic sort of radiation is more important. In this case, again, scattering is important, and so you can obtain all sorts of information. Talking porridge. So, more recently, Philippe and Sue have looked at this process in infinite depth, and again, then we put a packet of waves which is more realistic than this solitary weight. Second one, so the last few minutes of my talk. With Alberto, we propose to look to use a dissipative LLS. I'm not sure that DLS is the notation. Is the notation. Use the derivative NLS or something. Anyway, but anyway, distributive NLS in our case. So, first it's the other NLS, not the one people use here, the one in whatever, it's two time derivatives, it's those two x derivatives. It can change between the two with some change of coordinates. The thing is on the right-hand side, we put some dissipation term. So, this is kind of, I mean, I mean, people like Harvey and John Carter and so on have done this study more properly and use, I think, the approach by Diaz and Zakarov to put this into this special term. Again, for this audience, I should not probably not say, but this is the eigenvalue of these waves. It's not the wave itself. But that's in most, in all cases, this Ki comes from viscosity or whatever. And they've done experiments in Banks. Whatever. And they've done experiments in tanks and compared and so on. Now, in the marginalized zone, people, especially in CIs like Mike Mellon and others, have observed, I mean, they propose some laws, but they observe field observation. We see the dumping rate, again for linear things, it's behaving like a fi function of omega cube, the of the frequency. Uh that's one you can even describe sometimes depending on how thick is the ice and so on, with and the SP and so on. And so on, and the SP and so on. And then, if you look at all the field observations, you can actually see the dependence of k in omega. So it's omega to some power between, I don't know, two and four, roughly speaking, depending on which field observation was done in which place. Again, I said different conditions, so all of them were correct. But we have to pick one of them. So we picked k to be omega q, which seems to be the sort of middle of this range of linear distributions. Linear dissipation proposed by Magoras People. So, the difference between our studies and previous ones is that the right-hand side is not only a constant, it depends on omega cube. So, you have a current wave with the wave number k0 and so on, and you get omega. And I probably didn't say here, so the real part of k is the one given by the special interest in a The special relations in ocean, whatever. Omega is k squared of k or something. Omega square is k square. So that's what we're doing. And then we have some boundary conditions. Now again, you have all the solutions in space. And we've done a number of things in the last few years with Alberto. So, first, you look at some sort of random wave simulations. You extract some waves from some spectrum, let them go. This is just some technical details. You just go for how many kilometers. Technical details, you just go for whatever how many kilometers use DLLS really could afford once in space. The time derivative is determined in Fourier space. In this case, this coins with these terms which appear on front of the omega cube is not that well defined as for the water areas. It depends on on the conditions. So this can this new incorporate various uh interactions between ice flows, turbulence under the ice flows and so on. So this is some this comes sort of after observations. This comes out of after observations, cannot predict what is it. But anyway, you can take it lower or smaller depending on how uh how uh well how many ice flows you have in the area. And then uh what you see here is uh the simulation. So we have waves, we put some inner waves here, we let them evolve without any dispression here in the normal the classical NLS, and then it just goes 55 kilometers, as we say. And then you see that, I mean, the red is uh The red is bigger for this way. So, this is like you see the crest. They go at an angle because of the group velocity. We can take out if you want. And they start to decay, you see more and more black stuff appearing here. And again, obviously, for high dissipation, they decay much faster. And you can approximate how likely it is to see big waves after some distance. So that's one of the our papers when we look at this kind of stuff. And then you compare it to a few experiments. And then you compare it with a few experiments and we assume, we say that it's improving a bit compared to linear theories. Then with Alberto and Amin, we look at the so-called module instability. So again you perturb the wave of frequency omega with some bandside perturbation. If you have no dumping, The dumping, you see this sort of breathers, I think, when the energy from the main carrying river goes to the sandboard and then they go back. So you see some like periodic waves of breathers. If you put some dissipation, this pattern starts to break a bit, so it's no longer original periodic on time, and the distance between them appearing on space is more. Distance between them appearing on space is smaller, this is getting smaller and smaller, and then the dumping one is more serious. You just see that this disappears quite quickly. On the right-hand side, you see the wave amplitude. So I think the black one is the current waves, and we have like a blue and green side wave. And you see, at some point, which corresponds to these sort of things, when they exchange energy, they have this big bridle. So that's one of the So that's one of the things we've done. And even more recently, with another postdoc, Ben Humphreys, we look at what happens if you put also wind. And we went to the higher order LS. So these things and these things are just the classical dist equations. A is not an envelope. I don't know why. And the dumping again, we look at constant dumping, no dumping, or fetch. No dumping or faculty-dependent dumping, the one we say is good for MIZ. And the gamma comes from the wind. So we can do balance if you want forcing the dumping and so on. So we did have again some simulations. So we put just a set square in this case. When it's no dumping, just go unchange. When it's dumping, at some point you see it disappearing. Well, it's dumped. So the the itistic tells you if it's dumped or not. Or if it's dumped or not. And then if you put the French dependent, it's even sort of the self-region. And then again, similar stuff for the difference between the dist and NLS, but yeah, just again this is no dissipation. This is some dissipation that this accelerates a bit. And then for the heterogeneous one, accelerate and then decelerate. So it's a bit more complicated. So this is, we know 40. So, this is with no forcing, you put some forcing, and again, for example, we choose the forces that balance the dumping there. And then again, we find out all sorts of other things happening here, like acceleration, acceleration of the wave. And even more recent, Rafael here and his PhD. Yeah, positive. So, we look at the dumped Zakarov equation. So, more or less, we put some dumped. We put some dumping here and then we consider it to be friction-dependent. And we've done various simulations, but one of them is, for example, when you look at the semi-shaped unstable waves, it's broadening if you're not dumping, and otherwise it's just downshifting in this case if this fragment-dependent dumping. Sorry, my voice is letting it down. So that's the kind of it. So we can actually say that this stuff with the wind stuff is. stuff with the wind and stuff is sponsored by PPSFC all around the world. And there are various papers for the MIZ in the last couple of years. And I think that's it. So most of the stuff you can read is on review a lot recently. Thank you.
