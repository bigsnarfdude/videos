With the mapping class group and GGT crowd. And well, I'm sort of guilty as charged. I'm part of this crowd, so maybe it's not my place to comment on this. But maybe from the outside, if you're not actively doing this, it might seem like there's this. Like there's this industry of people proving results about curve graphs or arc graphs or sphere graphs or any of these other things. And it might not be clear what this has to do with topology as a whole or with other things that you might care about. So my goal for today, if I manage to do nothing else, my goal for today is to convince you using a couple of results that I was in. Results that I was involved in, and some classical results, and to convince you that curved graphs are a very useful tool to prove theorems that have nothing to do with them. That these ideas are useful in topology generally. Oh, I forgot to say in the beginning, please add. I forgot to say in the beginning, please ask questions in the middle. Just I don't think it will be chaotic if you just unmute yourself and ask me questions. In particular, my handwriting is terribly bad. So if you can't read what I write and would like to know, then just let me know and I'll try to read it myself. Okay, so that's the goal. The goal is to just give a, and I should also say, very personal invitation into this subject. So I hope that I don't miss something that's terribly important. I'll try to. Terribly important. I'll try to mention some of the important things, but it's all colored by my personal tastes. Okay, so in order to do that, I'm not actually going to start with curved graphs at all, but rather I will now switch and tell you about the two results that will come at the very end that in the proof crucially use these ideas. So let me switch gears completely and briefly talk about something purely topological. Briefly talk about something purely topological, namely the strong-Hawken theorem. So, not assuming that you're an expert on this either, so let me remind you what all of this means. So, let me recall something. So, recall, if M is a compact-oriented, try my best to say all the correct adjectives connected three-manifold. Three manifold, then M admits something called a Hyga splitting. So this is classical topology. So this means that M can be written as the union of two handlebodies glued along a common surface. So where the Vi are three-dimensional handlebodies. And since we're all topologists, but not all topologists agree on what you mean when you say handlebody, let me be precise. So for me, a handle body is the three-manifold that's bounded by a surface in free space. So this is V. So i.e., let's say the regular neighborhood of a graph in R3. In our kilo percentage. So it's a classical result essentially boiling down to triangulability of three manifolds that actually any three manifolds is obtained by taking two of these guys of the same genus and then somehow gluing their boundary along some kind of homeomorphism of a surface. It's a fun visualization exercise. You start with a triangulation, you thicken the one skeleton, that's going to be a handle body, and then the complement is also a handlebody. Handle body, and then the complement is also a handlebone. Okay, so if you're very optimistic, you would now say, aha, this is great. This allows to essentially encode information about a three-dimensional manifold in a surface, right? All the information about the three-manifold is now encoded in how I glue the two handle bodies. So, in theory, and this really should be underlined, all information All information about M is encoded in the gluing map between the boundary of V1 and the boundary of V2. So, in theory, we could just now do surface theory and try to find something out about three manifolds. Why do I underline in theory? Well, if Why do I underline in theory? Well, if you know this subject, then you know that it's sometimes deceptively hard to extract any actual information about the three-manifold from this gluing. One reason is that this gluing is notoriously non-unique, and so for any given splitting, it's maybe hard to see what's really going on. Here's a specific instance of this. So, for example, here's a classical example. Here's a classical example. Suppose that I have a curve. So suppose I have some alpha on this surface. Remember, this surface is the surface that I've glued the two handlebodies on. So this is now a surface in my three-manifold. So suppose I have an alpha, a simple closed curve, which just happens to bound disks in both handlebodies. So such there exists a DR. So, such there exists a di in Vi, a disc with the boundary of D1 is this curve alpha is the boundary of D2. Well, then what I can do is I can form the union of these two and get a sphere in my three-manifold. So it's a two-sphere in M. And such spheres are called And such spheres are called Haakon spheres, for reasons that will become apparent in a second. And in a sense, this is sort of an obvious way of using the splitting to get a sphere. Do these have to exist? Well, in the late 60s, Haakon, and this is where this comes from, proved. This was in 68 that if M admits an essential sphere, no essential two-sphere, then the splitting has a Harkensphere. And this sort of begs an obvious question: namely, are there any others? And as far as I know, this was open until last year, so quite some while, even though it's a very natural question. Question. And last year, Charlemagne proved a strong Hawken theorem. So this is a theorem due to Charlemagne, which says that any essential two-sphere in M is isotopic to a Hakan sphere. A Haakon sphere. Okay, and so this is often called the strong Hawken theorem. Giving sort of a very satisfactory answer to the question, are there any spheres that aren't sort of obviously visible from the perspective of the splitting? So what I'll talked about today, so this was in 2020, and I should This was in 2020. And I should also say that Charlemagne's proof is something more general that, for the purposes of this exposition today, I won't really be talking about. His theorem can actually deal with manifolds with a boundary as well and also control disks in the manifold. So you can ask: are there sort of interesting disks as opposed to interesting spheres? But that's not really relevant for this exposition. What I'll talk about today is a different proof. About today is a different proof of this version of the theorem that I found together with Jennifer Schultens. So, this is me and Jennifer in 2021, I guess. And so, what does this have to do with curved graphs? So, the statement has nothing to do with curved graphs, clearly. There's not even really, I mean, there's surfaces somewhere, but there's no graphs. But, yes, you see later. But as you see later, the proof uses this sort of idea of building a combinatorial complex. So that's one motivation, right? So even if you just care about sort of pure three-dimensional topology, this is maybe a result you might be interested in. And somehow sneakily in the proof, you can make things a bit easier if you use these gadgets to help you arrange the proof a bit nicer. Okay, so that's one advertisement. So that's one advertisement theorem. Let me switch gears completely again and give you a completely different advertisement theorem that has to do with fragmentation. So this comes from a different branch of topology. This is more geometric topology at the beginning, essentially, in any dimension. And this is the following question. So recall, if M is a close Is a closed-oriented, let's say, smooth maybe manifold, M. I don't need M. And now let's suppose that I have a diffeomorphism of this manifold. And this diffeomorphism is isotopic to the identity. Then there's a classical lemma in geometric topology called the fragmentation lemma. Called the fragmentation lemma, and the fragmentation lemma says the following. The fragmentation lemma says that such diffeomorphisms essentially arise in an obvious way. So, what's the obvious way that you can do? You can take something that's supported on a disk, and then you can multiply it by something else that's supported on a disk and keep on doing this until the support of your diffeomorphism is maybe everything. So, what does this say? It says that such an F. That such an F can be written as a product of Fi's, where the support of Fi is Di and Di in M is a properly embedded, is, just wouldn't say properly embedded, is a closed ball embedded. Embedded in yeah, so that's the fragmentation lemma. How would you prove something like this? Well, it's enough to do this for f that are very close to the identity, because if they're isotopic to the identity, it can break an isotopy into little pieces that only move by a tiny amount. And then for something close to the identity, And then, for something close to the identity, you play around with partitions of unity and essentially write your map as a graph and the product of the manifold with itself. And then you break it down with a partition of unity to find this fragmentation. Okay, so when you have this and you're a little bit geometrically minded, this again begs very natural question. So let's call the fragmentation norm the minimal length. The minimal length of such a product. So, for example, if you think about this, say, on the two-sphere, say I have a diffeomorphism of the two-sphere, what can I then do? Well, I can take my favorite point. My favorite point, it gets sent somewhere. I can then move this point back to where it started. I can do that on one disk. And then I've sort of now have a fixed point. Then I can look at a little ball around that fixed point and I can maybe modify my map there so that it actually fixes this whole disk. And then the complement of this in the sphere would be another disk. So this suggests that maybe on a sphere, I can get by with only a couple. With only a couple of disks to write a diffeomorphism as. And in fact, there are some classical results on this. So, some results. And the first, this is pretty hard work, combining results by Burago, Ivanov, and Poltorovich, and combining it with And combining it with work of Tsugoi. And what this shows is that in a lot of cases, this norm is uniformly bounded among the whole group. So if M is a sphere for some n, or if the dimension of m is not two or four. Or four, then the fragmentation norm is uniformly bounded on diff zero of m. And so this means that there's just some constant so that maybe every diffeomorphism that's isotopic to the identity can be written as the product of 10,000 things supported on a disk. Right, so depending on the element. So, depending on the element, the disks have to be different, but the important thing here is that the number does not go to infinity. So, then you might ask: well, why do I care? I mean, I care. I'm a geometric group theorist. I like having nice norms on groups. But one reason that Guragu Ivanov and Poldurovich cared about this is they showed that this fragmentation norm is, in a sense, a universal conjugacy invariant norm. Conjugacy invariant norm on these groups. So, even if you don't care about this specific question, you can ask, you can be interested in the question that this coarsely bounds any conjugacy invariant norm on diff zero. Of m and so, for example, it's classical results that these are perfect groups, so everything is a product of commutators. And sort of if you're more interested in the algebra of these groups, you might ask, oh, what happens, for example, to commutator length or stable commutator length? That's something that group theorists like. You can say, if I want to write an element, if I want to write powers of an element as products of commutators, does the number of commutators go up or not? And what this result tells you is. And what this result tells you is that this going out to infinity can only happen if this very nice topological norm is unbounded. So this fragmentation norm is unbounded. Okay, the other thing you probably immediately see is that this theorem has sort of a slightly glaring omission. This sort of applies to essentially all manifolds with sort of two dimensions excluded. Now, maybe I'm just somewhat frightful, but I'm not. I'm just somewhat frightful, but I'm not surprised that anyone would explode dimension four in the result about diffeomorphisms. Maybe that's not so surprising that we have to be really careful with dimension four. But dimension two, this is doable for all manifolds, but not for surfaces. What kind of ridiculous scenario is this? Oh, I said I wanted to do sort of something about time. So all of this is around this is around 2007 when this was done. When this was done. And then you can ask: okay, so what happens? And they did ask, what happens for other questions, for surfaces, for other manifolds, in particular for surfaces. So Boragovanov and Poltorovich asked, what about surfaces? So surfaces of genus G, where the genus is at least one. And that's the second theorem I want to use as advertisement, and this is joint with. Advertisement, and this is joined with Jonathan Bowden and Richard Webb. And what we prove is that the fragmentation norm is unbounded on diff zero SG for any g at least one. So not so now the surface case is closed. That's good. Case is closed, that's good. But also, it's maybe sort of drastically different from anything else we had done. We had seen before. So, all the high-dimensional and sphere results give you bounded norms. And here on a surface, this is actually unbounded. And again, this is sort of partly an advertisement talk. So I want to sort of highlight this theorem in its statement. Well, fine, it's about surfaces. But in its statement, these curved graphs don't appear at all. And they will only ever show up again in the proof. only ever show up again in the proof. Okay, so that's the advertisement part. Let me go back to my first slide here and talk a little bit about this invitation. So we will sketch very, very roughly because I want to talk about two results and generally people don't even manage to prove one. I certainly won't be able to really prove any of the results. But the goal is to indicate how this idea of a curve graph is crucial to the proof. A curve graph is crucial to the proofs of these results. So, by showing how it appears, how they appear in the proofs of the two advertisement theorems. Okay, so I hope that I've convinced you that it might be worth learning what these are, even if you don't care about the. Worth learning what these are, even if you don't care about them initially. Now I can't put it off any further. I need to tell you what curve graphs actually are. And actually, it's not that bad, even. Many of you probably have seen them and you know that they're not that bad. So what are, so what's the classical curve graph? The classical curve graph is something that you associate to a surface. So let's take Sg and a surface. So let's take Sg as surface, and let's assume that the genus is at least two. This will make my life a little bit easier. In the lower complexity cases, all the definitions change by a tiny bit because the surface is too small. Once you have genus 2, everything becomes uniform. So that's where I'll stay. And so the curve graph is a graph. Okay, so far so good. So I need to tell you what the vertices are. So, I need to tell you what the vertices are, and I need to tell you what the edges are. So, with the vertex set, the set of isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on Sg. On Sg and edges between curves admitting disjoint representatives. Okay, so let me draw a little sketch for you in case you haven't seen this before. So here's my surface. So what's an essential simple closed curve? Well, that's some kind of curve that's non-trivial in the fundamental that I can't contract. Trivial in the fundamental that I can't contract. So a curve like this is an essential simple closed curve. So this guy becomes, or formally speaking, it's isotopy class. For now, I'll never distinguish things that are isotopic. It'll become a vertex in my graph. And then here, let's draw one more. This is beta. Beta is also an essential simple closed curve. And this beta is disjoint from this alpha. So in the curve graph, there's an edge between the two. Between the two. Let's keep on doing this for at least a tiny bit. Here, actually, let's be sneaky. This is gamma. Gamma is also essential. It intersects beta in a single point. So the algebraic intersection number is plus or minus one, which means that even up to isotopy, I can't pull these apart. So this means that beta and gamma are not joined by an edge in this graph. Alpha and gamma seem to be in Alpha and gamma seem to be intersecting in this picture, but that's a fluke of how I've chosen representatives of my isotopy classes. This thing here is an embedded disk on my surface, so I might as well pull this through and isotope my gamma so that it becomes disjoint from alpha. So these two actually are adjacent in the curved graph as well. So that's my definition. Well, it's not my definition. Well, it's not my definition. That's the definition of a curve graph. So, who came up with this? Let me give you a tiny bit of history now. So, the tiny bit of history is that this was started to be considered by Harvey in the 80s. So, this was built first by Harvey in the 80s. And why did Harvey think about this? As far as I know, he. About this, as far as I know, he thought about this in the context of Teichmüller theory. So he was wondering about the moduli space or Teichmüller space of hyperbolic or Riemann surfaces, and he wanted to build something that behaves a bit like the Tietz building for a symmetric space. So he wanted to sort of describe what happens at infinity for a Teichmüller space. And if you know a bit about this, then you know that going to infinity in moduli space has something to do with curves getting very short. Something to do with curves getting very short. And in hyperbolic geometry, curves that are short can't intersect. So somehow it's not so surprising, maybe, that if you want to sort of capture the combinatorics of what happens at infinity in Teichmüller space, you might be interested in a gadget that captures this intersection patterns and these disjointness patterns of curves. So that's sort of originally what he did with this. And then it was used a bit later. A bit later to a pretty good effect to study the mapping class, and that's sort of obvious, right? So, the mapping class group, the group of isotopic classes of homeomorphisms of a surface, will act on this guy. And so, you can try to use this action to conclude things about the mapping class group. So, I want to highlight two things here. This was used by Hera. Used by Hara to study cohomological properties and by Ivanov to study rigidity properties of the mapping class group of this surface. And so, what goes into And so, what goes into this for these cohomological things, what you do is you actually construct the curve complex. So, you don't just construct the graph, but you now build the flag complex. So, whenever you see the boundary of a simplex, you actually glue in that simplex. And it turns out that when you do that, the resulting simplicial complex becomes highly connected. And that's something that's very valuable in this endeavor of proving homological or co-homological stability properties. If I have a group. Stability properties. If I have a group that acts on a highly connected complex, that's very useful for this. So, for example, many proofs of homological stability for mapping class groups eventually go through connectivity properties of the curve graph, of the curve complexes. And what Ivanov proved is that the automorphisms of this graph generally are the mapping class group, except in low complexity cases. And this can then be used to reprove Royden's theorem or things like this. So then you can use this to prove that. Use this to prove that the biholomorphic maps of Teichmüller space are the mapping class groups, and so and so on and so forth. So, that's sort of what people did. They knew that this thing was around. They used it to study Teichmüller theory and the mapping class group. And somehow what went into this is the topology of this complex, the connectivity properties. And then the next thing I need to highlight, because it's really important, is that in the beginning of the 2000s, or probably a bit earlier, but the papers are from then. Earlier, but the papers are from then. Mazury-Minsky enters the scene and study this as a geometric object. So around 2000, Mazury-Minsky show that this thing is Gromov hyperbolic. So since we're in a topology conference, So, since we're in a topology conference, maybe I should tell you what this means. So, i.e., if we give each edge length one, and take the induced path metric, then geodesic triangles. R slip. So, what does this mean? This means that if I have now three curves, alpha, beta, and gamma, and I look at geodesics in this curve graph between them, then if I thicken up two of the sides of this triangle, then this already contains the third side of the triangle. This is sort of a combinatorial non-positive curvature condition. Condition. And that made geometric group theorists incredibly happy because now we have negative curvature. So, if a group geometric group theorist has a group that we like, like the mapping class group acting on a negatively curved space, that's great. That's something we can work with and use. And this allowed us to study, this allows us to study the word geometry. Of the mapping class group. And sort of post-Maiser-Minsky, sort of what they showed is that you can actually compute the distance between points in the mapping class group hierarchically out of controlling things in these curve graphs. And out of this grew an amazing industry of things in geometric groups. Question? Yes. When you say that it is grommy permanent. It is gromovyperbolic, hyperbolic. Well, you have to thicken up the edges, you said. But is there any specific radius that you have to use in that case? Like, or how much do you have to thicken it? So, how much, okay, so this is a good question. So, how much do you have to thicken? How much do you have to thicken these? Not by much. So, this delta, so something is called delta hyperbolic. Delta hyperbolic if thickening up one of the sides, if I thicken two sides by delta, it contains the third. So then you can ask what's this delta? It actually turns out that the delta doesn't depend on the genus at all. So there's one delta that works for all curved graphs. This doesn't follow from the original Mazeminsky stuff, but it follows slightly later. I don't actually know the best. I should know this. I don't know the best constant if you phrase it like this. If you phrase it like this, there's an equivalent formulation where you want a center. So it turns out that this is equivalent to wanting a point that is within distance epsilon from all three sides. And if you phrase it like this, the curve graphs are 17 hyperbolic. So for every triangle, there's a point that is within distance 17 of all three sides. I don't know if that's optimal or not, but that's a low number. So it's sort of, if you look at the first proof, the Maison-Min. If you look at the first proof, the Mazerminsky proof is sort of slightly mysterious. It uses the connection to Teichmüller theory, and it doesn't allow to control this constant at all. But there's later proofs by many, many people where this was sort of attacked from a different perspective. And these give sort of effective bounds. And 17 is one of them in this formulation. So you probably have to multiply this by like three or something to get the other one. Sorry? Sorry, it's a really large scale. Sorry, it's a really large data tag, then 17. Yeah, it's like a low number. So this is, it's not a bad number. It's not great. I mean, the previous constant was like in the thousands. So the 17 is the best that I know. The other proof gives something in the thousands. But sort of, this is this is so here, sort of, I have to say I have my geometric group theorist hat on. So since all of I only really care about things well-defined up to quasi-isometries, so the exact value. Isometries. So the exact values don't really matter to me. So I should say, by the way, this is non-obvious at first, but these graphs have infinite diameter. This is not an obvious thing, but there's curves of arbitrary distance. And so once you're way beyond the scale where this hyperbolicity constant kicks in, it's sort of not so important anymore what the specific number is. It's really about large-scale geometry. Okay, thank you. Good. Okay, thank you. Good. So that's this. And then sort of, then people ran wild with it. So nowadays, there's all kinds of variants of these curve graphs in all kinds of settings. Here I really, really cannot even claim that I'm going to give you a full picture. But let me just in words say, or let me sort of say now variants exist. Numerous variants exist. Numerous variants exist. And so essentially, whenever you have some kind of surface with some kind of structure, you can start associating a graph to it and try to play this game. So for example, if I have a handle body, I can look at all the curves that bound disks in the handlebody. That gives me the disk graph. If I have a surface with boundary, I can instead look at arcs connecting the boundary to itself. That gives me the arc graph. You can look if I have a You can look if I have a flat surface structure, so it's one of these singular flat structures on a surface. I can look at the graph where the vertices are isometrically embedded intervals joining singularities. That was studied by DeSardo, Randeca, and Tang recently, and they proved sort of rigidity results that the combinatorial automorphisms of this graph are the affine automorphisms of the flat structure. Of the flat structure. That's a really cool result. That's sort of a result that tells you that this combinatorial gadget sees something that a priori seems much more rigid and much finer than what this combinatoric should see, like affine diffeomorphisms of a structure. Okay, but today I really, really, because I don't expect all of you to be curved graph fans already, so I really want to focus on these results that don't say, that don't look like the curve graph does, but I want to really focus on these. But I want to really focus on these results where, in the statement of the theorem, the thing doesn't appear at all and it somehow sneaks in through the proof. Okay, so I guess let's just get on with it and see how we do this. So that's the classical curved graph. So let's see what could this possibly have to do, what could this possibly have to do with the strong Hawken theory. So, how could we even have a curved graph-like object enter the picture here? So, here's an idea. And this is, and I'm going to be honest immediately, this is an idea that doesn't really work. But then I'll fix it and I'll tell you what you have to do to make this idea work. So, here's a proof version 0.1. That's sort of the first attempt at a proof. That's a proof. So, what's the complex we're going to build? We're going to look at something called the sphere complex. So, look at the sphere complex. The sphere complex of M. So, what's this? This is something called S M, which has vertices, the isotopy classes of essential. Essential two spheres in M, right? Remember, maybe I was a bit quick. Remember, I'm back in this Haakon setup. So now I have a three-manifold. I've broken it into two handle bodies, and I want to prove the strong Haakon theorem. So I want to prove that any two-sphere is isotopic to one that intersects the splitting surface in a single circle. So I'm interested in spheres, so I should build a curve graphy object for the spheres. So I'm going to build the sphere graph. So this has vertices. Sphere graph. So this has vertices for isotopic classes of spheres, and again, it has edges for disjoints. Okay, so what do we know now? Let me draw a little cartoon. So here, this amorphous blob is supposed to be the sphere graph. And what do we know? Well, we know something, right? So Haakon tells us here. Haaken tells us that if there's a sphere at all, then somewhere. Then, somewhere there's also a Haakan sphere. So, this means that in this strange sphere graph, there's some kind of subset. I don't really know how this looks like, but there's some spheres which are Haakon spheres. So, these are the Haakon spheres. Okay, so let's make a little observation. The observation is that this graph, this sphere graph, is connected. Sphere graph is connected. So there's an observation. This sphere graph is connected. So this means that if somewhere there's a mystery sphere that I don't know that it's Haakon, what I can do is I can join it with a path to some Haakon sphere. I know that there is one, so I'm going to just join it with a path to this Haakon sphere. Path to the slacken sphere. And now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look for the first time that this path jumps out of the set that I know to consist of Hawken spheres. So join the mystery sphere to the set of Hawking spheres. Look for the last sphere, sigma prime, before entering the set of Hawking spheres. Okay, so now what does this mean? Now, if you think about this for a second, this means, right, because edges. This means, right, because edges correspond to disjointness. This means that this new mystery sphere is actually contained in the manifold that I get by cutting at the Haakon sphere. And the sort of observation is that this guy here, this has pluses and minuses. So the bad news is this is a manifold with spherical boundary. So, I don't know yet how I feel about this. Maybe I like closed manifolds better, but there's one good thing. The splitting induced from the original one is simpler. And it has simpler, I mean that it has lower gene. I mean that it has lower genis. If I have a Hawkins sphere, right, this intersects my Hygard surface in a single circle. So if I cut at this sphere, I also cut the splitting and I get an induced splitting. And the induced splitting, the surface is obtained by cutting my original surface at this circle. So this will make it have more boundary, but lower genus. So somehow it seems like the complexity of my problem has gone down. Of my problem has gone down. So, maybe that's an idea of how to use this to build a proof. Maybe we should do some kind of induction where we try to prove this for low complexity manifolds first, and then crawl through this connected complex, bootstrapping our way up, showing that more and more spheres are Hawkins. Okay, so let's try this again. Proof version 0.2. Work with manifolds with spherical. Work with manifolds with spherical boundary and induct on the genus of the Hygard splitting. Okay, and now something happens that as curve graph people, as a curve graph person, I'm very used to, when you switch settings, used to when you switch settings the first definition you write down is probably going to be the fault the the wrong one so the problem is there's a problem here the problem is that the sphere graph as defined above for a manifold with boundary behaves badly so either you allow that boundary spheres as points in your Spheres as points in your complex, then they're adjacent to everything else, and this thing becomes essentially useless, and the induction doesn't work anymore. Or you disallow this, and you only want to have other spheres, but then it stops being connected sometimes. So that's a bit bad, but we can work around this. So we can solve this. And this is now the actual proof. So the actual proof works like this. This is now very sketchy, but I want to give you. This. This is not very sketchy, but I want to give you an idea of how this works, and I can hopefully convince you at least of the main idea. So let's say for M, a manifold with spherical boundary that is sphere sigma in M is surviving if sigma is still essential. Is still essential in the manifold m bar obtained by gluing balls to the boundaries. So the terminology comes from the idea that these spheres survive filling in the boundary. Maybe before this was just a tube that connected the two boundary components, thickened up a bit, then this is. Components stick it up a bit, then this is a perfectly valid essential sphere in the manifold width boundary. But once I fill in these balls, this becomes null homotopic. So this is not a surviving sphere. Okay, and now here's a bunch of things you show. So what you show now is the following. So now, the first step is we define a surviving sphere complex. So, I'm not going to tell you what it is in writing because hopefully you can already guess. So, now the vertices are isotopy classes of surviving spheres, and edges are again disjointness. And you show that it's connected. By the way, how do you show something like this? This is simply a surgery argument. So, you have two surviving spheres, you wiggle them a bit so they're transverse. You wiggle them a bit so they're transverse. You look for an innermost intersection circle, and then you try to perform a surgery, cutting the sphere and gluing it in a bit of my target sphere. And the surviving condition means that not both sides of this can be inessential in the manifold where I filled in the boundary. So at least one of the surgeries will still be surviving. And then you just induct on the number of intersection circles. So that's not super hard. It's just, this is a connected complex. Okay. So now remember our strategy. So now remember our strategy is to try to get to the Haggin spheres by crawling through the sky. So this now leads to two technical problems that you need to prove. The first is that any, we somehow need to deal with the non-surviving spheres. So what we're going to show is that any non-surviving sphere is Hawke. And we now somehow need to show this by hand. So let me convince you why this should be true. You why this should be true. A sphere that doesn't survive has to have a very specific form. This means that in M, it separates M into two bits, and one of the bits just contains, it's just an S3 with some balls removed. It has to be the things which are just the boundary components, because after filling them in, it becomes trivial. So by the sphere theorem, it needs to actually bound the ball. So then this tells us that, so now you do a little induction. That so now you do a little induction and you say, Well, let's deal with sort of one boundary component at a time. So it's enough to deal with spheres that actually only have two of the boundary components on one side. If you do that, then you see that the sphere looks like this. It just is a tube connecting the boundary components, thickened up a little bit together with the boundary components. So it looks like a dumbbell. It's the boundary, and then there's sort of a cable, sort of a tube coming out, doing something odd. Coming out, doing something odd in the manifold, going to another boundary component and connecting up to something there. Well, okay, so now you look at this tube and you homotope this tube around in your manifold and you bring the tube into a general, into a nice position on the splitting surface. And when you've done that, you've brought your sphere into a position where it intersects the surface in a single circle. I admit that that's not a proof, but I hope that you believe me that this is doable and not too much work. And not too much work. This is sort of mild. The point is that the non-surviving spheres have a very specific form, and so we can use this specific construction to just deal with them. The next thing we need is that if there is a surviving sphere, if there is a surviving Hakan sphere. Hawkins sphere. And that's just Haakon's lemma again. So if you have a sphere that survives, fill in the boundaries, now it's still essential. Haakon's theorem tells me that in the resulting thing, there's an Hawken sphere. Drill out the boundary again. You've now found an essential Haakon sphere that's also surviving because it will go to the Haakon sphere in the closed.map. Okay, and now we can actually run this induction. So now this induction works. So suppose we know the theorem for the genus of the splitting surface being up to some constant less than some g. And suppose that the genus of my surface. That the genus of my splitting is g plus one. So then I look at this surviving. So by the second bullet point here, I already know that all the non-surviving spheres are Hawken. So I only need to deal with the surviving ones. For the surviving ones, I know that somewhere there's a surviving Haakon sphere. If I now have any arbitrary If I now have any arbitrary surviving sphere, I join it by connectivity to a path with this guy here, and now I just induct. So, this here, let's call this sigma zero. Let's look at the next one. This is sigma one. Sigma one lives in M without sigma zero. And this has a splitting of genus G, because I can. G, because I cut at a disk. So I cut my surface at a circle. So the genus has gone down. Now, either the thing becomes peripheral, becomes non-surviving in this thing, then I know already that in that manifold I can isotope it to be Haakon. After reglowing, it stays Haakon. Or it stays surviving there, but the genus has gone down. So I still know that I can isotope it to a Haakon field. And then I just induct, then I just crawl along paths. Paths until I know that sigma itself is also hockey. So, what's going on here? So, hopefully, you know, you believe me at least partially that what we can do here. So, the idea here is, so what's going on? The idea is that using this variant of the curve graph, using this surviving sphere graph, allows to reduce. To studying one specific scenario, namely a sphere disjoint from a Hawken sphere. And that's much more manageable than the general case. And then you use a connectivity argument. Connectivity argument to crawl through. So, what's to do? Let me sort of say this as a little challenge. We've now, just like in the history of the curve, this tiny history of the curve graph, we've only used something incredibly mild. So this only uses the connectivity. So, let me sort of throw this out as a challenge or a question. Throw this out as a challenge or a question, and the question is: can we use the geometry for something? And what even is the geometry, right? But you now have this surviving sphere graph. This is already sort of a test case where we've used it for something interesting. Maybe it's worth studying this more and seeing if this can have sort of further applications. That's sort of this sneaky thing where people start proving all kinds of things about all kinds of complex state tends to be useful sometimes, and then you. It tends to be useful sometimes. And then you always have this impression that if you know further properties, maybe you can improve other things. Okay, so I have 10 minutes left, which is woefully not enough to really talk about the fragmentation result, but I promised that I will talk about it at least a tiny bit. So let me at least indicate how curve graphs show up here and how they help. So remember, on this slide, our goal is that we have a surface of genus at least one. Of genus at least one. So, again, I'll immediately skip to the part where the genus is at least two, because otherwise I need to talk about different definitions. And remember that what we're up against is we want to show that the fragmentation norm is unbounded. So let's remember this. Let's remember that the fragmentation norm being unbounded is actually implied by any conjugate. By any conjugacy invariant norm being unbounded, we don't actually have to work with fragmentation because Burago Ivanov Poltorovich tells us that if I have any conjugacy invariant norm which is unbounded, the fragmentation norm has to be unbounded as well. Okay, so that's the first reduction. So let's instead work with something that I maybe like more. I mean, I think the fragmentation is the more interesting one, but let's for the proof work with the For the proof, work with the commutator length. So we aim to show that the commutator length can be unbounded, is unbounded. So, commutator length is just how many commutators do I need to write my group element. And in order to do this, We use something else from the realm of geometric group theory. We use quasimorphisms. So what's a quasimorphism? A map from a group into R is a quasimorphism if there exists a constant such that if I compute Such that if I compare the value on the product of two things, and I compare this to the sum of the values on the different things that I get. So for a homomorphism, this would have to be zero. For a quasimorphism, I just want that this is not too big. So there's some kind of defect that tells me how far this is away from a homomorphism. And this is supposed to be true for all group elements. And so now here's something that's an exercise. Maybe if you're bored in the break and you like this, then you can do that. If F is an unbounded quasimorphism, then the commutator length on G. On G is unbounded. Why should this be true? So a homomorphism sends a commutator to zero. Why? Well, because it sends an inverse to minus the element, and also it sends, it goes into an abelian group. And coarsely, this is still true for a quasimorphism. So a quasimorphism will send the inverse to approximately minus the element, and it'll send a commutator therefore approximately to zero. Therefore, approximately to zero. So if I send something, if I have something that is a product of 10 commutators, it will send it to something that's bounded by this defact B, the value of the trivial element, and something involving this 10. So if I can find a quasimorphism that gets arbitrarily big, this tells me that commutator length will get arbitrarily big, which in this setup will tell me that fragmentation has to get arbitrarily big. Fragmentation has to get arbitrarily big because commutator norm is an conjugation invariant norm. Conjugates of commutators are commutators. So now I need to tell you about a little black box because geometric group theorists can build these for us. So now I've transformed a nice topological question into a horrible sounding algebraic question. Instead of fragmenting diffeomorphisms, I'm now trying to build quasi-morphisms on a group. Why am I able to do that? Why am I able to do that? Because there's a wonderful machine due to Bestvina and Fujivara. So, this is a wonderful box. And what do you need to put into this box? You need to put into this box a hyperbolic graph, gamma, an action of G on gamma by isometries. And you need to put into this box elements g and g prime in g which push into very independent directions. I'm woefully vague here. So if you know some grammar of hyperbolic spaces, this is stronger. So what I want is I want hyperbolic elements, so elements that translate along. Elements, so elements that translate along axes, but we need something much stronger than just saying that the axes have four different endpoints at infinity. You need that I cannot even move one axis close to another by something in my group. But since I only have three minutes left, let me tell you sort of the punchline of the story. The punchline of the story is that if you hand Pestine Fujiwara these things, they hand you back an unbounded quasi-morphism. So that's what they do. And this sort of generalizes these counting quasimorphisms on trees. If you've seen quasimorphisms in your life, you've probably seen them on trees, where I sort of count how often certain segments appear. And what Bestina and Fujivara realized is that you can imitate this in hyperbolic graphs and sort of count geodesic segments. Count geodesic segments. Okay, so I'm only going to tell you what this graph is. And given all my advertisement, no one will be surprised that, of course, it's a curve graph. But how can this possibly work? Because remember, what we want to do is we want to work on diff zero. So we want to work on the isotopically trivial diffeomorphisms. And remember, the curve graph is the graph. Is the graph whose vertex set is isotopy classes of curves and whose edge set is disjointness up to isotopy. So by definition, the isotopically trivial diff zero group will act on this guy trivially. So now is the point where you just have to take a deep breath and do the obvious but scary thing and make. Obvious but scary thing and make your graph incredibly big. So let's define the so-called fine curve graph, where what you do is just delete the word isotopy classes and you delete the word representatives here. So now before already this graph was locally infinite and had countably many vertices. Countably many vertices. Now, this thing has uncountably many vertices, and everything is adjacent to uncountably many things. So, this sounds like a horrible idea. But if you're not afraid, you just take a deep breath and you play a bit with this thing, what Jonathan Bowdoin and Richard Webb and I realized is that this thing is still hyperbolic. So, Bowdoin, me, and Richard Webb, what we proved is that this fine curve graph is also. Curve graph is also Roma fiberbolic. And that's sort of the first ingredient to feed into this Bestina Fujivara machine. Now, I don't have time to tell you how we do this, which is sort of the harder part. We need to somehow get elements that act on it in a nice way. And mapping class group people use technology from mapping class groups to get these. But since this fits into something that I was asked before, let me say that. Asked before, let me say that the way we prove this is that we approximate this fine curve graph by normal surviving curve graphs where I remove more and more points. The idea being that if I know the isotopy class relative to a larger and larger finite set of curves, I get sort of a better and better approximation for knowing the actual curve. And now, this sort of side remark that curved graphs aren't just hypothetical. Remark that curved graphs aren't just hyperbolic, but the hyperbolicity constant doesn't depend on the surface, comes in extremely helpful because that's really what underlies this. As I sort of start puncturing my surfaces at more and more places, the hyperbolicity constants don't blow up. And this allows me to prove sort of via an approximation result that this very complicated fine curve graph is still hyperbolic. Okay, thank you for your attention. I hope I haven't completely steamrolled you, and I hope that I've convinced you. You and I hope that I've convinced you that even if you just care about topology, which is a good attitude in life anyway, maybe it's worth thinking about curve graphs once in a while or asking your curve graph friends who are always more than happy to build these things for you because it's very much fun. All right, thank you for your attention. Oh, well, thank you very much, Sebastian. Well, probably we have just time for one quick question. Just time for one quick question.
