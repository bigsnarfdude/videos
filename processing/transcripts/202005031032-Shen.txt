Roughly speaking, he proved that at least 87.5% quadratic Dirichlet L functions satisfy this conjecture. In fact, there is a more general conjecture which stated that the L function one-half chi is non-defined. Chi is not there for any character, not only just for quadratic character. In 1981, Jutila proved the first moment. Here, P1 is a linear polynomial with explicit coefficient. This error term was improved later by Goldfeld and Hofstein, then by Young for the smooth version. Smooth version. Flory considered this in the function field setting. She obtained one additional mean term of size x to the one-third with error term x to the one over four plus epsilon. In the same paper, Jutila proved the second moment. This result was improved by Sandrajin later by. Later by Flori and Suno. The third movement was established by Sandra Rajin. R6 here is a polynomial of degree 6. The sum star is sum over square 3 integers. This sum is slightly different from the previous one. Here D is square 3 and here is character 8 D rather than character 8D rather than character D. Well, if D is odd and square free, then 8 D is a fundamental discriminant. So this form is easier than the previous one, but essentially they are the theme. People do this form mainly because we want to focus on the methods and the techniques rather than calculation. This result was improved by loads of Was improved by loads of people. Especially, Zhang, he obtained an additional minimum of size x to the 3 or 4 under some certain technique assumptions. Well, Diakono confirmed this additional term in the function field. In the following paper, Diakono and Whitehead did this. Did this in the number field setting for the smooth version around that time, we did have very nice conjectures. In 2000, Katie L. Snace, using random metric theory, he gives the conjecture for all case movement. He gives the They give the leading mentor. This conjecture was refined by Connry Farmer Keating, Romestein, and Smith by using a heuristic method. They got more main terms. Here, P is a polynomial of degree K times K plus one over two. There was some debate on this size of error term. Error term because in for the third moment, Diakono and Whitehead found the additional mean term of size 3 over 4. Apparently, this is larger than this error term. In 2010, Sandra Raji and Yang considered the second moment of quadratic twist of the Twist of modular functions. They give the leading mean term under the generalized Riemann hypothesis. Unconditionally, they can give the lower bound, precise lower bound. People believe that the difficulty of this problem is the same as the difficulty for the fourth movement of quadratic Dirisalia functions. Of quadratic Dirichella functions. Based on this method, Flor reconsiders the fourth movement in the function field setting. Here, H2G plus 1 is a set of monic square free polynomial of degree 2g plus 1. She obtained two more mean terms. She obtained these two more main terms by These two moment terms by using recursive method. Last year, I did this, did the analog for the number field setting. On the GIH, I give the leading mean term, and unconditionally, I give the lower midterm. PSC1 is a constant. More precisely, this is some number times all the product. OLA product. I got one leading mean term here, but it may be possible to get more mean terms by using Floridi's recursive method. So this is the fourth movement. Next, I'd like to sketch the method. The first tool I want to use is the approximate functional equation. Approximate functional equation. We can convert L function square to a kind of Dirichlet series. Here, tau of n is the divisor function. The number of divisors of n. Omega is a contrast integral. In fact, this is a real function that decays exponentially. Because of this, Because of this, when n is much larger than t, the value of omega will be like zero. So this sum is like a truncated sum, and n is up to d. So roughly speaking, the L function square is approximate to this truncated star. n is up to d uh the next one I want to use is the upper bound for Why I want to use is the upper bound for the shifted force movement. This, if you take z1 and z2 equal zero, then this is the fourth power of a function. So this in fact is the fourth moment. We shift it a little bit, but we cannot shift it too much. The real part of z one and z two should be less than one over log x. And 1 over log x, we also have some restriction on the imaginary part of d1 and d2. We want to use this lemma mainly because we want to use this correlation bond. The proof of this lemma is mainly based on San Rajin's 2009 work. He gave the upper bound for the Upper bound for all case movement on the GIH. In fact, this lemma is the shifted version of this result. This result was improved by Harper by removing this epsilon. Unconditionally, His Brown gave this upper bound, which is the best up to date. Chandi gives the gives the shifted movement for the uh for the movements of remaining data function sand and young uh gives uh that for uh twisted modular function and much uh proved that for uh diristal functions mod q next one is post-motivation formula Mission formula. Here, phi is a smooth function. That is just a parameter. This is quadratic symbol, which is a quadratic character. On the right-hand side, GK of n is a Gauss type sum. So if you ignore this coefficient, this sum is just a Gaussian sum, Gauss sum. Some Gauss sum. Free head is a Fourier type transform. This is a kind of generalization of the classic Puton-Sahmusian formula. So in the classic Puton-Samusian formula, this place should be one. And there's no Gauss type sum here. The phi hat should be exactly the Should be exactly the Fourier transform. Now let's guess the proof. I will prove the asymptotic first and then prove the lower bound unconditionally. This is the fourth movement. With width, we put a smooth function here, mainly because we want to use Manning transform and put a missing formula. We can remove this. We can remove this in the end. Next step: just split this fourth power to the product of two second power. This is a trivial step. Then we use the approximate functional equation to expand the L function square. Next step is a trick. We replace the variable if d variable if D by parameters u1 and u2. So u1 and u2 are fixed numbers. If these two numbers are not too small, these two expressions are identical up to an error. We prove this identity by using upper bound for safety moments because this result is dependent on the momentum. Because this result is depending on GIH, so our result is depending on GIH. Then we use the Putnam-Amusing formula to split this expression to three terms, diagonal terms, off-diagonal terms, and other terms. Other terms will contribute to error. Diagonal terms and off-diagonal terms will contribute to the mean term. will contribute to the mean term. Here we take uy equals e2 equals x over a power of log x. This is big enough. We can evaluate diagonal terms and of diagonal terms and give asymptotics for them. So plug this in, we can get the both moment. Of course, we need to remove this smooth function. Then this is, then we prove the lower bound. We need to use the Cauchy-Swatz inequality. This red part, in fact, is L function square. It's the approximate functional after using the approximate functional equation, we get this. And replace the variable here by the parameter. The variable here by the parameter u. We keep the second L square. On the right-hand side, the second sum is exactly the smooth force movement. So we can remove this sum to the left. To the left. So we order this inequality. We can get this. Denote the numerator by a square. numerator by a square, the denominator by b here we take this parameter to be x to the one minus four epsilon. This is smaller than the one we take previously. So this makes us bound the errors more easily and we don't have to use And we don't have to use the GIH here. We can use the previous method to establish the asymptotics for A and B. So plug A and B in this fraction, we can get the lower bound. So we get the precise lower bound here. Here is the references. I think I have to stop here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Xian. Any questions for Xiaomi? If there are no questions, we can thank Chalmy. Thank you.
