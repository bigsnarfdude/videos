  Okay. Okay, so thank you, and thank you to the organizers for the opportunity to speak today. Yeah, so my name is Zach. I'm a postdoc at Georgia Tech working with Matt. And today I'll be talking about some joint work with Jim Beelin and Peter Nelson at the University of Waterloo. I have to say, I'm new to the algebraic side of matriarch theory, so this talk will be more on the combinatorial side. But I hope you'll find parts of it interesting. So, in particular, I'll be talking about extremal properties of classes of matroids. So, here's kind of the most general extremal question you could ask. This was explicitly posed by Joseph Kohn in 1936. Proposed by Joseph Kohnyan in 1993. So, given your favorite minor close class of matroids, what's the maximum number of elements of a simple rank n matroid in your class? Here's some examples. So, I'll write G of Q for the finite field of order Q. And a G of Q representable matroid of rank N has at most Q to the n minus 1 over Q minus 1 elements. Elements and equality holds for predictive geometries. And a simple rank n graphic matroid has the most n plus one choose two elements, and equality holds for complete graphs. And a simple rank n planar graphic matroid has at most 3n minus 3 elements, and equality holds for planar triangulations. But there's an issue here, which is that rank 2 matroids, some rank 2 matroids can have arbitrarily. Simple rank two matroids can have arbitrarily many elements. So, this question is not really well defined as stated. But luckily, Joseph Kung proved that this is the only obstruction for this question to be well defined. So, in particular, he proved that for all positive integers L and N, a simple rank N matroid without the rank two uniform matroid on L plus two elements as a minor. plus two elements as a minor has at most L to the n minus one over L minus one elements. In particular, that's a finite number, so we can ask this question for minor closed classes that do not contain all rank two uniform H-roads. And the answer to this question in general is encoded by this extremal function for the class. So it's just a function that takes in a positive integer n and just outputs the maximum number of elements. And just outputs the maximum number of elements of a simple bitroid in your class with rank at most n. So we can rewrite it in the examples from the previous slide and in this notation. So here's the extremal function for the class of matroids representable over this finite field. Extremal function for graphic matroids. And for planar graphic matroids. And okay. And these are three really canonical classes. Canonical classes of matroids, and they have very different extremal behavior: exponential, quadratic, and linear. So I think a natural question to ask is, what else can happen? What are the possible extremal functions for minor closed classes of matroids? And the crazy thing is, is that up to a constant, these are the only possibilities. And this is called the Called the growth rate theorem. So it's really a combination of four results by various subsets of these authors. But it says that for any minor closed class of atroids that does not contain all rank II uniform atroids, there's some constant c, that one of these three things holds. So in the first case, there could be some prime power of q, so that your external function has an exponential lower bound and upper bound in base q. Lower bound and upper bound in base Q, and your class contains all GFQ representable matroids. Or your class, the extremal function for your class could have a quadratic lower bound and upper bound, and your class contains all graphic matroids. Or your extremal function could just have a linear upper bound. And I think this is a really nice result. Is this graphs or history excludes of graph? That's one. Ah, so yeah, I mean, the intuition is that, yeah, these these are essentially minor closed classes of graphs. I mean, that's not all that can happen here, but that's kind of the dominating behavior. Yeah, so this is a really nice theorem. I'm just going to focus on one aspect of it that I like for this talk, which is that these classes of type one are just completely controlled. Of type one are just completely controlled by finite fields, which is nice because this question is just purely combinatorial. It's about matroid minors. But finite fields are telling you the answer up to a constant for classes of type 1. So we wanted to prove an analog of that for classes of type 2. So, okay, so these are called exponential, quadratic, and linear classes. And it turns out that It turns out that these functions for classes of type 2 should be controlled by finite groups. So that was our goal for this project. And what do I mean by that? So, I mean, we know the behavior is quadratic, but maybe we can figure out what's controlling the coefficient of the quadratic term, something like that. Okay. And. And no, that's not even known. Yeah, so it's not even known that this is always a quadratic function. That should be true, and it's conjectured to be true by Geeland, Herrera, and Wiggle. But that's not even known for representable matrons. Yeah. We just know that there's a quadratic lower bound and upper bound. Okay. Yeah, and our main result, I think, provides some strong evidence. I think it provides some strong evidence for this to be true: that these functions should be controlled by finite groups. Before I tell you the result, I need to show you, I mean, how do you even get a class of matroids from a given finite group? So if you haven't seen this before, there's two really nice classes of matroids associated with a given finite group. And I don't have time to give full definitions for these classes, but I'll tell you the. For these classes, but I'll tell you the relevant properties and do a couple examples. So, the first nice class is the class of gamma-frame atroids. So, we'll let gamma be a finite group. The class of gamma-frame atroids is minor closed. And the external function, external behavior, is just determined by the size of the group gamma. These were first studied by Zeslowski in 1991. Okay, another nice property is that this class has a sequence of universal models called Dowing geometries. So any simple rank-end matroid, gamma-frame matroid, is a restriction of a specific matroid called the rank-end Dowing geometry over gamma. And these matroids have some really nice properties. So they completely encode the group. So two Dylan geometries of the same rank are. Two Daling geometries of the same rank are isomorphic if and only if the two groups are isomorphic. And we know exactly when they're representable over a field. So this Daling geometry is representable over a field F, if and only if the group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the multiplicative group of F. And this allows me to show you an example of a representation of a Litalian geometry. This is over the five-element field. The five-element field, and this is a representation of the rank three Downing geometry over the multiplicative group of the five-element field. If you squint, it kind of looks like maybe an incidence matrix of a graph. Every column has two non-zero entries, and kind of for each pair of non-zero entries, we have maybe like a label coming from this multiple. Coming from this multiplicative group. And indeed, these matroids can be constructed from graphs with edges labeled by your group, but I don't have time to get into that. Okay, so this is the first really nice class of matroids associated with a finite group. And there's another one that's just as nice, called the gamma lift matroids. Also minor closed, also has extremal function determined by the number of elements of the group. The group also has a sequence of universal models called lift geometries. Lift geometries are also really nice. They also encode the group, and they are representable over a field if and only if gamma is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group of the field. So these two classes kind of go hand in hand in that sense. And again, this allows me to show you an example of a representable. An example of a representable lift geometry. So this is over the ternary field now. And this is a representation of the rank 3 lift geometry over the additive group of the ternary field. And again, this looks like an incidence matrix of a graph, where if I write this group as 0, 1 minus 1, we're just putting those group elements above kind of edges. Elements above kind of edges of the instance matrix of a graph. And again, these gamma-lift matrix can be constructed from graphs with edges labeled by the group gamma. Okay. Okay, so back to the goal. We want to understand the external functions for these quadratic classes and hopefully show that they're controlled by finite groups. By finite groups. But we have these two natural classes of matroids associated with a finite group. This is a different story from exponential classes where there's just one natural choice. So what we decided to do to kind of get around this issue was we said, well, let's just exclude the lifting behavior. We'll exclude non-trivial lift geometries, and then hopefully the external behavior should be. The external behavior should be completely determined by gamma-frame atroids. And yeah, that's our main result here. So we show that you have any minor closed class of atroids that excludes some ranked uniform atroid, and also excludes all ranked three lift geometries over a non-trivial finite group. Then there has to be some group gamma which determines the external function. Which determines the external function for your class up to some linear term here. And this is because your class contains all frame entropies over that group n. Okay. So I won't say anything about the proof, I think. I'd like to move on to some applications so we can apply this. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a good point. So that follows from the fact that we are excluding some ranked uniform atri and excluding all these lift geometries. Because excluding these lift geometries also excludes all projective geometries, because every projective geometry has one of these lift geometries as a restriction. So if I go back. Sorry. Why couldn't it be linear? Uh yeah, you're right, you're right. I should say that it contains all graphic matroids as well. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Dumb question, Martin. If I take two non-isomorphic groups with the same cardinality and take the unions of the frame matroids of both of them, it seems like that should fall into this nerve somehow. Ah, let's see. The unions. Yeah, so I guess yeah, you could it would probably be you'd probably get frame atroids over like the direct sum of those two groups. But I don't get all the frame atroids over the direct sum. Each of the two classes for gamma one and for gamma two. Yeah. But the constants won't be right because the Constants won't be right because the constant size can't one plus signs can't two. Yeah, well, so maybe, let's see, you have to, that would have to imply that there's some lift geometry, I guess, not to a lift geometry. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have to think about that some more. Are there questions for the moment? Yeah, so what I'd like to do next What I'd like to do next is just apply this to some really nice classes of representable matroids. That was partially, that was one of our goals in proving this theorem. So for example, we can just apply this to the class of real representable matroids without some line as a minor, and we can get an approximate external function. The external function for this class. And that's just because these lift geometries are just not representable over fields of characteristic zero, because there's no non-trivial finite additive subgroup. So then you just have to find the largest finite multiplicative subgroup of your field. And for the real numbers, it's just the two-element group one and minus one. The two element group one and minus one. That's where this two comes from. Okay, and the previous best upper bound here was something exponential and an L, proved by Joseph Koenig. So this is the first result with the correct quadratic coefficient. Okay. But we really were interested in finding some exact external functions, even if this is just approximate. Approximate. And to use this theorem to get an exact external function, this lower bound would have to be the correct answer. So we have to consider single element extensions of Downing geometries and what happens if we exclude those matroids. That's what we did next to guess. That's what we did next to get some exact results. So I'll use this notation: this rank 3 Downing geometry plus an element, E, is just any simple rank 3 extension, every Downing geometry by this element. And as a corollary of our mean result, we get this theorem, which is that if you have a minor closed class that excludes some rate to uniform atroid, then either you have some non-trivial You have some non-trivial lift geometry, or you have some single-element extension of a down geometry with a group as large as possible, subject to the rank two uniform atria excluding. Or you get this nice kind of tight upper bound for a sufficiently large n, at least. And what can we do with this? Well, now we can get, ah, yeah. So if we want to apply this. So, if we want to apply this to representable matroids, we have to understand the representability of these extensions of down geometries. And that's not too hard to do. They are not representable over fields of characteristic zero and are presentable over fields of at most one distinct characteristic. And now, this observation allows us to apply this theorem, for example, to the class of complex representable matroids. Class of complex representable matroids without some y as a minor. And we get this exact external function, at least for a sufficiently large n. The proof is easy from this result. These first two outcomes are just not representable over fields of characteristic zero. And therefore, we get this upper bound. And we have a matching lower bound because Because Downing's geometries over the cyclic group of ordered L are complex representable, because it's a subgroup of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers. And we can do the same thing for pairs of finite fields, where one multiplicative group divides the, is a subgroup of the other multiplicative group. And these first two outcomes do not. These first two outcomes do not occur. They just can't. Both these matroids are only representable over fields of at most one characteristic. And yet, if we assume these fields have a different characteristic, then this third outcome holds with L equal to the size of the multiplicative subgroup of the smaller finite field. And we get this matching lower bound because Downing geometries over the multiplicative group of the smaller field. Over the multiplicative group of the smaller field are also representable over the larger field. And this has some special cases that were already known. This is already known for regular matroids and for dead matrix. Okay, and I'll just finish with a couple open questions. So we want to show that these classes are controlled by finite groups. We did this in a special case where we excluded lift geometries. Lift geometries. To do this in general, we need new ways to construct matroids from a finite group. So matroids with a representation of this form, that's a minor closed class, but the external matroids are not frame matroids, and they're not lift matroids. So we need something new. This might be kind of hard, something more concrete. You could do the opposite of what we did: exclude down geometries and hopefully. Down geometries, and hopefully, lift geometries would be the external matrix that you get for those classes. And the most concrete question of all, what's the exact external function for real representable matroids about some line as a minor? This is a very natural class, and I think this deserves an answer. Okay, I'll stop there. So thanks for your attention. Questions
