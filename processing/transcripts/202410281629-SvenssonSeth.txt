I've uh added a small amplitude compared to the title given in the programme, uh because I needed a longer title. And most of it will be joint based on joint work with Ula, but also a little bit of extension done by myself. And the last slide is working progress, already mentioned by Matz in his talk that we're working on, so things that will only appear. That will only occur briefly at the end of if I don't run out of time if we want to go up at all. So I will begin by talking about this cubiliary gravity equation, which was introduced by Matz. So it is a full dispersion model for the water wave problem, sort of made to improve. Made to improve on the KDB, possibly, but here it is important that we have the capital reversion so that we have surface tension with this parameter T in here, that it's non-zero, it will have to be weak, as we shall see. However it is it is this version relation comes exactly from the linear uh Exactly from the linear dispersion relation for the working wave problem. So it's sort of different in the non-linearity and in the absence of self-detection. This is what's usually just called a width of equation, but you can call it sort of a gravitational width equation. But when t is greater than zero, it's a model for capillary gravity water weight system. And then we will see And then we will look at the traveling water waves. So we do this this classical travelling wave and such, and then we rescale the wave number to normalize the period to pi. And then we have this wave speed from the traveling wave outside, the rescaling parameter kappa for the wave number, and the surface tension Ts of our parameters. We have these three parameters to play with. These three parameters to play with in this model. And we will have to use all of them in sort of our results. And after this rescaling, we can write this for remote player as this very similar thing where sort of kappa shows up at type. And this work started out by Out by when I moved to the Trondheim. So Matt's with Matt Johnson, Ula Mell, and Flipper Ramonato had a result, and Ula was there, and he was sort of unsatisfied because they characterized all small symmetric solutions. But he thought, well, we should characterize all of them, even the non-symmetric ones. And he was convinced they don't exist. Matz was convinced they do exist. Matz was convinced they do exist. Ula tried to disprove them and failed and then got convinced they do exist. Then I got involved and I was convinced they don't exist. I tried to disprove them until I was convinced they do exist. And now we have proven that they do exist. So what they do is they do this local bifurcation technique where they have a one or two dimensional journal in the sort of even space. But you get this two-dimensional kernel when the surface tension is small. But if you don't assume this evenness, you get a two or a four-dimensional kernel instead. I mean, it is essentially in the even case you have cosines, but in the non-apriori even case, you have cosines and sines. So, you can get twice as many functions. And it is precisely this four-dimensional kernel exactly for this four-dimensional kernel that asymmetric solutions can exist. And this is because if you just had a two-dimensional kernel of a sine and a cosine, you can sort of shift everything due to translational invariance to get an inlet solution. And that's sort of what we mean by solution. Sort of what we mean by symmetric and asymmetric. So it is essentially that it shouldn't be an even solution under any sort of spatial shift. So if you shift the function and find an even solution, it is symmetric in a large sense. And if you can't find such a shift, it is asymmetric. So here is an example of a process solution, and it's also sort of the leading order of the solutions we actually uh actually obtain at the end. Actually, obtain at the end. And there are some previous results on this, sort of asymmetric solutions for the water wave problem. I know no such results on the Widtham equation, but all of these are sort of secondary bifurcations, so they already bifurcate from quite large symmetric waves. While the ones found here come from the trivial solution, which is, as far as I know, not known in. Not known in the waterway problem either. Alright, so we start with a true solution, I said, and then we get a non-trivial solution through some local bifurcation result. Now we will have a four-dimensional kernel. We have already seen a two-dimensional kernel today. Now it just gets even worse. We want the linearization to be a Fredon operator with zero, and then we need And then we need all these four elements to be in the kernel of this. But the kernel acts quite easily on this, or the action of the kernel is, or the action of the linearization isn't that difficult on these for remotes that we have for the periodic functions. So we have sort of had to fix our parameters Have to fix our parameters c, t, and kappa so that we have two positive integers that solve this, and then by sort of a symmetry, we always get these four-dimensional things. And this is why we need the weak surface tension. When you have strong surface tension, you get a sort of monotone function if you plot the this very If you plot the dispersion relation, but if you have weak surface section, you get this dip. So when you sort of plug in two different K1 and K2, one will just be a stretched version of the other. And if it's monotone, you won't have any point where they intersect. But if it did so have this one one zero, it will have. One zero, it will have precisely one point of intersection. And then we know that we can always find sort of kappa zero and C0 such that we have this four-dimensional kernel of the cosine of with wave number k1 and the cosine with wave number k2, and the same for the signs. And I won't go into the details on how we say that it is a Frelum operator, but we can essentially just invert it on every other Fourier mode. And then, as usual in local bifurcation, we have the projection onto the kernel along the range, and the projection onto the range along the kernel. And then we decompose everything, both the solution and the equation, into sort of a part in the curve. Into sort of a part in the kernel and a part in the range. Now, this is sort of a special case where sort of the kernel is the complement to the range is the same as the kernel because it just maps for remotes to themselves. But if we write u as v plus w, where v is in the kernel and w is Where B is in the kernel and W is in the range. And then instead of expressing this in the cosines and the sines, I will express it as these two cosines which are both shifted by a sort of phase theta, if you will. And in the end, we will see that it's only sort of a relative phase theta. It's only sort of a relative phase that is relevant. If we shift both of them by the same amount, it doesn't really matter. And then we have these two unknowns now, B and W, and two equations. Where the first one is infinite dimensional, and the second one is sort of finite dimensional in the sense that it's projected on. In the sense that it's projected onto this finite dimensional kernel. And then we can simply apply the implicit function theorem to get a unique solution to the infinite dimensional equation for a given element in the kernel, a given function V. And then we take this, so it depends on this. So it depends on these parameters R and theta, which sort of define this element V in the kernel. And then we substitute this W into the finite dimensional problem and we have a truly finite dimensional problem. But we have these four equations and three parameters, C, kappa, and T. But this would be solved by using this. By using this fact that I mentioned, that if we shift both by sort of the same phase, it won't matter. And for this, we can use the variational structure together with the translational invariance. So if we write this functional, then the u derivative of this is is just Derivative of this is just uh the equation itself uh multiplied by uh V but if we evaluate it at V. But then since we can sort of shift this we find out that that in fact we have that the equation is is uh perpendicular to the derivative of u, and then you sort of combine this with the fact that u. This is with the fact that u derivative is just the derivative of b and w, but the part with the derivative of w disappears because you know that that is a solution already to the infinite dimensional problem. And in the end, that just means that the equation is orthogonal to the derivative of B in the kernel. So that sort of removes one of the dimensions in the kernel. Dimensions in the kernel. So if we introduce some reduced function here, where we have now just sort of shorten the notation and use these as the sort of these already sort of shift the cosines and sine as the basis functions for the kernel. We essentially have these four scalar equations and Equations and the condition we had from before is essentially that two of them are linearly independent. You can make this sort of nicer if you use the relative phase as one, the relative phase and the sort of additive phase as your variable instead, and then one of them will be trivial zero. Um but uh the condition means that so uh if three of them are sat satisfied the if three of them are satisfied therefore more or less and then uh to sort of not run into problems with the uh uh with the two first uh equations we sort of uh assume uh these Assume these wave numbers are co-prime. You can sort of still do the bifurcation. It is done in the even case, but you will end up in this case in a setting where you cannot find any asymmetric solutions anyway. So we just assume it sort of to begin with. And then we can sort of factorize everything. Can sort of factorize everything like this with these psi functions, which are well they're bounded. And then the whole idea of factorizing this is sort of that we sort of actually iterate the we iterate this this operation. This operation, which we can do sort of to calculate higher and higher order terms in the expansion, we are guaranteed by the implicit function theorem. And then we have to expand every order in the Fourier modes as well. It's quite messy and technical thing, but in the end we get this nice factorization. And then we can sort of focus on these psi functions and Psi functions and from these conditions that they were linearly dependent, we see that it's sufficient to solve psi 1, 2, and 3 is equal to 0. And then we get number 4 for 3. And then it should be enough, hopefully, with our parameters C kappa and T. And the first part is just like in the symmetric case. In the symmetric case, in the even case, so I won't go into that. But we can find sort of C and kappa for any it should be theta here. I knew it was an error somewhere because I've used some of these slides before, and someone pointed out an error, and I looked and I looked for this error, but I couldn't find it. Now I can see it. It should say. It should say theta here and there. So for any orth identity, we can find the C and kappa that solves the two first equations, and then we can take this C and kappa and plug them into this side 3 to get sort of a function of just R, theta, and T. And then at sort of the trivial solution, so if R is The trivial solution. So if r is zero, we set this capital phi to a lowercase phi and sort of make this k1 and k2 dependence explicit because we can sort of solve this equation that phi is equal to zero for some of these k1 and k2 pairs, but not all of them. So to sort of generally solve this for This for side 3 is 0 for more r theta and t, we definitely need that phi 0 somewhere for the trivial solution. If that isn't true, we can find any quality solutions. And then if we can do that and as well find that the t derivative is non zero, then then we're fine and we can just use the implicit function theorem once more. Implicit function theorem once more and obtain a solution here. And numerically, it looks like this. This is not sort of how we rigorously proved it. Instead, the rigorous proof in our paper actually relies on the intermediate value theorem. We used continuity, and that it sort of changes sign. Because if you compute If you compute the phi explicitly, it's 500 terms or something like this. So it's not too easy to differentiate and just say this is non-zero at this implicit point T0, so you don't have an implicit value for that. But if you do numerics, you can also find other wave pairs. So I showed the phi function for this. It's sort of smallest pair in a sense. Smallest pair in a sense, but it looks like we can find sort of infinitely many, hopefully, but that is also an open question. And we don't see any real order in sort of which pairs work and which don't. But in the end, we end up with a result that we did sort of have this because. Is because at least for this smallest two five, we have done all the computations and made sure that we have the properties we need for this function phi and it should appear in CMASON. Hopefully not been too optimistic with 24 that there and that it actually appears this year. But it is accepted. And then what I've done after this is sort of generalize this to some sort of equation with a linear part and a non-linear part, sort of mimicking this rhythm equation to sort of apply it to some larger class of equation. If we just have this function space XS now, which Now, which some of it's the software spaces or the helder spaces or something like this, and that we have some technical properties that make it sort of behave in the same way. So, the first one is just that it's linearization, it's sort of the expected Fourier multiplier and the Fourier operator, and even, so it's more or less just the properties of the. Just the properties of the equation. For the non-linear part, we can have something quite a lot more complicated in the Widthem case. It's just u squared. Here we just have some analytic function or operator that consists of these m m linear operators which sort of has this amphibian form. So Pamphylional form, so it sort of multiplies together all the exponential functions more or less, and then it can have some constant depending on all the wave numbers. And then that it's also sort of even in some sense, and also that it's it's variational and that it's is translation antivirus so we can sort of do the same reduction but you could sort of add more parameters instead of this I guess or I mean you could generalize it in different ways. And then essentially if we have some point mu0 where we have the same sort of kernel and If these technical conditions were used to essentially the same as this pi function being zero and its derivative being zero, actually we get type one and type two for free by sort of the elements being in the kernel, but sort of verifying this this uh uh determinant is is uh the very technical part. And uh then we would have small amplitudes Then we would have small amplitude symmetric solutions, and this is the paper of mine in water waves of this equation, which has sort of the same shape as the ones before. And this can probably be applied to sort of the full waterway problem if we sort of use it in the Propenco formulation with capillarity on finite depth, and we can sort of. Depth and we can sort of define this Boco equation with Kevillarity. I think much showed it without only. But we need this Kevillarity to get sort of this four-dimensional kernel again and everything. But then of course you have to show this technical condition holds and also make sure that sort of with the parametrization of the Banker equation that we end up with sort of physically asymmetric solutions. Solutions. But I think the difficult part is doing something with these technical conditions because they get much more technical because the non-linearity is so much more complex. Alright, thank you for your attention.
