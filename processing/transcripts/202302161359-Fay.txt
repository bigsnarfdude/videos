 There we go. Okay, cool. So I can start. I'm going to be from Tom and Spain. And then I can let him as well. Great. It's been a pleasure to be here. I'm going to be talking today, kind of following on from some of the previous talk about energy transport and also towards the end charge transport processes. And in Gabriella's case, it was in artificial systems. I'm going to be talking a bit more about natural systems. Natural systems. So, I'm in particular focused on the question of how to describe coupled electron transfer processes and energy transfer processes in light harvesting complexes and developing sort of computational approaches to simulating these quite difficult systems. So, you can think about this kind of, I guess, the more general question that I'm interested in is how to describe loss processes in open quantum systems and sort of potentially interesting. Systems and sort of potentially interesting open quantum systems without resorting to Limblad type treatments. So trying to go beyond Limblad treatments and incorporate some more kind of interesting physics into the models. But I'm going to do all of this through the lens of looking at photosynthesis and electron transport into photosynthesis. So electron transfer plays an important role in plants and other photosynthesis. In plants and other photosynthetic organisms. It plays a role in the essential functional role in reaction centers, but it also plays a role in photoprotection, which I'll also refer to as non-photochemical quenching or NPQ in this talk. I'll use these terms kind of interchangeably. So both of these processes in light harvesting complexes involve an interplay of excitation energy. Of excitation energy transfer and electron transfer. And what we'll find is that this sort of interplay here cannot be captured accurately with simple limblad type treatments. So what does photoprotect about? Photo protection is how I kind of became interested in all of this. So photo protection, so plants have to harvest light energy. Plants have to harvest light energy from fluctuating light sources. So, the light fluctuations that plants experience occur on a wide variety of time scales, from sort of seconds to minutes to hours to even seasonally, right? So it happens on this huge range of time scales. And in order to act as efficiently as possible under low-light conditions, plants have evolved these huge photosynthetic super complexes packed full of chromophores. So these things have a huge So, these things have a huge absorption cross-section and they can absorb light energy at a very high rate. So, this means that they can turn this light energy into chemical energy efficiently when there isn't much light around. But this creates a problem when there is high levels of light in the environment. So, that's because these high levels of light can cause damage. So, in particular, these chlorophyll excitations Chlorophyll excitations, we can get a build-up of chlorophyll excitations when light levels are high. And they can build up at a rate faster than they can be used in reaction centers. So they stick around for a while. And I won't go too much into the photochemistry, but these excess excitations can form singlet oxygen, which is a high-energy state of oxygen, which causes all sorts of damage to two cells. So in order to get around this, plants have evolved these sort of real-time adaptations. Have evolved these sort of real-time adaptive NPQ mechanisms so they can switch on quenching to get rid of these excess excitations. And this turns out to be really important for, or understanding this is really important for things like engineering new crops to operate as efficiently as possible. So, very recently, some collaborators of ours published this paper where they tuned, slightly tuned genes associated with MDQ. Tuned genes associated with MPQ in soybeans, and they found that they could get 30% higher crop yields by some very simple modifications. And they directly correlated this to the MPQ response in these species. So we know a little bit about the molecular mechanisms of NPQ. So in particular, we know that one particular mechanism that can operate is charge transfer. So in this talk, I'm going to focus. So in this talk I'm going to focus on one specific example, which is charge transfer quenching in LHC2, which is this light harvesting complex here. So this light harvesting complex is a protein scaffold, which is this grey bit. And then there are the chromophores which harvest light energy, which is the blue chlorophyll B and the green chlorophyll A. And then in it, there are also these other molecular structures called carotenoids. So the highlighted in purple. So, the highlighted in purple here are the luteins. This is a particular type of carotenoid. So, in LHC2, there's a particular lutein which can undergo a charge transfer with a particular chlorophyll A called chlorophyll A612. So, because, and this can dissipate excess excitation energy by through a charge transfer process. So, what's happened is the electronic excitation on the The electronic excitation on this chlorophyll triggers a charge transfer, where we get an electron transfer from the lutein to the chlorophyll, and then this charge transfer state can recombine back to the ground state. But for all of that to happen, first of all, what has to happen is we have to have excitation energy transfer from all of these other chlorophylls to this specific chlorophyll here. So I'm interested in this coupled energy and charge transfer process that's going on here. So the real question is how. Going on here. So, the real question is: how can we model this process accurately and efficiently? So, just before going on, I thought I'd clarify the difference between excitation energy transfer and electron transfer. So, we think about excitation energy transfer in terms of so we have some donor fragment and some acceptor fragment, so this might be two of those chlorophylls. And each one of those, there's a set of molecular orbitals on those. And in XIT, Tools on those. In excitation energy transfer, we have an electronic excitation. We start out in a state where there's an electronic excitation from the donor HOMO to the donor LUMO. And then what happens is that electrostatic interactions between the electrons facilitate a simultaneous excitation and de-excitation of electrons, which transfers the excitation from the donor to the acceptor without any net transfer of electrons. So there's still two electrons on the donor and still. So there's still two electrons on the donor and still two electrons on the acceptor at the end. And this type of excitation energy transfer, or the coupling between these two different states, is typically on roughly the same order of magnitude as the system bath coupling, so the coupling to the protein scaffold and the molecular environment. And that's also normally roughly on the order of thermal energy in these systems. So this typically exists in a sort of weak to intermediate system bath coupling regime. System bath coupling regime. Now, electron transfer is such. Are electron-electron interactions relevant here for these processes? Do you know? So the electron-electron interactions are. I haven't mastered this yet. There we go. So the electron-electron interactions are what causes the. So the electron-electron interactions are folded into this coupling, J. And so the electron-action interactions. And so the electron-electron interactions are what actually facilitates this excitation energy transfer. So it's a primarily sort of transition dipole, transition dipole coupling. So it's a Coulomb type coupling. So yes, it's the short answer. Okay. Thank you. So in electron or sort of charge transfer processes, what we have is if we start out with the same excited state again. out with our same excited state again. In charge transfer what happens is we get a transfer of an electron from this excited LUMO to say the LUMO of the acceptor. So we have an actual transfer of an electron from the donor fragment to the acceptor fragment. So this is primarily mediated by direct coupling between the orbitals involved. So it's typically a very short-range coupling, unlike the excitation energy transfer. But because we have a charge transfer, this changes the charge distribution in the overall system, which changes the polarization of all of the surrounding sort of molecular environment. So typically, this type of charge transfer process couples very strongly to the environment. So we're in a regime where the reorganization energy is much, much bigger than thermal energy. So in order to kind of start talking about how we describe these couples. Talking about how we describe these coupled charge transfer and excitation energy transfer, and talk a bit more in detail about how we describe just the excitation energy transfer process. So if we take our LHC2, we have a set of chromophores, our chlorophyll B's and chlorophyll A's, and there are a set of locally excited electronic states that are relevant to our excitation energy transfer. So we have a set of states where just one of these chlorophylls is excited. We're going to just consider the case. Is excited. We're going to just consider the case of when we just have a single excitation in our LHC2. And then all of these different excited states localized on the different chlorophylls couple to each other via this electrostatic interaction that I just described. So we have these couplings, J, between the different locally excited states. And these couplings will tend to delocalize the excitation and they facilitate this transfer. So if these Facilitate this transfer. So, if these couplings are strong enough, then we can form delocalized excited states. But then, at the same time, this is not a closed system, this is an open system. So these local electronic excitations couple to the vibrations on the chromophores and on the surrounding protein scaffold. And this leads to a system-bath coupling, which tends to localize these excitations. So the system-bath coupling. So, the system bath coupling to first order, it causes decoherence between the local excitations on the different chromophores. And we parameterize the strength of this system-bath coupling with the reorganization energy of each one of these couplings to each bath. And we can typically treat the bath in our system as being decomposed into a bath associated with each of these chromophores, because the primary coupling of the electronic excitation to the environment is. Excitation to the environment is through the local vibrations. So that means that the bath of vibrations on, say, this chlorophyll doesn't couple to the excitation on a neighboring chlorophyll. So we can describe this whole system with a Hamiltonian where we hit in the psyched basis, in this locally excited basis, where the diagonal elements describe the energies of the excitations and the coupling to the path. To the path, and then the off-diagonal elements here describe the couplings between the local excitations. And what we do is we can write it out a bit more thoroughly in this form, and we describe our system bath coupling with a simple linear response type approximation, where we can treat our bath as harmonic, and we can treat the coupling between the locally excited states here, n, and the bath as being linear in the bath displacements. So if we So, if we want to model the dynamics of this excitation energy transfer, well, we can use approximate theories. So, we could use first a theory and the limit where these inter-excitation couplings are small compared to the reorganization energy. So, in this limit, we have sort of hopping between localized excitations on each individual site. In the opposite limits, are when the electronic cuttings are large compared to the reorganization energy, we get sort of damped coherent transport, which we Damped coherent transport, which we can describe with perturbative red field theory. But in general, in light harvesting complexes, there's a range of electronic couplings because these electronic couplings have a fairly strong dependence on the separation between the different excited states. And typically, there's a range of electronic couplings, and they're mostly roughly on the same order of magnitude as the reorganization energy. So, if we want to describe the dynamics of this electronic. Describe the dynamics of this excitation energy transfer exactly, we have to use a different approach. So, the approach that I'm going to be talking about is this hierarchical equations of motion approach. So, I'm not going to go into the details of where this method comes from, but operationally what it is, is we have a hierarchy of auxiliary density operators for our system of excitations. And so, the zeroth element here is just the reduced density operator of the system. Density operator of the system. And then what these auxiliary density operators do is they capture the non-Markovian and non-perturbative response of the system to the bath, or baths in our case. So one thing to note with this method, though, is that if we have large reorganization energies in our bath, we need deeper hierarchies. So we need lots and lots of elements in our hierarchy. So that means that we and particularly if we have lots of baths, if we have large reorganization energies, Large reorganization energies, we get a very high computational cost quite quickly. So let's go on to sort of thinking about how to extend this treatment to include this charge transfer process. So I'm going to summarize the results of this paper, which was published back in November here. So what we do is, well, we add in our, say, our quencher into this sort of simple cartoon here, which can accept or donate an electron to the chlorophyll. And this will couple to some particular chlorophyll excitation. To some particular chlorophyll excitation. And this quencher also has its own bath of vibrations associated with vibrations of the quenching molecular fragment. But then also this charge transfer process couples very strongly to the polarization of the surrounding protein and solvent environment. So we also have to include in our sort of open quantum system description this bath that accounts for the polarization of the environment. So, in our sort of Hamiltonian, now we add another diagonal element which corresponds to this charge transfer state. And there's some coupling between, say, some particular local excitation and this charge transfer state, parameterized by VCT here. So, we can write out the overall charge transfer Hamiltonian as a term that describes the coupling between our sort of reactive, locally excited state. Locally excited state than the charge transfer state. And then we also have to include a new system bath coupling term that accounts for how this charge transfer excitation couples to both the baths on the chromophore and the quencher and this polarization bath. Can you explain more about these different types of baths and why one is much bigger than the others? So what I've tried to represent in this colour. So, what I've tried to represent in this cartoon is just that the polarization, so polarization here, we're talking about electro polarization of the electrostatic environment. So, because we have a charge transfer going on here, the Coulomb interaction is pretty long range. So, this charge transfer will couple to molecular motion sort of very far away physically from the pair of molecular fragments. From the pair of molecular fragments involved in this charge transfer. So, abstractly, this is just three different baths which have different reorganization energies, maybe different characteristic frequencies. But physically, yeah, we have this part. We can, you know, to a good approximation, we can partition out the intramolecular vibrations in our molecules from the kind of vibrations and other sort of vibrational motions of molecules in the protein and in the solar. In the protein and in the solvent. So, this is, you can also think about this as just a separation between a bath of modes, which are the modes involving the atoms of Q or the atoms of the chlorophyll versus the atoms of everything else in the system. So, yeah, the problem with applying HEOM directly to this is that this charge transfer process has associated with it a reorganization energy, which is much bigger than KBT. Which is much bigger than KBT, and this makes direct HEOM calculations completely intractable for realistic parameter regimes. So we have to do something else. So we've developed this sort of what we call a hybrid HEOM method to tackle this charge transfer state. So what we do in cartoons is we treat the excitation energy transfer within this method exactly with HOM. Exactly with HOM. And then we treat the charge transfer process with perturbation theory. And in particular, we treat it with sort of the ultra-strong coupling type perturbation theory, where our perturbation parameter isn't the system bath coupling, but it's the coupling between the charge transfer state and the locally excited state. So I'll talk a little bit more about that right now. So in our traditional sort of Sort of perturbation, sort of weak coupling perturbation theory. We can partition our system into a system, a bath, and a system bath coupling part. And our total density operator can be written pretty accurately in terms of this projected total density operator, which is just a simple direct uncorrelated product of a thermal equilibrium bath part and the reduced system part. Now, in the strong coupling limit, what we have, we instead pass. What we have, we instead partition our total Hamiltonian into a free bath part and then the system and system bath coupling part, and also a block which contains system and system bath coupling. And so we block diagonalize our Hamiltonian. So we have a block which is diagonal in the locally excited basis, but in the locally excited The locally excited states, and then a block that is diagonal in this charge transfer state. And then we have some term which couples the locally excited states to the charged transfer states. So in this limit, we can accurately describe our total density operator with this type of sum of uncorrelated products of a reduced system density operator and a bath density operator, where now these bath density operators are different. Density operators are different because these bath density operators incorporate the correlation between the system and the environment. And these system density operators here are diagonal or are block diagonal. So this term here only contains term information about the locally excited states and this term only contains information about the charge transfer state. So what we're saying is that in this ultra-strong coupling limit, instead of having no coherence between the system Coherence between the system and the bath. What we're saying is we have no coherence between the locally excited states and the charged transfer states. So, all of this has been formulated quite nicely recently and very formally, but these ideas have been around for quite a long time in the chemistry literature in the context of electron transfer problems and electron transfer problems where there are maybe interesting coherent quantum dynamics competing with these. So, overall, when we do this sort of projection here, When we do this sort of projection here, this spanzig projection, what we get is a method where we have two coupled hierarchies: one hierarchy that only contains information about the locally excited states, and one hierarchy that only contains information about the charge transfer states. So we've thrown away any coherence information between the charge transfer and locally excited states. And then there's some super operator that appears in the equations of motion that describe the. Of motion that describe the transfer between the locally excited states and the charge transfer states. And in certain limits, this reduces to a Limblad form, but in general, we don't use the Limblad form of this super operator in describing the dynamics. So the way that we actually derive the equations of motion is we use the Nakajimat-Svantig equation and we use a perturbative expansion to this in this ultra-strong coupling limit, so the perturbation parameter. Coupling limit, so the perturbation parameter is the coupling between the locally excited and charge transfer states. And we also make a Markovian approximation, but that Markovian approximation is just in the description of the charge transfer process. So we preserve all of the non-Markovianity and the non-perturbative system-Barth interaction within the locally excited state manifold. But it turns out that this Markovian approximation won't actually matter for the experimental observables we're looking at, because this Markovian approximation. That because this Markovian approximation preserves the long time limit of observables and also the time scale on which the system relaxes. So, in order to also do some of the calculations on LHC2, we've had to implement a few other little tricks to make it feasible. So, we have a nice sort of propagation scheme based off of Krylov subspace methods, and also a new kind of truncation and low temperature correction to the HEOM, which accelerates convergence with respect to the size of these hierarchies. With respect to the size of these hierarchies. And all of that is just published here if you're interested in this. And all of this is implemented in a MATLAB code that I've written. It's available at my GitHub. It includes both sort of HCOM on its own as well as this hybrid version. So we've tested this hybrid method in a simple case where we have a dimer of two locally excited states coupling to a single charge transfer state. It's sort of a simple model. Transfer state. It's sort of a simple model of this fragment of LHC2 here. And we've tested this across a range of different excitation energy transport regimes. And also these two different columns correspond to different regimes for the charge transfer. So in this regime here, we have a much more quantum bath, so we have a much higher cut-off frequency in our charge transfer bath, and a much stronger coupling between our charge transfer states. Coupling between our charge transfer state and our locally excited state. So, across these different regimes, this method seems to work quite well. It's pretty accurate. And also, it's much cheaper. We don't need hierarchies anywhere near as big. So, this means that we can now tackle this LHC2 problem that contains 14 different locally excited states and 14 different bars. So, now we can start to kind of. So, now we can start to kind of answer this question: how do exciton dynamics affect charge transfer quenching in LHC2? So, LHC2 is a bit more complicated than just a single charge transfer pathway. We have two different charge transfer pathways, where we also have to include the charge transfer between our charge transfer state and then the ground state of the system. So, we have to explicitly include the ground state in our description. And we also have to include non-radiative and radiative decay pathways as well, which we can also do through this. As well, which we can also do through this kind of framework of semantic projection quite neatly. The other thing I should mention is that some other people have worked very hard to parameterize these charge transfer models. So we already have parameters for the reorganization energy of the charge transfer, the energies of these different charge transfer states relative to the locally excited states. And we also have information about the couplings as well from some other studies. So, what I'm going to show you is So, what I'm going to show you is the dynamics of different populations of different excited states after I initialize an excitation on this chlorophyll A612, which couples via charge transfer to this routine in the molecule. So, what we see is that at very, very short times, we see the formation of an exciton. So, this A612 excitation couples very strongly to the neighboring A611. A611. So we form this delocalized excitonic state. So the population equalizes very quickly between these two different chlorophylls. And then what we see on a slightly longer time scale, on the order of sort of 10 picoseconds, we see energy redistribution. So we start to see energy transfer from this excitonic state to the remaining locally excited states within LHC2. But then, But then, happening also on a roughly a 10 picosecond time scale, we see population of the charge transfer state. So, that's this dashed line here. So, this charge transfer, this loss process is happening on the same time scale. There's this energy redistribution. It's not just a small little perturbation. And also, it happens reversibly. So, the system, after about 50 picoseconds, reaches a quasi-steady state where the charge transfer state has about a 10% population. Population. Interestingly, this charge transfer state has a lower population than you would predict on the basis of the energy of that charge transfer state relative to the A612 excitation. So that's because there's this exciton forming which stabilizes the excitation on A612. And this is an effect that you wouldn't capture with a simple Limblad approach. If you used a naive Limblad approach, If you used a naive Limblad approach, you wouldn't be able to capture the fact that exciton formation changes the energies of the excited states and therefore changes the rate of charge transfer processes going on. So what we've also done is we've looked at the overall decay of the exit population, this blue line here, for a couple of different exciton-Hamiltonian models. So these exciton-Hamiltonian models have. So, these exoton-Hamiltonian models are parameterized based off of experimental data, sort of various sort of spectroscopies. And interestingly, what we find is that the lifetime of the chlorophyll excitation in LHC2 depends pretty strongly on the energies on the exciton Hamiltonians. Even though we're describing the charge transfer process, so we're describing the quenching in the same way, but the only thing that's changing is the exciton Hamilton. So, the only thing that's changing is the exciton haloton. So, there is quenching going on. So, the intrinsic lifetime due to non-radiated decay is about 4,000 picoseconds. These are about either sort of 20% or about 10% of that. And these numbers compare reasonably well to experiments. So, the experimental lifetime is about 2,000 picoseconds. We didn't do any reparameterization here, we just used parameters for. Here we just use parameters from MD studies. So I think the main discrepancy here, as well as the errors clearly in the exciton Hamiltonian, come from errors in the charge transfer parameters. But I was pretty pleased that we could get even the right order of magnitude, given that the rate of charge transfer is sort of exponentially sensitive to LGBT. So we can understand the difference between these different exciton Hamiltonians as arising. Exciton Hamiltonians is arising due to the different energies of the A611 and A612 excitations within these two different Hamiltonians. So in the model 2 case, the A611, A612 excitation is the, these are the lowest energy excitations, whereas in this other model, these are something like the fourth or fifth lowest energy. So we're seeing that the sort of energy funnel here is playing a big role. Funnel here is playing a big role in the charge transfer mediated quenching. I will wrap up very quickly. We can investigate how this works in more detail, but we can just play around with these models by shifting the energies of the excited states. And we see that this does also have a big effect on excitation energy, even with relatively small shifts of only about 500 wave numbers. So this is roughly a Numbers. So this is roughly in the order of the, this is less than the range of excitation energies in these Hamiltonians. So I think this has some interesting implications for understanding NPQ. So I think this suggests that the energy funnel and structural changes in proteins which modulate this energy funnel could play a big role in facilitating this quenching process in real systems. So, yeah, just to summarize, I think I've I think I've presented this framework for describing loss processes using this transient projection approach in the context of LHC2, but I think it can be applied to a whole range of open quantum systems. And I don't think it's limited to HOM. I think you can apply it with other sort of exact open quantum system dynamics methods. There'll hopefully be lots more interesting biological applications to come. And just to re-emphasize the HEOM code and hybrid HEOM code, if you want to play around with it and you know Code. If you want to play around with it and you know MATLAB, I wrote it in MATLAB because I quite like MATLAB and I know lots of other people like MATLAB, but I couldn't find a MATLAB implementation of it. So yeah, that just leaves me to say thanks to the Liver Group and also Graham Fleming and Audrey Short. Audrey Short's a PhD student of Graham who these are the people who got me interested in this whole book. So thank you very much. That bell was a bit of a handful. Bit of a hint. Hopefully, I will squeeze in a couple of quick questions if there are any. So, beautiful talk. Wondering, does your charge transfer sort of perturbative approach you talked about, and you said you can take it to a platform and make a Machaudian approximation. Does that have, if you go to high temperature, do you just end up with a Marcus rate? Is that Yeah, so the the rate that appears in it is basically exactly the markets rate, the the Marcus rate, yeah. Um where you have to pick some characteristic energy if you're excited. Characteristic energy of your excited states and some characteristic coupling. And the polarization bath, do you also just model that as path of bosonic? Yeah, in this case, I just modelled it typically. But the theory, actually, in principle, you could describe that polarization bath as anharmonic. You could describe it with any model you want, basically. So the parameters for the LHC2 charge transfer kind of assume a harmonic bath. Assume a harmonic bath, so I used a harmonic bath in this case. But yeah, in principle, it's not limited to harmonic baths coupled to that charge transfer process. Any quick questions online you want to sneak in before? Hi, Tom, it's Anton Turkishkin. Nice to meet you. Hi. Um I have a what do you think about a modified redfield um uh approach in uh quantum biology Biology, it is often discussed as a perturbative theory, but also generalization between Redfield and First Alta-Strong Carpenter, weak and altar-strong company regime. Did you work with it? What do you think about its perspective to describe excitation energy transfer? Yeah, I haven't worked with it personally, and I'd be interested to. I think you know. I think through this hybrid HEOM method, we have a decent benchmark, I think, for comparing some of these more approximate theories to these modified red field theories. One thing that's missing, I think, in the sort of generalized first modified red field theory type methods that emerges in this is that you get shifts, kind of lamb shift-type terms appearing through this transient projection approach, which I think are just. Projection approach, which I think are just thrown away, or like yeah, which are thrown away in these other approaches. And I don't have a sense for how important they actually are, but there's certainly, I think, some physics missing from this sort of coherent modified red field theory, generalized versatile type theories, which we naturally incorporate in this so you mean the bland shift. You say that the modified rental theory and negative Theory and neglected elements. Yes. Yeah, so specifically, the generalized first theory misses a lamb shift between sort of different blocks. Maybe a bit hard to explain just in words in this very limited timeframe, but I think. Okay. In this very short question, do I currently understand that exist on lifetime means a time or time which uh takes for hexitone to turn into the charge transfer state. Well, it's just the time for the uh so experimentally it's the fluorescence lifetime. So it's how long does fluorescence last in these systems, which is which correlates with what is the population of all of the different chlorophyll excitations. And so longer excitation time, exciton lifetime is better or worse for if you want to So if you want to, it it it depends. If your plant is under low light conditions, you want this to be very long so that the excitation goes into your reaction centers. But if you're under high light conditions, then you want this excitation lifetime to be very short so that you're not getting damage and getting sort of photochemical damage. So it depends on the environmental conditions. And so if it's called lifetime means time of fluorescence, At a time of fluorescence, then it is true that the mathematical models you can see here include repopulation terms or fluorescence terms. So what I also incorporate into this is through this transient projection framework, you can incorporate fluorescence through just including the bath of electromagnetic modes. And so you can include spontaneous emission perturbatively through the same kind of framework as we treat this charge. Kind of framework as we treat this charge transfer whilst treating the exciton dynamics still with HOM. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Very interesting talk. I think if there's any more questions, we'll save them for the coffee break. Thank Thomas again.
