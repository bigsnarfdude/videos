Welcome back. I think after three talks on minimum theory, it's going to have to turn to geometric flows. It's my pleasure to introduce Professor Elberchang, who will speak about recipe flow on gun convectory manifolds. Thank you. Thanks for the introduction and also, of course, for the invitation to talk here. I'm talking here first time at this location of the birds. So good to be here. And I was just going to apologize for the change in topic, but you can camera for me. So a bit of a departure from previous talks talking about Ricci flow, but I hope you find it interesting. And I know there's a couple people here, other experts on Ricci flow, on non-compact manifolds as well. On non-compact metaphors as well. So, so, anyways, I'll be talking about Ricci Flow on non-compact three metapholds, and in particular about a conjecture on this, which goes back perhaps right to the beginning of Ricci Flow when it was first considered on non-compact manifolds. So, that's kind of nice. And Ricci flow. Flow, which by now needs perhaps not no introduction, but not too much introduction. Everyone's probably heard of it before, is the evolution equation, following evolution equation for a family of Riemannian metrics on a manifold. It's the evolution that The evolution that the family of metrics evolves at every point in space-time by minus twice its Ricci curvature. And it is an evolution equation for an initial metric on a manifold. Okay, so let me start by saying, well, on compact manifolds, Manifolds. On compact manifolds, it is known that there exists a smooth, short-time solution emerging from any smooth metric on a manifold. And this is famous result of Hamilton, first result for Ricci flow. And when M is non-compact. When M is non-compact. Let me start by saying the first result proved for Ricci form of non-compact manifolds is the following. There exists a smooth, complete bounded curvature solution. There exists a smooth, complete bounded curvature solution provided the initial metric is a smooth, complete bounded curvature metric. Okay, and this is the result of Xi in 89. So there exists a solution, a complete boundary curve. This is a solution, a complete boundary curvature solution emerging from any such initial metric. Later, we can put uniqueness in here within the class of such solutions. This was by Chen in Ju, considerably later. And I'm suppressing a little bit in what I write here, like, for example, the existence time of this solution, the curvature bounds of the solution. Curvature bounds of the solution, these depend only on the initial curvature bound of the metric. And actually, I'm suppressing a bit more. The initial metric is assumed to have targeted curvature, but possibly unbounded derivatives of curvature, whereas a solution has bounds on the derivatives of curvature to all orders. Okay, so immediately bounds all derivatives of curvature. But anyway, so for the most part in this talk, I'm just talking about existence. This talk: I'm just talking about the existence of solutions by which I mean short-term existence. So, general strategy for let me put this darker. General strategy adopted by Xi and the general strategy to most of the results that I'll be talking about today to solving Ricci flow on non-compact. Flow on non-compact manifolds is given your initial manifold is to approximate it with nicer manifolds. Now that approximation can be by bounded curvature complete manifolds or compact manifolds or anything that you can approximate your initial manifold with from which you have known solutions. Known solutions to Ricci flow. And then, of course, try to let I go into infinity and you flow every member of an approximation of M and hope that the solutions converge to a limit solution. Okay, so this is for Xi, the general strategy was in fact to look at just pick an exhaustion of M by. Pick an exhaustion of M by subdomains with smooth boundary, solve the Ricci flow Eurichley problem with constant boundary conditions and get the solutions of that and estimate them to get a limit solution. But in general, you just want a nice approximation. So, actually, to appreciate Xi's result and just in general, the other results I'll be talking about, it's Results I'll be talking about, it's still useful. We can still learn from just asking: you know, what did it take to solve Ricci flow on a compact manifold? You know, what is general theory by, you know, usually we just refer to, and what happens if we just apply that to the non-compact case? You know, what role does the additional geometry play? So, on compact manifolds, so first I should say in many, perhaps most applications of Ricci flow. Of Ricci flow, the actual equation solved is not exactly this equation, but is so-called a reparametrize of Ricci flow, a deterrent reparametrization, which is parametrically different, but geometrically the same, but in particular is strictly parabolic instead of this, which is just weakly. But at any rate, deterred flow or just weakly parabolic Riesy flow on a compact manifold, how do you solve it? How do you solve it? You solve the linearized equation for arbitrary right-hand side, and then you invoke implicit function theorems in Frechet or Banach spaces, and you just get general theory, you get existence. So for that, what do you need? I mean, you can apply that to the non-compact case, and you can certainly get something. So you need function spaces. Those require a norm, right? Those require a norm, right, for tensor or function spaces. So, how do you get a norm for your function spaces? Well, you get these through local charts, right? You have to have, and to apply interior estimates on these, you need to cover M by uniformly sized charts. You want your metric to look nice in these charts, to start off in the bonach space of your choice or function space. So, at any rate, just to apply the general theory classic approach, you need to. Theory classic approach, you need to cover your manifold by uniformly sized coordinate charts in which the metric is uniformly nice. And that is essentially a bound on the geometry. So actually, you can do that. And like I said, you can get a result. To do it kind of in a classic setting, which maybe like say C2 alpha Banach spaces would actually require something on the order of bounded curvature and gradient of curvature, right? To have a C2 alpha bound on your metric. To have a C2 alpha bound on your metric in uniform size charts. So you can do that. So Xi's result is kind of, you know, getting just a little sharper. It's just a little bit subtle, but curvature bound alone is kind of breaking beyond what would be just the classic approach by general theory. So, anyways, this is what she did. And let me ask now. Let me ask now. So, what motivated she to first look at Ricci flow on non-compact manifolds? So, she was motivated by two in non-compact Riemannian geometry. And first, was to classify complete non-compact. Complete non-compact three manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Okay. So that the universal cover which you want to show is S2 cross R or S3. Why that? Well, probably because, just so probably because just to generalize. Probably because just to generalize what Hamilton did by that time for compact manifolds, he classified non-negative Ricci curvature compact three manifolds using Ricci flow. So it's very natural at that time to be motivated by this. So there was another problem which motivated Xi at the time, and that is to classify, also a problem of classification, classify n-dimensional. Classify n-dimensional complete non-compact Taylor manifolds with non-negative holomorphic bisection curvature. Okay, so very different kind of setting to this is motivation probably because the conjecture is that at least when positively curved, that this is just biholomorphic to Cn. Biholomorphic to Cn. This is Yao's conjecture, and this was all in Xi's thesis, so that was probably his motivation at the time. So, anyways, Xi was motivated by these two problems, and he obtained partial results on these using his existence theorem here, partial results for, at least for bounded curvature metrics. Okay, so I should say that since Xi's work, so this. Since Xi's work, so this problem of classifying complete non-compact non-negative Ricci curvature manifolds, this is since settled by Gang Liu by completely non-Ricci flow techniques. I don't know if there were, I don't think there were any results in between what she did here and Liu's final resolution of this. And in this case, also by Gang Liu using. Also, by Ganglium using non-Ricci flow techniques, Ganglium classified such Haler manifolds, assuming they had, it's a very natural assumption for these manifolds, had Euclidean volume growth, maximal volume growth. And I should say soon after, as in a couple months after, completely independently, Liu's result here was reproved by Man Chun Li and Linfei Tam using strictly just a pure Taylor-Ricci flow. Strictly just a pure Taylor-Ricci flow proof. Okay. So, anyways, so now completely classified and largely classified, but not completely. But so what is left? So in spite of that, despite that, for Ricci flow, it's still entirely open whether an arbitrary metric from this class or from this class can be flowed. Okay, solutions starting anywhere in here. Solutions starting anywhere in here is still open. So it's this case that is the conjecture that the talk is based on conjecture. So if this is a three-dimensional complete non-compact manifold with non-negative Ricci, then there exists a smooth A smooth, let me put it right under here. Complete non-negative Ricci solution G of T emerging. So conjecture that there exists such a metric emerging from any such manifold. Okay. So this is a somewhat So, this is a somewhat, let me call it folklore conjecture. One can imagine only that Xi was probably had this in mind or would have believed this when he was working on this case for the bounded curvature metrics, but he had not written this down as a conjecture. I don't know if he even said that there should be solutions. And I think much later, Peter Topping wrote, formally conjectured, something more general than this. Something more general than this: that in n dimensions, an n-dimensional complete PIC one curvature manifold, one positive isotopic curvature manifold, has a complete solution with one isoparametric, with pick one non-negative curvature. And this is just a special case of Topping's conjecture. But, anyways, even Topping's paper, I think he refers to this as a problem. To this, as a problem which has long been known to experts. So, folklore conjecture. For that matter, it's still a conjecture that there exists a complete non-negative bisexual curvature metric evolving from any of these. That would be very interesting as well to know about. So that is the main conjecture. That is the main conjecture, and the talk is about results on this conjecture. When can you produce such a solution emerging from such a metric? So despite this conjecture, I want to also note the following example: that there's no complete solution. Expected. Here's an example where, in contrast, no solution is believed to emerge, the exact proof of which is not still not completely known. So, this is maybe this is the folklore example. If that's the folklore conjecture, I think. Or conjecture, I think it's safe to say experts all have this in mind. Even Xi in his first paper said without any further proof that it is easy to construct examples of unbounded curvature complete metrics from which there's no solution. Okay, but so this is the standard example experts would have of a complete three-dimensional. Complete three-dimensional manifold from which no solution is expected to emerge. And no solution. So, what is this? This is uniformly sized. It's like an infinite dumbbell. The weights are all uniform size. There's variations of these where the weights shrink as well, but uniform size S3s attached by thinner and thinner necks as you go out. To help the example along, you can make the necks get longer and longer too. Next get longer and longer, too, but they're variations of the same theme. And there's no expected solution to emerge from this because you expect the little S2 on a very thin neck like this to collapse in a time faster than any assumed existence time. You expect it to collapse in a time approaching zero as you go out. So I say expected because, as was correctly pointed out by Pointed out by Chopping in one of his papers, I think maybe 2013 or so. Okay, that might be around that time. To make this argument rigorous, one actually uses pseudolocality for Ricci flow. A pseudo-locality would guarantee that applied kind of intuitively to this example would apply that these S3s stay uniformly sized along any assumed solution, and it's the uniform. And it's the uniform size of these S3s that is preserved, which will force these, in a way, by minimal S3 argument, S2 argument, force these to collapse. On the other hand, pseudolocality so far is only known to hold in full generality, assuming that you're looking inside a complete bounded curvature solution. But this is, you know, by construction, not such a thing. So it's expected that this is an example where there's no This is an example where there's no solution emerging. And in the context of this conjecture, one can actually hook up this example to have Ricci curvature bounded below by a negative constant as close to zero as you like. So just making this conjecture a little sharper that you don't expect to be able to weaken this assumption alone, right, to just a Richie lower bound. Okay. Okay. So, in a way, this might be the most basic, as far as I know, this is still, you know, this following conjecture is maybe the most basic and still open conjecture. There exists a complete Riemannian manifold, non-compact Romanian manifold, from which no complete solution emerges. But, anyways, so it is this example. All right, so then results results on relating to this conjecture so conjecture holds Provided. So the conjecture is known in the following cases. So, okay, I'll be reviewing some past results. Some of these results have, you know, are just kind of specific or three-dimensional cases of more general results. And I'll just mention those maybe just in words, but amezus ribas. Ebezos, Rebas, and Will King in 2011 showed that the conjecture holds if G is further assumed to have non-negative sectional curvature. Okay, so if we further assume this is a non-negative sectional curvature metric, then they prove that there's a complete non-negative sectional curvature solution. Negative sectional curvature solution emerging from it. In fact, more generally, they prove when for arbitrary dimensions, if there's a non-negative complex sectional curvature metric, then there's a solution likewise non-negative complex sectional emerging from it. So, this is the three-dimensional result of the result, which holds for all dimensions. Holds over all dimensions. Okay, so if we strengthen this, then to sectional curvature, we get the result. Result of OCAR, 2017. Hocard proved that if in addition to the hypothesis here and the conjecture, one assumes that the volume If you assume that unit volumes are uniformly bounded below on the whole manifold, it's non-volume collapsed in this sense. So what he proved is actually that Hokard proved that assuming this and non-negative Ricci, there is a complete solution emerging from it. And the fact that the solution also The fact that the solution also has non-negative Ricci or non-negative Ricci is preserved, that was, let me just say, the fact that the non-negative Ricci is preserved is Chen Chen Chang okay. Okay, forgive me. There might be more. Let me say, Chenj, AL. I will. I will correct myself or I will add that in maybe later. Maybe I'll make an announcement before I introduce the next tomorrow, just update that. But that was approved later. Okay. The non-negative reaching preserved. Okay. And more generally, let me say, what did Hokard show? What did Hokard show? More generally, under this volume non-collapsing, in fact, he only required Ricci to be bounded below by any constant. In the non-negative curvature case, we have this result, and it's actually preserved. Okay. So, more recently, 2021, Ye Lai. One, Yilai had proved the following: that the conjecture holds, well, she had proved that on any such manifold, there always exists a non-negative Ricci curvature solution emerging from any such metric. The only drawback is that she did not show that the solution is complete for all time. The solution is complete for all times. So let me say: to keep this wording as such, the conjecture holds provided we remove completeness condition always exists and non-negative. So in some sense, and this is going to be kind of the basis for our results. So what Lai showed is that, or based on Lai's result, it reduces the conjecture to showing that the construction, the solution constructed by The solution constructed by is complete. Okay, you can start from there. There's always a non-negative reaching curvature solution. Okay. So what are our results? Okay, so those are the results I wanted to mention. And our results are the following. Martins and myself, this is very recent. So there exists a real function f of r. Going to zero, and sorry, it goes to infinity, such that conjecture holds provided provided that from some point, from some point, the volume of our balls is bounded below as. Is bounded below as f of r cubed. Okay. Okay, so provided we have a bound on volumes from some point and a bound which is allowed to degenerate as we go to infinity. So just to Just to make a comment about this. So, if we have complete and non-negative reaching, that implies that volumes from any point on the one hand, they grow at least, or at most, like a constant times r cubed. So, at most, Euclidean volume growth, that's just a Bishop Gromov volume comparison. Bishop Gromov volume comparison. In fact, this C, I suppose, Bishop Gromov would just be the volume of the unit ball in R3. Okay, so it's always bound, volume is always bounded above by Euclidean growth, and it is always at least linear. Okay, if always at least linear volume growth. This is, I believe, by Yao. Okay, so that. Okay, so that this so this f is somewhere in between here, um, and in particular, um, the closer. Well, it'd be very good if we could show that f approaches something like c over r squared, because then that would be basically capturing all possible manifolds in the conjecture. But anyways, so all manifolds in the conjecture have volume growth like this between that and that. Between that and that. Okay. On the other hand, just a not too hard computation will show what this, you can interpret this F here in terms of the volume of unit balls at an arbitrary point. So, to relate it to Hokard's result over there, so if you consider any point of a distance d from P, then the Distance D from P, then the unit volume at Q is at least so little. This is just volume comparison, Bishop-Gromoff volume. It's at least that much. You just make the radius bigger, divide like this, and you just triangle inequality. Okay, you just change. Inequality. Okay, you just change the base point from p to q and decrease the radius. It's this triangle. And on the other hand, this ratio is exactly what we're hypothesizing about. This is f of d over 8. And so d is the distance from q to some fixed point p. So this function f here can be interpreted as a It is a bound on the degenerating, possibly degenerating volumes of unit balls. So you can think of it as a perturbation around this result of Hokards with a uniform unit volume bound. So, second theorem. Okay lecture holds provided so if we assume that we're on R3 and And if the metric G in the conjecture is a compact perturbation of a non-negative sectional curvature metric. So, if it's a non-negative reaching curvature, it's a compact non-negative reaching curvature of perturbation of Perturbation of a non-negative sectional curvature metric, as in here, and we assume the manifold is R3, then we also have the result. So you can imagine you could probably make this a little bit increase the class of metrics in here a little more by saying if you have a metric which has non-negative Ricci curvature and it's a limit of non-negative Ricci curvature perturbation. Non-negative reaching curvature perturbations of non-negative sectional curvature metrics, the result would hold as well. But, anyways, so this one and the proof is based very much on perturbing basically the construction in here, result of Cabezus-Rivas-Wilking. And the other one I related to this result of Hokard. But in all cases, like I said, the proof involves starting from this solution construction. Starting from this solution constructed by Lie and showing that under these additional assumptions, one gets completeness. So, okay, so let me sketch proofs and Proofs and like I said, the proofs start with the solution or lies solution. Okay, so lies solution. Let me just say something about this. Yes. How to see if the pollution is affected by a live complete or not like like a what what the what the animal wants to do? But the enemy one, it's the enemy to an example which well, luckily, there's no solution, there's no example which is strictly known to be incomplete. But let me do this and then maybe you see what the I think I know what you're saying. I don't know. I don't know. Let's see. Okay. So Lai's solution is to To why do I always use approximate your manifold in this case with compact manifolds to get to get a compact approximation to your initial non-negative reaching curvature manifold. This is actually not hard. It just involves, you just need M to be orientable. So the argument is on the universal cover. And you just look at domains with orientable boundary. You kind of basically you double them. Basically, you double them in a smooth way. So it's not hard to get approximations like this, where essentially the whole lower half, almost the whole lower half of this, is isometric to what it sits over in your M and G. Okay, so it's not hard to find a compact approximation of your non-compact guy. But what is hard in this doubling construction is it's hard to control. There could be little right on the meridian where you're doing the doubling and just doing some fancy stuff. Doing some fancy stuff, it's hard not to guarantee you don't introduce some very highly curved areas, some bumps like this. And when you flow such a thing, well, it's hard to prevent such a bump in curvature from becoming singular in a time ti, which may go to zero as i goes to infinity. So, looking at the Ricci flows from this simply constructed approximation. Simply constructed approximation, it's very hard to control them and take a limit on them to get a limit solution. Instead, what Lie looks at is the so-called corresponding singular Ricci flows M script I, script Mi emerging from this initial manifold. And singular Ricci flows, these were introduced by Kleiner and Lott. And what these are is they're just singular Ricci flows is a Singular Ricci flow is a four-dimensional Ricci flow space-time that contains the classic solution to Ricci flow, but it goes beyond it. Singular Ricci flow, if you were to watch the singular Ricci flow, so to say, emerge from a given compact three-manifold, you would basically be watching the Ricci flow performing Ricci flow with surgeries, as in Perlman's original program, where the surgeries are performed at the singular time. Next. Singular time. Next, the flows, things are flowed right up until next pinch, beyond which they separate and the remaining smooth parts or non-singular parts continue on flowing until they too get singular. So at the very end of a singular Ricci flow space-time, everything is singular, or else some parts just continuing flowing for all time. Okay. Okay. At any rate, what Lai showed is: although the solutions to Ricci flow may not exist to a uniform time over one of these MIs, inside each MI is some sigma i over which the flow does exist for a uniform time, and that these sigma i's with their solutions, these converge. These converge to a limit solution on M, and that Ricci, non-negative Ricci is preserved for these. Okay. So, okay. So let me just maybe say in these last remaining minutes, what I'll actually just do a bit more than just say it in words. I'll just write in point form, you know, the key and Form, you know, the key ingredients to showing that this solution is in fact complete under this assumption. So the key ingredients for us was, all right, so one of the key properties that Eli proved for these singular flows, which was not already proved by Kleiner and Lott, was that in these singular flows, one had Perlman's pseudolocality, Perlman's classic pseudolocality. Berlin's classic pseudo-locality locality result. So sufficiently Euclidean regions survive for some uniform time and stay, they have curvature bounds. Classically, that assumed you're in an ambient, complete, non-compact Ricci flow, and she extended that to being valid inside singular Ricci flows. And Bocard, Simon, Hopping, pseudo. Pseudo so on the other hand, Hokard and Simon Topping since then proved a version of pseudo-locality, which was valid in three dimensions. It also relied on being in a complete non-compact bounded curvature complete solution, but only insofar as it depended on Perlman's pseudolocality. So, since Lie proves Perlman's pseudolocality holds in these singular flows, Holds in these singular flows. By checking the proof, we verify that this holds also within the singular flows, and their silolocality is somewhat stronger and lets us do something like the following. Well, okay. Maybe let me just say, okay, in words. So P1 is checking that one. Checking that one has sun and topping and Pokard's pseudo-locality valid also in these singular flows. And the second key ingredient is something called the shrinking. So anyways, let me say the result of this pseudolocality or even Perlman pseudolocality is a curvature bound of the form C over T. C over T. And the shrinking ball lemma in Ricci flow is a lemma which says when you have local curvature bounds like C over T, right, possibly getting singular at time zero, this is enough to give you see a bound like this. So leaving out some So, leaving out some details, but if you have C over T curvature bounds on some domain, let's say, and shrinking ball lemma says you have such an inclusion, and you can imagine how do you use this to get completeness, such an inclusion. Well, you just say that if you have a geodesic on the manifold crossing through every R ball in the initial metric, then that picks up. Then that picks up every time you do so, it picks up at least this much distance in the metric at time t. And you cook things up, you show that for such some such choice of f, you can apply to the locality of Simon Topping and Hokar, and then shrinking ball lemma and get completeness that way. There's not quite time to say any more detail, but let me just say that. Detail but I'm just gonna
