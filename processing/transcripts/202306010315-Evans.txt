I suppose you can move it up and get the other one down. Yeah, yeah, so it's very well done. Okay, perfect. So, thanks a lot to everybody. And so, we will start this first talk of the sequence session with the talk by Josephine Devans on existence and stability of NESS. One debt came out, please. All right, so thank you very much. So, thank you very much for the invitation. So, yes, it's a very nice conference. I have learned a lot. So, I'm going to talk about a joint work with Angli Kim and Agaki about non-equilibrium steady states, convergence towards non-equilibrium steady states in kinetic theory. So, as we heard, I think on Monday or Tuesday, we learned a bit about non-equilibrium steady states. So, these are states. Equilibrium steady states. So these are states where there is some kind of the density remains the same, but there is some kind of flow going around, some kind of circulation or movement of macroscopic quantities. So in this case, it's going to be about heat transfer. So I will write down the equation and then maybe my explanation will make a little bit more sense. So I'm thinking about this BGK model, which is this. Which is this So X is in 01, V is in R. So this is a kind of toy model for the Boltzmann equation. So instead of the very complicated Boltzmann collision kernel, we have a much tamer but still Much tamer, but still non-linear kernel, where this MF is exactly the Maxwellian in velocity with the same mass, momentum, and temperature as that. So I didn't write down the names of BGK and I've forgotten them, but there are three physicists. Thank you who wrote down this equation. And I think it's it's mainly used today for numerics for um Navier Stokes. Thank you. So, what I want to do is add in some way a thermostat to this equation. So this represents, so let me, I should tell you what F is the, I think you know from this morning already, but F is the density of gas particles. Of gas particles in phase space. So this is the BGK operator, and it represents the interaction of particles with each other to push towards having a Maxwellian equilibrium in velocity. And then this thermostat is going to, so we learned that to get an equilibrium We learned that to get a non-equilibrium steady state, you need to be in an open system, and this thermostat is going to represent something that takes heat in and out of the system and will knock us out of being in a nice Maxwellian equilibrium. So with Engliki, we've studied two different kinds of thermostat, one where we can do more than others. So the first situation is we do more. Is getting more physical, so we have diffusive boundary conditions with different temperatures. So, I'm not going to write down exactly what diffusive boundary conditions are, but you can just imagine. Conditions are, but you can just imagine when particles hit the edge of the domain at zero or one, then they have to return, and they have to return with some distribution in velocity, which we choose. And so you can define a temperature for that distribution in velocity. So you can say the particles coming in from the left are colder, so they're moving much slower than the particles coming in from the right. So you can see somehow, I don't know if you think about this. Think about this, it's maybe a good example of what a non-equilibrium steady state will look like. So, if the particles coming from here are going much faster, then you're going to have particles going very fast in this direction and then coming back quite slowly, even though they're inter, you know, at least if the effect of the boundary conditions is strong, is stronger in some sense than the mixing between the different particles. So, you're going. Different particles. So you're going to have a kind of small number of particles going very fast to the left and a much larger number of particles coming slowly to the right. So this is quite different to the kind of situation where your velocity is kind of homogeneous all over the space and your particles are entering, you know, your particles coming to a position. If you're coming to a position X, the particles that come from over here look Particles that come from over here look very much the same as the particles come from over here. That's the kind of equilibrium situation, where in this non-equilibrium situation, you see very different things if you look to the left or the right. And then situation two is maybe a bit less physical. So we put periodic boundary conditions and And we add BGK type thumbs up all the space. So it looks like what we add to the equation will be rho f F times M tau X for V minus F. So instead of your particles going towards a Maxwellian with the same first three moments in velocity as your distribution F, we're going towards a Maxwellian with the same mass, the same local density, but it has some fixed temperature and zero velocity. And we choose this temperature to And we choose this temperature to vary throughout the space. So we can imagine this represents an interaction with another gas which is stable and has a fixed temperature tau of x. So I guess for both these situations, we expect to have a kind of complicated steady state that is not a max volume. So we expect for steady states to be far from Maxwellian in some sense. So I should say, I mean, I don't know if everyone here calls her Maxwellian a Maxwellian. It's a Gaussian. So if this equation in these two situations has a steady state, we expect it, at least in some choice of parameters, to be quite different to Quite different to being a Maxwellian steady state. And so, this is interesting to me, I suppose, because a lot of the work on convergence to equilibrium in kinetic theory relies very strongly on having Maxwellian steady states and knowing a lot about how your steady state is. So, I would like to see if we can do some of the same things when you know a lot less about your steady state. And, you know, I guess the dream is this extends to more complicated and more physically realistic models like oscillator chains that Angriki has worked on a lot, or Boltzmann models with thermal boundary conditions, things like this. So there are a lot of previous works, though, I mean, not a huge amount, I suppose, but plenty of previous works on looking at non-equilibrium studies. Looking at non-equilibrium steady states in kinetic theory. So, I can't list all the papers, especially because blackboard talking would take a long time, but maybe I can tell you the people, I guess. So, Arki Ridden Nuri Esposito Preferly Esposito, not Antonio. Mara well. Well Jim Levowitz Levovitz Carolyn Moore and probably some other people as well but most of the papers I know are by some subset of these people in different formulations. And so So most situations, I mean, okay, with everything in life, it's easier to work in a perturbative setting from a linear equation. So there are lots of different ways with these equations that you can set up the perturbative settings. So for example, if the temperature of these two walls are close, if you have diffusive boundary conditions where the temperature doesn't vary very much, then you can do stuff. You can do stuff. And so, a lot of the works, particularly for Bottomen, are in that situation where the boundary temperature doesn't vary very much. Also, I guess, not exactly a perturbative setting, but if this kappa is very, very small, then you'll be close to the hydrodynamic limit. And then again, you can do stuff using knowledge of your hydrodynamic limit. But in either of those situations, I mean, they're very hard, very good papers on those, but in either of those situations, you will be quite close to being. Those situations, you will be quite close to being Maxwellian in velocity. So, this is a kind of different situation to what Angeliki and I have been looking at. So, our perturbative setting for the first situation is when CAPR is very, very big, so you're close to free transport, but your world temperatures can still be very different. And then for the second situation, it's when the thermostat is very, very strong compared to the Compared to the self-interaction, the non-linear part. So, again, you'll be close to the solution of a linear equation, but the steady state of that linear equation or the steady state of your non-linear equation won't be max value. That's kind of the situation we're interested in. So, I'll tell you probably just What our results are. So, in both cases, we have existence of a steady state. We're done with Paul G. And coming with our existence proofs, we have some. existence proofs we have some bounds on the we have some pointwise bounds on quantities that are integrated in velocity so which are quite important so maybe I will say pointwise bound on stuff of the form like this um And these kind of bounds are kind of necessary if you want to run some convergence to equilibrium arguments without knowing anything more about your steady state. I think you at least need to know something. At least, I'm not aware of any kind of kinetic, inhomogeneous kinetic proofs of convergence to equilibrium where you don't have some very strong information about these quantities. Um, so uh, I'm not really going to talk about how we showed existence at all, um, but I wanted to tell you a little bit about um stability. Uh, so if we look at the linearized equation around G, we have We have say this equation looks a bit horrible. So, those of you who've worked on BGK before, you'll recognize this looks similar to the linearized BGK model. And so, here, Tg is the temperature of G. And then we also have a very good idea. And then we also, in situation two at least, will have something coming from the thermostat. So, since in both cases our thermostat is a kind of linear operator, this doesn't change. So, what I would like to do, what we would like to do is show linear stability. So, we would want to show that H goes to That h goes to zero in some appropriate norm. So, I mean, choosing this norm, maybe there's a choice you have to make, which is a little bit unclear. I mean, we chose a norm that kind of works, but when we can't do it, maybe you can choose a better norm. But so, what we did is we What we did is we were using some now relatively classical hypercoercivity theory. We were building a proof on the L2 hypercoercivity theory due to Dorber, Moore and Schmeiser, some of whom are here. And in that proof, in the way the mechanism for proving convergence to equilibrium for spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equations works. Homogeneous kinetic equations works is you look at kind of well, there's lots of there's there's plenty to it, but say you you have um uh collisions and transport and you hope that kind of the collisions push towards equilibrium in velocity. So, in our case, that would be towards functions of the form phi of x, g of xv and transport pushes you towards maybe 10 forts squared, pushes you towards Towards equilibrium in X, if you're opposed to equilibrium in velocity. And this does you have a coercivity technique to say that if you've got these two, so this is called microcoerciity. Microcoercivity and macrocurci. So the RL2 hypercursivity proof shows that if you've got both these things and various other conditions, then you will have, then you can show, then you can construct a new norm to show that h converges to zero. So, what we did is in this equation, you can't use what would be your physical collision and transport operators in the same way, but you can just use the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of this operator in L2G. So, you pretend the symmetric parts is your collisions, and then the transport part. Transport part, you say, is your anti-symmetric part you call your transport part, and then run this proof as a kind of abstract piece of machinery. And for lots of situations, that would work. I mean, so I think that that idea comes from a paper of Calves, Rohan, and Schmeiser about the run and tumble equation for hematoxis. Hematoxis to just kind of ignore what would be the real collisions and the real transport and use instead symmetric and anti-symmetric parts in the right space. So in lots of situations that works, provided you have some good controls over these kind of quantities, you understand how they decay and you can bound them enough. Sorry, I realize I'm being very vague, but I'm. But what I wanted just to show you here is that for our situation, microscopic coercivity can really fail in maybe a kind of interesting way. Interesting to me anyway. So maybe it's worth saying, I think I didn't really say that. Think I didn't really say that this equation conserves mass and the BGK operator conserves first and second moments, but the thermostat won't, so we're only conserving mass. But maybe something is kind of going on a bit more with our first and second moments. So, what I wanted to say is that For the part of the operator, so for the collisions sorry, I would for the part of the operator without the send stuff. Microscopic cohesivity fails, which is maybe not very surprising if you only take half of the operator, you don't necessarily expect it to push you towards your equilibrium. And so you can find, in fact, you can find a polynomial in V Q which is of order two such that Q G Q G C of Q G is strictly positive. So L, sorry, I don't know what to call this. Yeah, the operator, the linearized operator. So we can find some directions which are kind of parallel to g times the first and second moments on which this is positive. And this size, the size of how positive this is. This is depends on the normalized third and fourth moments of G. So the something So, in our second case, whether So, in our second case, where the thermostat acts everywhere in the domain, we can just kill this positive term with a term from the thermostat, and everything is completely fine. In the first case, where we only have the thermostat acting on the boundaries, it's somehow not producing a full spectral gap on its own, and we don't know how to control this term at all. Maybe this is interesting, I guess, because the first case is somehow more physical. And we really, I think. And we really, I think, have no idea whether the steady state we find in this case is stable or not. And somehow something quite complicated is going on with your hydrodynamic quantities, but we're not able to work out what in any sensible sense. So, yeah, I think that is the end. Thank you very much. So, any questions? In the original paper by B, G, and K, there was this original additional non-linearity, right? You mean the rho squared, the exactly the row f. How difficult is it to incorporate it in the 1D cases as bad as in the higher dimensions? As bad as in the higher dimensions, so it's a little bit better. I mean, so I guess the whole reason we're doing, maybe not the whole reason we're doing VDK, is because it's much easier to show existence results for a one homogeneous equation. So we didn't try. It would definitely be, I mean, we couldn't use exactly what we did. It would definitely be more complicated. I don't know. I mean, so there is. Know, I mean, so there is existence of a steady state for Boltzmann in 1D in this situation due to Archirida Nuri, which is far is a large data existence result. So maybe you can just copy that proof in 1D for existence of a steady state. I mean, I'm sure it will not be exactly the same, but basically, they have a transformation, just you integrate in X from 0. In x from 0 to x, and then you turn your equation into something that's one homogeneous, and you can control the entropy. I don't understand the details more than that, but yeah, it seems like that might work. I also have a question about the model. I was wondering if you could extend your theory when you take V in R3 and you just take V1 in front of the DXF and you keep the Maxwellian as a Maxwellian in R3. Maxwellian, there's a Maxwellian and all that. Yeah, yeah. So, actually, I mean, so the stability stuff we did doesn't rely on being in 1D at all. And I think even the existence, so probably I think, yeah, I mean, the existence proof is very by hand because we do like do a man and then integrate along back and forwards along the interval according to the characteristics. So if you're in a if you're in a R. If you're in an R3, then you would have to trace around complicated characteristics. But of course, in your situation, if you're homogenous in that way, then it would be the same. Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I think that would probably be almost the same. I think it's quite interesting because I mean, then Google are really used by practitioners. Yeah, yeah. And I think it's really Really, really close to what is done in practice. And also, just to link with, I just wanted to say that up to my knowledge, if you take V naught 3 and you take V1, and if you also take the row in front of the equation, I think maybe Francois can comment, but I think that there is still no existence of weak solutions for this equation. Solutions for this equation. Yeah, with the rule front. Yes. I mean, so even for the non-steady equation, it's still completely open. No, I know. I keep seeing Mario Pomarenzi bring this point up. But I guess it's a very hard problem, actually. Yeah, I suppose that just older guys remember when people tried to do that in the early 90s. In the early 90s, once we had the internal solution for the Watsman. And I think it still remains something which. But I think statistics should be easier, right? Yeah, yeah, but you have to just have dimensions, so I don't know. I mean, in a very, I don't know what's going on kind of way. But yeah, I mean, because there is this accredited proof for the Polesman and the stuff, maybe also what happens. I don't know. So the very very last comment is that actually there is a whole theory which basically done by physicists and which has not really reached the dynamical world. In the case in which instead of taking the full BGK that you have, you take a linearized version of it. And then you can do a lot of computations. And so you have, in some sense, sort of a complete description of the linearization. Sort of a complete description of the linearized theory with formulas. And so I think it's something which is maybe interesting to understand the non-linear case, in which, of course, you cannot do the explicit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I can. Okay, so for this first case, I have. For this first case, I have no idea. I mean, I guess I have absolutely no idea if it is even true. For the second case, we run, for instance, we run a contraction mapping argument in a set where you have some bounds on your hydrodynamic quantities, in which case you have uniqueness in the set. And I imagine probably uniqueness in total, but yeah, we didn't prove that. Even if they're not unique, they're stable. Unique the stable, yeah. I mean, I think that if you think about for steady states, that's very possible. For you know, you could have multiple steady states of your model that are stable. I don't think there's anything depends on the notion of stability, but yeah, yes. I mean, obviously, your perturbation away from the steady state would have to be founded in some sense. So, I think we obviously were speaking of raw. Yeah, but the thing is, if you have some global bounds of the solution, then there's some sub-sequence that has to converge to some kind of steady state. And if it's stable, then the whole solution has to converge to a steady state. Is that possible? Well, I mean, if you just think about like an ODE with a double well, you have two stable steady states and one unstable steady state, it will converge to one of the steady states, so a subsequence will converge to this one or this. Will converge to this one or this one, but all steady states are real and stable. I mean, it might be true that all solutions converge to some steady states. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. But so I guess there are some results on like oscillator chains where actually the steady states they find are really quite strange. They have weird boundary behavior, like real big peaks in the density of the boundaries. And those are not the ones we found in this situation. So it may be that there is a difference. There is a different steady state that is stable in this one with the boundaries. But also, this is maybe some sense in which BGK is quite far from the real physics as well, so something very strange could happen, I think. More questions? So, thanks a lot.
