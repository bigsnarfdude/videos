And also, Dan, of course, who organized this conference and invited me to speak. Since this is our first talk, it would be helpful to mention briefly the main motivation, history, as well as position of this research subject in the global picture of modern. Global picture of modern science and technology. So, just in a few words, we shall be dealing with some topological problems which can be classified as mathematical foundations of AI. So here is a typical situation on this picture. We see a robot and many obstacles, and the robot needs to decide which trajectory its Its trajectory, its path from the initial position. Hi, Robert. Sorry for interrupting you, but it's not in a full screen. Maybe you can put in the play button. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, so we see a robot here surrounded by obstacles and the robot must find trajectory from the initial position to position to the target position. And I should say that algorithmic motion planning is a well-developed branch of modern robotics. And here I mentioned two books, monographs on algorithmic motion planning. And actually it's a very active area. Just in a few weeks' time, there is a big conference on this topic in Topic in the University of Maryland. So, in this work, we study mathematical problems inspired by motion planning, problem of robotics, and our main focus is on topological aspects. And our results can contribute to the development of the field of automated decision-making, which is a broader subject than motion planning, which is essential. Planning, which is an essential part of AI. And there are, in general, I mean, obviously, you can classify decisions into two big classes. One class when the set of possible choices is discrete. And examples here are left or right, buy or sell, red or green, and so on. So you choose between two or three or five options. Or three or five options, and other situations when we have a continuum of possible choices. And this second option is actually mainly relevant to what we will be discussing in this talk. In problems of robot motion planning, the algorithms make decisions with infinitely many choices. And here is a typical Is a typical situation, autonomous robot motion, when we ideally the robot receives an order or command expressed briefly in one of the natural languages, say in English, and decides itself how to implement it. For example, if you are dealing with a self-driving car, you may say drive me to Queen Mary Mile End Campus. Mary mile end campus, and the car should be able to find a suitable route and implement it moving within the street traffic and observing the traffic code. The mathematical theory of motion planning is about the structure and singularities of motion planning algorithms. So here are just basic kind of reminder of basic terminology. Remind of basic terminology which we use. So, every system we can associate to it a space which we call configuration space. Can you is it all right? Sorry. Okay, can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. So, a state of a system is described. The system is described by a finite set of numerical parameters, lengths, angles, and vector obtained by putting all these parameters together can be understood as a point in some Euclidean space, and variety of all these possible points, variety of all possible states is configuration space of this. The configuration space of the system. It comes with natural topology. So we can speak about continuity in the space of motions. We can discuss continuous motions of the system, which are represented by continuous curves in the configuration space. Okay, so now we can just. Now we can just reformulate the notion of motion planning algorithm using the notion of configuration space. So a motion planning algorithm in X, X is our configuration space, is the map from X cross X to X to the I. X to the I is a space of I is a space of curves, continuous curves in X. I is intervals 0, 1. So this for every pair of states, a motion planning algorithm associates a movement of the system, a curve in the configuration space, which starts at the first point and ends at the second point. And this condition. And this condition is expressed by saying that if you compose A with a natural projection, projection from x to the i to x cross x, which is given by evaluating the path at the beginning at the end point, then this composition should be the identity map. So, in other words, a motion planning algorithm. A motion planning algorithm is a section of this canonical map from x to the i to x cross x. And there is a lemma which says that the continuous section of this vibration exists if and only if x is contractible. And this example shows a convex subset. A convex subset of an Euclidean space, and here we can have a continuous motion planning algorithm just going along a straight line from A to B. But this may exist only if the configuration space is contractible. And in general, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the configuration space is contractible. Actually, typically they are not contractible. Actually, typically they are not contractible. So, the conclusion of this lemma is that typically any motion planning algorithm should be discontinuous. And we can measure the complexity of such algorithms using this invariant TC of X, which is defined as the minimum. The minimal number of open sets covering x cross x, such that over each of these sets there is a continuous section of this pass vibration. So TCX is a homotopy invariant of x, and it is zero if and only if x is contractible. So I'm just going through this well-known material. Just going through this well-known material as an introduction to some new results, which I will present in my talk. So, here are examples. Well, if we look at the sphere, sphere of odd dimension, Tc of Sn is one. You need only two sets to cover. cover x x so the first set which is denoted here by f0 is the set of not antipodal pairs a is not equal to minus b and here we are dealing with a circle but i mean this actually is true for any odd dimensional sphere so the first set is the set of not antipodal pairs Of not antipodal pairs, and the second set is a set of antipodal pairs. So, on the first set, to go from A to B, you can use the shortest geodesic arc. It is unique and continuously depends, depends continuously on the endpoints, so it is a good motion planning algorithm. And the second set, this F1, the set of antipodal pairs. One, the set of antipodal pairs. So here you need to fix, there is a problem this may work only if dimension is odd. So you can fix a tangent vector field on the sphere. It's a unique tangent vector field on the sphere and use it and go shoot geodesic arc from A to B in the direction of the tangent vector. Of the tangent vector at point A, and it is also a good solution over this set F1. In the case of even-dimensional sphere, you need extra one set. So I just want to mention that many people presented this conference, contributed important results into the development of the theory. The theory, and well, Sasha Dranishnikov, Hesuit Gandalis, Mark Grant, Dan Cohen, John O'Prereer, Peter Landweber, Lucy Vanderbrock, and others. And I also want to say that this method of using the sectional category to estimate complexity of algorithms was previously done by Smail and Vassiliev, who used Vassiliev, who used this technique for estimating complexity of algorithms for solving algebraic equations. Okay, so now, so this part was kind of basic well-known stuff. I'm sure everybody at this conference knows this quite well. And now I start a little. And now I start a little bit more recent, well, quite recent construction, which we call parametrized topological complexity. So this is based on two papers, which both are joined with Don Cohen and Schmuel-Weinberger, and one is already published, and the second is accepted in. In annals of mathematics and artificial intelligence. So, the purpose of this parametrize, so here emphasis is on parametrized. So, parametrized kind of intends to make motion planning algorithms more universal, more flexible, so that external conditions become part of Of input. So, the same algorithm can work for different positions of the obstacles, for example, which is quite natural. So, this is a formalism of parametrized setting. So, here we assume that we have a map P from E to B, which is E to B, which is typically a vibration, but in some applications it may be a map of a more general nature. But I will, in this talk, I will always assume that it is a vibration. So there are fibers. So fibers, different fibers, represent different configuration spaces, and the point in the base describes. Describes external conditions. So once a point in the base is determined, then the fiber is a pre-image of, as there is a fiber above this point. So we have a family of configuration spaces parametrized by the points of the base, which are understood as external conditions. And the typical example which And the typical example, which actually we studied in full detail, is this vibration which is called Faidel-Norved vibration. So here we have two sets of points, all distinct in R D. The first points which we call robots, and the second category of points we call Points we call obstacles. And this vibration, Fidel-Norvid vibration, associates to all this configuration of robots and obstacles only the configuration of obstacles. The fiber of this vibration is also configuration space or robots in the complement of a fixed set of objects. A fixed set of obstacles. So, actually, in the first paper of Fidel Norvert, I mean, the Theorem 1, in their paper, they show that this map is a locally trivial vibration. Okay, so parametrized motion planning algorithm will take as input the initial position of all robots. Of all robots, the final positions of all robots, and also the positions of the obstacles. And output, it will be a motion, continuous coordinated motion of the robots, which starts in the initial position, ends in the final position, and will avoid all the obstacles. If there are questions, If there are questions, I'm happy to answer. Okay, so how this so this was kind of a situation which we considered as a main motivation and now is kind of formal, more general construction which includes that construction as a special case. So here we start with an arbitrary vibration. Start with an arbitrary vibration P from E to B and we form space which we call E to B. This appears of configuration. So I will call points of E configurations. Points of E will be configurations and each configuration determines some point on the base which we can understand. We can understand as external conditions, but also as configuration of obstacles. So the space E to B consists of pairs of configurations which live under the same external conditions. So they lie in the same fiber. So it's written here, P E equals P of E prime. So this is one space and another. Is one space and another space is a space which is called EIB. So this space is a space of continuous paths in E, such that each of these paths lies in a single fiber. So if they started at certain points, they cannot get out of the same fiber, the kind of fiber-wise paths. And this space we call EIB. We call EIB. And there is this projection capital PI, the map capital PI, which associates with every path gamma, the pair of initial and final points, gamma at zero and gamma at one. Okay, and the main definition: a parametrized motion planning algorithm is a section. Planning algorithm is a section of this vibration pi. So it is a map from E2B to EIB, such that the composition A and then capital PI is the identity. Okay, so and there is a corresponding notion of parametrized topological complexity. Topological complexity, which we call Tc of this vibration, so it depends on the whole vibration, and it is a sectional category of this vibration capital Pi. So, in full detail, this GC of vibration is the smallest integer k such that. Such that the space E to B admits an open cover with K plus one sets, where each UI has a continuous section of pi. Okay, so this is our main definition. And also, I want to mention another important notion. Important notion which was introduced by Yuli Rudak sequential motion planning. So it is a generalization of what we discussed until now. But here we have many moments and the system is required to move not from A to B, but it requires to move from A to B and then to C and then to D. So it should move. it should move certain from certain sequence achieve certain sequence of states in a pre in prescribed moments of time so in this case we have some number r fixed number r will be number of kind of moments of time where we register our system and we will fix some And we will fix some moments of time, which we call T1, T2, TR, between 0 and 1. It can be just kind of equal distance moments, but it can be arbitrary. And then we have projection P from X to the to X to the R, which associates to the motion sequence of. The motion is a sequence of positions which it achieves, obtains at this moment of time, T1, T2, T3. And the topological invariant TCR is the sectional category of this vibration pi, P. So when R equals to 2, it is what we discussed earlier, T C of X, but for R greater than 2. it for r greater than two it's a different number and it has many interesting properties okay so now i start the main topic of my talk today it is a kind of sequential parametrized motion planning so here we will it is a joint work with amit paul who Amit Paul, who is also in this audience now. So it is a generalization of parametrized motion planning where we have not only two positions but arbitrary sequence of positions on a sequential version of the parametrized topological complexity. And in this work, we also analyzed in full detail. Also, analyzed in full detail the Fidel Norbit bundle, and we develop explicit algorithms for movement of multiple robots in the presence of multiple obstacles in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. But this part will be separate. I will not include it in this presentation. So let's do the definition. So, what is a TCR of a vibration? So, we fix some R, some integer R greater or equal than two, and we fix R points on the unit interval zero, one, all pairwise distinct points, and then another. And then another object here is this vibration. Again, vibration represents a family of configuration spaces parametrized by the base. And we define E to the R B. So this is a space of R tuples of configurations all lying in the same fiber. In the same fiber. And we have this map pi, which goes from EIB. I think my cursor doesn't move, so I cannot show, unfortunately, I cannot show you point to this formulas unless I get is it. Can I stay in this mode? Can you see my slide? Is it would it be better to go to full screen? I think it's okay for me. It's okay. Okay. You see, here I can move my cursor and you can see probably it. I can. So we have this map pi, which sends a grammar, a path in. A path in space EIB to its values positions of this path at different moments, at moment T1, T2, TR. And this main definition says that TCR of a vibration is defined as a sectional category of this vibration pi. In fact, this is a vibration. This is a vibration, it is a very rich vibration. It's easy to check. Okay, so alternative definition of TCR. And here, I think I'm not sure people are aware of this result. It's very simple, of course, but I just want to emphasize it that it's quite useful. Useful. So let K be a connected finite CW complex and let K1, K2, Kr be a sequence of R pairwise distinct points in K. So instead of interval, we can use K. So we look at maps from K to E, which is which lie in single fiber and take And take evaluation of such maps at these points, points k1, k2, kr. So essentially, we do the same thing instead of the interval, we take k. And Lerma says that this sectional category of this vibration equals TCR of this vibration. This vibration. Okay, so, but in fact, the proof is so general. I mean, it's valid in much more general assumptions than finite CW complex, but we don't want to go into this. So, here we list certain properties of this notion, TCR of a vibration. TCR of the vibration. So, first is that if we have a trivial vibration, then this TCR equals TCR of the fiber for the trivial vibration. If we have a principal bundle, then again, TCR of principle. TCR of principal bundle equals TCR of the fiber and it equals category of G to power R minus one. And in general, TCR of any fibration is greater or equal than TCR of the fiber. Another property is that if that is That this TCR is zero if and only if the fiber is contractible. And number five is an upper bound. So you can estimate TCR by dimension of the fiber, dimension of the base, and connectivity of the fiber. K is the connectivity of the fiber. So we will use this actually. Will use this actually upper bound. And then there is lower bound which uses cohomology. So we look at delta diagonal map. Diagonal map maps into ERB by mapping each configuration into repeated E part times and it induces a And it induces a map on cohomology with arbitrary coefficients, then this TCR of the vibration is greater than or equal to the couplings of the kernel of this map induced on COMOLIG. So it is again, it's quite standard. And another And another property is that that is an important property. If we have two fibrations which are fiberwise or motop equivalent, then TCR of them are identical. And here is a result which uses a theorem of Jose Garcia Colcines from a few years ago. Ago. In fact, it says that if we have a locally trivial vibration where the spaces E and B are mitrizable, separable A and R's, then instead of open covers, we may use arbitrary partitions of this space ERB, which is very convenient when you construct an explicit algorithm. Construct an explicit algorithm. Okay, so these are kind of general properties. And now I will focus on a specific question. We want to compute TCR of the Fidel Norway bundle. So we, as before, this notation FRDN is. Rd n is the configuration space of n distinct points in Rd. And the configuration, we think of it as first there are m obstacles and then n robes. And the projection is associates to the whole configuration only the configuration of the obstacles. To put Fadelno rebundle, and I already mentioned this actually. So, now what is our vibration pi r in this case? So, the points of the space ERB are configurations consisting of m plus rn Plus R n points in Rd. So first M are obstacles, and then there are R, sorry, N robots, and then second position of N robots, and then third position of N robots, and then R position of N robots. So in total, there are M plus Rn points. Points and there are restrictions, for example, for the same L, the same L that I must be distinct from that J for J, for I distinct from J. And also all these robots must observe obstacles. Okay, so A path in this in the space is just motion of everything, robots and obstacles. And a path lies in the space EIB if obstacles don't move. So if only robots move. So this gamma 1, gamma m are constant. M are constant, and these are arbitrary movements, but they have to observe obstacles and each other. Okay, so here I describe what it means, what is a section of this bundle. So, a section of this bundle is a map, let's say S, from ERB to EIB. So, if you have So, if you have a configuration in this ERB, which consists of M robots and then M obstacles and then N robots and then again N robots and so on. You have R groups of N robots. Then the section associates to such To such configuration, a continuous path. So it is, it has gamma 1, gamma m, alpha 1, alpha m, such that all these gammas are constant. They don't move. Obstacles don't move. And this position of alpha at moment T L is exactly Z J L. Exactly, Z J L. And then this conditions which say that we are there is no collisions between robots and obstacles. So, okay, so this is our main result. Our main result says that if we look at the Fidel-Norved bundle, which is here, then the TCR of this bundle equals R times N plus M minus 1. If G is odd, if dimension of the Euclidean space is odd, and Rn plus M minus T. Rn plus m minus two if dimension is even and the case when r equals to this result was obtained earlier in this paper in papers with down coin and schmuel Weinberger okay so um uh done um can you tell confirm timing how how much time do I have Timing, how much time do I have left about 15? 15 minutes. Okay, thanks. Okay, so I'll go briefly just indication of the proofs. So the proofs consist of upper and lower bounds. So in general, we have this upper bound. This upper bound using homotopical dimension. And if you apply it to our situation, we get upper bound for TCR Rm plus M minus 1, which is actually optimal when D is dimension is odd. However, if dimension D is even, there is an There is an improved upper bound by one better, by one below, and it is based on an explicit motion planning algorithm. So, I mean, in this paper, which we made public in archive, in the archive, we considered only the case when d equals 2 and then it uses some Some splitting using complex numbers and splitting of configuration spaces into products, which it doesn't look work in general for a higher dimension. So in general, for any dimension z, we have an argument using explicit motion planning algorithm with that many domains. So this gives. So, this gives an upper bound. I will not go into this now. So, lower bounds are based on chromology estimates and using chromology lower bounds. So, for this, we need to describe to know the chromology of the spaces ERB. So, all Comology groups here are integrals, so coefficients are Z everywhere, so I don't mention them. So, we have three propositions here. They are quite technical, but very important for us. So, proposition one says that this integral cohomology ring contains ring contains certain degree D minus one homology classes. So they depend on three indices I, J and L. So I must be less than J and they must be smaller than M plus N. And L can be one, two up to R and well these classes actually have very clear meaning, they kind of Clear meaning because they kind of come from projection of into pairs of configurations I and J, which must be distinct. And so this is the class measures how particle I and particle J rotate around each other when L is fixed. So when J is smaller than M, this class. This class is independent of L. And this is a reflection that these classes actually come from the base. When J is smaller than M, they come from obstacles. So they don't have index L. Square is zero because they come from spheres. And then there is this relation, three-term relation or braid relation. I don't know very well known. Relation, I don't know, very well-known relation. So here we multiply with the same index L, and here we have the same second index IPJP. This product is decomposed into two monomials. Well, I don't want to go into it. So, this is the formula: three-term relation. This is proposition one. And then next, we want to kind of label monomials. So, to label monomials, we use pairs of sequences. So, if you have some sequence i of some integers i1, i2, ip and sequence j of indices j1, j2, jp. So we write i smaller than j. I smaller than J if every IS is smaller than Js. And if we have such pair of indices, then we can form a monomial. So it is a product of these classes. So this classes depend on these integers I1, J1, I2, J2, and so on. 2 and so on. So, this is class of degree p times d minus 1 lying in this conology algebra. So, now we say that j is increasing if it is increasing, if j1 is smaller than j2 and so on. So, now a proposition two. Now proposition two. I'm still okay with time, right? So proposition two that says that an additive basis of the Freabelian group, so now this is free abelian and it has basis. An additive basis of this group is formed by the following set of homology classes. So we take all monomers. Take all monomals like that. So you see here there are sequences Ij, I1J1, I2, J2, and so on. And these sequences must be, first of all, each I must be smaller than each corresponding J. And all sequences J must be increasing. So I just want to go back a little bit here. This last relationship. This last relation shows that if this second index is not increasing, you see here it is repeated, then you can express it through sum of two terms where the second index is increasing. So this is the meaning of all this. The first sequence J here takes values in the set two, three up to n. 2, 3 up to m and this last j1, j2, and so jr they take values in this indices for robots. So it's m plus 1, m plus n. And all these classes form a basis of this chromology. So this is proposition two, and this is proposition three. Actually, I think I will. Actually, I think I will skip this. How much time do I have? Five minutes. Five minutes. Yeah, I'll just skip this proposition three. It kind of expresses certain products in terms of this basis. We just let's go ahead. So, zero divisors are classes of this type. So, we have L and L prime, different. prime, different indices, and ij and ij here. So they lie in the kernel. And the proof of odd case is that we show that this product, so in this product, there are m minus one classes here and then two n classes here. You see here we have square. Here we have square. square. Here we have square two n classes here and here we have r minus two times n classes in this product. We show that it is non-zero and this gives a low bound, this number is a low bound. But this cannot be used when d is even because this then the square will be zero. Square will be zero immediately. So, this is definitely not true when D is even. So, for D even, we have a different product. It has one less zero divisors and it is non-zero, so it finishes the proof. So, this gives us two lower bounds for the odd, Rn plus M minus one and Rn. plus n minus one and Rn plus n minus two when D is even. Okay, so now I have a few minutes left. So I want to discuss this what we call T C generating function and rotationality. So okay, so let P let's make a little breath. P let's make a little break so it was computational part and now it is less computational part. So we have a vibration P and for this vibration we have T C T C 2 of this T C three of that T C R of that and we have infinite sequence of different T C's so what we can do we can just put them into a form of power series Power series, we can put them as shown here as a form of power series in t in variable t and we can ask what is what kind of function is that what kind of function of t is this function. So, first we look at so maybe I should say that this is inspired, of course, by what Of course, by what we did with John of Preyer in our paper about TCR of single spaces, not parametrized, not parametrized when you have trivial vibration. So in that paper, we showed that in many cases this is a rational function and we predicted its structure. So let's look at the case of Look at the case of Fadel-Norvid bundle, which we computed with Amit Ho. So, in this case, if I put all these numbers into that formal power series, we get for this TC generating function the following. So, it is actually rational function, it has singularity. It has singularity at t equals one of order two, and this highest residue is n here. It depends on the number of robots, and this number actually depends on the number of obstacles. And this is in the case when dimension is odd. And if dimension is even, so here this n is still the same. Here, this n is still the same, but this is slightly different formula here. So, what we see is that if we compare with the fiber, the fiber is this configuration space of endpoints in the complement of n fixed obstacles. And this category of this fibromy is exactly n. Is exactly n. So we see that in this specific example, the TC generating function of the Fidel-Mervick bundle is a rational function of this form. It's like a paper with a journal prayer. This form, and this PT is an integer polynomial with value at one equal the Lusternik-Schneulman category. Listernic experiment category of the file. So there is a nice paper of Gonzalez and Grant, which computes all TCRs of this configuration spaces. So if you put all these TCRs in a generating function, you get this function here, and you see that the top singular. And you see that the top singularity is exactly like the top singularity which we have here. However, there is no pole of order one. Here we have pole of order one, and here there is no pole of order one. So this leads to a very interesting question, which I wanted to be at the end of my talk. At the end of my talk. So, questions like this: how the TC generating functions of a vibration and of its fiber are related? So, I mean, well, the expected answer is that the top singularity must be the same from the fiber and for the fibration. For the vibration, but and this is true in this example which we had before. So, as this can be reformulated as follows: we can ask what are the differences if I take TCR plus one minus TCR for large R, will this difference become eventually constant? And also, I can take difference between TCR. Difference between TCR of the vibration and TCR of the fiber. Will this become eventually constant? Again, these two questions have positive answers in this case of fadyl novette vibration. I think this is everything I wanted to say. And actually, do I Anyway, yeah, this is everything I wanted to say. So if you have questions, please answer. Thank you, Michael. Questions, either in person or online? So you said at the beginning of the talk that P was probably going to be a vibration, but maybe it didn't have to be sometimes. And then you said. It didn't have to be sometimes, and then you specialized, I think, for the rest of the talk to the case when P was a vibration. So, I was just wondering what can be said when P is not a vibration. Well, it's a very good question, actually. I think one of the talks, José Garcia Colcines, I expect that his talk will give an answer to this question. I personally didn't. I personally didn't think in that direction. I mean, many results which we used are not applicable in the case when it's not a vibration. But I mean, you're absolutely right that in many practical situations, it may be not a vibration. That talk will take place this afternoon, by the way. Place this afternoon, by the way. Any further questions? Okay. Hi, so this is Peter Paris. Nice to see you, and I liked your talk. I have a question, which is kind of what kind of motivation What kind of motivation is? So, in your definition of parametrized topological complexity, you ask for solutions which are continuously depending on the parameter. So, in what sense is this like what's a natural motivation for that? Well, yes, thank you, Peter. Thank you for this question. This question. Just wanted to correct. We do not expect that the solution, the algorithm, will continuously depend on parameters. The algorithm does not know what are the parameters. It will work for any parameters. And maybe I'll just answer this question. Can you see my slide? Can you see this picture? Yes. Yes. So let's look at this picture. So if I fix positions of all the obstacles, I have my configuration space and I can implement my algorithm of motion. But now if obstacles moved, I cannot use this algorithm. I mean, it's totally, the configuration space is totally different. Is totally different, although it's very similar, but it's different, it's a different space. So, formally, it's a different space. So, this parametrized approach allows to avoid this. For example, what we did with this Fidel-Norweg bundle, exactly the situation when obstacles are not fixed in advance, but they are arbitrary. And once you press input the positions of Input: The positions of the obstacles and your initial position and final position, then the algorithm produces the motion. So I think this explains this why it is more effective. Yes, so I understand that, but the point is that if you move those obstacles just a little bit, then you expect that the algorithm will just slightly move. I mean, at least within the same motion, I mean, chart or whatever. Whatever, yeah, because I mean, the it is continuous in the direction of b also. I mean, in the direction of the parameters. No, there is no, no, no, sorry. There is no requirement for continuity on B, and it's not continuous on B. So it is only continuity with respect to time. So with respect to time. So motion is a continuous function of. So motion is a continuous function of time, but there is no requirement whatsoever to be. Maybe I'll just find this slide just a second. Well, okay, yeah, so let's see if this is this situation. Yeah, we have input. input you as a input never here input you put positions of robots positions of targeting target positions of robots and positions of obstacles so and the algorithm produces a motion and this motion is only continuous as function of time but there is no requirement for it to be continuous. For it to be continuous on obstacles, and it is not. I mean, it's not so your section is usually defined on open subsets of E times E over B. Yes. So I mean, if you take points over different parts of B, it will be continuous in B as well. In B as well. Well, otherwise, over open, if you take one open set and over this set, you have a continuous section, then within this section, yes, everything will be continuous. But I mean, to combine the algorithm, you need many sections, and they do not combine into a continuous section together. There is a discontinuity, there are discontinuous. There are discontinuities, so they don't combine. So, I don't know, maybe I think I answered this question. Yeah, okay, thank you. Any further questions? Okay, thank you again, Michael. Thank you.
