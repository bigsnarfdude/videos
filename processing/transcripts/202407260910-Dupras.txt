And the data we deal with is RN6 data. And they are quite familiar with their samples and the individuals. So traditionally, people will just do virtual expression. But the virtual expression, we just do it, test one gene at a time. And it's a simple two-sample test. Or people will make it a little fancier, do a co-expression network or differential co-expression network. But both of these methods. But both of these methods have a tissue of instability. So the reproducibility of gene expression analysis is an issue. And this project starts with we want to identify some biomarkers to distinguish whether cancer gets metastasis or not. So for biomarker selection, if we use regularized margin regression like I saw, then we will. So then we will run to a problem of those stability versus sparsity. So this is if you run different data set, then you may get different biomarkers. And in 2010, Manchester and Bochmann published this paper. In this paper, this first figure is lambda. It's a regularized term. The value of lambda. Rash term, the value of lambda, and the y is a beta, and this red lines are true signal, and the green dashed lines go by noise. And we can see from this plot, if we run like so, even though we increase the regularized term, the true signal here couldn't stand out sometimes, we will pick up the noise. But if you run lots of multiple types, and especially in the paper, we introduced a random. Paper will introduce a randomized puzzle. And then the true signal in these two plots, these are the pipe. This pi stands for if you run 100 times, how many percentage of the time the red, the true signal will stand out. So, and this one is a randomized LASO. So, randomized LSO, if you run a soul multiple times, the true signal will stand out. So, we take this idea. And extend it to our innovation part. So, even though we can run this multiple times, make the true signal stand out. But the other thing is, what if the highly collinear term with the true signal, they are also associated with the phenotype? So, our extension is to we integrate biological structure, take advantage of Take advantage of collinearity instead of control collinearity. So we pull out. So our procedure is first we run randomize.sol and get a certain threshold. For example, 80% of the times this feature being selected, then those features, we will define them as core gene. And this core feature, and the next step, we will pull up. And the next step, we will pull out all the highly significantly convenient features with this core feature. And for each core feature, they have highly convenient feature. And then we go to pathway enrichment analysis. So to demonstrate how it works, we simulate data because simulate real correlation structures, it's kind of hard. And instead, we use G-Trats. And instead, we use G-Text data, G-TAX expression data, and from there simulate phenotypes. So we have 15 base pathways, and we set three, five, or 10, four pathways, and five, 10, or 15, four genes. And then our phenotype is decided by the core gene and the textual hopper genes. So, and we did simulation based. simulation based on based on these formulas like we have linear linear terms and non-linear situations of getting the simulating the disease phenotype and we also introduce a simulated signal to noise ratio to introduce some noises in the daytime and then in the end we can simulate the phenotype and alternatively we're compared with Alternatively, we're compared with randomized voiceo and randomized voiceo and stability selection with our terms here defining the probability of a set of variable being selected. Well, as a random sample of the data. So, and then stable, our stable set of variables is identified particular cutoff. So, we have two different thresholds. And we also compared with adaptive. Also compared with adaptive elastic net, and here's a simulation results. So the blue one is scope, and the red one is adaptive elastic net, and green one is a randomized class. So for this one, these are the linear model, and this is non-linear model. For the linear model, upper panel and lower panel is high correlation, lower panel is low correlation. And we can see the scope outperforms. Scope outperform the other two methods in the majority of the case. And ability to identify the causal gene again, scope is outperformed other two methods. Sometimes it may not, but majority of the time, scope outperforms the other method. And the ability to identify the core pathway will also show the same results. So when we submit to journal, they ask for Journal, they ask for tests for robustness against the threshold. So we have several thresholds, like certain thresholds of what's the threshold of how many percentage of the times the features been selected, or the threshold of the significance of the extremely co-expression. And this plot shows no matter which sample size, how many subs. how many uh how many sub how many times of subsample 100 times of subsample 500 or a thousand they are they are actually quite stable across different parameter setting so to demonstrate the tool we use tcga data and choose the top six cancer type breast cancer this they have a lot of sample size simply because of this and here's the results And here's the results. The red dashed lines is actually core gene we identified. We can see in the majority of the time, the core gene is less than 10. Sometimes it's just four. But this bar plot, if we run a soul multiple times, each time, sometimes maybe less than 20 genes, sometimes maybe more than 40 genes. So it's unstable for each one. So it's unstable for each one. But our method, we have stable, we only select less than 10 genes. And you may have question, less than 10 genes, whether they have enough prediction power. So we can show that the precision less is more, even though we select less than 10 genes, sometimes just four. But these are the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the PCDA data. And we also And we also download a totally unrelated data set from the database. And this is another independent data from PubMed. And then we can show that stabilized LASO, even though we have very few genes, this is a lung cancer, very few genes lack it, using those five genes, we can still reach pretty high prediction power. And the next step is a significant. Step is significantly co-expressed with those stable core genes. We pull them out and then do the pathway engine analysis. And here comes the results. So here we identify the, this is a gene pathway name and how many genes involved in this pathway and how many genes being identified in breast cancer. Five out of ten core genes identified in this pathway and the 20. In this pathway, and 29 out of 36 genes he identified in this pathway. And we can see if we adding up 29 divided by 36, 35 divided by 36, we're adding up this value, then we get this POS score. So the maximum value for the POS score is 6. And we can see here the POS score is all the cancers shear this pathway. And the blue are the The blue are related to cell cycle, and those red are related to DNA repair system. So we know that cancer become cancer because their DNA means the function of repairing the mistakes. And also because of the cell, the cancer cell continuing going into the cycle. Going into the cycle. And the next page, the same thing here, those purple are the pathways identified by other passes. And the green are the pathways remote to the immune system. And the red is the pathway related to the DNA repelled system. So these are the top POS scores I showed here. And all these pathways, there are cancer hallmark pathways related to cancer development. And we identified large proportion of the genes in this in the related pathway. And to compare with other methods, like for this kind of homework pathways, the green is the scope, orange is differential co-expression, and purple is the differential expression. We can see that scope identified for all kinds of types, identify those pathways much outperformed. It's much outperformed the other method in most of the case. And when we have a close look of how those core genes evolved in this pathway, for example, here, the express network centered by the core gene, these are the core genes. And this is the nucleotide accession repair plasma. We compare primary tumor and solid tissue. We can see significantly that this lines indicate. this lines indicate the correlation between the core gene and the gene in this pathway. And the core gene in the normal tissue, this here consists the regulation effect. But in the tumor, the correlation get lost. So the regulation effect gets lost. This and we also find, for example, MTCO2, that's another gene that across Genes that across four out of six cancer types we select as core genes. And these core genes, they have, they are differentially expressed between children and normal. And we also have core genes that are not specific expressed at all. So for example, this MTCO2 identified in four out of six cancers. There are at least all six cancers here. But we can see in the normal tissue, Can see in the normal tissue, they have strong correlation, but in the tumor tissue, the correlation structure gets lost. And my collaborator, as the oncologist, is very interested in the results, and he studied the kidney cancer and about the CD66, CD63 in kidney cancer. And he split this gene. We split this gene in kidney cancer for the sample with all kidney cancer and the HVHL mutation and wild type. For the mutation type, we can see the CD63 expression level. The red is bigger than zero. This is after normalization standardized. And the blue one is bigger than zero. And they show different survival plots. And when we have a closer look on And when we have a closer look of this CD63 with its thrombing gene, we can see in the tumor, they are positively correlated, and in the normal, they are negatively correlated. Significant different correlation structures appear. So it shows they regulate in different ways. And then we compare our scope with current practice. For example, scope with differential expression. Scope with differential expression and differential co-expression. And here we show the POS4. And we see scope, the POS4, that the POS score is genes identify, as I mentioned before. And scope has big sharing across six different cancer types. So that means the pathways we identify, they are sharing for different cancers. So even though they have They have different first name, they share the same last name, census, right? And but for the differential co-expression, differential expression, the POS score is much smaller. So this goes to people will think cancer is more just different type of cancer have different mechanisms. But and the differential coexpression, the POS4, is in between of those two methods. And our methods show Our measures show, even though there are different cancers, but they show a very common character. And this common character, maybe in the future, we can have a developed drug target that can target it. And in a big dream, maybe we can develop several drug targets that can target four different types. But of course, scope also identifies cancer-specific pathways like this high spike that are cancer. That are cancer-specific pathways. And when we compare with the differential expression, and these are the differential expression, the pathways identified, the higher POS score, identified by different cancer types. And those pathways are comparing with our method are not so strikingly related. And as a summary, we use And as a summary, we use martial lasso to stable to select stable variables and identify genes that are co-expressed with those stable genes and then do the pathway enrichment analysis to discover the common pathways for different cancer type. And then we extend it to a single cell. And this data set clearly experimental validate label E cell, T cell, progenitor cell, et cetera. Cetron and here are the pathways, for example, we identify for them for the T cell. And when we draw the correlation network in T cell and other cell, they show significant different patterns. And we also search the validation whether the scope-identified pathways are showing the and it's actually, for example, this TCF7, the highly co-expressed gene. Expressed gene and 67 more than two-thirds of the targeted gene being validated by a chip-sip experiment. And 20% have been, these are have binding site for this TCF7. And those rest, those are newly identified, not been validated for. So the findings we get, more than 60% been validated by the experiment previously, by other. By experiment previously, by other labs. And scope, single-cell scope, we can also do some functional annotation for unknown genes. For example, this gene, GM, A292. This gene had no function before. We don't know that it's a pseudo-gene. But when we look, this gene involved, that's in cell cycle pathways. So we can kind of help to annotate the function of the gene. Of the gene. So, this is some new things we can do with it. And I would like to acknowledge my student, Pason Hasina, and he did the scope picker. And Sandash, we did single cells, the scope part. And Weja, he helped. And Jamin, they helped with biological distribution. Thanks. Question from the audience? I have actually quite a few questions. There is actually quite a few papers on molecular characterization of cancer, rather than cancer by sight, which is similar to your concept, right? So people try to partition cancer by mutation, by molecular characterization. By mutation, by molecular characteristic. So, how did your partition call exit? So, for here, I didn't deal with any data, only the expression data. No, but even the single-cell expression. So, there's a couple talking about single-cell partition, and then that partition of cancer is different to the cancer side. A bit like your pathway is a little bit different. So, I was wondering whether you capture your pathway actually. The pathway actually aligns with those killer characteristics? I didn't compare with those paper, and those are single-cell. And the work here is on a box. And I think we can look into those single-cell parts and have a look at the cartel to see which type of cell factory driven this. One minute, so I do actually have one more question. I do find this really interesting. So, could you clarify a little bit in front when you're talking about accuracy? Were you interested in, it wasn't clear to me what's your AB, like what are you comparing accuracy? Yeah, when you're first developing the method of, you know, you talk about accuracy. So, it's kind of one way. It's kind of one way we want to see whether long time accurately predicts the true level. Yes. Have you looked at survival and whether this improves? I personally didn't do that, but my collaborator did this survival. He compared with the expression level of CBC3 lower. Of CB63, low and high, and this showed a significant difference. At the beginning of your talk, you used G-Tex whole blood data for your assimilation. Yes. One of the problems with the G-Tex whole blood data is that they take whole blood. So the vast majority of the transcripts in that data are from red blood cells. So in the moment. So, which is not a kind of usual type of gene expression data that we would see. So, it might be interesting to see how that simulation performs on other types of data, other tissues. Oh, we didn't simulate it on other tissues because the blood sample has the largest sample size. So, we choose that one. Yeah. The problem is that it has a very small number of genes that have super high expression, and then everything else is very important. Yeah, but we didn't, we simulate phenotypes based on it's not by using the phenotyp, we based on the extraction and the pathway is selected to simulate phenotypes.
