Oh, fine. Then, so, first of all, thank you, Agnieshka and Miro, for inviting me to Banf. It's my first time there here. I guess, Miro, you are quite cold outside of the center. Okay, so. Um okay, so um my talk today will be about uh joint result with Jose Carrillo and Evelina Zatorska and it will be about how we pass how we can pass from the weak solution of the generate Navier stokes equation to strong solution of the pressure. Strong solution of the pressureless OL system, and it will be a kind of singular limit with vanishing viscosity and pressure coefficient. And both systems are considered with a linear direct term, neutron repulsion, and quadratic confinement. We are restricted to one decase, and as I already mentioned, the limit will be with vanishing. The limit will be with vanishing pressure and viscosity coefficient. And this proof will be based on the relative entropy method using the artificial velocity formulation for one D Nadu Stokes system. Those two systems, in particular Euler system with non-local interaction described by the Newtonian repulsion, quadratic confinement and linear drag term. And in a drug term is widely used a hydrodynamic description of collective behavior. So we can look on the dynamics of large population of cells moving due to interaction produced by adhesion or chemical cues, or movement of large groups of animals which move due to visual or sensory. Due to visual or sensory interaction from the very long distance, from a large perspective, and look on it as a macroscopic description, right? And each cell, each agent could have the region of repulsion, which is very close, and region of attraction, which is a bit farther, and could align to others, which can be the Orders which can be described as alignment. Such hydrodynamic models could be obtained in a phenomenological way or by means of method of kinetic theory, by integration of Blassov-type equations, which is a kind of mesoscopic description middle step between the aging-based model and the hydrodynamic description. Description. So, this is about the motivation to consider such models, which I will talk about. In particular, we are interested here in a pressure-less Euler with non-local interaction, and which we will see as a limit problem for the vanishing pressure and viscosity of Nager-Stokes system. And wherever later I will write bar over rho or u, I will mean the solution of Euler. So please keep it in mind. So here we see the Euler system, continuity equation, momentum equation. Here we have a friction which corresponds to constant alignment and here we have a term which is described non-local. Describes non-local interaction of particles, agents, or whatever we would like to have in mind where the model is under consideration. So this potential W consists of two parts. One is repulsion, this is short range, and long range attraction described by the quadratic confinement. In particular, the In particular, this Euler system was not so long ago considered by Carrillo, Jon Picho and Zatorska. And they provide the threshold condition for the existence of global in-time solutions emanating from smooth initial data. And they also show the long-time asymptotic profile for densities, and they show that this. And they show that this in a profile they see the step function, and it was one decade, of course, under the assumption that the total mass and first moment of initial density and initial momentum are given. Just let me recall this result briefly because it also has later impact on the hour result. So we are So we assume that solution to all systems emanates from smooth initial data, namely density is C2, velocity is C3, it's positive on the initial region. And to here we can consider as omega zero, so initial initial interval of existence of solution as an interval or whole line R. The initial mass is bounded as well as the initial momentum. There is a control of first moment of density and integrability of the momentum. Then authors specify three cases. They are very complicated and they will Complicated, and they would talk it would talk like three slides to present them. So, I avoid to do it. So, you just could try to find them if you are interested in their publication. But those three cases depend on the initial data in a sense that depends on the x-derivative of the initial velocity, total mass, also on the initial density, and And depending on those cases, they show the solutions blows up in a finite time. And if and otherwise, they are exist for all times. So they are able to show also that those classical solutions exist globally and to show the long-light behavior and the profit. Long time behavior and the profile for the time converging to infinity. So, what I mean here by the strong solutions of Euler system, I mean here that there are density C1, velocity C2 and characteristics which are associated with the velocity are the former. Velocity are duphomorphism. So the result is, in fact, based on the fact that if they are in the class of those strong solutions, they are able to calculate exactly how the solution looks like. So this is a very technical proof in some sense. In our consideration, the current one, we consider the whole We consider the whole line. We cannot, we somehow find the difficulty to be restricted to interval, to bounded interval, due to relative entropy method which we use in order to prove how we converge from one system to the other one. We assume that if If we assume that initial velocity of the Euler system is no ish growth faster than linearly far from the origin. We also control the x derivative of velocity and second derivative of velocity we assume it's bounded and we choose in this way the characteristic associated with the Characteristic associated with the velocity. Somehow, so having the result of Jong-Pilcho, Eveline and Jose, we are able to say that with those initial data, we also control how the velocity of oil air behaves for all time. So we know that it's also grow no faster than Grow no faster than linearly infinity when we are far from the origin, and also that the spatial derivative of velocity is bounded. This is crucial for the construction of our relative entropy inequality and relative entropy functional as well. So, I already announced that since we have this order system, we've been Euler system, we've been interested how we could pass from the Nabelstok, so kind of Nabelstok system to this Euler. Somehow the motivation behind was, which is maybe not achieved here, and this is a middle step, how to define a solution of all air system after blow up. And we found this result as well as well interesting. As well, interesting that if we consider this degenerate Nabier-Stokes equation with non-local interaction and linear alignment, here we have, we say that is degenerate never stop since this velocity, since this viscosity coefficient may disappear on vacuum. So it could appear that on vacuum, It could appear that on a vacuum, velocity is not defined at all. We have here the viscosity coefficient and pressure, and we have them in a specific form. So this is a linear function between them. The existence of such degenerate the existence of solution to the generate another stock system without Another stock system without this non-local term was already under many was already an issue for studies for a long time. In particular, we could find him such names like Bret de Jardin, MÃ©lette Passer, Passeur Yu. And sorry for to all of that, to all of you who haven't been mentioned here. Who haven't been mentioned here and had some input to this kind of research. And what I would like also to mention here the work of Brenier, who also consider kind of passage of Nabilstoks with this vanishing pressure and vanishing viscosity, but in slightly different regime. Regime. What I will mention also later on the work of Malay, Basser and Vasser Yu is give a useful methodology which allow also us to consider this primitive system. What in fact is our result which I would like Which I would like to present you is first of all that we have a weak sequential stability proven for this primitive system. So we do not give exactly the existence of solution but just weak sequential stability. And later on we show that if epsilon converge to zero, the weak solution to this primitive system converge to strong solution of all other systems if they exist. So this convergence is shown via the relative entropy method. And the basic idea is that in this Navier-Stop system, in this primitive system, we use the artificial velocity. And this velocity, V, we could put to the hours. We could put to the hour system, and if we replace our U by this one, in the momentum equation of the primitive system starts to look very similarly to the momentum equation of the Euler system. In fact, if epsilon converges to zero, v is equal to u bar, I mean by u bar, this is the solution of the Euler. U-bar this is the solution of the Euler system, so then this equation is exactly looks the same as the equation momentum equation in the Euler system. This similarity allows to compare the solution of the primitive system with the solution of the limit system of the Euler system by use of the relative. By use of the relative entropy. Okay, so also the similar idea of replacing of this artificial velocity was used by Boris Aspot and Zatorska, also in other works, should be mentioned here. So, in order to show the weak sequential stability for the primitive system, because there is no There is no, we are not aware of the results showing the existence of solutions for this primitive system with non-local interaction. And we concentrate here on the weak sequential stability. So we assume that initial we have a bunch of assumptions for the initial data. In particular, we keep control on the We keep control on the higher moments of the density. We keep control on this partial derivative of this guy. We assume also that in infinity, I recall you that we consider the system on the whole line. So if we are far from the origin, we converge to zero. And those are Those assumptions will allow us to keep control on the higher moments and we allow also use the methodology developed by Vasser Mallel and Vasser Yu in order to show the weak sequential stability. Of course, in order to be able to compare solutions of the Euler and this primitive system, we take the same mass for the primitive system and for the limit system, also the same fer momentum. momentum for the to make clear what to clear how the formulation will formulation of the result look like I give you following inequalities which we require from the approximation of the solution of the of the primitive system and for the solution of the primitive system so we have the we primitive system. So we have the, we will require, we will require and we will show that solution of the primitive system satisfies following energy inequality from which we have the following bounds and also Brech de Jardin mathematical entropy inequality is satisfied. This one is obtained by introducing here this artificial velocity and here we obtain And here we obtain the following bounds. And Melbaser estimates, which allow to keep control on the higher moments of the density, and as well for this guy, we allow to show strong convergence of the density. So our result sounds as follows. Agnieszko, how much time I have? One minute more or less. One minute more or less. One minute. Okay, so I really have to speed up. But if you need one more minute, I can share it. Okay, so we assume that our gamma is between one and three over two. So this is our restriction for the pressure exponent. And we show that if we have a sequence of smooth solutions satisfying those estimates which I showed you a slide. Estimates which I showed you a slide before, then those then those smooth solutions converge to weak solutions of our primitive system. So this is exactly what I mean by weak sequential stability. So we have some approximation which satisfy uniform bounds, which are satisfied also by the weak solution. And we show that this approximation converges to a weak solution. Of course, we haven't shown for the moment. course we haven't shown for the moment yet that such approximation exists and we could find such approximation here this strange guy is how we understand the diffusion term and or the viscous term in this degenerate Neville Stokes system and the second result and the second part of the result says that if we start if we have this approximation and have x Approximation and have extra assumption on the initial density, then relative entropy converge, then strong solution, then weak solution to our primitive system converge to strong solution of our OLF system in the sense that this relative entropy converges to zero. What I have to say here is that this we show that the relative entropy show that the relative entropy inequality holds only for the smooth approximation. We are not able to show it for the weak solutions and showing it for the smooth approximation we pass with this approximation to the limit and then we are able to show that in fact To show that, in fact, this condition holds. So, in this moment, I could finish the talk and thank you really a lot for your attention. Okay, thank you very much, Aneta.
