We'll be talking about the propagation of dissipation in singular stochastic Hamiltonian system. That's quite an interesting title. It's up to you. Well, thank you for the introduction and thank you for the invitation to speak here. So, yeah, also thank you to the organizers for putting a conference like this together, which is, I think, a bit unusual and. And naturally presents some unique challenges. So, I really appreciate you doing that. So, what I'm going to talk about today is kind of work with my collaborators over the past few years and trying to understand convergence to equilibrium in two stochastic differential equations. So, see if I can do this. So, the first stochastic differential equation will likely Will likely be familiar to at least a large number of you, which is Langevin dynamics. So, under damped Langevin dynamics on Euclidean space. And Langevin dynamics describes the position of capital N particles, each of which, so the positions live on Rk and they have respective momentum vectors P1 up through Pn that also live on Rk. Also, they live on Rk. So they move around according to this Newton's law. And what forces are acting on the particles? Well, there's the most maybe obvious thing that you see here is this function u. And in this function, U encodes all the potential forces. So what could actually go in U, for example, would be like, well, the particles all live inside a petri dish with a wall. So there's going to be a natural force through the wall. There's going to be a natural force through the wall that won't let the particles escape that petri dish. Also, that may or may not be included, depending on which scenario you are in, would be particle interaction. So what happens if particle I encounters particle J? So as in the case of springs, if they are sort of far apart, do they pull back together? Or maybe in the case of molecular dynamics, when they get close, do they sort of push each other away? So there's a lot of things that can happen. So there's a lot of things that can happen. So this equation can be very simple or can be fairly complicated depending on what you're making you look like. The other forces that are acting on the particle are the force due to thermal fluctuations, which is modeled by this scaled Brownian motion, and then a balancing friction force right here via fluctuation dissipation. Okay, so under reasonable circumstances, Know under reasonable circumstances on the potential function u, longevent dynamics is one of those instances where you have an explicit, or at least mostly explicit, stationary distribution with corresponding invariant probability density, which is of the Gibbsian variety, right? It's e to the minus beta times the Hamiltonian, where in this case, the Hamiltonian is just the kinetic plus the potential energy. So, if you kind of take yourself maybe outside of the statistical mechanics framework for a minute and think, like a Bayesian statistician, you know, this is one of these kind of dynamics that leads to an ergodic sampling scheme, which means that if I have a density that I know up to a normalization constant, so f of q is g of q over n, g of q over n is my density, I can sort of thrust it into the potential, right? I kind of write. I kind of write this g of q over n as e to the minus beta u, where u is of this kind of strange form, and I plug it into the equation. I start the dynamics from a conveniently chosen initial distribution. I run it long enough, and then I integrate out the stuff that doesn't matter. In this case, the momentum directions, and lo and behold, I can take samples from this distribution. Okay, but there's a lot of things that I'm assuming, right, at least about what. Assuming, right, at least about what should happen, like this should get close to this distribution at time infinity. So I'm making, you know, a fairly strong assumption there. So the second, you know, in the same light, the second family of equations that I'll look at is an additional layer on top of Langevin dynamics. So this is sometimes called the Noz√©-Hoover equation or Brownian heating. It's called sometimes adaptive Langevin. And it's basically just, you know, And it's basically just, yeah, like I said, an additional layer on top of launch of n dynamics. So you can see in this equation, I got my P's and my Q's and all the sort of forces that you saw before. But on top of that, you have this thing, this additional direction, Cassi. And what does Cassi do? So Cassi is called the thermostat. And much like your thermostat in your house, when it gets too cold, the thermostat kicks on and heats the, you know, the house up. And if the, you know, of course, if it gets cold, And if the, you know, of course, if it gets too hot, hopefully you have air conditioning, the thermostat kicks on and cools you down. This is exactly what happens in the system, except the temperature is not the usual kind of notion of temperature, it's just the kinetic energy. So Cassi controls kind of the magnitude of the kinetic energy. So if the kinetic energy gets too small, right? So if this is really small, then what happens to Cassi is it becomes very, very negative and large, and then it acts kind of a friction force that points in the opposite direction. Force that points in the opposite direction, thereby increasing the magnitude of P. Similarly, if P gets too hot, so if P is too large, what happens is that this thing gets very large and positive, and then this enacts kind of the same kind of type of friction force, but it's going in the other direction. So it's going to cool it down. So the interesting thing about this system, too, is that it has an explicit invariant probability density, which is like a Gibbs type 4. Which is like a Gibbs type form. I'm not sure it's the right thing to call it Gibbsian, but it's only the only difference between the invariant measure for this system and the one before is that you have this additional Gaussian factor. So again, you can do the same kind of Bayesian framework here to take random samples by running the dynamics long enough and integrating out those directions, namely P and C, that don't matter. And so the And so, the main problem that we're trying to solve is understanding in an explicit way possible the nature of convergence to the invariant probability measures in both equations for you in a really wide, basically the widest class that you expect robust convergence properties. So, and I'll be talking about singular potentials today, but the results that we can derive are more general than just. Derive are more general than just singular potentials, but they're a good test case because the singular potentials basically sit at the boundary where you expect robust convergence properties to be satisfied. Okay. And the thing that I'm going to say, so the main issue with both of these equations, of course, these are both missing noise in certain directions. They're, you know, under reasonable circumstances, you're going to see that they're hypolliptic, but they're degenerately damped. They're degenerately damped. Okay, and I'll tell you what that means a little bit later, you know, when I talk about kind of the main issue. So, what does a singular potential look like? So, typically, potentials come in kind of two parts. You have the environmental forces. So, all the particles kind of experience the same energy landscape, the walls, the wells. And you also typically break this apart into the interaction forces. So, in this case, we'll only deal. So, in this case, we'll only deal with pairwise interactions. So, what happens when particle I encounters particle J. And typically, what you would see, you know, the common examples that you would see in the literature, at least the rigorous literature on Langevin dynamics and Noze Hoover, would be potentials that are like polynomials. They may not be exactly polynomials, but they would be something like an even-degree polynomial that may have many wells. And maybe you don't care that you might not be talking about a large number of particles, you might be talking about a A large number of particles, you might be talking about a single particle, so there's no interactions. Or in the case of springs, you would have a potential that you know has like this power growth so that when you stretch the spring out, it comes back in. The thing that I, you know, the thing that we're kind of looking at here is sort of singular interaction potentials. So you may have an energy landscape described by this even-degree polynomial, but then you would, you know, have this, you know, interaction. Uh, you know, interaction potential that looks like this, and this is the canonical kind of expression for the Leonard Jones 612 because of the six and the twelve here. And so the singularity can be quite pronounced, right? It's one over r to the 12th when you get close. And so that leads to sort of complications in studying the dynamics itself. But you can also consider, you know, what where is another natural place to have a singular potential instead of having like an even. Instead of having like an even-degree polynomial, if you want to restrict particles to say a closed, you know, circular domain, then you could put a singular potential on the boundary that would prevent them from escaping. Okay, so that's the kind of thing that would happen here. You know, center, you know, you wouldn't get too far without, you know, you just can't leave. But in these cases, you can definitely kind of get far out with positive probability. So the mathematics literature, the rigorous mathematics. mathematics literature the rigorous mathematics literature is typically restricted to potentials that you see kind of in one you know how do you sort of deal with potentials in two and three is there sort of a common set of assumptions that you can make to ensure robust convergence properties for all of these um you know what is what about noze hoover and how do you what's the dynamics different so the interesting thing about the dynamics i'll illustrate in kind of two movies the movies aren't broken as as maybe suggest As may be suggested by the broken film. So I'm going to basically plot, you know, we're going to be in spatial dimension when I'll have three particles and I just put some fixed parameters in the system. And I'll have like an environmental potential, like just a single well, and then I'll put an interaction potential, which has been modulated to make it easy to simulate. But you'll see the relative positions, and here they can't actually cross over, but when you see the Over. But when you see this, so here you can see the blue, the red, and then this kind of darker green color. Those are the positions. And then what's plotted on top of that is basically the interaction energy in the system. So they kind of move around according to the dynamics here, in this case, Langevin. And then every so often, the particles encounter one another, in which case there's these energy spikes, which can be quite dramatic depending on kind of the situation. Dramatic depending on kind of the singularity in the system. Here it's pretty small. But qualitatively, you see kind of the issue is that you have these intermittent energy spikes in the system. So, okay, so what about Noze Hoover? You won't, you may not see, I would say, the difference between these two things by looking at this, but maybe you will. You can kind of see a little difference here. The dynamics kind of moves around a little bit more jittery because it's Bit more jittery because it's responding to the thermostat. And the other thing that you're supposed to notice clearly: if everybody counted the number of spikes on the last slide, which I assume that they did, there should be more spikes here. So maybe you don't see that. That doesn't matter. I'll at least plot it on the next slide, but that's what you're supposed to take home. And the reason that is, is that the thermostat doesn't let the dynamics sort of sit like at small momentum values. And so it just has. And so it just has the tendency to sort of discover parts of space, you know, these like nether regions of space, I guess, better. So an easy kind of simple plot, if you just sort of run the dynamics over a long time window, both of them, and you just kind of plot, you know, how many visits beyond, you know, how many visits. So if I discretize the system, how many times am I beyond a fixed level X? And you plot this with, you know, Langevin and Noze Hoover, what you're Langevin and Noze Hoover, what you're going to see is that basically, you know, these are kind of really far-out values. You, on this like fixed time window, I'm seeing, you know, Noze Hoover is above Langevin. It's visiting, you know, this, you know, this energy level 1600, 500 times, whereas Langevin is somewhere down here. And so the point of this illustration is that Nose Hoover is on top, except for maybe back down here in these regions where we don't matter, where the energy is sort of small. Don't matter where the energy is sort of small, okay? So that's kind of the difference between you know the two systems in one really simple statistic. So the thermostat really kind of heats things up. It gets things moving around a little bit. And so you don't sit at kind of these smaller values too frequently. So the question is: you know, if you want to prove If you want to prove that the dynamics converges to equilibrium in a reasonable way, in spite of these energy spikes. So how would you actually approach this problem? And so, I guess the way that I see it, and this may not be the way that everybody else sees it in the audience, I kind of feel like there's just two approaches. But within each approach, and there's sort of different directions. And there's sort of different directions that you can take to analyze things. So, approach number one is the one that I was sort of raised on in my mathematics young career, which is this Lyapunov-Harris approach where you try to construct this mystical thing called a Lyapunov function. You have to find it. And basically, what happens is like the dynamics outside of a large ball in space and the shape of the ball can be different. Space and the shape of the ball can be different depending on what you're looking at. But outside of a large ball, you kind of have to come back to a region where sort of noise dominates in order for sort of two initial conditions to mix. And so it's broken apart typically in two pieces. So you have to find this sort of function, which is sort of large when you get far out in space that tells you that you don't spend too long out here. In this case, if I had an estimate like this, In this case, if I had an estimate like this, it's just telling me that I'm coming back in logarithmic time to this eggshell object. And then once I get back to the eggshell object, I sort of have to find a uniform location. So this is kind of this uniform location where the particles can kind of all meet up and be happily married from then on forward. And this is just the Doblin minorization condition. So you're looking for an alpha positive and a probability. For an alpha positive and a probability measure on the space such that this bound is true uniformly in the initial condition. And so, typically, this is the part where you really need to use things like the fact that it's a hypolliptic diffusion to get regularity of the semigroup and then also support properties of the diffusion using the support theorems. Now, of course, you can do this in a different way. You can think about taking a coupling approach as well. approach as well. But so I'll just say that that's kind of approach one. And then from there, you can kind of do a lot of different things once you get back here. So the second approach is something I'm a little less familiar with, but I've had the fortunate, I've been fortunate to learn a little bit about this sort of Poincare approach more recently. And the Poincare approach, to me, this may be a super simplification, but Super simplification, but basically, you try to use the structure of the invariant measure that you have for your system by constructing a distance like L2 of pi, in which the dynamics is contractive. Okay, so a simple example of, you know, so I like to do this example because this example helps me kind of explain, you know, what to do. We look at the over-damped Langevin equation. So if I sort of formally rescale space. Formally rescale space and time and take gamma to infinity, I arrive at over damp system here. This system again has this invariant probability measure. But the point is, if I do this calculation, if I just sort of do this calculation for overdamped Langevin, you see exactly what you need to see. So if I take an observable that's centered with respect to this invariant measure, and I sort of differentiate along the trajectories of the system with respect to this. With respect to this distance, then beautiful things happen. You kind of see that when you do the algebra, that it's instantly contractive in the sense that if this is what I mean by that is not a strict contraction, but what I mean is that you get minus gradient of PT phi squared, that term is negative. And under many circumstances, you know, the measure should satisfy a Poincar√© inequality, in which case you can compare, you know, Case, you can compare this object with the original norm that you started with. And so you get this natural kind of Gromoll type estimate and therefore get exponential convergence to equilibrium. So this is a simple example, right? Because we can't kind of do this sort of trivially for the other systems because they're not uniformly elliptic. So what do you do differently in those scenarios and sort of how do they? Differently in those scenarios, and sort of how do they compare with one another if you kind of look at what happens with Lyapunov and the Pancare approach. So this is kind of a table to help explain things. Like this is how I view it. So what I have here is basically I'm going to look at all three of these systems and kind of compare and contrast the two approaches. If you just kind of start off and do the first calculation that you should do, right? So if I look at over. So, if I look at over-damp dynamics, the natural candidate for a Lyapunov function would be the potential energy. That's the first guess for a Lyapunov function. And if you differentiate along the trajectories of the system, in other words, look at what happens to V under the action of the infinitesimal generator, then you get a nice form here. So I pardon the fractions of a half and fractors of two. Factors of two. I tried to balance them so that they all looked beautiful, but there was just no winning, depending on which thing I was looking at. But the beautiful thing here is this expression. And what you look at here is that typically for most potentials, this nabla squared u is going to beat the Laplacian. If you think about a polynomial, that's certainly going to be true. It's also true for singular potentials. That's a little harder to see, but this thing beats this thing. But this thing beats this thing asymptotically, and so for large values of u. And then typically you can compare this back to u. Okay, so that this is basically giving you what you want right off the bat. And similarly, if I look at what happens, you know, in the Poincare approach, starting off with the natural topology, which is L2 with respect to the invariant measure, when I take ddt, the first calculation I do, I get basically everything I could hope to get, which is my. Basically, everything I could hope to get, which is minus navala pt phi squared, and I can apply upon Corre inequality, and I'm very happy. Now, the problem is if we go to Langevin, so Langevin is no longer elliptic. And so, if we start off, just let's take the Lyapunov approach for a minute. So, if I start off by guessing the Hamiltonian, which would be the natural kind of first guess at a Lyapunov function, and we start to see some problems because See some problems because you know you don't actually recover the full Hamiltonian on the right-hand side when you apply the generator to it, right? You all you get is minus gamma p squared plus a constant. And so that's problematic. So you're you're wondering where is that dissipation and q hiding in the system? And so, you know, how do we figure out how to get around this issue? And you can also see this happening for the, you know, the, you know, the Poincar√© approach when we do. The Poincare approach when we do the same kind of calculation but for launch of n dynamics. But this time, you know, what's missing is sort of analogous here. You have missing Q derivatives in your gradient. You only have the derivatives in P, and you really, to be able to apply the Poincare inequality for the product measure, you need those derivatives in Q. So there's sort of missing dissipation here. It's hiding somewhere in the system that we can't quite see using the first guesses for all. For our kind of metrics. So, the last thing, I kind of kept LaunchEvent up here. I don't know if it's really necessary, but if I look at Noze Hoover, it's even worse. If you take the natural kind of first guess for a Lyapunov function for Noze Hoover would be the Hamiltonian plus the Cassi squared over two. And the problem here is, again, you basically recover everything that you would from launch of n dynamics kind of naturally. Launch of n dynamics kind of naturally, but then there's this additional factor which creates an energy source when Cassie is negative enlarged, just like that's basically when that thing, that thermostat turns on. So it's not even bounded anymore. And so, you know, how are we going to actually see that this thing settles down? So what kind of things do we need to do? So we're missing kind of dissipation again into C and Q. And if you do that calculation. And Q. And if you do the calculation for Noze Hoover using this Poincare approach, it doesn't really change. You still get what you got last time, and you're missing derivatives in both Q and Cassie. So all I'm doing this slide for is to just say, you know, this make this point. So for Launchavent and Noze Hoover, using basically the natural first guesses, it's not obviously contractive, right? And so something has to be done in order to. Something has to be done in order to make those things contract. So, what is the strategy? The strategy is, I think it's very similar. You have this kind of comparison of what's going on with Poincare and Lyapunov, so they have a similar flavor, but it's still not kind of obvious, like what's the mapping between the two. So, the Lyapunov function approach basically is as follows: you start off with your good guess. Start off with your good guess, the original thing. So you start off with your natural guess, and you add some low-order perturbation to its psi, which encapsulates some sort of averaging effects of the dynamics, which leads to the dissipation in the missing directions. And so basically you look for this lower order perturbation, which means that this V old is going to completely dominate this wherever the boundary space is, such that, you know, whenever you're sufficiently large, that this gives you the contraction. To this gig gives you the contraction. And so it's really simple. You know, finding this perturbation is very simple in the case when the potential is sort of like a polynomial. It has a very nice, simple, explicit form. And you can kind of see in these early papers, Li Ming Wu, Denny Cole, Mattingly, Stuart Ingham, where it's this thing called the PQ trick. You basically add epsilon P dot Q for epsilon small enough, and that gives you kind of the missing dissipation. Gives you kind of the missing dissipation under some further additional, you know, assumptions on you. So, if you go kind of, I think I'm going to go all the way down to the bottom here first, and then I'll come up here. So, if you want to look at kind of what happens to the Poincare approach, if you try to do this for launch of n dynamics, what you might try to do is kind of pop up to, you know, H1. So you can kind of twist a gradient so you get that missing derivative. And that's, you know, one. Derivative, and that's you know, one you know, common approach. So, you would go back up to H1, which is kind of like your perturbation of the original norm, and sort of twist the gradient to encapsulate those dissipative effects. But sort of more recently, there's this nice work of debt, Mahat, and Schmeiser, where you can sort of do this without having to jump up in the topology in a fairly general scenario. Fairly general scenarios. So, you basically add a low-order perturbation, which is like a twisted gradient, but it's been renormalized to be an operator on L2 as opposed to H1. So you can kind of think about like if I were to twist the gradient and sort of divide through by the right number of derivatives, it would be an operator on L2. And that's more or less what's happening here. But you can also, even if you're more stochastically minded like myself, you can give an explicit description of what. An explicit description of what this thing actually does, provided you look at sort of sufficiently smooth functions on NPQ space or QP space. What this does, it's basically kind of, you know, this LH is the Louisville operator for the Hamiltonian dynamics. So it sort of like, that's like kind of the spinning part of the dynamics, sort of kind of spins phi. And then this pi averages out the p with respect to the invariant measure. And then Respect to the invariant measure, and then you kind of flow along the gradient dynamics according to this Feynman-Katz formula. So that's actually what it looks like, and you can prove that that's what this operator looks like. Symbolically, you can also write down what the operator looks like using sort of functional analysis. But okay, so there's the difference that I want to illustrate, there's a difference between To illustrate, there's a difference between the numbers one and two. So, our goal is to sort of make minimal assumptions on the potential. So, ideally, the type of growth bound that's satisfied by singular potentials and kind of going back to what you expect for overdamp dynamics is you want to have a condition that's like the gradient sort of beats, the gradient squared beats the Laplacian, it beats the second derivatives. So, here, this is what's written here. So, here, this is what's written here. So, the gradient sort of goes to infinity as you go out to infinity in space, but it satisfies this growth condition where basically you can choose this constant to be sufficiently small at the expense of choosing something a little larger here. Okay, so that's the two. The one, the one that you almost always find in the literature, at least in sort of the Poincare side, is that the Hessian or the second derivatives are controlled basically by one power. Are controlled basically by one power of the gradient. Okay, and if you think about just polynomials for a minute, right, polynomials are clearly going to satisfy something like this. I take two derivatives of a polynomial at infinity, that's certainly going to be controlled by one derivative, right? But if you do singular things like one over q to some power, right, that's not going to be respected because the singularity gets stronger with derivatives. So you can't control it in that way. And but is, but if you're not going to be able to do that, But if you have this condition, actually, the singular thing would actually satisfy this. So it's enough. So polynomial type potentials satisfy both one and two, but the singular potentials satisfy only this. This should be one, not two. I should have reversed it. I have one and two equations here, and it should be like, you know, corresponding. There's too many ones and twos floating around, but you get the idea. Two is floating around, but you get the idea. So, this is the condition that we want to employ. So, what do we know about this in terms of convergence to equilibrium for Longchevin under sort of singular type conditions on the potential? So, like that first bound that we saw before. So, kind of the earliest papers were Florian Conrad and Martin Grothaus in 2010, and then Grothaus and Stilgenbauer, where they proved ergodicity, and I think polynomials. I think polynomial rate of convergence and sort of the topology that we've talked about, the L2 with respect to the invariant measure. And then this is not actually chronological, it's just sort of by groups. In 2019, Grothaus and Wang sort of extracted kind of sub-exponential convergence rates, but under sort of weaker Poincare inequality. So not the full strength Poincar√©, something a little bit weaker. And I came into this problem back in 2017, but from the kind of Lyapunov side of things. So, in 2017, we looked at a simple case, like one particle in one dimension with a hard wall at zero and sort of a polynomial potential at infinity, proved it in that one case, but then later came back and were able to extend it sort of to this general condition and construct an explicit Lyapunov function for. For the launch of NDynamics under those conditions. And then later, Jonathan Mattingly and Lou, his postdoc, built off this work to show that you could deal with even worse potentials like Coulomb potentials that have logarithmic singularities. And you have to, in that case, you can't really assume as much general structure as what I put on the previous slide. But if you have a little bit more structure in your potential, you can kind of extend this idea to. Potentially, you can kind of extend this idea to the Coulomb interactions. And then I wanted to understand if I could get better understanding of the explicit rate of convergence. So the previous papers here are not very explicit. So typically you get kind of better explicit estimates if you apply this Poincare approach. And so with Fabrice Badouan and Masha Gordina in 2020, you know, we were able to extract explicit We were able to extract explicit convergence estimates and sort of a weighted H1 topology using gamma calculus. And so, what does this thing really look like? So, this is, you know, this is a kind of a weight here. This is a function that's basically a Lyapunov weight, but for different dynamics. And there's kind of a twisted gradient. So, this is this gradient sub-zeta. So, zeta kind of is a parameter that twists the gradient. Is a parameter that twists the gradient. And basically, the local mixing happens here according to some local Poincare constant satisfied by the invariant measure. But then, kind of the global dynamics far out is taken care of by this piece of the norm. So you can kind of, you know, you can kind of think about Lyapunov function plus a Poincar√© inequality is going to give you, you know, convergence to equilibrium. And we can get some estimates on kind of like, for Kind of like for singular potentials, you get kind of polynomial dependence in n on the convergence rate. But again, there's still some dependence on Poincar√© inequalities, which I'll kind of bring up later. And then, kind of something that's hopefully soon to come out. So, we worked with Masha Gordina and Gordina and Evan, my student, and Gabrielle Stoltz in France, and tried to kind of fine-tune what was in this paper to see if we can actually get better dependence on the scaling parameters in the equation. So one thing that was not present in the sort of weighted H1 topology was the kind of natural scaling of the problem as it depends on the friction parameter. So you expect just by doing kind of a back of the envelope. Just by doing kind of a back-of-the-envelope calculation, that the rate of conversion should be like gamma, the minimum of gamma and gamma inverse. And we can do that in both, you know, kind of an unweighted topology and a weighted topology, which this kind of morally speaking looks like L2. So it's almost L2, but not quite. And we believe that it should work similarly for Noze-Hoover and also the Boltzmann equation, if you kind of follow the unweighted approach. Kind of follow the unweighted approach. For Nose Hoover, much less is known because the dynamics is a little bit more complicated than Launchevan dynamics. But the kind of first rigorous result that I know of in terms of this direction would be that this paper in 2014, which proved that it's uniquely ergodic. And then I sort of adapted, you know, what was in the paper with myself and Jonathan Mattingly in this LaunchEvent case to construct an explicitly up enough function for. Construct an explicit Lyapunov function for this. So it is geometric, does settle down into equilibrium geometrically fast. Again, it's not very explicit. And then Benedict Leimkuhler in 2019, along with Matthias Sachs and Gabriel Stoltz, they were able to extract really explicit convergence estimates for Noze Hoover, but it doesn't quite work for singular potentials. Okay. So the open problem. So, the open problems. I just kind of list some open problems. I'm not sure. I know kind of what's realistic and what's probably unrealistic. So, the first question is something I think is a good discussion for the audience, but how do you estimate kind of the Poincare constant locally in a domain? That seems to be like maybe a unicorn or a fantasy or something, like you're chasing after something that you may not be able to do. But we have ways of estimating. But we have ways of estimating the Poincare constant sort of for large values in the phase space. It looks like kind of the Lyapunov condition, more or less. But what happens when you're kind of in a large bounded region in space? Is there sort of a practical way that you can get decent estimates on the Poincare constant? Because in each of these sort of convergence results, there's this mystical thing called the Poincare constant that I don't know how it behaves on, say, the dimension parameter. Or, I mean, you know, it doesn't depend on friction because it's that's. Depend on friction because that's built into the problem. But still, how could you get better control of that? Second thing is: can you improve any understanding using sort of explicit couplings? A la kind of Eberlique, what they've done is sort of done a good job of finding ways to construct metrics in which motivated by coupling, which naturally contracts. So, if you can do that here, that would be really interesting. Do that here, that would be really interesting. Um, the low-hanging fruit is probably, you know, you look at trying to adapt this hypocoursive approach for Noze Hoover, which is just mixing and matching our paper with this paper of Benedict Leimkuhler, Matthias Sachs, and Gabrielle Stoltz. What about Boltzmann? I think that that's also doable, but I, you know, I'm a little less familiar with the Boltzmann equation than some of my colleagues. Of course, the natural thing. The um, of course, the natural thing would be: you know, once you have kind of a good understanding of convergence equilibrium for the dynamics themselves, can you do that and prove some rigorous results about what happens when you discretize things and translate the results to numerics? Okay, and so that's it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Um so thank you again.
