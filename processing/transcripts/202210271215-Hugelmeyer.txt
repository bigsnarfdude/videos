All right. Hi, everyone. I'm here to talk about ring-valued non-invariance from crossing colorings. My name is Cole Hugelmeier. This is some joint work with Konstantin Mierkel. He's a number theorist, Steph Stanford. This is all a work in progress. I made up these invariants like a little over a month ago only. So there's still a lot that I do not know. But I think they have some fairly interesting properties. Fairly interesting properties. So, I am excited to tell you guys about it. So, much like, say, a gain module or the universal abelian group of finite type invariants, the ring-valued not invariants I'm going to tell you about, they live in a algebraic structure, which is built out of not-like objects modulo-some geometric linear equivalence relations. So, first, I have to tell you what the not-like object is. Like object is that we're going to be linearizing. So I'm going to call it a skewer tangle. So what a skewer tangle is, is it's a one manifold with boundary inside of R3. So this is compact one manifold with boundary. With boundary, right? And it has to have the following property: that for all x in the boundary of L, if we have x plus something on the z-axis, so 0, 0, t, and that's an L, then that implies t equals zero. So if I take any vertical line going through one of the boundary points, it can only, it has to only touch. Components, it has to only touch L at that one boundary point. So, an isotopy of skewer tangles is just an isotopy which preserves this property. And the way you should think about it is: I just have a bunch of skewers that have to stay vertical. And then I have string, which is, I have one piece, one end of the string tied to each skewer, all right? And then I might have loops as well. And then I'm allowed to move the skewers around however I want as long as they stay vertical. And then that would be an isotopy of this geometric object. Of this geometric object. So, what I want to do is draw skewer tangles by a projection that takes all of those skewers to points. So, I'm going to project down the z-axis, right? The strands cannot go over a skewer. Oh, no, they cannot. Cannot. Yeah, an isotopy has to preserve this property. Has to preserve this property that the one manifold does not touch the skewers except at the one point. The skewers, except at the one point where it touches them. Yeah, so really, what these are is these are immersed one manifolds in the plane with crossing data on modular Reidmeister moves, right? So I allow Reidmeister moves, just like any Reidmeister move you might want. I'm allowing that. But I'm not allowing myself to take a boundary point and move it to this. So this is not allowed. So, this is not allowed. I can't take a crossing and slide it over or under any boundary point of my immersed curve, right? Because there's a skewer in the way, right? There's a line here, and then that's going to catch that curve so it can't go over the skewer, right? So, this is a geometric object that I call a skewer tangle, and I'm going to create a ring out of these things. out of these things. But before I do that, I need to explain what these rings are parameterized by because it's sort of like a sequence of rings, but they're not parameterized by integers. They're parameterized by a combinatorial structure, which I'm just going to call a color set. So bear with me for a moment while I'm defining random things. So a color set is just a set C equipped with a function sigma, which goes from C to C. To C and a function s, which goes from c to plus minus one, all right, and these have to have the following properties, all right? For all x in c, we're going to have sigma to the fourth of x is equal to x, and s of sigma of x is equal to negative s of x. So I have a sine function and I have a permutation. And I have a permutation, right? And my permutation has to have either order four cycles or order two cycles. And then my sine function just alternates sine as I go around those cycles. So I have maybe like something like this. And then I could have something like this. And then I might have it. I might have another one like this. Right. And then each of these points is an element of the set C. And then And then they alternate sign. All right, so this is what a color set looks like. All right. And I'm going to be considering C colored skewer tangles. So C colored, which is just a skewer tangle which has a map, which Tangle which has a map which goes from the boundary of L to C. So it's a coloring where each of the skewers of the skewer tangle is colored by an element of my color set. Okay, so this is of course some set of things, but it's also a monoid. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to write S T C square tangles C to be to denote the monoid. Up to isotopy. So what do I mean by this? So an element of this as a set is just an isotopy class of C colored skewer tangles. So, you know, I have a color in C for each of the skewers, and then I can isotope them around, and that would give me a different element of that same representative. Different element of that same representative. And what's the monoid operation? The monoid operation is to take the disjoint union of two skewer tangles. So the way I do that is I just have one skewer tangle and then I have another one, which I move far away in the xy plane, okay, so that they don't interact with each other. And that's obviously a associative operation, right? So this gives me a monoid. It's a commutative monoid. And the empty skewer tangle is the identity of this monoid. Okay? Yeah? Okay. Is there anything about two endpoints of one component yet like to assign the same color to the two endpoints of it? No, no, they can be different colors. That's very important. Yeah. So it's just right now, right now, we don't have anything happening with these sigma and S, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing is happening with these sigma and S yet. Yeah. It's just, you could define a C-colored skewer tangle for any set C. C-colored skewer tangle for any set C, and the fact that it has these combinatorial operations on it will be used to define the relations of the ring that I'm about to describe. Okay, so I can now define the ring valued invariance that I'm talking about. I think it's worth mentioning that if I have any link or not, I can consider that as a C colored skewer tangle, right? Because I don't have any skewers, so I don't have to assign them any colors. And it's a skewer tangle. And you know, it's a skewered tangle. It's just, I don't have any of the skewers. So, any given any link or any knot, I have a representative of this monoid from that link or not. Okay. And what I'm going to do is I'm now going to construct a ring. Yeah? I don't have to add a trivial skewers. Nope, it can have no skewers. It can have an empty set of skewers. Yeah. What is the trivial skewers of paper up to you? Well, so you, so, so. So, so generic skewer, or do I have to have a little bit of a so every skewer has to have exactly one boundary component on it? So, you could have you have to have an even number of skewers. Yes, so you could have, you could have, um, you could have like a skewer and then a one manifold and then a skewer. And this is going to be very important later. And then these would have different colors. So, this would have like color A, color B. Okay, so that's an example of like the simplest skewer tangle. Of, like, the simplest skewer tangle that has skewers. Okay. So we've got the monoid of color skewer tangles here. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the monoid ring and I'm going to mod out by an ideal of this ring. Okay. And the ideal is going to be generated by relations of the following form. Okay. So I is just going to be the ideal generated by relations. Generated by relations like this. Given any crossing of a skewer tangle, here I'm taking a crossing in this projection where the skewers go to go to points. So in the projection where the z-axis gets projected down, I have some skew tangle with a crossing. So outside of this dashed ring, we would have some complicated skew tangle, and then we'd have one crossing. And I'm gonna set that equal in my ring to the sum. To the sum over all x in C plus. So, what do I mean by that? Given my color set, see, I have this sine function here. So, I'm going to partition it as like C is equal to C plus disjoint union C minus, where C plus is just the set of all colors which have a positive one as their sign, and C minus is the set of all colors which have a negative one as their sign. All right, so I'm going to sum over all X in C plus. And what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to excise the crossing entirely and replace it with four skewers. So I'm going to have a dot here, a dot here, a dot here, and a dot here, right? So I've cut off the crossing and replaced it with four skewers of my skewer tangle, and I have to color them. And what I'm going to color them with is x here, sigma x here, sigma squared x here. Sigma squared x here and sigma cubed x here. All right, so you'll see that this is sort of all of the ways to color. If I were to apply this relation to all of my crossings, right, I would be sort of summing over all ways to color the half edges of my knot diagram with elements of C so that the crossings are colored by cycles of sigma. Cycles of sigma in such a way that the top strand has a positive sign and the bottom strand has a negative sign. I'm imagining there might be some questions here because this can be kind of tricky to understand. The color set is sort of a universal way to color the crossings of a knot diagram. That's the point of it. So the cycles of the color set are designed to color crossings, right? And then the half edges of the knot diagram get color. Edges of the knot diagram get colored by the elements of C, right? The cycle corresponds to counterclockwise movement, and the sign corresponds to over or under crossings. So this ideal here is designed so that we can take any knot diagram and break it apart into just a product of things like this. All right. So if we take any knot diagram, So, if we take any nut diagram, or sorry, any diagram for a colored skewer tangle, we can apply this operation to every single crossing, right? And that will give us a just a product of these things, right? So this ring, you where do you start? Like, where does x go? Where does x go? The lower left one. So, here's the thing: this, if, if we were. So here's the thing. This, if we were to rotate, well, if I rotate this whole picture 180 degrees, then that's the same as me summing over sigma squared x, which is in C plus. Yeah, so it's symmetric over a 180 degree rotation. So it still makes sense. Yeah. And I should mention there's sort of more relations than there are generators because the generators of this ring are the isotopy classes of skewer tangles. And the relations have to choose a crossing of a diagram. So these relations. Crossing of a diagram. So these relations are indexed by all diagrams and all specified crossings of a colored skewer tank. But even then, the great thing about this is that it completely reduces down to a finitely presented ring, right? Yeah? Disjoint circles, as you want. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you can have as, yeah, it's just, it can. So, you can have as, yeah, it's just, it can be any compact one-manifold with boundary. So, it does not, it can be, have as many disconnecting components as you want, and those don't have to have boundary, it can be loose. So, that's important because I want to have every link be represented as an element of this monoid, right? So, every link is a colored skewer tangle and therefore is an element of STC or induces an element. Okay, so in particular, that means that it's going to induce an element of this ring, right? Ring, right? And I'll just write that, you know, as class of the link with brackets. So I'm going to write the skewer tangle, which is just colored by AB like this, as just brackets AB. Okay? And these elements generate the ring. By the way, I'm just going to call this ring RC. So this quotient ring is RC. Okay. Okay. Oh, I shouldn't write that as the ideal equals this, but yes. But the quotient ring from this ideal is denoted R C for the color set C. Okay. And now obviously we're using all the properties of the color set, including the sign and the rotation. So here's a theorem is that RC has this presentation. This presentation. Okay, RC has this presentation. So the generators are these things, as we've just described. Given any colored skewer tangle diagram, we can break it apart into things of this form. And then those are just variables for a polynomial ring. So what do I have? I have just the adjoined, like size of C squared variables, modulus. C squared variables modulo these relations here. So we have symmetry under A, B, and B A. We have this, which is corresponding to the Reidmeister one. So these relations are all obtained by taking Reidmeister rows and then breaking them apart by applying this relation to every crossing. So maybe I should draw that. And we'll go over just the example of a Reidmeister 1. So if I have AB, right, I can apply a Reidmeister 1 to it. And I get AB. And then I can apply my relation to this crossing. Okay. And what that gets me is the sum over all X in Z plus. Overall x in z plus of a x, right? Sigma squared x, sigma cubed x, and sigma x b. And you can see that's exactly the polynomial I've written over there. So you have a product of these three things, and then that gives me a polynomial in my generators, which I need to mod out by to get the Reidmeister one move to be there. The Reidmeister one move to be there. I also have to do the same thing for C minus if this is a flipped crossing. Okay. And for Reidmeister 2, I get this polynomial. I have a product of two. Yeah. No, no. No. So what happens with closed loops that have no profit on them? Well, oh, yeah. So I have to prove that those reduce as well. So, right, given a closed loop, I can just apply a Reidmuster one to it, and then I can, and then I can break it into two things, right? Two things, right? So, given any closed loop, I can break it down like this if I need to. And you can easily see that that doesn't change the presentation. Yeah. So, this is a presentation for the ring. And this crazy complicated thing is just what you get when you have a Reidmeister 3 with the six boundary points labeled A through F. All right. You can see I have variable, these are just brackets with sigmas in them as well as X, Y, Z. In them, as well as x, y, z's, and then letters a through f. Okay, and then on the top and the bottom, I have one of each of the a through f, and the bottom, I also have a through f. So, this is a degree nine polynomial, which I need to mod out by to have Reidmeister three moves preserved. Okay. The tambours are not oriented. Unoriented, yes. You could easily do this exact same theory, build exactly the same construction with oriented tangles. The same construction with oriented tangles, but I'm avoiding doing that because it makes things much more complicated. Um, yeah, you can do this. You can, this is a pretty general construction, like you could do this for any sort of system where you have graphs, modulo, local equivalence moves, and you would get a similar ring. Um, I haven't really explored much what possibilities there are in that in that direction. What's the trivial color set here? Oh, so the trivial color set. The trivial color set, I would say that there's no like empty color set. The simplest one I would consider is maybe Z mod 4, right? Where you just have the cycle being add one in Z mod 4 and the sign being alternating sign. Yeah, yeah, at least one cycle. Otherwise, the set of colored skewer tangles is like empty. Or yeah. Oh, yeah, you could do the mod two as well. Yeah, you could do that. No, so you don't actually get non-trivial knot invariance for a one-cycle color set. That's something we've verified computationally. Yes. So for a one-cycle color set, you do not get non-trivial non-invariance yet. That's actually a problem. So I do want to mention, we have this presentation for our ring. And if you have a community. Our ring. And if you have a commutative ring with a specific finite presentation, there's an algorithm to tell you if any two polynomials in your generators are equal in that ring. It's called the Grobinger basis algorithm. And the important thing is that it can get very computationally complicated. And my friend Constantine has been working on trying to compute these rings. And unfortunately, we haven't been able to compute. We haven't been able to compute the Grobner basis for these rings, except in the case of one or two cycles where you're not really getting anything interesting happening. So, the problem is these rings are incredibly computationally complex. They're only computable in theory, but maybe not in practice. Despite this very significant limitation, there's really, really interesting properties of these ring-valued not invariants that I want to talk about. Out. So let's just go over a few of the theorems we've proven about these not invariants. Yes, so we'll do, here's the big theorem, all right, is that if L1 and L2 are links such that they're fundamental groups. Fundamental groups are not isomorphic. All right. Fundamental groups of their coverings are not isomorphic. Then that implies that there exists a color set C, all right, so that the class of L1 is not equal to the class of L2 in RC. In RC. So that means that this invariant is at least as powerful as the fundamental group of the link complement, right? And I should mention that if you can take some results about profinite groups and generalize those to quandals, that would actually imply that the invariants in RC are a complete invariant of unoriented lengths. So it seems very, very likely that these invariants are actually a complete invariant. And I want to prove this theorem for you guys today. So to prove this, we're going to need a lemma, all right? And the lemma is sort of the sort of the linchpin of this theorem, which gives us sort of the connection between these rings and the Fondamel group. And here is our lemma. Here is our lemma. Okay. Let G, capital G be a finite group, right? Then there exists a color set C and a ring homomorphism. H going from R C to the integers such that for all links L, H of the class of L in R C is equal to the number of group homomorphisms. homomorphisms from pi one of L to G. All right, so ring homomorphisms from RC are actually capable of counting group homomorphisms from the fundamental group to any finite group, right? So the way I'm going to prove this is just by explicitly constructing this ring homomorphism. So to do that, first I have to decide which color That first, I have to decide which color set I'm using. Okay, so the color set I'm going to use here is as follows. I'm going to define C plus and C minus separately. So C plus is going to be the set of all four tuples of elements of G. All right. All right, such that ABCD is the identity, and AC is the identity. And C minus is equal to the set of all four tuples in G such that ABCD is the identity and B D. And Bd is the avenue. Now, technically, as subsets of g to the four, these two things might overlap, but I'm going to take the disjoint union of them to form C, because obviously I can't have them having the same size. So C is just the formal disjoint union of C plus and C minus. Okay? And what sigma does, sigma just permutes the four tuples. So sigma of ABCD is equal to Is equal to B C D A. And obviously, the sign is just determined by which of these sets you're in. Okay, so what does this actually mean? What this means, this is sort of a group, this describes sort of like a group presentation for the fundamental group of a single crossing. So what these really are is these are pictures where we have a crossing, and then around the crossing, we are labeling, you know. Around the crossing, we are labeling by elements of our group. And then I have a star next to one of these, next to one of these things, which describes it as being the first element of the four tuple. But I'm going to draw it as pictures like this, where we have a crossing, which each of these things are labeled by elements of the group, so that if we so that this extends to a map on the fundamental group of the neighborhood of a crossing, where we have B being. Where we have b being the value of a loop like this, c being a value of a loop like this, it's always you know counterclockwise loops, okay? So what we then want is for you know the Ford topple. So what we then want is we then want to define the ring homomorphism, right? So what we need is we need to have a way of telling whenever we have an unordered pair of two of these elements. pair of two of these elements of the set. What do they map to? And what we're going to do is that we have an honor pair x, y, where x and y represent elements of c so h of this. The idea is to map it toll one if these things can be connected together in a way that the maps from the fundamental groups are consistent and zero otherwise. So from this picture's perspective, what we want is that perspective, what we want is that the star marked term from X multiplied by the star marked term from Y equals zero, right? That would tell us that we map to one and then it's zero otherwise. Sorry, identity. I should be more clear. So these things just represent the first term of the four tuple, right? And I want to say that if the product of those two things is the That if the product of those two things is the identity, right, then my generator maps to one, and if they're not the identity, I map to zero. And this describes a way of saying, if I can take these two crossings, which are just local pictures of how the fundamental group maps to G, if I can take those crossings and consistently connect them to each other, right, then I'm mapping to one, and otherwise I'm mapping to zero. So this might be kind of. So, this might be kind of confusing. But the point of this is that if I take any link, and I break it down into the product of all of those arcs, and I look, what does that map to under this homomorphism? What I'm really doing is I'm summing over all of the possible ways to locally map the fundamental group. Locally map the fundamental group at each crossing such that it's all consistent across the whole link. So that's really just a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the link complement to the group G, right? So you can see that this construction here actually gives us a nice homomorphism from the complement of our link to the group. So this is a really nice fact. And we can now use this along with some theory. This, along with some theory of profinite groups, to prove this theorem that this ring-valued not invariant actually determines the fundamental group. So let's go over that proof. All right. So, the real important fact here is we've got two theorems, and I'm going to write down the reference. Okay, so one of them is: so, wait, raise your hand if you know what a profinite group is. Anybody here? Okay, a handful of people. Okay, so what a profinite group is, I'm just going to say it's an inverse limit. Of finite groups. And given any group G, it has something called the profinite completion, which is written G hat, which is the inverse limit of all finite quotients, right? So it's just limit, I should say co-limit of all ideals, sorry, of all normal subgroups. Of G, finite index of G mod n. So you just take all the possible finite quotients of G, and this gives you this huge co-filter diagram. And then you just take just this abstract categorical inverse limit of all of that. And the theorems about these that we need are the following two facts. So the first one is just a sort of a classical fact in the theory of pro-finite groups. In the theory of profinite groups, which is that if G1, G2 are profinite, all right, and they have the same set of finite quotients. Then they are isomorphic. And I got this from Ribes and Zelensky, just their book, Profinite Groups from 2000. And the next one is a theorem of geometric group theory from Long and Re 2010. Which is that if two three-manifold groups have isomorphic profinite completions, then they are isomorphic. So I'm just going to write it as pi one of L1 hat isomorphic to pi one. isomorphic to pi one hat of L2 that implies that pi one of L one is isomorphic to pi one of L two right so in general it's not the case that if two groups have isomorphic profine I completions then they're isomorphic but in the case of three manifold groups this is true right so I'm going to use these two theorems so what we So, what we know is that if let's just suppose that L1's class is equal to L2's class in RC for all C. All right? If this is true, right, then we know that the number, because of our lemma, by lemma, we know that the number of homomorphisms Homomorphisms, right, from pi one to g is consistent between L1 and L2, right? So what I claim is then that that then implies that pi, that L1 and L2 have the same set of finite quotients and are therefore isomorphic by these two facts. So why is this the case? All right. So I want to imply my claim. imply my claim is that this is claim is that we have a same set of finite quotients all right so uh what we're going to do to prove this is we're going to take a minimal counterexample so uh minimal counterexample so we're going to have a group h which is a quotient of g so it's a quotient So it's a quotient of pi one of L1, but not pi one of L2. All right, so without loss of general, you know, we could swap L1 and L2. So this is the case. And we're going to count the homomorphisms from pi 1 to h by what their images are. So what we're going to do. What we're going to do is so we have the number of homomorphisms from pi one to H right for either of these links is equal to the sum over all subgroups Q of H of the number of surjective homomorphisms from pi one to Q and since this is a minimal counterexample to our classical This is a minimal counterexample to our claim, we know that this is equal between the two links as long as Q is the proper subgroup of H. And in the case that Q is actually equal to H, we know that these counts are different because we have one of, we have that H is we have that Q is a quotient of this, but not this. So that tells us, that gives us our result. And then that finishes the proof of this theorem here using these results about profile. So this So, this is nice and all, but if it was only for the fact that it reconstructed the fundamental group, I wouldn't be so interested in these invariants. What really gets me excited about these invariants is that I guess linear programming problems within these rings actually correspond to Kangle transformation problems on knots. Okay, so the first thing I want to point out about these rings is that they have Is that they have an ordering. So there's an ordering on these rings, which is just, you know, the positive cone is the positive monomials. So there's a subset, you know, RC plus, which is just a multiplicatively closed subset of RC, which is, this is the thing generated by positive monomials. Positive monomials, yeah. Positive numbers, yeah. So it's just a positive linear combination of products of the ABs. Okay. And this gives us a partial order on our C. Okay, which is generally consistent with its ring structure. And what we're going to do. And what we're going to do is we're going to show that linear programming problems in this ring correspond to tangle equivalence questions. So here's a new error. All right. Let L1 and L2 differ by a crossing change. All right. In this case, what we're going to do is we're going to define a finite list of polynomials in RC. So we're going to for A in so A is a four tuple. I'll write it as ABCD. And this is in C to the fourth for some color set. So it's just four. Force for some color set. So it's just four elements of a color set. Okay, we're going to define p plus of a and p minus of a by the following polynomials. One of this is just a positive, one of they're just opposite sign crossings where we have ABCD. On the endpoint. So these are skewer tangles, right? So here I have diagrams of skewer tangles. And obviously, those correspond to polynomials in my ring. And this is just polynomials I can define. It's a list of sides of c to the four polynomials. Okay. And my theorem that I want to say, so this is the theorem. The theorem is The theorem is that there exists a function which goes from c to the four to rc plus, all right, so positive monomials, with the following properties, the class of L1 is equal to the sum of all a in c to the four f of F of A P plus of A and L two is equal to the sum over all A in C to the four F of A T minus A. Okay, so what we've done is we've said that if L1 and L2 differ by a crossing change, then this Then, this linear programming problem of finding positive, of finding these, you know, n to the four, this finite list of polynomials, all of them positive, which solves these linear equations. So this theoretically will give us an obstruction to the existence of a crossing change, which is computable. In practice, it's totally not computable at all. As I said, like even like computing a Computing of Grobner basis for these rings is pretty much impossible, let alone solving a linear programming problem in them. But in theory, this is something that you could just do in a finite computation, is to check the value of these obstructions. And in general, you can generalize this lemma to give you an obstruction to any imaginable tangle transformation. So if you have any way of replacing a tangle with a different tangle, Have any way of replacing a tangle with a different tangle, then you would get a linear programming problem in this ring that says if this linear programming problem does not have a solution, then there's no possibility for those two links to be related by that tangle transformation. So ideally what you would want is you would want an order preserving map that takes RC down to something easier to calculate in. So ideally, what you would watch. So, ideally, what you would want is maybe a ring homomorphism to R that's order-preserving, right? Where you could then get an obstruction in R instead of in RC. By R, I mean the reals. So this is not so easy. So here's where the stuff gets difficult. If we want to describe a homomorphism, if we want to describe a homomorphism from RC to the Homomorphism from RC to the reals or to the complex numbers, so we just want to have RC. This blackboard is a bit problematic, so I'll just use this one. So if we have a ring homomorphism, which goes from RC to the reals, okay, this can be described by a matrix, right? So we have some matrix. So, we have some matrix where on the top we have the elements of C, on the left, we have the elements of C, just in some ordering. And then the terms of here are the values of just what does AB map to. Whatever AB maps to, that's the term of this matrix, right? So the ring homomorphism can be described by a matrix which satisfies the relations I just erased. Yeah. So. Yeah, so uh so if you want this ring homomorphism to be order-preserving, right, that corresponds to all these terms being non-negative, right? If uh if they're all strictly positive, then you have a chance of it being more effective. Um, so the issue with the ring homomorphisms we can construct so far is the following: either so far, Either, so far, just based on what we can't construct, either they don't give you non-trivial non-invariance, or they have lots of zeros in this matrix so that it's not an effective unnotting number bound. So, what I should say is what we want, so the hope here is we're hoping for a matrix like this where all injuries are positive, are strictly positive. Are strictly positive and it's non-trivial not invariant. So any matrix like this would give us a real value not invariant, right? In fact, it would give us a positive value not invariant if all these terms are non-negative. In the case of the one we just constructed with the color counting thing, that is a positive value dotten variant. It is an order-preserving map from the ring to the reals, but it doesn't have all of the entries strictly positive. So it doesn't have a good chance of giving us a nodding number bound. In particular, if all the entries were strictly positive, we would have a cone in the plane. The plane, so that if you took an ordered pair of links and then mapped the values of their invariant into the plane, if it lived outside of this cone, they would not be connected by a crossing chain, right? So if we had all of the entries strictly positive, we would get this picture. And there are many matrices where all of the entries are strictly positive that we can construct. They're sort of trivial. There's this trivial sub-variety, which is Which is dimension is equal to the size of C minus the number of cycles of sigma. So if you had, say, like four copies of Z mod 4, then it would be a nine-dimensional sub-variety. But this sub-variety, it just maps onto a line. Like any two links are going to have the same value, which is quite unfortunate. But the hope is that there's other components of this variety that actually. Variety that actually have all of your entries positive, right? And actually give you a non-trivial knot invariant. So the issue is finding these matrices. Once you have one of these matrices, you can compute the values on a knot relatively efficiently. But the issue is actually finding the matrix in the first place is an extremely difficult task because we cannot compute a Gromier basis for RC for any interestingly sized C. C. So, the current approach, which we haven't really fully implemented yet, is to try perturbations. So, if you have some list of polynomials, as we do, and you have a solution, which a solution in that variety, which we get from any group, right? Given any group, in fact, any quandal, even a quandal involution, all of those types of coloring invariants, you would get a Invariance, you would get a matrix like this, right, with ones and zeros. And then the hope would be we might be able to find some perturbation of that matrix into the variety, which is non-trivial. And finding those perturbations is easier than solving for a Goebbel basis because it becomes just a linear system. So if you actually do the calculations of what the computational complexity is, is that Is that for a color system with 18 elements? That is the smallest we've found so far where we know for a fact that RC is non-trivial, because with that color system, you can describe the three-coloring invariant of knots. So we know that the tricoloring invariant is non-trivial and distinguishes knots. And you can describe that with a color system of 18 elements with three four cycles. 18 elements with three four cycles and three two cycles. And if we calculate what the possible linear perturbations of that are in the variety, that computation using cutting edge linear algebra algorithms should be doable in a finite amount of time. So that computation, it should be possible to determine if there's actually a perturbation that takes us to all positive terms here. And that should be something that can be answered. That should be something that can be answered. And that's the direction I hope to go with this research going forward: is to actually see if we can get non-trivial unknown number bounds using this technique, which would be really cool. And other than that, the final remark I want to say is that there might be some hope that these invariants could be used for help towards a certain conjecture. Help towards a certain conjecture in finite type theory. So there's the conjecture that are two knots, given the knot, is it determined by its finite type invariant? So can we have two distinct knots which have the same finite type invariance? And here's a theorem. All right, is that if That if L1, I should say, if L1 and L2 have the same finite type invariance. Then the class L one minus L two. The class L1 minus L2 is always a zero divisor in RC for any crossing system, right? So if you can find any of these rings where the difference of two knots is not a zero divisor, that would actually imply that those two knots are distinguished by some finite type invariant. And since I'm Finite type invariant. And since I'm out of time, I'm not going to go over the proof of this, but I will if anybody wants me to show you. Yeah. So, yeah, I think I'm done. Great. Any questions for Cole? So you mentioned you have this size 18 guy where you at least know that there is a thing. Can you prove non-existence for any smaller sizes? So I can prove that if you have one cycle in C, then Have one cycle in C, then it does not give you any non-trivial link invariant. Okay, if C has two cycles in it, it can count the number of link components. So for example, you could have a matrix of ones and zeros like this, which gives you a coloring. And what that coloring is, it's an orientation, or it's a coloring of the link components by different colors. So if you have a matrix of these with ones and zeros in it, this generalizes things like Generalizes things like coloring by orientation, coloring by colors, coloring by a quandal, coloring by an implutoquondyl, coloring by a group homomorphism. But yeah, all I know is that if you have one cycle, it doesn't tell you anything. If you have two cycles, it can count link components, but not really do anything else. Anything more than that, we can't do computations. Okay. Yeah. So ideally, we would want to have interesting functions of these rings that we could compute quickly. Of these rings that we could compute quickly, but that's also a difficult problem. I see. I actually had a second question that is from everything that you said, is there anything special about S3? I mean, like, can you at least do like thickened surfaces in the same construction? Yeah, so these invariants perfectly easily extend to virtual links. So, yeah, so I think the right way to think of these is that they're really virtual. Is that they're really virtual link invariants. You could, I don't quite know the best way to think of them as link invariants on a surface. Maybe you would have something like twisting the generators by elements, by generators of the fundamental group. I think if you're in a surface times an interval, you could probably add a like make some cuts on the surface so that what you get is something that's genus, genus zero. And then Genus zero. And then you would have the rule that the skewer is never allowed to go over one of the cuts. And if you add that rule, then right, then you're twisting by the fundamental group. And then I think you would get something pretty interesting. But I think that I think understanding it just in R3 is difficult. So I don't know. Yeah, understand. Thank you. So, does this invariant also remember, like, or can it distinguish mirrors, I guess? Can it distinguish mirrors? Yes. So, it like there are quandals that can distinguish mirrors, right? Okay. So that's like the fundamental group obviously doesn't, but this is more powerful than the fundamental groups, yeah. Other questions? All right, let's make call again.
