And then let me introduce the first speaker today, who is David Bolt, who's going to talk about reduced school and we should be on a dream and mention the file. Okay, thank you. And thanks to the organizers. It's been a wonderful conference. I've enjoyed it a lot. So I guess they put all the speakers who weren't really talking about Spinoria or October aspects of G2 and Spin 7 geometry on Friday. Because I must admit, I'm not. Because I must admit, what I'm talking about isn't really directly to do with these subjects. I'll mention G2 a few times, and the Octonians will appear once. But this is a sort of a different kind of geometry than the thing we've been talking about. Should also mention that this is work in progress, so there's no reference yet for this available. Okay. Yeah, so I want to talk about a particular geometric structure that exists in dimension five, which I think is quite interesting. And hopefully, I'll be able to convince you that it's developed. Convinced you that it's just a little bit interesting and then show some results. So, when I say a geometric structure in dimension five, what do I mean exactly by a geometric structure? Well, in Enrique's talk, he talked about the notion of a H structure. That's exactly what I mean when I say a geometric structure. So, I use G instead of H. Doesn't stand for anything. But yeah, so the way I want to capture the idea of a geometric structure on a manifold is in a G structure. So, what is a G structure? Structure. For me, oh, it's interesting. Dating doesn't talk as well. Okay, yeah, so for me, a G structure is a principal G sub bundle of the coframe bundle of the manifold. So the coframe bundle is the bundle whose fiber at a point consists of the coframe set to that point, and the coframe is sort of a linear isomorphism from the time and space at some point of M. Basically, something RM. So, this is the co-frame, and then fibers of the co-frame bundle are just a set of all of these things at a given point. So, this would be a fiber of what B. Okay, so we have this co-frame bundle, and then a G structure is a principal G sub-bundle of this thing. Okay, so examples would be, for instance, if G is a special thought. Would be, for instance, if J is a special orthogonal group, then that gives you a Romanian metric. Actually, also an orientation. That should be just the orthogonal group, you should put it special there. That could be true. Or if I have the general linear group over the complex numbers sitting inside the real general linear group, then the G structure associated with that is an almost complex structure. And then G is equal to G2, then a G structure is indeed a G2 structure in the sense we often think of it. We often think of it, which means you know a positive definite three-form on our manifold, so these two things are equivalent. And then another slightly different example: if we have the trivial group, just with one element, then a G structure corresponds to a parallelization of M. That's because if we think of our co-frame bundle, if I have an E, a trivial group sub-bundle of that, and that's just going to be a co-frame at every point. And of course, I can dualize. At every point, and of course, I can dualize and turn a co-frame into a frame and do a parallelization. Okay, all right, so now that we have our notion of geometric structures, since we're doing geometry, we really want to understand these things up to coordinate changes. So, we're interested in the question of understanding G structures, understanding geometric structures up to the action of the diffeomorphism group. So, Cartan, Cartan's method of equivalence, is sort of a technique for dealing with this in general. It's not quite an algorithm, but it gives you. It's not quite an algorithm, but it gives you a procedure that you can pretty much follow along. At some point, you have to make some decisions, but it gives you a sort of way to solve this problem of understanding if I have two G structures, when are they equivalent? Actually, the bitheomorphism group. So I'm not going to explain it in general. In general, it's quite subtle, but we will need to talk about it in the case when our group G is a subgroup of SON. So in particular, I would call these like a metric G structure. So our group is a compact. Group is a compact, compact group. And again, this SO, and this should be an ON, I suppose, really. All I say is okay. So I'll describe a little bit how the method works. Please feel free to stop me and ask if you have a question here. So the invariance is invariants of all orders, not just first-order invariance. Invariance of all orders. In principle, the method gives you a complete set of invariants, although we were talking last night about what exactly that means is also subtle. But I'll explain the. Also subtle, but I'll explain the result that comes out at the end of this. So, what happens in the metric G structure case is that we leverage the fact that we have already solved the equivalence problem for Riemannian metrics. We understand that the curvature and its covariant derivatives provide a set of invariants. And we take our invariance of our G structure relative to that. So, yeah, what we do is we say that since G is a subgroup of ethical, then our manifold carries a Riemannian metric. Carries a Riemannian metric G. So we can work, instead of working with the bundle of all co-frames, we can just work with the bundle of orthonormal coframes. So that would be the co-frames that pull back the static metric on Rn to be equal to the metric that you have there. So we'll work inside that bundle. Okay, but on this bundle, on this bundle of orthonormal coframes, we have two very nice forms. So I'll explain. Two very nice forms. So I'll explain the top logical one form because I think it's completely standard. So this eta is going to be an Rn valued one form that's called top logical. So it's going to take in a tangent vector. I guess this works for the general Gofream bundle, so it takes in a vector, vector fields. Field, say I have a co-frame U of F, and what does it do if the projection of my coframe bundles of my manifold is pi? Then I take my vector, push it down to the manifold by pi, push forward, okay. This now lives in a tangent space of M, but we're working at a point where we have a co-frame, so then I just use the co-frame to send that over to R. So then I just use the co-frame to send that over to Rn. So did u i star of v, and this is what eta of v. So it takes in back the fields and it gives you something, and it's an element of Rn. So it's an Rn value of one form. So we have that, this is a canonically defined form on any sub-bundle of the co-frame bundle, but in particular we have it on this bundle of orthonormal co-frames. Now the fundamental limit of Romanian geometry says we also have a unique Romania geometry says we also have a uniquely defined torsion-free connection that perfects the Romanian structures that we have this Levi-Chibita connection, which we can encode as a little SON, so the algebra of SON valued one form on this orthonormal co-frame bundle B. So it's just a connection form on this bundle, and it takes values into the algebra of SON. So together we have these two one forms which take values in Rn and SON. If you add up the dimensions, that's the same as the dimensions. Dimensions. That's the same as the dimension of the orthonormal co-frame bundle. And it turns out that these things actually are themselves a co-frame for this orthonormal co-frame bundle. So you have enough forms to have a framing of the downer space at each point. Okay, and these forms together, now that we have one forms, we really want to differentiate them. And they satisfy these so-called first and second structure equations. So this is just saying really that theta is a connection form. form uh there's no torsion here so it's torsion free uh and this last one is saying something about the curvature of a so r is an equivariant function uh from b s o n to b into this space that's equivariant with respect to the g action so it represents a you know a tensor on the base of the manifold it's just the curvature of the romanian metric so we have these one forms that satisfy these differential equations that's the upshot here and they are canonical That's the upshot here. And they are canonically defined in terms of the structure. So, what we do now is we pull everything back along the inclusion. So, we have this orthonormal covering bundle. Inside that, we have our G structure. And we pull everything back, this. So, yeah, the next step is to restrict everything, pull it back. So, we need to think about what happens to our forms. Well, our connection form took values in SON. We now have a G action instead of an SON action. So we should probably decompose the Lie algebra SON where theta takes values into representations, at the very least. So we've seen before it splits into G plus G perp, compact group. G perp may not be irreducible, but certainly we have this decomposition. And that's reflected by splitting this form theta, which takes values in SON, into a piece gamma, which takes values in G, and this other piece T of eta, which takes the piece of pieces of Other piece t of eta which takes values in g per. So it somehow this thing, this part of it gets written in terms of the etas. Now, because we've restricted to a smaller dimensional space, we still want to get a co-frame on this. You know, some of the thetas are going to become written in terms of the etas. They get written by this function t. So this function t is a g-ag variant map from our g structure into this space. So it's supposed to take in something in edis, that's why you. Something in edis, that's where you get the Rn star, and then spin out something in G perp. So you have this function G. So what we have here then is gamma is a connection form for our G structure. So it's now this connection now preserves the G structure and it defines the so-called natural connection, which is just the sort of projection of the Liebachevita connection of the Lie algebra G. Not the canonical connection, just the so-called natural connection. called natural connection and this function t is the torsion of the t structure. Okay now if you take Cartan's first structure equation before which was d eta equals minus theta wedge eta and just sub in this equation then you get this this structure equation. So I've slightly changed these around this is sort of meant to be schematic just to see the t appears in a linear fashion and you can imagine how this space would actually give you an action on two forms. It's going to give you something in Rn. You something in Rn like this. So, this is the first equation that becomes this. And then the other thing we have is the gammas. And then they satisfy an equation like this. So K now will be the curvature of the natural connection gamma. So again, we have a co-framing of BG. We have a co-framing on our G structure given by the components of eta and gamma. And we have structure equations that they satisfy. Okay. Okay. So you mentioned the canonical connection. Well, there may not exist a canonical connection anyway. This natural connection always exists and it's canonically defined in the sense that any diffeomorphism of the G structures will preserve this. But it's not what is called the canonical connection or the characteristic connection. It's just something else. So K is the curvature of the natural connection. Yeah. It's T which are not the natural connection. Yes. T which were not enough. Yes. Can you say again what do you mean by T of E per G? Yeah, okay. So by construction, D perp is a subgroup of SON, algebra of SON, which you can think of lambda 2, Rn star. But in this space, G per that's Rn star. You just change some indices around, and then add it up and do formulas that you take in RN. Okay, but these equations are mainly meant to be, I think, schematic rather than, you know, I could write it with indices, but there are some complaints about I don't give any indices in formulas, so I removed them all. Okay, so the upshot is we have these two things, and what the equivalence method tells you is that all of the diffeomorphism invariants of the G structure are Are expressed as sort of, or all the invariants that might be expressed in polynomials of the derivatives, are expressed as polynomials in the torsion, the curvature of the natural connection, and their covariant derivatives with respect to this natural connection nabla. Oh yeah, I mean I've misspoked it's a subspace, it's not a sub-algebra, yeah, that's just wrong. So, this result that is for certain soil. And it follows from the fact that the And it follows from the fact that these, that we have a co-framing on the G structure, and then there's a so this is actually an E structure on this larger manifold and there is a result about equivalence of E structures that has this result as a corollary. An ionized answer. Well, it's a little bit complicated. Well, it's a little bit complicated in that case. Yeah, yeah. You can certainly say if the nanoz tensor vanishes, they're all looking equivalent. And all the information you want will be contained in the nanolas tensor in some sense, but it's a little bit vague. This is one of the subtleties of the equivalents. Yeah, because you have to worry about, say, the orbit type of the nanas tensor, and there may be subcases that you have to deal with. Yeah. Okay, yeah, so this is what Cartan's method equivalence implies. And we will actually use this to explain something later. We will need this. Something later, we will need this result. Now, there are relations between all these things. So, for instance, the first B anti-identity, if I differentiate the first structure equation, I'll get zero on the left-hand side, I'll have a d gamma term, I'll have like the derivative of the torsion, say, and like the edit terms will appear. And so you see that there'll be some relation between k and the derivatives of the torsion, the micro torsion. So you'll get relations like that. And it depends a little bit on the actual nature of the group G that you're dealing with, exactly how many relations. That you're dealing with, exactly how many relations you get, etc. This was the kind of thing Bruget thought about when he proved his theorem classifying possible honourable polynomials? Are you restricting? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I mean all the polynomials that are polynomials in the jets of the d structure itself. Yeah, yeah. I think there should be some stronger results, actually, so it should be that all the local invariants can be written as functions of these things. Yeah. Okay. So So, yeah, we have this result, and then so the most interesting natural case is to ask: when can a G structure have vanishing torsion? This torsion is a first-order variant, it's sent to us to ask when it could be vanishing. So, when that happens, you can sort of check by hand that the metric G has to have holonomy contained in the group G. Metric little G has holomony contained in the group big G. And then, if the manifold is irreducible, so it's not locally a product, say, and it's not a locally symmetric space. And it's not a locally symmetric space, then G itself must be a group that appears on Berget's list. So these groups are well studied. We spend a lot of time thinking about them. In particular, we think about these G structures even when distortion exists. But what I want to talk about today is sort of, if we want to think about G structures in general, these are very special examples. And just to get a flavor of metric G structures, just what happens when you choose a group that's not on this list? You know, what are the phenomena that appear? What kind of geometry? That appears, what kind of geometries do you get? Is there anything interesting there that happens? Yeah, so the idea is: you know, if you think that's a good question, you should probably start at the simplest case rather than picking some hard group. And actually, the simplest irreducibly acting group that's a sort of compact group that doesn't appear on Bouger's list is a particular copy of SO three that lives inside SO5. Everything else would be like products of circles and then it doesn't act irreducibly. So this is somewhat the simplest case of this idea to look a little bit beyond. This idea to look a little bit beyond Rouger's list. Okay, so this is what I want to talk about: G structures where G is this particular SO3. So SO3 structures in dimension five. So what is this group SO3? Well, if I think of trace this symmetric 3F3 matrices, it's a five-dimensional vector space, and I can act on them by conjugation by an element of SO3. That preserves, you can check easily, that preserves them being symmetric, it preserves being traceless. Of service being traceless. So, this gives us an embedding of SO3 inside SO5. It turns out to be that the representation that you get on the five-dimensional space is irreducible. So, when I talk about SO3 and SO5, I'm talking about this one. There's another SO3, the one that fixes two vectors, but we're not talking about that. So, for us, when I say an SO3 structure on a five-manifold, I mean a G structure with respect to this, this group, G. Okay. Now, because SO3 is a structure. Now, because SO3 is a subgroup of SO5, or because SO3 is a compact group, an SO3 structure induces a Romanian metric already, which is a metric structure. But the question is, what is the other information that we need to sort of specify this SO3 structure? Because some people, for some reason, don't like sub-bundles with co-frame bundle. They'd rather their geometric structure be encoded in a tensor because they can differentiate the tensor, say. It turns out that this is, in addition to the metric, we have a cubic form. The metric, we have a cubic form. So, if I think of this action of SO3 on this five-dimensional space, it preserves the determinant function. So, on this five-dimensional space, the action of SO3 preserves a cubic function, which is the determinant. So, we can just take that and paste it to the tangent spaces of a manifold with an SO3 structure. So, just bring the linear algebra to a point, and you get this symmetric cubic form, which is usually called epsilon. Usually called Eupsilom. The determinant is a symmetric function of the, it's a polynomial in the elements of a matrix. And the polynomial is the same thing as a symmetric form. Because multiplication commutes for these variables. Yeah. I should also mention this isn't due to me that this is sort of a survey of what's been known about these structures. I'm not making any claims that I discovered this. I'll talk about the history in a few. I'll talk about the history in a few slides. Yes, so we have this symmetric cubic form epsilon. And so then it's the pair G and epsilon that determine the SO3 structure. And it's the same way that a three form, say, determines a GG structure. Unfortunately, the symmetric cubic form is actually not quite enough to define it on its own. You would have something non-compact there. But the pair does. So we think of these manifolds as having a metric and some quite special cement. A metric and some quite special symmetric cubic form on them. Okay, yeah, so here's the promised history slide. So, as far as I could tell, maybe Elke could correct me, but I think that the investigation of these structures was suggested by Thomas Friedrich at first, and it was sort of, he was thinking in the context of connections with totally skewed torsion, because we'll see in a little bit that this is possible for certain types of these structures. So, I think he suggested it, and I've seen it in some lecture notes. We've probably told other people about it, but I don't think he really wrote a Other people about it, but I don't think he really wrote a paper about it. And the first people to kind of write a paper about this were Bobyensky and Nirovsky, a 2005 paper. This may not be quite right, but they certainly said a lot about this cubic form. I don't know. I think Friedrich maybe must have known there was a cubic form, clearly, but in this paper you can find lots of information about the cubic form and its sort of algebraic properties. So they investigated to say what the torsion could be, what the curvature could be. They found some interesting classes. They did quite a lot of it. It's a very nice paper. It's a very nice paper, Carlos Journal. Since then, there's been a few other papers. So, Chiossi and Fino studied SO3 structures on five-dimensional Lie groups, so, sort of a symmetric situation. And then in 2011, Ilke, Beckerbander, and Thomas Friedrich wrote a nice paper that sort of studies the topological criteria for the existence of an S23 structure. So, you get some necessary conditions, like the first Pontragon class has to be divisible by five, you have banishes and Stefan-Whitney. Blah, R5, you have banishing some stief-Whitney classes, some other conditions. I think we maybe don't quite have a necessary insufficient condition that's very easy to write down. But this is contained in this paper. And then there also were some specific homogeneous examples that they studied. So. Yeah. Well, Michael probably will mention that some of these are already automatic, I think, in Wentify. So W5 equals zero, I think, is probably automatic. But yeah, it is interesting, certainly. Yeah, it is interesting, certainly. These are the same fruit. Bottom? Two fruit trips, so it's the same fruit. Same fruit, yeah, yeah. And so they come together to the main kind of works that have been done on these things. There's been some other papers around this that I'll maybe mention later, but these are the sort of the central ones. I could be wrong about this, LP. You could correct me if it's. Okay. So just something of note. The only actual examples that you can find in these papers, they're all homogeneous. Now, of course, if you just want to write down an answer. Now, of course, if you just want to write down an S of three structure, you can actually just do it pretty easily. But what I mean is that the interesting examples, people are getting examples that are interesting, and actually, they're all homogeneous in these papers. No, a manifold with an S23 structure is not necessarily spin. So, or spin C even. But there may be something there, but it's a little bit But it's a little bit harder. Yeah, Michael will tell us that it's definitely spinning it. But there's interesting things actually. I wish I was going to be here for you. So yeah, the own examples are homogeneous. So let's talk a little bit more about the geometry of these. And let's put them in a bit of context. So we could generalize this condition. I know we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves. I just introduced this and I'm already talking about generalizing it. But just to get a flavor for this geometry, we could think about what directions this could go in. And actually, there's several generalizations you could make. Several generalizations you could make. So, you know, the way this action arises is by an action on sim20 of R3. So there's a few things I could generalize here. So I could generalize the two into a P. And so actually SO3 acts on this space. It's an irreducible representation of SO3. These are all the irreducible dimensional irreducible representations. And this would give you a notion of irreducible SO3 geometry in all odd dimensions, in particular in dimension 7 and the Brigade space. And the Priget space would actually be an example of one of these things in dimension seven. And this is sort of how I was led to think about these things. Actually, it was coming down from dimension seven. You know, Jesse and I have a paper about the Priget space, and there's some other things that appeared in my PhD thesis that made me think about these. Ph3, Phoenix. Pardon? Ph3. Yep, yeah. Exactly. Yep. So you get these things. And I also mentioned that the pseudo-Romanian cousins, so instead of SO3, if you look at SL2R of these geometries, they appear. Of these geometries, they appear in sort of non-Riemannian holonomy and also sort of in like applying the method of equivalence to ODE and PDE problems. You get these SL2R structures where we have this irreducible action of SL2R. So that's kind of a non-Romanian cousin. So one way to think about these five models, manifolds, is their Riemannian versions of these geometry of differential equation things that you get. I'm not sure what that really gives you, but it's kind of interesting. Another generalization you could make is you could generalize the sort of three that appears in this. Sort of three that appears in this, the R3, and then you would have instead of SO3, you have SOK acting irreducibly on this space, and you can look at manifolds like that. I think Anna Theno Havilnerovsky have one paper discussing K equals 4 case. So we're looking at SO4 structures. And SO4 is a very interesting group because it's not simple. And so in this case, it's like a 9-manifold. And you get like kind of interesting generalizations of the notion of a self-dual four manifold appear. So different, you get sort of the curvature breaks up in more. You get so the curvature breaks up in more ways. As far as I know, that's the only curvature that does all these things. So we generalize the two, we generalize the three. What is there left to generalize? What happens when you're going to say complex? Yes, you could generalize the R. So we could turn an R into R, C, H, or an O. So there are three four groups, SO3, SU3, SB3, and F4. And they can all be defined as acting on sort of traces her mission. As acting on sort of traces permission 3x3 matrices over the respective fields here. And then these associated geometries have been. There's a few papers about these. Narovsky has one or two. These are the ones that have analogs of this cubic form epsilon. It turns out that the epsilon, a particular level set of it, defines an isoparametric hypersurface in a sphere. And then Cartan classified a cubic isoparametric hypersurface. Cartan classified these. So these are kind of the groups that are possible. I'm not so sure. Someone asked me about this before as well. I'm not sure. I suspect not somehow, but maybe if you add some symmetry and really reduce down to something, you could see it. I think the first three of those should have should go on to be infinite family, but then F four should be really special. Uh yes, but if you want to think of them as this, you know, symptoms of this Jordan alpha yeah, I guess yeah, and you'll sort of see generalizations, I suppose, of this situation appearing. Suppose of this situation appearing. Yeah, so all these sort of do play with each other as well. You could imagine pairing these two, getting some very strong generalization. So we have these. And then there's sort of another direction. We know this theorem follows from Priget's classification that the groups on Pruget's list act transitively on the unit sphere in their holinom representation. Whereas the action of SO3 on S4, inside the representation we're using to define the d structure, it has cohomogeneity 1. How cohomogeneity one. So the orbits here are distinguished by the value of the cubic form, the value of the determinant. So in a certain way, this is again a simple way to go as a generalization of Peget's list because we've gone from a transitive action on a sphere to a Coleman genetic one action on a sphere. So that's a possible generalization. You could just look at G structures where we have this situation occurring. So nice examples would be like isotope reactions or rank two symmetric spaces. We give you lots of examples. And this fits in that picture as well. In that picture as well. Yeah. The interesting thing about these is that you would have interesting equations you could write down for hypersurfaces here because now the normal vector of the hypersurface will point in the sphere, which gets acted on by Covid R1. So you can write down equations for hypersurfaces by demanding that this normal vector points in certain nice directions. So you'll get a nice rich sub-manifold theory in these things. So if you if you look at the groups So if you if you looked at the groups, which I think called J1 and sphere, and you classify these, and you wanted to say that these can't have control of the pieces of that only. But you could ask how small is the torsion, for instance. Yeah, exactly. This is sort of the theme of what my actual results are going to be about. No, not in this level generally, just in the specific example. For access to technical spaces. This is the equivalent actually to the last approach on your last slide. Is it? Yes. Okay, yeah, yeah, there should certainly be. Yeah, these all are coming to anyone. Okay. Maybe I should add some more groups then. I think there should be. Yeah. But in any event, this is exactly these three actions in RD and then you have dominoes going into play. Okay, yes. So may I need to add the adjoint action of SP2? That's common to anyone, for instance. Basically, that's it. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Certainly, it's related there. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I think this is related. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, but it doesn't preserve any planes. You know, it acts trans it doesn't act transit on the sphere, but it's not that the orbits are planar, you know. Orbits are planar, you know. The orbits are okay. Yeah, so let's talk a little bit more about the geometry of these manifolds. Probably a natural question if you used to teach you in spin seven geometry is what do the differential forms look like on these manifolds. So we should talk just a little bit about the representation theory. So I mentioned it before that these are all the irreducible representations and they have dimension 2p plus 1. Okay, so now we have our space of differential forms. We just look at how it's how it decomposes. Decomposes and it uh goes like this. So, zero forms, of course, are irreducible. One forms are irreducible because our action is irreducible, but it's the two forms that decompose. As you would expect, we're going to get a three-dimensional thing from the fact that the Lie algebra SO3 should be in there. And it turns out what's left over is a seven-dimensional, irreducible. And then once you have these three, you can just use the hot star to flip them over. Get these. Okay. Yeah, so this is repeating what I said. So we have the trivia representation, these five. Presentation: These five-dimensional ones correspond to H2, which is R5, and the three-dimensional ones, H1, Z3, seven-dimensional ones are H3. So now that we have this, we can talk about the torsion classes, the version of the Grey-Hervella torsion classification of these structures. So, yeah, I mentioned it before. If I have a metric G structure, the torsion takes values in this space. Now, this space will usually not be Certainly, not be irreducible under the action of G. So, if we're good representation theorists, we should definitely decompose it to understand better. So, we can decompose this into irreducible representations, and this code gives us a rough classification of the d-structures into torsion types, at the very least. So, in our specific case, G purpose PH3, that is the lambda 2, 7 that we saw before, and then the torsion space is this space, which is H3, 103H2, which the Klepschordon formula tells you is 5, 4, 3. So there are five sort of irreducible representations in the torsion space, and therefore there are sort of two to the power of five, which is 32 possible torsion classes of SO3 structures. In the same way that there are two to the power of four, 16 possible torsion classes of G2 structures. Now, it'll be a little bit of work to work out which ones actually can occur and which one's split up into two. I'm not going to do that, but there probably are some. But there probably are some which don't actually really occur. Anyway. And again, this is this appears in Mirovsky and Boliansky's work. So, what happens if the torsion vanishes? That's like the simplest torsion class. Well, we already said that this can't really happen because the Halloween group must be contained in SS3, doesn't appear in Berger's list. So it follows it must be locally symmetric. And there are symmetric spaces that have this isotopic representation. So there's this space SU3. So there's this space SU3 model, SU3, the Wu space. I think Michael mentioned it in stock. Interesting from a topological point of view. There's R5, if I just think of sort of the flat model here, realized in this way with an eight-dimensional symmetry group. This is the irreducible SO3. And then there's also, if I think SL3 mod SO3, this is sort of the negatively curved dual of this guy. So there are these nice three models. And then we can think in general of an SO3 structure. And then we can think in general of an SO3 structure on a five-manifold as sort of a curved generalization of these things. So more about the geometry of the, oh no, I guess I need to talk about the curvature. Yeah, we mentioned the torsion. If you look at Perget's, the way he actually classifies the holomy group, you realize that there should be very little curvature left over once you take the first Bianca identity into account. In this case, there's only a one-dimensional. In this case, there's only a one-dimensional, there's only a single invariant that gets contributed by the curvature that isn't related to the covariant derivative of the torsion. So there's just one invariant that turns out to be like the scalar curvature of the induced metric. So we have the torsion, we have the torsion covariant derivatives, and then we just have the scalar variant R, which is contributions and curvature differently. It's very different from the G2 case, yeah, yeah. This is how Project classifies the holomory groups of CE. So when this space is very small, you can possibly have a When this space is very small, you can possibly have a non-symmetric example of the following. Yeah, so then, yeah, the first Bankian entity says that all the other curvatures are written in terms of sort of alpha t and t itself. What about the co-write derivatives of the curvature? Well, it turns out that dr, which would be the co-write derivative of r, it gets written in terms of the co-write derivatives of t as well. Actually, as you would expect from the fact that you know when the torsion vanishes, you must be one of these symmetric spaces. These symmetric spaces. Spaces. These symmetric spaces are Einstein, particularly they have constant scalar curvature. So if the torsion vanishes, the scalar curvature is constant, then you kind of know there must be a formula that expresses the derivative of the scalar curvature in terms of the torsion. Couldn't be any other way. Yeah, so you could just see this. Have to be a symmetric space or just locally? Locally symmetric, I guess, yeah. Yeah, I think I said it on the slide. We love it symmetric model lines. Okay. So, these manifolds, I think this is getting to some new stuff. One reason these manifolds are interesting is because they have special sub-manifold equations that you can write down. So, you know, similarly to the case of the G structures that we're maybe more familiar with, the ones in Bouger's list, these manifolds with an SO3 structure, they admit special classes of sub-manifolds. But if you remember our decomposition of differential forms, there was no invariant differential form on this space, really. On this space, really. So these aren't calibrated sub-manifolds, they're something else. So the way you define them is this graph mining of three planes in R5. So we're going to be talking about three-dimensional sub-manifolds. It has a particularly special SS3 orbit. So this is a particular three-plane that has stabilizer, an orbit consisting of three planes that have stabilizer S1. So the way this works is if I take the maximal torso semester 3, then R5, you can see. Really. Then R5 decomposes as a trivial representation plus a C that spins speed one and a C that spins spin two. So decomposes inspector maximal torus. We'll have this. And then O is going to be the SO3 orbit and this way. So O is going to be the SO3 over this particular. Going to be the SO3 orbit of this particular one. We only get from an R and a C1. By the way, we've defined it, it's S1 invariant. You might ask about the other one, it turns out to not be interesting. So I take the maximal torso S1 inside SO3, and I look at how that acts on the representation R4. And it breaks it up into some representations of the circle group. Representations of the circle group are given by they're either trivial or they're Like, they're either trivial or they're C and they spin with some speed. So, this is saying this one spins twice as fast as this one under the actual. Yeah, they're not dimensions, yeah, otherwise it wouldn't make sense. So, we have these nice, this nice orbit of three planes that you can define. And I'll say that a three-dimensional sub-manifold in my manifold is as a three-structure as type O. If the image of the Gauss map takes values in this orbit. So, if I think of taking the sub-manifold and mapping as tangents, Taking the sub-manifold and mapping its tangent space up into this Grassmannian. If I end up in this orbit, I'll say I have type O. There's some ambiguity, but the fact that we only care about the orbit takes care of the ambiguity here. So this is a well-defined concept. It's like a first-order equation for our sub-manifold. It's saying that our tangent space is special in some way. I'll explain after I give the theorems because they don't hold in the case. Yeah, so yeah, the proposition theorem. Yeah, the proposition theorem is that sub-manifolds of type O exist through every point of M, if and only if M has the torsion type H1 plus H2. So if and only if the smallest two torsions are the only torsions that exist. Can you write associations of M plus one special points? Yes, you can, yeah. This is how I got into these things. What was the question? Can you write it if you're in the seven-dimensional geometry? Can you write associatives in this way? Can you get some nice class of associatives? The answer is yes. Yeah, so the Yeah, so these things at the very least exist, which is nice, and they just fit every point if and only if M has this torsion type. If M doesn't have this torsion type, it's very unlikely for these things to actually exist at any point, to be honest. But there may be one or something. So the proof of this proposition is sort of an exterior differential systems argument. It's pretty standard if you know the techniques. Yep. So Landsberg, one of Robert's students. One of Robert's students from a long time ago, Robert Brown's students from a long time ago, he was working in a very different context, but he observed that if we're in R5, then the submanifolds of type O are minimal. Lansberg was doing something interesting. He was looking at all the possible first order conditions you can put on a submanifold that imply the minimal surface equation. So he observed that they're minimal submanifolds. So it's interesting to ask if it generalizes. So this proposition generalizes that fact. So if M has torsion type H1 plus H2, which is the only case we're interested in for these sub-manifolds. Only guys you're interested in for these submanifolds, then these are guys are minimal if and only if m has torsion type h1. Okay, what that means is all submanifolds are minimal if and only if m has torsion type h1. A better way probably to state the theorem would be to say that the mean curvature of something like this is given by a piece of the h2 torsion. So if that vanishes, then the minimal follows out of matter. Okay, now the question, why is the other orbit not interesting? You get existence. Well, no, sorry. You don't necessarily. You don't necessarily get existence. They would be minimal if they existed, but the existence is a little bit dicey, and I think they just shouldn't exist, really, in general. When you look at the exterior differential system, it's somehow more system. You can't apply to standard techniques. And you can kind of tell right if the answer is going to be no, so there's not much point uh calculating. There are no examples. Uh there are examples in flat space, but there are only finitely many examples in flat space. It's just all homogeneous. And then you expect in the curve space things are only going to get worse. Carrierspace, things are only going to get worse. Yeah, so we could generalize this to all of these irreducible SO3 geometries in all odd dimensions. And in dimension seven, it actually turns out that any of these things of type O, they're automatically associative. So the Proget space has one of these geometries, and this is part of my work with Jesse about associatives in the Proget space, was that we classified these things at the Proget space. Sorry, Gabby, 25%. What do we feel interested in? He observed that there are minimal submonifolds. You said there were finitely many? There are many of type O. There are finitely many if you use the other C. Yeah, yeah. There's actually about the same as open number JSP paper, but slightly different. Yeah. So I think these sub-manifolds are interesting. That's pretty much all I'll say about them, but I think it's an interesting avenue to think about. You get this nice class of minimal sub-manifolds, and it plays nicely with the torsion type. This will be the torsion type I'm going to talk most about. This will be the drawn drive. I'm going to talk most of the budget. I think, I mean, that's interesting, but I think it's not automatically minimal. In flat space, I think they end up just being planar, like being a complex curve or something in the R4, and I think you don't get existence in other cases. But certainly, there are lots of different orbits that you could look at. You know, it's a complicated orbit structure, but this is, I think, the most interesting one. Just thinking calibrated. I'm just thinking calibrated for bucket column users would be also interested. So, now a natural question: given that we're all teacher geometers, et cetera, we have sub-manifolds. Do we have gauge theory? So, we have nice sub-manifolds. Do we have nice connections? So, one thing that you might want in a fast-mass connections is this instanton property. So, I'll say that a subset of the two forms has the instanton property. It sort of came up in some of the problem sessions. Of came up in some of the problem sessions. If every connection that has its curvature to keep values in S here is automatically Yang-Mills. So an example of something that has the instantong property is lambda 214 of R7. And then once you know that you have the instantane property on a linear algebra level, sort of, then you think it makes sense to talk about it in manifolds. Unfortunately, there's a negative result. The ones you might hope for, lambda 2, 3 and lambda 2, 7, they don't have the instant on property. Also, the equations, the number of equations would be bad too, so this isn't so good. Of equations would be bad too, so this isn't so good. Um, and I'll leave you as a question: um, are there any non-linear SO3 invariant subsets that have the instant home property? So, in the same way that our sub-manifolds were not defined by a calibration, maybe our special connections are not defined as a linear subspace, but they're non-linear. This is the question. You could maybe try and mimic this. I didn't do it yet. You could think about, you know, can I look for S1 invariant subsets, a subset with skip visor S1? So, this is the question. I think these things maybe should have some sort of interest. These things maybe should have some sort of interesting gauge there. Maybe not though. So if you had a positive answer, it would be like a gauge-directed version of Landsberg's theorem on these things, these type of manifolds are not five. Okay. I did say I would mention G2 a little bit. So these things have a G2 twister space. I won't say very much about it. So if I have a manifold with SS3 structure, then I have automatically a rank 3 vector bundle. It's just the associated bundle for the three-dimensional representation of SS3. SS3. Then it turns out, I think this is pretty much due to Povyansky Narovsky, that this sphere bundle of this thing admits a canonical five-parameter family of G2 structures. What I mean by canonical is that diffeomorphisms of the SO3 structure will give you diffeomorphisms of the G2 structure in this way. So an example would be: I think you can get the nearly parallel G2 structure on the LFOX space and one minus one in this way, in this five-parameter family, but it's not such a nice element that this. But it's not such a nice element of this five-parameter file me. There's a natural way to write down this five-parameter file members, and then the parameters aren't so nice. So I don't know if there's really much to be said here, but it is kind of interesting. I think in Michael's talk, he'll generalize this a little bit to say when I have a rank 3 bundle over a 5 manifold with conditions, then the sphere bundle has a G2 structure. But the point here is that we have this canonical family of G2 structures. When you have the S2 structure, you get the family of G2 structures. So you could ask questions about, you know, can I get associatives by pulling back something from the base, etc. By like pulling back something from the base, etc. You could ask for the torsion of the G2 structure, given that you know the torsion of the torsion of any of these G2 structures given the torsion of the SS3 structure. I think they should. But you want to lift them up, so you need to find a way to do it canonically. But there should be some way to just yeah, take the second one about the form or something that would help. That's a good question. That's a good question. What happens if you take any stairs? How does it look downstairs? I didn't think about that. Yeah, you'd have to be like invariant in some way. Yeah, that's an interesting question. Yeah, yeah, like for sure you would think the torsion's the curvature still will end up in both those spaces, but that's a good obviously won't have the instant one property, but like these G2 structures, how they're going to be able to do that. Yeah, yeah, these G2 structures, I guess, will maybe be nearly parallel sometimes, but but Be nearly parallel sometimes, but they would have the instant on property, but in general, not. So, yeah, I think. There's definitely some. Some equation, yeah, possibly, yeah. Okay, now I want to talk about nearly integral SO3 structures. So, this is a definition. I'm going to say that my SO3 structure is nearly integral. It's fundamental that Q book satisfies this equation. So, if I put a vector field into it, so four times, into the derivative, four times, then it's zero. This is something you can do. Something you could do. So these were introduced, I guess, really by Friedrich, actually, but Bobyanski and Nerovsky. Kind of as an analog of Neil-Kaylor structures, there's another context I'll mention in a second. You know, the Neil-Kaylor equation, you can write it in this way. So if you just sort of have a cubic form, you just have more stuff that would be in. It's analogous in a very simple way, I suppose. But there are more, yeah, so the torsion class of this, you can do the calculation. Probably it's better done with a diamond operator, but Better done with a diamond operator, but let's do it. And this turns out to be equivalent to the torsion lying in H1 plus H3. So three-dimensional plus seven-dimensional space. Now, this is also the space of three forms on R5. So this is the right space. If you want your torsion to be skewmetric, this is the right space for it to be skew symmetric. So I think actually this is probably the reason why they thought about this class. The name nearly integral comes from nearly an analog with Neely Keller. But these are the ones that have been. But these are the ones that emit a characteristic connection. I think these are the ones that could emit a characteristic connection. And then maybe Ilke, in your paper, you actually showed that it is the unique characteristic connection. So there's an existence question. This is possible. This is necessary. But I think you provided, you said it's sufficient as well. Yes. I won't really use this connection very much, but certainly there is this SO3 connection with Tilt ESQ torch that you can write down when you have. Okay. So, how much time do I have left? Okay, perfect. Okay, so our problem that I actually want to talk about is hopefully convincing that there's some interesting geometry going on in these spaces. But given that I mentioned before that the only examples in the literature are homogeneous, maybe some red light should be flashing in your head. Should be, are there any actual examples beyond homogeneous spaces? Homogeneous spaces. So, this is kind of there's two questions here: really locally, are there examples with local existence? How many of them are there locally? So, the local generality question. And you could ask for ones of specific types, and probably you want a geometric reason to study these ones of specific types. So, for instance, the nearly integral ones, I think, have a nice geometric motivation because of this characteristic connection. Maybe the type pH one is interesting because of this minimal subanifold stuff, etc. So, this is the local problem. So, this is the local problem. And then, if you solve the local problem or you understand the local problem, then you want to tackle the global problem. You know, do these things exist on compacts, have they connected manifolds, say, et cetera. So, my philosophy, at least, is first solve the local problem, then solve the global problem. And this certainly, in this case, turns out to be the right thing to do. I think. Yeah. Okay. So, the main theorem is solve. Solves the local problem, I guess, for nearly integral SO3 structures. So the space of germs is finite-dimensional. So there's sort of only around a point, there's finite data that will tell you specify the germ completely of an SO3 structure. This is in contrast to many other cases, all the cases that appear really in special economy theory. So, for instance, nearly killer metrics, if you looked at nearly killer metrics like around zero in a small ball, there's infinitely many. There's infinitely many. They depend on a certain number of functions, a certain number of variables in the sense of zero differential systems. If you look at any of the torsion classes of G2 structures, the ones that actually have examples, they're all infinite dimensional. So this is sort of a, you know, this thing was saying there's something different going on here. And of course, it's length to the fact that S and three can't be all in the group. It's length of this. So this space is finite dimensional. So what's different about this case? Well, there's a technical difference. Well, there's a technical difference. You want to solve this problem probably using exterior differential systems if you can. But it turns out that the PD here is, for nearly killer ones, it's very nice. It's what we call involutive. Whereas the PDE describing the daily integral structures is not involutive. What does that mean? Well, sort of roughly speaking, if I write down a PDE system, typically we're thinking of an overdetermined PDE system where there are more equations than unknowns, then you might derive extra conditions just by different. Extra conditions just by differentiating my equations repeatedly and always using the fact that mixed partial equipment, mixed partial derivatives should commute. So we say you're involutive if when you do that, you somehow don't generate any new or interesting conditions. So by interesting condition, I kind of mean a condition of lower, that lives in a lower depth than you would expect when you differentiate. So this is the vague sense of involutive. So if it's involutive, then you can apply the Cartan-Kaylor theorem to prove existence in the real. Time Taylor theorem to prove existence in the real analytic category. But if it's not involutive, you can't. You have to do something else. Well, yeah, you basically add equations until you get involution. So, yeah, in the case of our system, just for the general torsion class, you've got to differentiate it four times, which is aided by the representation of the theory of SO3 being pretty easy to understand. And then you'll get a large number of restrictions that have to be. Large number of restrictions that have to be satisfied by the two and three tets, but they only appear after differentiating four times. So that's unexpected. But the genetics will have this property, but certainly it counts as an unexpected restriction. So you have a lot of equations. So the 2 and 3 debt is heavily restricted here. So what you do is you just add those restrictions, make an even bigger system, and just do it again. And then it turns out that you eventually will reach what's called a Frobenian system. I'll show how that works later. Once you have a Frobenian system, Later. Once you have a Frobenian system, you can conclude this fact about the space of germs being finite-dimensional here. Now, the actual dimension of the space of germs is a little bit hard to say because there's lots of place fitting that happens in the general case. Part of the reason why the paper has not appeared yet because it's very, very messy in the general case. Yeah. Okay. So let's not talk about the general case. Let's rather talk about the case of torsion type H1. Okay, so one of the things that happens here when you see this restriction. One of the things that happens here when you see these restrictions is you see many of them vanish when you're in torsion case H1, so whenever the H3 part of the torsion vanishes. So the system simplifies a lot. And we'll sort of illustrate the techniques that what do you do after you have this Frobenius system. So we'll illustrate that in this case. Any questions? This is not too familiar, I think, to many people, the stuff of involutivity, et cetera. But maybe this example will only know. You say it's by nine dimensional, do you know how many dimensions? It's hard to say because of all the case splitting. Not more than nine. Actually, this case turns out to be the most general. But you know, it's not a smooth manifold, really. There's all sorts of branches, but I guess the top strata is nine-dimensional. So let's illustrate how this kind of goes. This computation goes by taking the case where the torsion lives in H1. So here I'll just write T. So here I'll just write t is equal to v because it's more like a vector lives in the vector, in R3. So v now is some equivalent function from b to r3. And then our first structure equation, well we just change the t to a v. If you remember we have this first structure equation. And then what you do is you sort of differentiate this equation and then you say what can the derivative of gamma be and it turns out that all it can be is this function a has to appear and the function a appears here and here. So when you differentiate this, In here. So when you differentiate this, you get restrictions on the derivative of v and the derivative of gamma that mean that there must exist some equivariant function a from my g structure to the space of symmetric 3 by 3 matrices. And they must satisfy this equation. This is sort of schematic. There's like some contractions, et cetera, missing. But I just want to mean that A appears linearly in the derivative of V. In fact, A is the covariant derivative of V with respect to the natural connection. And then A also appears in the derivatives of gamma. Of gamma. You may be wondering what happened to this R, this single scalar invariant that I was talking about. Well, it's just the trace of A, maybe modified by the norm squared of B or something. So when you differentiate, you get these equations. The next step when you do this kind of method is to differentiate again, because you want to know. So A, only the traces part of A is the derivative of the. Derivative of V. Okay. Yeah, yeah, so maybe there should be a sub-zero here. Or yeah, this contraction. I'm sort of writing it schematically because I don't think it's very useful to see the actual obeses. Oh, five. Thanks. Okay. All right. Yeah, so the next thing to do is to differentiate these. So you want information about the derivative of A. And when you do that, something interesting happens. You find that the derivative of A, so this right-hand side will be the correct derivative of A. Oh, this R is spurious. It shouldn't be here. That should be an A. Well, that just shouldn't be. Be an A. Well, it just shouldn't be here. When you differentiate, you'll get AB terms and like V cube terms. What's interesting is there's no new function appears here. It's just the same stuff again. So if you differentiate that equation, you get zero equals zero. So what that means is sort of this system closes up on itself. There's no more relations that are satisfied. So actually, this system is involutive. We got the system by adding some extra condition. Okay. What we want to do to prove local existence. To prove local existence, is now we want to just take some eight manifold. So, the dimension of our B structure is eight-dimensional. We want to take some eight-manifold and we want to construct the form eta, gamma, b, and a. And once we construct these, we can sort of recover the SO3 structure. So it turns out if you just write this naively, actually the Frobenius theorem will apply, but Khart Khan packaged it very nicely as like a generalization of Lee's third theorem. Lee's third theorem integrates the Lie algebra to a local Lie group, or at least the local version of Lee's third theorem. The local version of these 13. If there were no, if all these right-hand sides were zero and the b's and a's were constant functions, this would be the exact same problem. Hard time to analyze it in the case where you might have varying right-hand sides. So you can apply this theorem that says if I have a fixed element in this vector space, then I'll get a unique solution to this system. So an eta, a gamma, a b, and an a. And so open ball around zero that satisfies the system and such that the value of zero is actually given by these two functions. So this is where you get the finite dimensionality result because. Finite dimensionality results because of the uniqueness statement here. So these eight, these nine numbers specify the germ, actually. And I'll just say you can recover M by quotienting this ball by this act of the vector fields dual and recover the SO3 structure in this way. Yeah. So then B turns out to be an open set in the actual structure itself. Okay. Actually, what you care about is not the actual values, you care about the SO3 orbit. Values, you care about the SO3 orbit of this B and A, because as we change in a coframe, these things are going to vary. So, actually, what we care about is the SO3 orbit. So, we lose three dimensions in our nine parameters describing the local germs. This is a six-dimensional space. It should have been six when I answer your question, all right, Jesse. So, we get this six sort of parameter family determined by the orbit. So, this function is called the structure function. And the upshot of this theorem is the structure function completely controls the geometry. Geometry of the G structure. The structure function kind of specifies what the local germ is, and then the geometry is just controlled by the local germ completely. It's completely controlled by the behavior of this function. So we're interested in this function if we want to think about global issues. We've provided the solution to the local problem, but now we want to understand the global problem. So we have our manifold. The picture is. The picture is we have RB, and we have the structure function that maps from B to R3 to SIM2 of R3. B projects down to the manifold M you get by dividing by SO3, and then this maps down to some other space, and then we get a map in here. So this maps into orbit space. Space. Oh, this space huge. Okay, and then it's really this map that's controlling what's going on here. So we're interested in what does the image of this map look like? Well, you can work out that these equations must be satisfied. So the image of the map upstairs, there must be constants C1, C2, and C3 so that these equations are satisfied. So it's a co-dimension 3, sub-manifold of this space. Like this. This tells you something interesting. I like the geometry of these. So, yeah, this sort of function descends to map S. This is the map that goes along here into this. This is how I'm generating the orbit space. It's an orbifold in general, not a manifold, and this is a problem. If I let sigma C1, C2, C3, oh, and N is just the set upstairs defined by the equations that I wrote on. If I let sigma be the image under there, then my structure function maps. Then my structure function mapped n into sigma. Now, for generic values of c1, c2, c3, this sigma is a three-manifold. It's defined by three equations, and this is somehow a six-dimensional orbifold. So generically, this thing is three-dimensional. And that's a little bit interesting because our map M, our manifold M is five-dimensional, but we're mapping into something three-dimensional. So that means that there are two-dimensional fibers. So the fibers of our structure function are generically two-dimensional, let's say. Let's see. So, what does that mean? That means that inside M, there are these fibers, so two-dimensional things, where the invariants all keep the same value. But the invariants control, you know, the invariants are the same, then the germs are the same. So, that means actually if we move along the surface, the structure doesn't change. So, that says there's kind of a two-dimensional symmetry group happening. There's kind of a two-dimensional symmetry group happening here. Now, it's a symmetry group avoid because I didn't say that you could do it globally. So it's like you might not be able to compose these symmetries. But what's interesting is we didn't make any assumption about symmetry whatsoever. And out of this structure function, the fibers of these tell us the dimension of the symmetry group, and it's not zero. There are really symmetry vector fields here. So we get two independent symmetry vector fields. You might wonder what's the symmetry group, and you do a computation and you show that they commute. So you always have an abelian local symmetries. Alien local symmetries here. So if you want a compact example, you're probably going to have like a TG symmetry maybe is the kind of thing to look for. So these are somewhat automatic torque in some sense. Now we want to understand better the subset, where the image of the structure function lives. This map S takes a dense subset of M and submerses it onto the interior of the subset. You have to worry about what's happening at the boundary, but certainly away from the boundary. But certainly away from the boundary, the period of the boundary will be sort of some co-dimension greater than one thing. So, on this dense subset, you submerge onto the interior. And then you can start to ask global questions. So, it turns out if you want M to be smooth and compact, then this sigma needs to be bounded. That doesn't always happen, but it does happen. So, this puts some restriction on the value of C1, C2, and C3 that are possible. So, you want it to be bounded. Now, why am I not? Now, why am I not presenting a theorem that says these are the compact examples of these things? Because you have to do a little bit more, because the way we construct is we build the 8-manifold, then we quotient by an S3 action. So you might produce an orbifold at the bottom. So you want to avoid the orbifold singularities. And the orbifold singularities will sort of happen as you approach the boundary. So there's two bad things that can happen. Could be that the distance to the boundary of sigma turns out to be infinite when you look at the manifold. The manifold is non-compact. We don't want that. Non-compact, you don't want that. Or if the distance is finite, it could be that when you get to the boundary, this boundary is somewhere to the orbital points of the orbit space. Then your manifold develops an orbital singularity there. So you need to avoid that. So doing that, you need to understand this map a lot better. So that's something that's still kind of work in progress, although it's a little bit further on you.
