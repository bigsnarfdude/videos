Yeah. So I'd like to talk about an application of ACSV to prove an interesting result in statistical mechanics. So I'll give an overview of how this works without really going into a lot of details. So the story begins with the cube recurrence. So this is a certain three-dimensional non-linear recurrence that was introduced by Jim Propp in 2001. And the reason Propp came up with this is that he Top came up with this is that he was studying a similar recurrence called the octahedral recurrence, which showed up in alternating sine matrices and terminal timings and things like this. So this was something that people were studying. It had lots of nice properties. And Trop wanted to come up with another recurrence that, or similar recurrences that have similar nice properties. And the octahedron recurrence sort of lives on the vertices of an octahedron. So he came up with the cube recurrence. And here Evidence. And here is how it works. So think of this picture over here as a hole where a cube should have been. So it's a cube-shaped hole. Or you can also think of it as the back side of a cube. And think of this as what you get when you fill the hole with the cube. Or you can also think of this as the front side of the cube. So you assign formal variables to each of the vertices of the cube. So you see seven vertices here. So you have in B, C, D, E, F. B C D E F G H, these seven variables. And when you fill in this hole with the cube, you lose sight of this vertex over here, but you see a new vertex over here. So the edge goes away. You don't see it anymore because it's behind the cube. But you see the front vertex of the cube, while the other six vertices are visible throughout. And what the cube records is, is this equation that relates all these eight variables. All these eight variables. So it looks complicated, but it has a lot of symmetry. So what it's saying is a times h, so the vertex in the front times the vertex at the back, is equal to the sum of products of opposite vertices. So b times e, they are opposite, plus c times f plus d times g. So that's the records. So the way you want to think of this is you want to move the age to the other. is you want to move the h to the other side and think of this as saying, so suppose I knew these variables, then when I fill the hole with a cube, I lose sight of h but I see this new vertex over here. What this equation is saying is a is this expression in terms of the initial variables. So it's giving you an expression for the new vertex you see in terms of the variables you have. Any questions? Any questions about the Q bracket? Bad question? How does that sum and produce are working? Oh, this over here? Yes. Right, so you have the front vertex, which is A, times the back vertex, which is H. So that shows up on one side. On the other side, you take vertices that are opposite. So B and E are opposite, C and F are opposite, and G and D are opposite. I can start out other U. I understand that. How do you multiply some variables? Just like. So they are just formal variables. So just think of them as variables in some polynomial ring. And this is some sum. Is that the question? Then divided by also means multiply by the inverse? And don't you have to worry about whether you're on the left or the right? Oh, so think of this as the ring of rational functions generated by all these variables. So everything is commutative and you have division. Okay. So where does this come from? So the story I told you makes it seem like the cube records is this artificial construction that Prop came up with, but it actually turns out to show up. It actually turns out to show up in many parts of math which don't at all seem related to each other or the cube nectarines when you first see it. So, the one that you're likely to have seen before is the star triangle transformation for electrical networks. So, maybe this is something you've seen in high school. And it turns out that the cube recurrence is equivalent to this star triangle transformation. The other ones are maybe more exotic, so we're puzzled as to what we've what exactly we've seen in high school. What exactly we've seen in high school. So, the other one is the flucaination for the orthogonal Grassmannian in its projective embedding. So, this is something called the spinner variety. So, the octahedron records that Prof was initially looking at is the usual Proker relation for the normal Grashmanian. So, this is like a type B version of that. It's also something that people in Integral Systems studied a long time ago. Studied a long time ago called the discrete BKP or Miva equation. It's also closely related to cluster algebras. So the cube recurrence is not itself a mutation in a cluster algebra, but there is an underlying cluster algebra structure where it becomes a sequence of mutations. And it also shows up in algebraic geometry as the pay identity for theta functions. So the point is just to say that there is something fundamental about this equation that makes it show up in a lot of different places. And I don't know why it shows up. And I don't know why it shows up all over the place, but it seems to. And all of these are kind of well understood now. And in these settings, do we still just have an equation of this type, or do we also have some underlying geometric structure that's analogous? So usually you have a graph and the setting of the cube is a little bit too it corresponds to the triangular lattice we'll see. And in some of these cube And it's all things you can define more generally. But yeah. Other questions? Okay. So what is interesting about the cube recurrence or the octahedral recurrence, so why did Prop come up with this? So the reason is that you see something nice when you run the recurrence. So here is sort of how you run the recurrence. So you need to choose some initial conditions. So the initial conditions for us are going to be holding. For us, are going to be holes in the shape of plane partitions. So, think of a three-dimensional Young diagram-shaped hole. So, in this case, think of this cuboid-shaped hole, or think of it as the backside of this cuboid. And then what you can do is you see a small cube-shaped hole over here, so you can fill that in with a cube. And when you do this, the cube reference tells you that the new vertex you see, the variable over there, should be this expression in terms of the initial. Should be this expression in terms of the initial variables. And now you see a cube-shaped hole over here. So you do the cube recordings again. And when you do that, you get this expression over here. So P was already given by this expression over here. So I substituted that for B. And that's why you got this more complicated-looking equation. And you see something nice over here. So this example is a bit small, so maybe it's not too surprising that this is not an arbitrary An arbitrary rational function, it's actually a Levant polynomial. So there is no, you're not summing some polynomial in the denominator, all the denominators are monomials. So in this case, it's not too surprising. There was never a step where you had something in the denominator that became a sum. But you can imagine if you started with a large plate partition, you would replace this h by whatever the cube records tells you you should replace it with. And then you have a sum in the denominator. And then you have a sum in the denominator, but magically the sums always cancel out, and everything is always going to be a round polynomial. So this is, yeah. H and L are the vertices at the back. Yeah, oh. Yeah, H and L are the two vertices at the back. So you need to go, yeah. Okay, so this was also a property of the octagon record. So this is Caljection. Of the obtagated records. So, this is conjectured by Krop that the cube record satisfies, has this property that its solutions are always Lauron polynomials. And it was proved by Formian and Zelensky shortly after in a famous paper where they proved that this is generally true for cluster algebras, that you always have Lauron polynomials. But the cube recognizes not a cluster algebra mutation, and it was, so they proved something more general, and this was one of their examples. Is there an easy description of a Laurent polynomial? That's the phrase you use. Yeah, so a Laurent polynomial is like a Laurent series, except it's finite. So you are allowed to... It's a sum of polynomials. Alright, but there is something more special about this than the fact that this is a Laurent polynomial. If you look at the coefficients, you see that they are all plus one. You see that they are all plus one. So there is no other integer or a minus sign here, which suggests that maybe there is a combinatorial object that is in bijection with the monomials that you see over here. So this is true for the octahedral recurrence. The monomials you get are in bijection with the terminal tilings of the anti-click diamond. So this is true by spire. So it's not too surprising that there is a combinatorial object here as well. So Prop used to have this So, Prop used to have this research program for undergrads at Harvard, and he gave this problem to two undergrads and they solved it. And the idea is: if you keep doing this, inflating this more and more, then the denominators are always the hidden buyers to the single power. The denominators are going to be just the hidden bias. The vertices that are deep. No, that is not true. I think that's it looks like that in this example because it's too small. Like once you go sufficiently deep, like if your plane partition is huge, then some of your denominators are going to be but only functions of those powers. h to the q, k to the second. So that's right. You're not going to get the stuff and the boundary in the denominator, right? Because the only time you pick up a denominator is if you fill a hole with a cube and it's only the interior once. That's it. Okay. So the combinatorial object they discovered is called the globe, and that's the object that showed up in the title. So I won't define it in the most So, I won't define it in the most general setting, but I'll describe it in a slightly more restricted setting. It's called a what? A growth. Grove. So, okay, so I'm going to describe it for these specific plane partitions. So, the ones that look like simplicis. So, this one has size 3. There are 3 cubes. But you can imagine what size 4, 5, and so on look like. So, this is some infinite class of paper. So, this is some infinite class of plane partitions that it's somewhat easier to describe what a group is, but it's the same, there's a similar description for all plane partitions. So, starting with this, I can create a triangular lattice by taking all diagonals of all the cubes. And the grove is going to live on this triangular lattice, or this portion of the triangular lattice. And here is what it is. Lattice. And here is what it is. So, as the name suggests, it's some kind of spanning tree-like object. So, it's a spanning forest whose components have to connect boundary vertices in a prescribed way. So, here is sort of a cartoon of what the connectivity is like. And here is an example of an actual growth. So, what's the condition? So, all these solid dots are all the boundary vertices of this triangular region. So, there are also internal vertices, but I haven't highlighted them. Vertices, but I will highlight them. Now, in a grove, this boundary vertex must be in a connected component, and that connected component must not contain any other boundary vertices. So, there is one connected component in the grove that contains this boundary vertex. There is another connected component that contains these two boundary vertices and no others. There is another one that contains these three and no others, and so on. And these should be all the connected components you have in your forest. So, if you look at this over here, this is an actual This over here, this is an actual grove. There is this isolated vertex, which is a component of its own. There is this component, and then there is this one with this connectivity, and then there is this one which has this connectivity, and so on. So, any spalic forest with this connectivity condition is converted through. And the theorem, so these are the two undergrads, Carol and Speyer, they prove that the monomials that are They prove that the monomials that appear in the solution to the cube reference, they are in bijection with these groups. So I won't tell you what the explicit, it's an explicit bijection, but I would need to define more terminology to say this, so I won't say this. And so if you've seen terminal tilings, which are what you get when you do the octagon deployers, then you know that they have this really This, then you know that they have this really nice Arctic circle phenomenon, and so it's natural to look for an Arctic circle for gloves. So, what you do is you take a large triangle, so this is of size 100, and you sample a grove uniformly at random. You see something cool. You see that it does not look entirely random. There is this in-striped circle, outside which the grove just looks deterministic. So, there are certainly lots of growths that are not looking like this, but almost all growth. Looking like this, but almost all groups look like this. So, all the measure is concentrated on things that look like this. So, this is called the Arctic Circle Theorem. This is called the Arctic Circle. So, you should think of this as maybe a melting crystal, where these regions over here are the portions of the crystal that are frozen, and the region inside is the liquid portion, and the circle is the phase boundary. So, Peterson and Speyer proved this, so they proved a version of Proved a version of this. So, what they proved is: say you take, so there are three types of edges in a triangular lactase. So, you take one type of edge, say the horizontal edge, then the probability that you see a horizontal edge in this region over here that is outside the circle but inside the triangle, goes exponentially to zero as you let the size of the triangle become large. So, that's some statement of this Arctic Circle Theorem. And Barashnikov and Prematural proof. And Baryshnikov and Timato proved a stronger version of this. They showed that inside the circle you don't have this exponential DK, and you also got more precise asymptotics for this. Okay, so how is a result like this proved? So I'm not going to really prove it, but just to give you an overview, there is a sort of algorithm to do this. So there is one piece, which is finding a generating function. So you look at the probability of So, you look at the probability of finding a horizontal edge somewhere in your triangle, in say a large triangle. So, this Pijk is telling you what is the probability of having a horizontal edge somewhere in your triangle. But it's doing this for all sizes of triangles. So, as i plus j plus k goes to infinity, you're looking at a very large triangle. So, i plus j plus k is like the size of this triangle. So, it's doing it for all triangles at the same time. So, the fact that your rows are So the fact that your roles are so closely related to the cube recurrence means that this Pijk also satisfy a three-dimensional recurrence. And that lets you actually write down the generating function. So this was done by Peter Smith-Speyer. So they found this generating function. And in their paper, they kind of do it by hand. But now ACSP tells you that you have to do the following. So what you do is take the tangent cone to this polynomial over here. So this is a singular variety. Variety and it's singular at this point 111. So you take, you look at what kind of singularity it has at 111. So locally it looks like this conic over here. So this you can think of as a plane curve, as a curve in P2 in the projective plane. And then you do projective duality, it's going to give you another curve, and that curve is the octet curve. So there is this easy procedure for getting the octet curve out of the generating function. Arctic curve out of the generating function. Any questions or yeah. So I was wondering why is it more loneliness? Why is it more loneliness? Right, so we have this expression over here, and like each And like each one of these is going to be like there is a growth for each of these pi monomials, but I don't know how to say pi sister monomial. I'll say pi monomial mean like just by monomial yeah I mean each of these summons. One of those corresponds to a grow. So for this guy there's gonna be five growths and they correspond to precise to these. And also your spending hundreds they do not have specified groups. Yeah, they don't have specified routes, so there are no orientations. Other questions? Okay, so the goal was to generalize this. So this was for the uniform probability measure of growth. So what kind of other probability measures can you put on growth, and what kind of results can you get by doing this? So the last By doing this, so the natural probability measure to put on a spanning tree or a spanning forest in statistical mechanics is you assign a number to each of the edges of the curve. Usually this is called a conductance curve because usually the setting in which you see this is electrical impulse. And then you would define the probability of a growth or a spanning tree to be the product of, to be proportional to the product of the rates of the edges that are in the growth. This is the standard thing. This is the standard thing you do. So, in this setting, you can certainly do that, except that the analysis that Peterson and Speyer had, it goes through the cube reference. But if you define your probability measures in terms of these conductances, then it might break all the precise algebraic things you need for that analysis to work. But it turns out that it doesn't. So, I told you that. So, I told you that the cube recurrence is the same thing as the star diagonal transformation for electrical networks. So, what precisely this means is that your conductances live on the diagonals. So, your conductances live on these red edges while your cube rectangles is happening to the variables at the vertices. But there is a transformation that lets you relate these two notions and Motions. And so if you do the cube records on the variables at the vertices, it is equivalent to doing the star triangle transformation for conductances. So I'm not sure who this observation is due to. I think it might be Fomin and Zelinsky, but it's not written down as far as I know. And this is, so the fact that this star triangle transformation for conductances becomes precisely the cube recurrence for these other variables. The cube recurrence by these other variables. It turns out to be exactly what you need to make everything work out. And so, all the analysis that Peterson and Speyer did, you can generalize that. And when you do it, you get more interesting Arctic phenomena. So if you, so to get this one, what I did is I chose conductances that are periodic in two directions. And I also needed some other. That's not sufficient. There is more conditions you need to put on the conductance. More conditions you need to put on the conductances. But there is a way to make it work. And then all the analysis goes through. You can find the generating function. Once you have the generating function, you can do the thing that Barishneko and P mantle tell you have to do, taking the dual curve. And you get this arctic curve over here. So now there are some features here that you don't see in the previous one. So what are the new features? So one of them is that there is a new frozen research. That there is a new frozen region over here. It's not so easy to see, maybe, because it's a bit small. But in that region, the growths looked like zigzags. But it is still frozen. That region, it's always going to look like these zigzags. But more interestingly, there is a new phase, which is called a gaseous phase. So there is a classification of phases in this model, essentially due to Kenyon Okukawa and Sheffield. And they say Sheffield, and they say exactly what phases to expect. And this is one of the new phases you should expect when you have this kind of periodic conductances. And you do see it over here, although it's not so easy to see. So the gaseous phase is random, so it's not deterministic like the solid regions, but the fluctuations are very small. It looks almost like all the lines are growing horizontally with small deviations. While in the liquid region, things look more random. More random. And there is a precise quantity of the characterization of these phases. So the first arctic curve is of the boundary that you have between the concentration and the liquid. And now we have, you're showing the third one, the gases. So do you have a curved equation for that? Or part of the do I have an equation for this curve? Yeah, this I do have. Yeah, I mean, this is the actual. I do have yeah, I mean this is the actual like the way I plotted this is I found the curve and I drew it. Uh but it's yeah and you can find it using the same procedure from the previous one like this procedure. So you write down the generating function, you look at what it looks like near 111 and you take predictive to it and you get this uh this complicated curve over here. That's all I wanted to say. That's all I wanted to say. Other questions? I couldn't really see very well the little zigzag region. I don't think you'll be able to blow it up enough to see it. But does that mean that somehow the placement is periodic? Frozen at zero and zero. Frozen at one zero one zero sign path so you can get this thing that's not completely frozen. There are two six hard configurations depending on parity. Yeah. But yeah, you will see one of the two obviously. It's essentially frozen. What you see one of the two depending on parity, but it's always the same one for this. I don't know if it's the same one for this side. In other words, if you look at twisting probabilities, are you seeing zeros and ones, or are you seeing them all half? But it's actually frozen in the system. You don't know which was the one. Yeah, it could be either. I think that's what happens. You can't tell the frozenness. I understand the last part, so you can't say the progenitor from the zero- Well, if you just look at the numbers, let's say you take the nitrate, instead of drawing the sample, you write down the probability of an edge that's going this way. Then, you know, zero, over here it's one, down here it's zero, and then the next part gets one half. And then it's one half. So you just see one half, so you think, oh, maybe there's some other one half. But really, it's one grand coin slip and then it's frozen. Yeah. Because you can't, so that's why I'm saying you can't tell that it's frozen from looking at. Interesting. Yeah, so the topmost one can either go to the left or to the right and then the rest is to the point. Can you say more about how the cube recurrence is coming somehow from a cluster algebra? So I can tell you a little bit. So anytime you have an electrical network, you can create a bipartite graph out of it. So there is this construction called temple east bijection. And when you have a bipartite graph, it has When you have a bipartite graph, it has an underlying cluster algebra which comes from taking the dual graph, like these the same as playback graphs that you already know. Yeah, and so there is a way to embed electrical networks into these bipartite graphs, and those have a cluster infrastructure. And then if you do the y-delta transformation on these electrical networks, it happens to be the same thing as doing a bunch of these POSNICOV moves on the Playboy graph. And so, in that sense, the Y-data transformation is. Sense divided the transmission is a sequence of these mutations. Okay, so it's a sequence of mutations, and when you combine them, you don't have just like a binomial, no, it's a trinomial. Or like, you know, some three monomials. Yeah, it has like three things. Yeah, that's right. But also, there is a change of variables that you need to do. So these cube recurrence variables are not the ones that are undergoing the mutation. So there is a transformation that gives you new variables. gives you new variables. Those, if you mutate those in a specific way, it's the same thing as doing the cube records to these variables. Okay. Thanks. I have a quick question. So like Twasi and you mentioned that you have gas liquid transition and liquid gas liquid transitions or liquid. Okay, uh let me think I was So that looks like it.
