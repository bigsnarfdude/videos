Expect this to happen. We're so used to everything working so smoothly now. So, thanks for giving me this opportunity to talk about some of the work we are doing. Just wanted to thank BERS and the Casa Mathematica OACA for organizing such an informative workshop in such a beautiful setting. And even though I'm one of the organizers, I think as you might have seen this. As I think, as you might have seen, the real credit goes to Mayank and Kumar for organizing this workshop. So, thank you for that. I think my contribution was just to suggest some topics and speakers that might be of interest to people like me in the industry. So, I am Samir Khanna. I lead a small global modeling group within BP. We are part of the Innovation and Engineering Organization of BP. So, you might see the I. So you might see the INE logo at the bottom right. The work that I'm going to talk today about is on alkaline water electrolysis being done by one of my team members, Raj Venuturumili. Raj is currently vacationing in India, and so I'm basically filling in and hopefully I will do a good enough job. So these are actually very exciting times for us to be at BP. Times for us to be at BP. Hopefully, you might have seen some of that through Madhu's talk, and you will see some of that through my talk too. And if I may just plug in, I'm actually looking to fill a few roles right now. There's one open position in our BP offices near London in UK, and there are two positions right now in our India offices in Pune. So, if you're interested, or if you know someone who might be interested, just give me a shout. Please contact me. Please contact me. So, I want to start today's talk by giving a little bit of a business context. You know, why is an oil and gas company looking at water electrolysis? Why are we so excited to be at BP? And then they'll talk a little bit more about the technology of electrolysis itself, why we are modeling it, what approach we are taking, and essentially what we have accomplished so far in this work. So far, in this work that is still in progress. And we are actually collaborating a little bit with Professor Fox and Professor Omar Matar on this. So we have some really good guidance too. So to give you some business context, I just took a few plots from this World Energy Outlook that came out in October of 2021, published by the International Energy Agency. And again, if you've seen these plots, I apologize, but I think these plots. I apologize, but I think these plots are really eye-opening. And especially for younger people who are looking for career opportunities, I think this is really shows you some really great challenges that we face. So on the top left is a plot of our CO2 emissions. So the left half of the graph is what we have done so far up to 2021. And the right half of the graph is the projected CO2 emission. CO2 emission in four different scenarios. The top scenario, blue, is essentially business as usual. So, STEPS is the acronym for stated policies that countries have implemented. And the yellow is the announced pledges scenario, the pledges that the countries have made. So, essentially, blue is business as usual, the policies that are actually implemented or being implemented, and yellow is the Implemented, and yellow is the line if the countries actually walk the talk, and that's what we would get. And in both those scenarios, if you look at the projected global warming scenario on the second plot on the right, both of those scenarios are not satisfactory. So again, the second graph is about the global temperature up to 2021. We have increased by about 1.1, 1.2 degrees. And if business as usual, the step scenario, if we Usual the step scenario: if we continue that way by 2100, by the end of this century, the globe will warm by 2.6 degrees, which is significantly higher than now. And even the announced pledged scenario where if the countries walk the talk, they would still be not sufficient. It will be 2.1 degrees. So, the other two scenarios that have been projected is the SDS, the sustainable development scenario that the UN has proposed. Has proposed, and this is to give a little bit more time for developing countries to go to net zero. So essentially, that scenario gets us to net zero by 2070. And the one that the International Energy Agency is recommending, which is to get to net zero by 2050, and most of the Western companies and countries are also aiming to get to net zero by 2050. And in those two scenarios, that look And in those two scenarios, that look much more promising. So, if you look at the temperature that essentially plateaus around 2050, 2060, and then sort of comes down. The other two scenarios, even after 2100, it keeps sort of going up. So that's the basically the challenge. And if you look at the, this is again a plot from the World Energy Outlook. It just talks about the four big themes that we need to work on to get. To work on to get to that net zero by 2050. And the first theme is essentially the clean electrification. So electricity is about 20% of the energy used today. And we want to get to more than 50% of electricity as energy by 2050. So basically increasing the use of electricity in mobility, which is happening already, and mobility, heating, cooking, and cooling of homes and things like that. Homes and things like that. So, increasing the use of electricity from 20% today to 50% by 2050. And not only that, also cleaning the source of electricity production. So, right today, a lot of the electricity production uses coal, and we need to move that away from coal to more of wind and solar and other technologies. So, the clean electrification is the big theme, and that's already started. That train has already started, I think. The second one is energy efficiency. The second one is energy efficiency. That's everybody has to contribute to using energy more smartly, and that's about building the smart infrastructure, both for housing and for mobility. And everybody change of habits to improve our consumption of energy. So that's basically improving our energy efficiencies. The other theme, the third is cutting the methane emissions. So oil and gas companies, especially, they produce a lot of methane. A lot of that leaks, and some of that is due. And some of that is due to flaring and things like that. And methane is even a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So, cutting that methane emission is one of the very big priorities for a lot of the oil and gas companies right now. And the final one that's the hardest one, and that's where most of the energy innovation still needs to take place, is the heavy industry and heavy transport. So, the heavy industry is the steel and the cement industry. The steel and the cement industry, and the heavy transport, the aviation, the shipping, and the trucking. And that's where electrification is probably not going to cut it. And that's where we need some more innovation to happen in things like hydrogen as a fuel or a more renewable fuel, the sustainable aviation fuel you're making from renewable sources and other synthetic fuels and things like that. So that's where more of the energy innovation. Where more of the energy innovation needs to take place to tackle that last section. And this is the last plot from the World Energy Outlook, and that's just showing the promise, the opportunity that we have. So for different technologies, they have for different, again, scenarios by 2050. If we really do want to get to net zeros, what are the opportunities in solar, onshore, offshore wind, batteries? Batteries is going to be the biggest opportunity and then electrolyzers. Opportunity and then electrolyzers and fuel cells. And essentially, there's this number here at the bottom: the $27 trillion clean energy is projected to be a $27 trillion industry by 2050. I mean, that's according to IEA. So that's where the big opportunity lies and that's where the big opportunities might be. So that brings me to BP. So BP, again, a lot of people know BP as British Petroleum and Oil and Gas Company. British Petroleum and Oil and Gas Company. But believe me, we are making a major transition right now. Two years ago, we got a new CEO, Bernard Looney, and he has pivoted the company completely away from, you know, getting into basically moving away from being an integrated oil company to becoming an integrated energy company by 2030. So that means oil and gas will not be our primary offering. So we will be basically have a very balanced So, we will be basically have a very balanced portfolio of energy offering. Oil and gas will still be a part of it. It will be significantly less than what it is today. But we will have a lot more offering in offshore wind and in hydrogen and EVs, charging, ultra-fast charging networks and things like that. So, basically becoming an integrated energy company by 2030 and then essentially to get to net zero by 2050 or sooner. So, those are the big themes that we are living every day. We are living every day. So, and that's where I think. So, this is that last section that I mentioned: hydrogen. That's one of the areas that we are looking very deeply into. And again, hydrogen is a great fuel, right? It has very high energy, essentially, density. But of course, there are a lot of, and there's abundance of hydrogen, but of course, there are a lot of challenges. So, hydrogen doesn't exist in its natural. Hydrogen doesn't exist in its pure form. There is no reservoir that we can just drill and pump hydrogen out. We need to make hydrogen from either water or from methane. Those are the two base main sources for making hydrogen. And then, of course, there will be a lot of other transportation and storage issues because it's a very light gas and it can leak very easily and it takes a lot of volume. So, need to transport and storage will be a challenge. But those are the technical challenges that need. But those are the technical challenges that need to be overcome. And so, so we are right now just focusing on, or my team is looking at the manufacturing side of hydrogen. And then again, we are looking at green hydrogen. There's gray, blue, and green hydrogen. Again, it depends on what source that you use for making that hydrogen. So, this is essentially green hydrogen using renewable energy to make hydrogen using electrolysis. And then again, And then again, there are four different technologies: alkaline electrolysis, proton exchange membrane, and then solid oxide. Those are the three main ones that we are looking at. And it's again, very well-known process, so it's not something new. But again, from a company like VP's point of view, once we get into hydrogen, we will be making it at a much larger scale. Much larger scale. So, you know, there are electrolyzers commercially available. The issue is, first of all, they're not the size that we will be looking at. We will be looking at scales that will be much bigger than that for making hydrogen at a mass scale. And also the cost of making hydrogen has to be competitive. So basically, our main objectives will be producing hydrogen at scale, at the optimum cost, and understanding. Optimum cost and understanding the reliability of these units and making sure it is still economical for us to produce that. So, from that point of view, that's why we are interested in understanding more fundamentally how an electrolyzer performs, how it operates. And so, it's essentially a multi-scale problem. So, there are things happening at a very nano, a very nano to micro scale right near the electrode. Right near the electrodes, the porous electrodes, that's where the electrochemistry is taking place. The conversion of water into hydrogen is hydrogen, and then the bubble nucleation growth and then release. So that's the very tiny scale phenomena that one needs to understand. And the second one that my team is more focusing on is the middle, the cell and the stack level scale. How does an electrolyzer unit perform? Electrolyzer unit performs. So these are essentially you have cells and you essentially rake up cells together into big stacks for making, you know, for increasing your production capacity. And then finally, you also have to worry about the whole system. So how once you make the hydrogen, you separate it and store it and all that. So there is a system level modeling that also needs to be done. And so these are three different scales. And we are right now. Scales and we are right now focusing just on the middle, just looking at the electrolyzer unit on how it performs. And that in itself is a complex multi-physics problem. So, if you look at the electrolyzer, there are four different physics that we need to take care of. There's electrochemistry right at the electrode surface that we need to understand. There's heat transfer, there's gas-liquid flow, and then it's again, it's essentially turbulent flow, especially at the scales that we will be looking at. We will be looking at. So that's one of the most complex modeling that you can do. But what that more type of model will give you is basically for a given voltage, what kind of hydrogen you can produce. Essentially, you can predict that. Whereas if you want to just do some, we're also doing some very simple models that will just help us design the flow paths a little bit better. We don't need to put all the complexities in, that will be just looking at the flow, the two-phase flow. Looking at the flow, the two-phase flow, and just understanding how that performs. So, those we're taking those two different approaches. Um, and uh, so essentially, if you look at the electrolyzer itself, it's a multi-physics problem. So, this is all this work is being done by Raj, and he has essentially identified all the equations that we need to solve and couple them. So, the challenge here was essentially, even though we are using a commercial software. Though we are using a commercial software, but the challenge was more into coupling these different physics together. So, coupling, especially the electrochemistry along with the gas-liquid flow and the heat transfer part. So, he has done all this coupling. That was work done in-house. And then we have a model now that essentially performs, I mean, can tell you for a given voltage how much hydrogen you would produce for a given design and a given electrode, the catalyst. Uh, electrode, the catalyst. Uh, so we want to do some validation of this work, and uh, we did some literature search. The only data that we could find was from this lab in Spain, the Centro Nacional del Hydrogeno. So, this is a lab in Spain, and Raj actually visited this lab and was very impressed by what they have done. Essentially, they have built a whole hydrogen ecosystem. So, using renewable solar. Using renewable solar and wind power, they are generating hydrogen and then transporting and storing it and then using it to run a fuel cell car around their campus. So it's a very interesting setup that they have and they are doing some really very interesting fundamental work in this space and we are looking to collaborate with them. So this is the work that they have already published and it's a small unit but that was good enough for us to at least But that was good enough for us to at least do some validation. And a 12-stack unit, and these are the parameters for that unit. And then the first thing that we could do was this, just the validation of this polarization curve, essentially, basically for a given voltage, what kind of current density you get on the electrode surface, that's directly proportional to how much hydrogen you're producing. So as you change the voltage, how does that current density change? That current density changes, and this is what the validation was for this particular case. And that was actually very good enough for us. That gives us a little bit more confidence. But again, we want to do some more validation, but this was just the only data so far that we could find. So once we have that model, essentially, then we can look at the flow inside the electrolyzer and see how the different geometry, different designs, different models. Different geometry, different designs, different features of the electrolyzer impact the flow. And so, this is just looking at the electrolyte flow inside the electrolyzer. And then there are some interesting animations that we like to show our management usually on how this we can see how the hydrogen is flowing inside that unit close to the electrode surface and away from the electrode surface. And then, sorry. Then, sorry, and then see how it performs. So, the most important thing here is that we can then essentially see where we are losing that potential, that voltage, the energy that we are supplying to the electrolyzer, right? So, he has basically looked at all the different places where we are losing the energy or where we can optimize the unit further to improve the overall performance. And that's how the model will. That's how the model will eventually be useful. And also to understand what kind of reliability issues we might have by, you know, there are some suggestions on using different kinds of separators, hydrophobic or hydrophilic separators, and how they perform. And also some of the unknowns in our modeling here is also the bubble, the bubble size, what the bubble size is as it's leaving the electrodes. As it's leaving the electrode surfaces, and also looking at the sensitivity of that. So that's what we are using the model to basically understand how, by changing some of the parameters, the overall performance of this electrolyzer changes. There's another thing was looking at the gap between the electrodes and the membrane. So typically there's a wide gap, but if you bring them closer, you get much more. Closer, you get much more essentially the current density for the same voltage that you apply. So, and when you do that, you need to have bipolar plates with different designs. And we're looking at the impact of different bipolar plate designs on the performance of the electrolyzer. So, again, our interest is a lot more application and understanding the unit, how it operates, how we can improve the design, how what kind of Design how what kind of reliability or safety issues we might need to worry about. And that's our main interest. And we're also collaborating with people like Rodney Fox and Omar Mata to help us guide with the right approaches in physics in our modeling. And this is essentially work done by Raj, who is doing, I think, a great job in this area. So that's all I have. Be happy to take some questions. I'd be happy to take some questions. Yeah, really interesting. A question not directly to what you presented, but when hydrogen is being But when hydrogen is being discussed, very often there's a question about storage and the stuff sort of diffusing out of containers and so on. I was wondering if you could say anything about the current state of that. I was saying that transport and storage would be the big challenge. It's such a light molecule. It can be very easily and it can ignite very easily too. So those are the challenges that we are obviously looking at. IMI team is not looking at that, but we have a pretty big team looking at the storage and transport of hydrogen. Storage and transport of hydrogen, yeah, and the most likely because it's also very light, so most likely that for transport, it'll be liquid hydrogen or highly compressed hydrogen. Um, but yeah, that's a big challenge. Thanks. Um, oh yeah, I guess I'm just kind of curious on the computational time and resources for yeah, just you know what type what type of time scales and computing resources do you need for these designs? Yeah, for this, we don't really need that much. I think for what Madhu was presenting earlier, I think that that's where we need a little bit more. And actually, we have our own BP-owned high-performance computer. Own BP-owned high-performance computing center in Houston. It's one of the largest privately owned computing facility and it's mainly used for seismic imaging and reservoir modeling. But I mean, it's a great facility and we are using it for our work. So we have been a little bit fortunate. We are not limited by our hardware capacity right now. So it's usually just understanding all the physics, all the challenges, and putting everything together. That's the Everything together and validating our models because these are all still very complex systems. Thank you, Samir. That was really interesting to look at. I know in terms of going clean and energy, you know, our footprint, engineering footprint on these things will change from reducing the emissions to basically reducing. Reducing the emissions to basically reusing different types of materials, right? And same thing, you know, we used to have nature do the lot of the job for preparing the fuels to us, to now the job would be on us to actually preparing the fuels. So have you taken any kind of like a higher level analysis of these things? Is this trying to, you know, how much of the cost of reducing these emissions for the cleaner environment? Emissions for the cleaner environment actually has in terms of material usage, storage, transportation, the kind of materials you'll be using for such fuels. Is there some number out there that actually explains that the cost of us putting the energy versus nature putting the energy? Yeah, I mean, even just for batteries, all the material that will be used in the batteries, the cobalt, the nickel, and the mining of all that. So, I didn't, yeah, that's again, especially at this. That's again, especially at the scale that we're looking at. But that's where IEA, they look at all these things and they give some guidance, right? And yeah, BP has a sustainability team and strategy team that looks at all these things. And yeah, there are definitely a lot of challenges to be overcome. Oh. All right. So and up the statistics before the conclusion of the workshop and how many hours it is on the schedule. Many power symptoms. It is on the schedule, but let's have a just stop. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. All right. So, again, apologize for the little bit of a delay in the beginning for can you kick me out or
