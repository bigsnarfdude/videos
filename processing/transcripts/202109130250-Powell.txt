Thank you very much, and thank you to the organisers for organising this really nice workshop. So, I'm just going to talk about a small project in applied proof theory, which I did with a PhD student of mine who just finished this summer. So, I think in this meeting, we don't really need an introduction to proof mining as an area because there are so many people from the field in the audience, but just in one slide, this is an area. Just in one slide, this is an area that uses ideas and techniques from proof theory to analyze proofs in mathematics. There are various things that you can get. So, quantitative information is one. So, rates of convergence or rates of asymptotic regularity, where those are not given in the original theorem. You also obtain generalizations of the original theorem. So, you might notice that certain assumptions can be weakened or eliminated completely. Of course, when you look at a proof proof theoretically, you often see generalizations, you often see things that are not necessary. And kind of more generally, looking at things proof-theoretically gives you deeper insights into different theorems from mathematics. And often you can collect theorems that have been presented in many different papers and bring them all together under the same roof, so under the same uniform framework. So the theme of this talk is to give a recent application, which I think it kind of hits each of these three points. But in doing so, I want to give some general insight into how proof money. General insight into how proof mining is done in practice. So, in this talk, I'm going to put a lot of theorems on the slides. It's not important that all the details are understood. What I want to do is I want to point to key characteristics of this theorem and just show how one gets these results from the original proofs in mathematics and sort of how everything comes together. So, the details are not important. What I want to do is simply illustrate how it's done and give some of the It's done and give some of the sort of the key results in this small project. All right, so I'm going to start off with a high-level overview. Then I'm going to focus on a really simple worked example, show how that generalizes to one of the results in the paper that we've written, and then right at the end, just give some other results without any further motivation or proof. And I've got the chat window open as well, so if there are questions during the talk, just interrupt. I'm not sure whether I'm going to exhaust the full hour, so if I'd rather get started. Hour, so if I'd rather get stuck on a slide and answer questions than kind of rush through to the end, all right. So we're going to work in a Banach space in this talk, but I'm going to start off with something familiar. So this is something that we all know, which is the Banach fixed point theorem. Of course, this applies in general metric spaces. You don't need to be in a Banach space. So we call a mapping strongly contractive if the length between t of x and t of y. Hang on, I've got a question. Oh, yeah, I can do that at the end of the talk to post links to the slides. So, my slides are on my website and I can do that afterwards. Right, so we've got the notion of a strongly contracted mapping. And Banach's fixed point theorem simply says that such mappings, they possess a fixed point, and moreover, this simple Picard scheme converges to that fixed point, and moreover, you get a rate of convergence. And the rate of convergence just falls out of the proof. There's nothing deep. Just falls out to the proof. There's nothing deep. Once you prove Banner's fixed point theorem, you essentially have the rate of convergence in the proof. So, the general structure of this theorem is that you've kind of got three things. And this talk is about the interplay of these three different things. So, you've got your space, you've got a mapping, and then you've got an algorithm. And those three together, then you get the convergence to a fixed point. And so, all of the results presented in this talk are going to be going to involve those three components. And those three components are going to change slightly. Components are going to change slightly. And each time they change, each time kind of you generalize one, you have to strengthen another usually to maintain conversions. So this project looked at a particular generalization of the fixed point theorem to a class of mappings which are called psi weakly contractive. All right. So here, instead of having that t of x minus t of y is less than or equal to 1 minus k times the distance of x minus y, we have this function psi. Have this function psi. So, this is typically a non-decreasing function. In many papers, this is also required to be continuous. The stronger properties you see are usually, I believe, needed to establish the existence of a fixed point. So, in this talk, it's just a non-decreasing function, which is positive on positive inputs. And then, in the special case that psi of t is equal to k of t, then you get a strongly contracted mapping. So, this is a generalization of the notion of being a strongly contracted mapping. And there are various papers that look at these and establish. Various papers that look at these and establish convergence and breaks of convergence. So, there's a nice paper from 1997 by Albert and Guerre De La Bri√®re. And it's simply a version of the Banach fixed point theorem for this kind of map. So, we've got a weakly contracted mapping, they prove it possesses a fixed point, and the peakard iterates converge to that fixed point. And we get a rate of convergence as well, but this is slightly more complicated, and you need to, you know, usually these are phrased in terms of integrals and inverse. And inverse functions. But again, it's a nice example where you've got a space, a mapping, and an algorithm, and you get convergence to a fixed point, but also a concrete rate of convergence to that fixed point. So just to show that these aren't kind of weird and wonderful things, the sine is a psi weekly contracted mapping for psi 1 eighth t cubed. All right, so there are lots of nice concrete examples of such mappings. And also, you can take these numerical results from the literature, the rates of convergence. Numerical results from the literature, the rates of convergence, and you can give concrete rates of convergence. So if we just take iterate sign, then we have that for any starting point that xn converges to zero with a very, very concrete rate of convergence. And the results where this is worked out and shown to be an instance of the general rate of convergence is also given in the paper by Alba and Guer de Lebrien. And I've got this is all cited in the references at the end of this talk. Okay, so these are really kind of concrete things. But there are many, many generalized But there are many, many generalizations of this type of mapping. All right. So, a slightly more complex generalization is discussed in a paper by Albert Judume and Zagir. And this is a totally asymptotically psychically contracted mapping. So, this is a bit of a mouthful, this name, but essentially, these are mappings which are psi-weakly contracted in the limit. And there are various ways of making precise what in the limit means. And here's one version. And here's one version. So basically, you see, can people see my mouse, by the way, if I point? Yes, yes. Okay, good. So you see here the definition of a psi-weekly contractive mapping, and then at the end, these two terms basically converge to zero. All right. And there are also generalizations of the convergence results. So here we, this is a paper from this, this is a result from this paper from 2006 by Alba and Chubi and Zagui. So you've got this mapping. This mapping that is asymptotically psi-weekly contractive. And here we look at a Krasnose-elsky-Mann scheme. And here's the usual condition that these coefficients converge to infinity, so they diverge. And as long as the distance between the fixed point and the sequence elements is bounded, then you can show that this Kras-Moselski-Mann scheme converges to the fixed point. But the interesting thing here is that once you get to kind of suitably complex generalizations, rates of convergence and then algorithm. Generalizations, rates of convergence are no longer given. They're quite difficult to formulate. Often they're given in simple cases, but it's much, much rarer to see closed-form expressions of rates of convergence. And I think there are various reasons for that. And the idea of this project was to try to provide rates of convergence in those cases, but also give more general convergence results. And one of the things that one of the features of proof mining is that for looking at things proof theoretically helps. At things proof-theoretically helps understand the structure of assumptions and give you the right kind of quantitative version of those assumptions. So, if you're working in sort of a uniformly smooth manner space, you have a modulus of uniform smoothness. And what you can do is you can plug all these quantitative formulations of your assumptions into your theorem, and then you get a general rate of convergence, which is parameterized by all those the various moduli you get from the assumptions. So, that's what this project was about. And again, it's the same. So that's what this project was about. And again, it's the same pattern: you've got a space, you've got a mapping, you've got an algorithm, and one establishes convergence to a fixed point. And what we're interested in is obtaining rates of convergence. So this was the first objective here was to look at lots of papers and come up with a nice generalization of the notion of being a weakly contracted mapping. So there are many papers that have similar proofs and use the same idea, namely you've either got a mapping whose iterates or maybe you've You've either got a mapping whose iterates, or maybe you even have a sequence of mappings, and in the limit, those are psi-weekly contracted. And then there are further generalizations involving dual spaces that I'll put up on my slides at the end. And so the first thing we did in this paper was come up with a very general notion of being asymptotically psi-weekly contractive. This is a delta epsilon definition where we have an actual modulus. So the this. Have an actual modulus. So, you need for any delta, you need an epsilon. And any psi, sorry, any sigma that gives you that in the relative parameters is a modulus. So basically, we have a general notion of being asymptotically psi-whether contractive and a corresponding modulus. So, that was the first thing was just to read a lot of papers in the field, find a nice definition which encompasses a lot of the concrete versions of kind of asymptotically weakly contracted mappings. Contracted mappings. So, in the one case that I showed you earlier, this notion of ALBA et al. of being quasi-asymptotically psychically contracted mapping, sorry, totally asymptotically psi-weekly contractive. Then, as long as you have rates of convergence for the parameters in this definition of the mapping, then you can show that this is an instance of our slightly more general definition. Okay, so that was the first objective: to define a generalization of being. A generalization of being weakly contracted in the limit, and we show that lots of different definitions that we could find in the literature fall out as a simple case of this. And then the second, and of course, you don't need to look at understand the details of this theorem, I'm just going to point at various things. The second objective was to produce rates of convergence. So general convergence results, which come with a rate. So here we have, and I'm going to, in the second part of this talk, I'm going to motivate this theorem further. So this theorem is going to appear later, but hopefully it'll be a bit more. Later, but hopefully it'll be a bit more comprehensible. But I just wanted to put it here at the beginning of the talk, just so that you see what this project is about. So we have now our new notion of being quasi-asymptotically psy-weekly contractive. We look at the Kresmos-Elsky-Mann iteration, and we can show that with some certain conditions, this Kresmos-Elsky-Mann scheme converges to a fixed point, and moreover, we've given full rates of convergence. Full rates of convergence. And so, this theorem, if one instantiates this theorem with concrete examples of such mappings from the literature, we end up with essentially new rates of convergence. So, rates of convergence which haven't been formulated in the literature before. But also we end up with a much more general convergence results, which can be instantiated in different ways. And then you get different convergence results, which have been found in different papers. Okay, so I'm going to put this result back up on the slide. Result back up on the slides later on in the talk. That's just to indicate what we're doing and what the kind of the culmination of this project was. So how are these results obtained? So first of all, one looks at the logical structure of key properties and assumptions and firstly finds a sensible way of abstracting and generalizing these key properties and assumptions and also giving them a quantitative meaning. The second is to analyze the convergence proofs that one finds in the literature. The convergence proofs that one finds in the literature. Typically, these use non-constructive things, or things that are at least at face value non-constructives, like limits, convergent sub-sequences, that sort of thing. And also, another thing is to just look at the relevant literature, identify common patterns, and come up with definitions and abstract results that are actually useful. So these are things that bring together various different results that have been presented in different places in the literature. Places in the literature. So, I'm going to start now with a very simple worked example. So, this is now back to the simple idea of t being a psi-weekly contracted mapping, which is just a slight generalization of just being a strong contraction. Okay, so the distance between t of x and t of y is less than or equal to x minus y minus psi of x minus y. And if we set psi to be And if we set psi to be psi of t to be k of t, we just get an ordinary strongly contracted mapping. Okay, so the first step, and this idea is certainly not due to us, this is something that is prevalent in the literature, it's a classic technique for establishing fixed points, convergence to a fixed point. So we have a mapping. In this case, it's got a nice property, it's siweekly contractive. We assume now it's got a fixed point. We take this picard iteration scheme. We take this Picard iteration scheme, and the first step is to show that the xn minus q, so the distance between the iterates and the fixed points they satisfy a recursive inequality. Okay, and typically it's not too difficult to show that these recursive inequalities hold. So, in this very, very simple case, we simply take the definition of the iteration scheme, q is a fixed point, and then we use the property of the mapping. We use the property of the mapping, in this case being psy weakly contractive, and we get this recursive inequality out of it. All right, so the first step is to reduce the problem to a recursive inequality. But then what we have is that we essentially we're out of the setting of Banach spaces, we're out of the setting of whatever mapping we're using, and we're in a very simple setting of sequences of real numbers which satisfy a recursive inequality. And if we can show that any such sequence of real numbers which satisfies that recursive inequality converges to zero, then we've established. Converges to zero, then we've established convergence of the iteration scheme to a fixed point. So all of the proofs that are discussed in this talk have this structure, namely, first of all, one reduces the problem to a recursive inequality and then throws away all of the setting, whatever space you're in, whatever mapping you're talking about, and just focuses on recursive inequalities on sequences of real numbers. So, in this case, and I'm going to label this sort of as a lemma B. So, this is the sort of Of as a lemma b. So, this is the sort of the pattern. So, we've got a theorem which I'm labeling A, and a lemma which I'm labeling B. And then I'm going to show how this A and B pattern manifests itself in a much more complex scenario later on. Okay, so this lemma is just a lemma about sequences of real numbers. Okay, so we have this, we've taken this concrete scenario here, and we've just reduced it to a very simple case of real numbers. So, any sequence of real numbers. So, any sequence of real numbers which satisfies this recursive inequality converges to zero, and moreover, we can show it has a concrete rate of convergence. All right. And I'm just going to show you how we prove that just to give you kind of a flavor of the kind of proofs that we have here. So let's suppose for contradiction that this sequence doesn't converge to zero, so there's some epsilon such that the There's some epsilon such that the sequence of reals is greater than epsilon for all n. What we do is we simply rearrange the recursive inequality. We convert this into an integral and we get this inequality because one divided by psi of t is non-increasing. So again, the steps of this proof are not important. I just want to give you a kind of a flavor of the proofs that we have. All right. So we simply take this recursive inequality, we rearrange it. And then we show that for any natural number n, this is bounded by some integral which is independent of the n. So we've used this one line here that this integral here between mu n and mu n plus one is greater than or equal to one. And then we reiterate this and we show that any natural number n must be bounded by a fixed thing which is independent. thing which is independent of n. So clearly we get a contradiction and we can give a concrete n for which this inequality is false. And from that we can give a concrete bound because our original assumption was that the mu n are always greater than epsilon. So then we can find a concrete bound at which we get a mu n less than or equal to epsilon. And because in this case we have a decreasing sequence, we can turn this into a rate of convergence. Okay, so all I've Okay, so all I've done is put this proof up just to show how essentially how elementary this is. And this is the combinatorial part of these convergence proofs. It's just something about real numbers that is often quite elementary. Okay. So what we can do now is we can add these two components together. So we had theorem A, which is just that we have this mapping and an iteration. A mapping and an iteration method, and we're working in some space. We show that the distance between the iterates and the fixed point satisfies a given recursive inequality. Then we show that any such sequence of reals that satisfies a given, that that kind of recursive inequality converges to zero. And then we put them together, and this is completely trivial to get a convergence theorem. Okay, so in this case, we have a sine-weekly contracted mapping, a fixed point, we take the Picard iterates, and we can. We take the P card iterates and we can prove that the X and these iterates converge to the fixed point. And through analyzing the recursive inequality, so the proof that any such recursive inequality converges, we get a rate of convergence, which also then applies to the concrete setting of the iterates towards a fixed point of a psi-weekly contracted mapping. Okay, so this is a perfectly satisfactory convergence theorem. Convergence theorem. And what we've done is we provide what is essentially a proof theorist, what I'm going to call a proof theorist rate of convergence. So we take the definition of the epsilon delta definition of convergence, and we just produce a function. So how to find the delta in the epsilon. All right. But analysts often formulate rates of convergence as bounding functions, which obviously converge to zero. And often in the literature, when convergence is established, then the rate of convergence is given in this. Then the rate of convergence is given in this form when it's given. And so it's often important that, you know, if we're carrying out this kind of analysis from a crucial theoretic point of view, we want to at least compare that what we've done matches up in a reasonable way to what's been known in the literature to check that we're on the right track and to show then that the new rates of convergence look like reasonable generalizations. So there should be a good correspondence in simple cases where rates of convergence are known with what we would get from our general framework. Would get from our general framework. And to do that, we want to convert these proof-theoretic rates of convergence, which are just sort of functions which come out of the normal epsilon delta definition of convergence to bounding functions that you get in the literature. And so in this case, it's reasonably simple. All right, so we take the rate of convergence we have, and what we want to do is somehow invert that. So we want to find an epsilon n such that the xn minus q is less than or equal to the epsilon n. And basically, Or equal to the epsilon n, and basically what you do is you just invert the rate of convergence. So in this case, you look at the integral and you get this relationship here. So any epsilon which satisfies this line here would work. All right. And then if we rearrange this, this is where we get our inverse function. All right. So this is a simple rearrangement of the proof-theoretic rate of convergence you get when you try to give a proof-theoretic analysis of these simple recursive inequalities. For recursive inequalities. And then once you've done that, you get an alternative formulation of the convergence results: namely, that you've taken the p-vad iterates, it converges to the fixed point, and now the rate of convergence is given by the bounding function here, rather than a proof theorist rate of convergence. And if we compare this to what's in the literature, it's exactly what you get. Okay, so what I've not said here is what I presented on the slides. What I presented on the slides is kind of a careful proof-theoretic reformulation of ideas that are very much present in the original paper. So, in here, there's absolutely no surprise that what you get by adding together these things is exactly what turns out in the literature. But the key to this project was to generalize this approach to cases where no rate of convergence has been given. And then, what we end up with is a concrete rate of convergence, which is essentially new for a much more general. Essentially, new for a much more general formulation of the convergence theorems. All right, so that's the very, very simple case. And essentially, what we're doing in this project is what we have done has been to generalize this to a much broader setting. And this results in new convergence results. Okay, I'm just checking. I don't know what to open for. Good. All right, so here on this side, I'm just summarizing what I've said already. This general route to a convergence results, the idea, and as I said, this is not our idea, this is something that is throughout the non-linear analysis literature. It's a very successful method for establishing convergence. There's lots and lots and lots of versions of this. You reduce everything to a recursive inequality and then show that these recursive inequalities, so any sequence of real numbers that satisfies such recursive inequalities, they converge to zero. What we do is we give a quantitative version of those. Version of those recursive inequalities where we give a rate of convergence. And if we want to compare what we get to the bounds in the literature, then we convert this proof-theoretic rate into a bounding function. And the nice thing here is that steps two and three, so those which involve the recursive inequality, can be done in a very general setting. And we're only talking about real numbers. It's very elementary. So in order to instantiate this and kind of In order to instantiate this and kind of give concrete convergence results to kind of theorems in the literature, when you're working in a specific setting with a banner space and a particular kind of mapping, then you can just all you need to do is adapt set one. Okay, so that's another key feature of this work is that by looking at many, many different kinds of proofs which all reduce to a similar recursive inequality, by giving a general quantitative analysis of such recursive inequality, Of such recursive inequalities. All we have to do to give concrete instances is to adapt the first step where everything reduces to the recursive inequality. So, this gives us not just rates of convergence, but a uniform framework within which the various different rates of convergence can be understood as kind of coming from the same basic idea. So, it's also an organizational framework for understanding different results in the literature. All right, so now I want to just give a slide. Give a slightly more general version of the simple worked example I gave. Because in this simple worked example, we're not producing new rates of convergence or anything like that. They just match up with known results in the literature. So again, this is not something that needs to be understood in great detail. I'm just giving you a sense of what we're doing. So now what I'm doing is instead of this side weekly contractive, this GNOME definition, I'm taking the abstract definition that we formulated. The abstract definition that we formulated as part of the project. Okay, and so in particular, we no longer talk about concrete mappings t and the iterates of those mappings, but rather we just talk about an abstract, like an arbitrary sequence of mappings A of n. You know, in some cases, you could define the A of N to be the nth iterate of a specific mapping T, but you don't need to. And actually, there are results in the literature that do formulate convergence results in terms of general sequences of mappings as well. So we catch those within this framework too. And we apply And we apply the same kind of idea. So, this is theorem A. So, this is just a generalization of the theorem A before. And this theorem A was all about reducing the convergence property to a simple recursive inequality on real numbers. Okay, so we take this general, what we call a quasi-asymptotically si-weak contracted mapping. We now look at the Krasno-Selsky-Mann scheme, and we can show that, given some assumptions. Given some assumptions, the distance between the iterates and the fixed point satisfies a recursive inequality. And this is a slightly more complicated recursive inequality because now we have the alpha n's which come from the Crescent-Sells-K-Mann scheme, and we also have this delta. So, this is basically because we're looking at families of mapping, so sequences of mapping, which are sine-weakly contractive in the limit, so asymptotic classes of mappings, then we also have. Asymptotic classes of mappings, then we also have a corresponding asymptotic formulation of the inequality. All right. And just to show that even for a very general class of mappings, establishing this recursive inequality is pretty simple. Okay, so it's just a matter of rearranging the definition of the algorithm, in this case, the Krasosevsky-Mann scheme, by the triangle inequality, by the property of A of the mapping, and you end up with the recursive inequality. So the steps aren't important, it's just to show you that here there are. Aren't important, it's just to show you that here there are just four steps, it's very, very simple. Um, and this is one of the first main results in our paper, which was to look at this particular kind of recursive inequality. It's more complicated than the one before. It's now got an asymptotic flavor, and we give a rate of convergence. So, we show that any sequence of real numbers that satisfies this recursive inequality, first of all, converges to zero. Quality, first of all, converges to zero, but also you can get a concrete-made convergence. And this kind of result is not new in proof mining. There are many other papers where the problem has also been reduced to a kind of an abstract recursive inequality, and either a rate of convergence is given where that's possible, or there are examples where rates of metastability have been given. So, this idea of giving a quantitative version of a recursive inequality is certainly not new. But in this paper, we look at a new kind of recursive inequality. Paper: We look at a new kind of recursive inequality that hasn't been explored before in proof mining. Um, and you know, the proofs in the literature tend to be quite complex. And so it took a little bit of thought to work out kind of how to formulate this proof so that you get a concrete rate of convergence in the end. But everything works out nicely, and the rate of convergence is what you'd expect compared to previous proof-thetic analysis of similar recursive inequalities. And here we've formulated. And here we've formulated everything in terms of this integral. You can do it more generally without needing the integral, but we've kept the integral formulation just because we wanted to compare the rates of convergence with known rates of convergence in the literature. Okay, and then what you can do is you can add these two things together. So you can add the reduction of the main convergence property to the recursive inequality with the numerical analysis of the recursive inequality. Add them together. There's nothing deeper than that. Add them together, there's nothing deeper than that, and you end up with a convergence result with a rate of convergence. So, this is a theorem from our paper. It's not particularly deep, it's simply that we've taken our abstract generalization of what it means to be asymptotically psi-weekly contractive. We've carried out an analysis of the proof that any sequence of real numbers which satisfies the relevant recursive inequality converges, and you get a rate of convergence from that. Okay, so here we have the proof. Um, so here we have the proof theoretic rate of convergence. And of course, what we want to do is ah, sorry, I forgot to mention that I said that this definition is a generalization of many concrete asymptotic schemes in the literature. So instantiating in particular this notion of a totally asymptotically si-weekly contracted mapping, which was explored in 2006 by Alva Chudime and Sagui. We get a rate of convergence for that known convergence result. So the difference between the general convergence theorem we gave above and this corollary here is that we're giving a very concrete rate of convergence for a known convergence theorem where rates of convergence were not given in the literature. Okay. So that's all this result is here. We've simply taken the sequence AN of mappings, this general sequence, we've replaced it. Mappings, this general sequence, we've replaced it with the quasi-totally asymptotically psy-weekly mapping that is studied in this paper, plugged in all the parameters, and we end up with a concrete rate of convergence. But there's nothing deeper than that in this result once we have our general convergence result. It's really just a case of plugging in the parameters. And there are many instances of this where we can just simply by plugging in the parameters, you end up with a rate of convergence. In cases where the rate of convergence has been given in the literature, the bounds. In the literature, the bounds match up very nicely, and in cases where they're not given, we've formulated them. Okay, and then the final thing we want to do is the rate conversion. And actually, doing the rate conversion here was not entirely trivial. Unless we've missed something obvious, this took a bit of thought. So, here's an example of, well, here is the abstract result we gave earlier, but now we have, instead of giving a proof theorist rate of convergence, Instead of giving a proof theorists rate of convergence, we give a rate of convergence as a bounding function. So it involves another inverse. But kind of formulating this in a way where concrete cases matched up well with the bounding functions given in the literature was reasonably subtle. It was like a two-page proof. And I'm sure there might be a simpler way of doing it, but it wasn't entirely trivial. And for details of this rate conversion, everything is in the paper. Everything is in the paper, which I'll put up at the end. Okay, so in a nutshell, that's what we've been doing in this project. We've been taking a formulating a sufficiently general notion of a class of mapping so that many different instances of this in the literature can be caught. Looking carefully at the structure of the proofs, not just each individual proof, but the structure that unifies these proofs, which in this case is essentially the reduction to a sequence, the reduction to a recursive. A sequence the reduction to a recursive inequality carried out an analysis of that recursive inequality to get a rate of convergence, and then you can plug that back in and get rates of convergence in lots of concrete cases. And then we've also done a conversion into a kind of an analyst rate of convergence where we have a bounding function. So we can facilitate a direct comparison with the rates of convergence obtained using proof-theoretic methods and the rates of convergence that have been given in the literature. And as I said, in cases, And as I said, in cases where rates of convergence are given, there's a really good match. It's not perfect, but there's a good enough match that it seems like what we're doing is generalizing kind of it's a reasonable generalization and the proof-theoretic analysis is not bringing us too obtract. So those are the main results. And I think I'm running ahead of time, which is good. So, summary of further results. So, the general result I gave here. Here is that was quite simple. Once we'd formed, arrived at the like a good, reasonable, abstract definition of what it meant to be asymptotically side-weekly contractive and given a quantitative analysis of the recursive inequality, it was fairly simple to add everything together and get a general convergence result. But in the paper, this is just one of several case studies. And in the other case studies, we give examples of convergence results. Examples of convergence results, which are, I mean, again, they're generalizations of several known results in the literature, but here this route to the recursive inequality was much more subtle. And also, the various assumptions that we needed to analyze were also non-trivial. And so the rates of convergence that we ended up with also contained various moduli that came from either properties of the underlying space or from kind of quantitative formulations of notions that didn't have an obvious content. Notions that didn't have an obvious quantitative formulation. So, I'm just going to, I'm not going to go into any details in this talk, but I'm just going to give a summary of those additional results. So, one sort of separate case study was the study of so-called de weakly contracted mappings. And here we work in uniformly smooth manner spaces. And so, in particular, we make use of the so-called modulus of uniform smoothness to formulate the convergence results. Convergence results. So there are various kind of generalizations of being psi-weekly contractive, which are now formulated using the normalized duality mapping. We gave a similar epsilon delta formulation of this, which generalized de-weekly contracted mappings, families of de-weekly contracted mappings that have been found in the literature. And then we construct a rate of convergence for this general class of mappings. This general class of mappings, which then takes the uniform of smoothness for the space as a parameter. And again, in simple cases, we end up with concrete rates of convergence for theorems that have been given already. So one paper there is by Judumi et al. in 2002, where I think this is where de-weekly contracted mappings were introduced. And then another result we looked at was perturbed schemes. So here we take the kind of a Crasnosel scheme-Mann scheme. Kind of a Krasnosel scheme-manned scheme, which is kind of slightly perturbed. So instead of working in a single kind of convex set, we work in the iterates lie in sets EN, which then kind of converge in the Hausdorff metric to a single convex subset E. And this was quite interesting. We needed to take various quantitative ideas from being a sunny, so part So, part of this, this only this was quite a complicated result. So, in order to establish convergence of this scheme, we needed to work in a uniformly smooth space. We needed to assume that these projection mappings were suddenly non-expansive. And also, one also needs that the sets EN converge to a single set using the Hausdorff metric. So, in order to give a quantitative analysis of this kind of result, Quantitative analysis of this kind of results. We first of all needed to use a formalization of the household distance, and this was something that appears in a recent paper by myself and Ulrich. We also needed to look at kind of certain properties that the sunny non-expansive retractions have and give quantitative formulations of those. And then the result was quite an involved quantitative, abstract quantitative convergence proof, which again, in a concrete case, matched up with. In a concrete case, matched up with a result of Albert et al. in 2003. Okay, so in the main body of this talk, the example I gave is still relatively simple. And in this paper, we've given several much more involved generalizations of convergence results and also rates of convergence, which then involve all sorts of moduli which come from carefully analysing each of the different assumptions required in these groups. Okay. Okay, so here's a summary of the talk. So, again, I said at the start, this is all about taking three ingredients: namely a space, a sequence of mappings, an algorithm, bringing those all together, and showing that in this case, you get convergence to a fixed point. And we looked at various different variations of these ingredients. Okay, so we started off with just a simple norm space. Just a simple norm space. And we looked at our starting point was just psi-weekly contracted mappings. Then we looked at asymptotic variants of that and came up with a generalization. So underneath the dotted line, these are the generalizations. So we have an abstract generalization of what it means to be asymptotically side-beakly contractive. And here we look at the Krasnoselsky-Mann scheme. Then we went to uniformly smooth spaces. And these are just the cases I sketched right at the end. And here we give a general notion of what it needs to be quasi-asymptotic. General notion of what it means to be quasi-asymptotically de-weekly contractive mapping. And then in the final example, we looked at perturbed Pratosowski-Mann schemes as well. So we have many different results, and all of them look at kind of like slight variations of these three basic ingredients where the space, the mapping, and the algorithm change. Maybe one of them strengthens, another one needs to be weakened. In each case, we get a rate of convergence. And moreover, in all cases, we use the same kind of reduction to a recursive inequality. And in particular, what this means is that What this means is that the quantitative analysis of the recursive inequality just needs to be done once, and it can be then applied in each of these different scenarios. And so, it's also a nice way of bringing together these different results and showing that the rates of convergence come in a quite uniform way. So, just future work, I mean, as I said, this abstract because of inequality, so reducing a problem to an abstract because of inequality, this is not something that's new here. That's new here. This is a well-known method from non-linear analysis, and it's also something that's been analyzed quantitatively in proof mining in several places. So, in a paper that I wrote with Ulrich last year, we looked at a slightly different recursive inequality, but that's just an example. There are many, many more. For some of them, you get rates of convergence, for other ones, you only get rates of metastability. But I think it would be really nice to have a general quantitative study just of the different recursive inequalities. So, bringing together known results, in particular, talking about why you get In particular, talking about why you get only metastability in some cases and why you get convergence in other cases. I'm also establishing some new convergence results for recursive inequality, so new rates of convergence. And it'd be really nice to have a repository of quantitative lemmas of this kind, which could then be applied in concrete situations. So I think that's a really nice idea for a future project: is simply to explore the literature, look at all the different kind of recursive inequalities that are used to establish convergence and kind of in one place. Kind of in one place, provide a quantitative analysis of each of those so that this could then be used for lots of new things as well. And that's all I wanted to say. So I think I'm running about 10 minutes ahead of time, but I doubt anyone's going to complain about that. So yeah, thank you.
