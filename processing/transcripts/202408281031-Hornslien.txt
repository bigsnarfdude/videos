Today we're going to talk about homotopy classes with endomorphisms of the projective line, which is joint work with Victor Valdemart, Jaren Gweig, and Glenn Wilson. And the thing with computing homotopy classes of endomorphism of the projected line is that it's essentially the same as trying to compute the fundamental of the circle, but in the motivic world instead. And that turns out is surprisingly difficult. Surprisingly difficult. So we saw in Murray's talk that if I took pi zero of like the sphere spectrum, simpletonic sphere spectrum, I got this growth indicate of like this field here. But that's quite advanced. That's quite a lot of technology. And it turns out, like, the set we want to look at, if we really want to study it. All it pointed here and just maps from P1 to P1. And it's a theorem due to Morrel that shows that this thing is Grodenik Ved, but not just Grodenik Ved. It's somehow twisted by some. By some units. So, like in topology, where we have unstable phenomena with like certain maps with mean spheres, it seems that, well, typically this happens right away. For maps from P1 to P1, for some reason there's problems here, unstable phenomena that we don't necessarily like. And even worse, that where else computational That Morel's computation of this is very difficult. Like, it uses a lot of high-technology stuff. Like, you really need to know motivic homotopy theory to compute this. And it's kind of silly that computing the fundamental group requires you to set up so much technology just to do this. So, our goal today is, I guess, I guess the cover or else the soul with as little typical theory as possible. So, this is like units mod squares. No, I got that, but what does it mean? What does it cross over? It's a fiber pullback square. So, you have the automatic form, you take the discriminant. Ah, it's by the discriminant. Yeah, okay. So, this is what we want to do. So, the first big problem is. First, big problem is pointed maps between these two guys inside here is surprisingly difficult. Like Mura said, this motivic localization really makes things very difficult. So you could be very naive and just create this other notion of homotopy, which we'll just call naive homotopy, which is just a map from P1 across A1 to itself. This is some kind of map. And I can evaluate it at time 0, where this t is my A1 parameter here, which gives me some F. Let's say I evaluate it at time 1, I get some G, and I'll just say that, oh, this is some kind of equivalence relation. So this construction here is called negative homotopy. Naive homotopy. And in general, naive homotopy is not the correct thing to do, which is also why it's just called naive. So we'll call this set here, T1, T1, naive. This is now some set if I take the transitive closure of this equivalence relation that I just imposed. And What is this guy? Well, there's a guy called Kasunau who proved that this thing here actually has a monoid structure. I'll call it monoid bit of k, something like this, which is just generated by quadratic forms. Generated by quadratic forms. You could think of like this growth thing if it's somehow created by quadratic forms and then taking a group competition. This is just before taking the root completion. He showed that this thing, the set of maps, had a monoid structure, and there was a map here that went all the way over that was group completion. So just because it's nice, we'll just take a look at how Casanova's addition works. So say I have a map from P1 to P1, which is just I send X0, X1 to X0, U, X1, where U is some unit. This is some map. Some map. Kazanov represented this thing as some pointed rational function, x over 1, where essentially you want the resultant of the numerator and denominator to be the one, as some condition, to ensure that they don't disappear at the same time. What happened with the U? Oh, sorry. Good. X over U. And if I want to add. And if I want to add x over u with x over v, I can complete them to this to a matrix like this, minus 1 over v. And complete SL2 matrices with these two pointed rational functions. And the resultant being a unit somehow, this other condition that you imposed in this. You impose on these functions lets you complete them to Sultan matrices. And then I can just multiply these matrices. And in this case, it gives me x squared minus v over u, right? And divided by ux, and then some stuff over here. But I only really care about the first coordinate here, or the first column. Last column? How you're supposed to? So you just want a relation that creates one. You just want to determine one? Yeah, determinant one. Finish an SL2 matrix. We do this sum. And in this case, we have X, P R U, U, X. Is that structured just composition of the endomorphisms? No, it's something else. It's something else. It's whatever this thing is. That's the mono structure. Composition somehow gives you some multiplication-like thing. Oh, right, you want to be able to add. Yes. So I'm adding two morphisms. That's what Kausana was doing. I'm adding these guys. Produce a new morphism. In this case, like, if I want to translate it to that notation, it would be x0, x1, apps to x0. comes to x0 squared minus b over u x1 squared u x0 x1. Okay. So Koznov created this nice monoid. But it's only a monoid, it's not everything, right? We wanted Morel's full group. And this is somehow only half of it. Uh always geometrically what this composition means, like when you do it like topology, you have like some no, I don't have any good I mean but this shows up in in K-theory, it's like it's like uh what do you call it in K1? It's a condition one or something, right? And it would roll two by two. It's a symbol. It's a two by it's a top two term. Will you extend it to something in SL2 when you have a just by the yeah, this is essentially what's going on, I think. And we'll see more SL2 stuff later. It's coming soon. And I I think Jake meant like stably from having P1 be a suspect. Having P1 via suspension. Yeah, that's true. It is the co-group structure that comes from P1 being a suspension. That's like the big thing. Casanova essentially showed that this group cohesion thing, so it's as close as it can be to be the correct thing. Say what this MWK was as a monoid, but it's so it's like we have a lot of things. So it's like we saw that I can send take this quadratic form and now I just take the mod I generated by those. Oh, inside of G2. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay, so I'm going to move this. I'll just put it over here just so we remember I got this over here. Okay, so the problem was also now somehow only got half of the things. There's not enough maps in this set, like honest geemorphisms from P1 to P1 to get all the holotouch classes. So there is a VM theorem by Michael Coyard then theorem slash definition Okay, so a motivic space Y is A1 naive One naive if we have a bijection of sets if or any affine x, we have a bijection like this, where I take x mapping into y. I have the true homotopy classes. This is like automorphisms, pointed maps. Pointed maps in the motilic homotopy category. And then naive this other notion that we just introduced. And examples of spaces like this is P1, SL2, also P and P. Also, P infinity like PGF. Those are some examples. I thought you just said that it's not true for P1. No, but P1 isn't afline. Oh, it's not Appline. Right. Oh, okay. Um so the trick now is we P one is an affine, but how can you fix that? Um how does it bear with like the finished? No, but the theorem is the example of the space. But Pn is not... You know, P1 and P infinity, but the intermediate P's? Little unsure. Yeah, yeah, it should be. It should be. Also pass my hand to me. Also, pass my name. Yeah. So, okay. P1 is an outline, however, remotes is. Here I'm just creating some ring x plus w minus 1, xw minus yz. I should have really put it over here, but I write it over there afterwards because this is going to be our. Because this is going to be our main guide throughout the talk. And I'll just define j to be the spec of this thing. And it turns out that this guy I just wrote here is a bundle over P1 where all the fibers are all trivial fiber and just times an A1. So it's really A trivial bundle in the motivic homotopy category over P1. Which means this guy here is in the motivic homotopy category homotopic to P1. Can you write what you just said previously about the something F5 over P1? Yeah, okay, J bundle over P1 E1 with fibers with trivial fiber fiber yeah fiber A1 trivial A1 so for example if I take like inside P1 I take like dx0 where dx0 where the first coordinate is non-zero and then I have a map from going from j down to p1 which i'll actually gonna move over here and um so i'm just gonna write down this ring r once more because it's gonna be s plus w minus 1 s w minus y z and we have a map pi And we have a map pi, I hope you can see, that goes from j to p1, which essentially maps to xy or z w. Whichever is non-zero. I mean, this spec r is just p1 cross p1, the usual embedding in p3, and then you look at the affine open x plus w. Yeah, there are several. Yeah, there are several. So, like, but if I do like the pullback of this guy, I just get an A2, which is. Yeah, you can do that for anything. So if we now put our J into this machine real here is we wanted to study P1 P1A1 which is the same as as sets J P1 yeah. Yeah, I'll just use the same A1 here. And then since P1 has this A1 naive property, and J now is affine, this set is the same as J mapping to P1, naive. So which means we only need to care about actual schemorphisms from J to P1, modulo or something. So that's what we're going to do now. Yeah, that's the Yeah, that's the whole point, right? To somehow escape the motivic stuff and see how far can you get. It's worth mentioning that Kazanal's result that I mentioned earlier doesn't it's just pure geometry and quadratic form the there's no no motivic stuff going on except for when he needs this when he proves the group completion. When it proves a group completion, then so now we'll look at maps from J to P1, which means now we're just doing asphalt regime, the data is a line bundle. Letter J and two se and two sections S0 S1 generating L. So it turns out that the Picard group is another A1 invariant. Another A1 invariant thing. So this thing, this Picard group is really the same as Picard group of P1, which is just the integers. Now we're going to define some bundles. Well, I upper star of one is going to be a certain R module in this case, right? Since we're just going to have line bundles on an app, I think. Just going to have line bundles on an applied thing, which just corresponds to understanding some modules, rank1 modules over our ring. So I'll define P1, P, normodule, X, Z, Y. So those are just like two vectors. And it's, I guess, worth noting that we have. worth noting that we have relations between these two that if I take y times xz this is the same as y x y z and if we look at our description of the ring yz is the same as xw so this is y x x w which is the same as x times y w so you have relations like So you have relations like this between the generators. So I have this map pi that goes from J to P1. And then I just pull back my line module. And then you're following up P1, and then what's the next thing? This is an R module? Generated by these guys. It's break one because of this relation. Yes. Of this relation. Yes. And then just kind of ask a big question about the answer we're trying to get to. Should there be an where is like the integer corresponding to degree of fixed degree or it's the rank of the quadratic form. It's the rank of the quadratic form. So now we have this bundle here and we can just tensor it up with itself to get Pn. Pn, which is the same kind of thing, xn, zn, and then xn minus 1, y, zn minus 1, w and all the way to yn, w, n. But you can actually show that this thing is just generated by two elements as well, xn. Dominance as well. X n, Z n, Y and W n. Sorry, things are colliding here, but you can show this essentially by using that 1 is equals to x times w. No, x plus w. So you can take, like if I have this x, y, z, w, x plus w, and then essentially And then essentially the W can move things one direction and another direction. So this thing is the same as I write it down or do I have to do it? Yeah. So this is the same as y times x squared, z squared. Z squared plus z times y squared, you'll need squared. So you can kind of use this to move, to express all these generators in the middle as some linear combinations of the other ones. And okay, so we have now we have all the, I guess, positive ones. We're gonna need some negative ones as well. Some negative runs as well. Just going to define Qn to be a module generated by Xn, Yn. So now I've essentially just switched places. Switched Y and Z. And this guy here is going to be I'm just talking. Oh, y and Z. And you can show that say I take Q1 and tensor it with P1, then I just get R. Okay, so now we have the line bundles. We move on to our maps. Start with degree zero because that's the easiest. Degree zero because that's the easiest. So that just means two elements of R that generate R. So that's, I just wanted, I want AB in R such that the ideal AB is just the whole rank. That's what I want. This is a map. So So some examples one comma zero xw, I can just take x plus w, I get one. And slightly more complicated one, x minus w, 2y. This one is a little bit harder to see, but This one is a little bit harder to see, but you can show that x minus w squared plus 4yz is 1, which is the relation you need. Those are some examples. Okay, now we want degree larger than zero. So what does an element of Pm look like? Element of Pm look like? Well, S0 is just AI. These are just going to be some elements in R. And S0 is going to be A0 times XNZN plus A1 YNWN. And similar for S1, these are all XNZ. B0 x and z plus b y n wn and now I just want some linear combination of these guys that generates the whole module. So degree zero corresponds to maps coming from the degree zero line bundle. So the two sections log. Yeah. Yeah, that's A and B. So it's just two sections of all that's. Yes, that's what this is. And then what's the bracket? An ideal. Oh, just, okay, they gener. They generate an ideal that generates the whole ring. Oh, that's interesting. So this is... So now I essentially want up to home into here or something, or we're not. No, just on this algebra. They just have to generate the whole thing. They just have to generate the whole thing. The naive homotopy aspect. Okay, let's take an example of a naive homotopy in this case, which means then I need two elements in R joint T such that they generate R joint T. Yes? So an example is just going to be 1, T Y. Just a very simple example, which shows that Which shows that 1,0 is homotopic to 1 comma y. So moving back to these guys, I take some sections. I just want them to generate the whole module. Fair enough. I'm going to introduce some notation where I'll be writing a0, a1, colon, b0, b1, a1. B1N for these pairs of sections, isomorphism. Sorry. Why is it A, B, and R T? I mean, sections of the trivial one and below are just too small. Yeah, but this is if I want a homotopy. Yeah. So a map from J cross A. Sorry. Yeah. No worries. Yeah, so we're gonna introduce this. Introduce this notation for the pair s0, s1, just to have less to write. And you can, so you just want s0 and s1 to generate your whole module, but you can turn this into like really algebraic conditions. So in this case, I'm just going to write it down just because it looks funny. A1 w at V0 Xn plus V0 V1 WN at this thing. It really translates, this condition that these two sections generate is equivalent to that this ideal generating the whole. Now you're taking maps instead of things. Yeah, this is an example of a map. For a homotopy, I'm just adjoining T and asking the same question. So we also need some examples. If I just write 1, 0, 0, 1, n, this is literally the same as just picking these two generators. These two generators. That's in this notation, which means they should generate other examples: x, 0, 0, w, n, this guy. Do you want to generate R or do you want to generate P? No, in this case, you can translate these two sections generating the module Pn to this algebraic condition where it's just you want this. It's just you want this ideal to be the whole range. And I'd say it's easier to, if you're going to be working with a computer, it's easier to use this condition. These are some example of morphisms. And once again, an example of a multiple P is this, which gives one zero power one y. 0 or 1y 0 1 and I guess I'll not get to this guy up here. Okay, so we have all our all our maps. Oh, I forgot to say, what do we do with degree, I guess, less than zero? Less than zero, then it's the same story as here. You just switch, swap y and z. So and in this case we'll use the notation eight zero, a one, b zero, b one, and then minus n. And then minus that. Okay. Okay, so we have our maps. Now we want to find a group. Did you, maybe I've just, did you actually classify this set of maps up to homotropy equivalence? Not yet. Not yet. That's on this list of what we're going to do. So you just impose this relation, and that's how you make things equivalent. Right. You're going to tell us sort of what the potentially how to classify them or what the set of them is. That's the set right there. That's the set right there. It turns out it's in general very difficult to somehow determine. Turn down representatives from equivalence classes. Yeah, that's, or that we'll get to. But in general, if you give me two morphisms and ask me, are they homotopy equivalent? That's going to be difficult in general. Even though it's you know this kind of computer check of sunsets or yeah, because the computer check only verifies that whatever you wrote down is a morphism. That, whatever you wrote down is a morphism. So, if I would have to feed a homotopy into the computer and ask it, is this a proper homotopy? Is this a valid thing? And then the computer would say yes or no. But if I give it two maps, it doesn't say, oh, these guys are in the same class. So we'll start with degree zero once again, because that's Once again, because that's that's where it's at. How this chart was about work. Okay, degree zero. So this data that A and B generate of the whole ring is really equivalent to this ideal AB being the whole ring is equivalent to there. It's equivalent to there existing u and b in R such that AU plus BB is 1. So I'll just chuck my guys into a matrix like this and now this is a SL2 R matrix and But sometimes you have several choices of u and v that can satisfy this relation. Luckily, they're all homotopy equivalent. So if I have u prime, v prime such that this is true, you can show, or it's literally just compute, that a b minus t times b plus 1. e plus 1 minus t v prime minus or t times u plus 1 minus t u prime at this thing SL2 R joint T matrix. So it doesn't which shows that it doesn't matter how you complete the thing. Many cons. Yeah, I guess. Or if you want to explain it with If you want to explain it with multivic, is kind of this data right here is the same as specifying a map J to A2 with L0. This data here is the same as specifying a map J to SL2. And these guys here are actually A1 on the topic in the motivic category. So just like J was a bunch. So just like J was a bundle living over P1, SO2 is a bundle living over A2 without zero. Or all the fibers are triggered. Yeah, so you have this. And now we can just, this is our group structure in degree zero. So you just take group structure SL2. SL2 multiplication. That's nice and easy. So, how now the problem is, what do we do for the higher degree maps? And now we're going to fix that. William, just to double-check this, this same argument shows that the Double check this same argument shows that this multiplication is well defined, just optimal comments. Yeah, you have to, yeah, this completion argument shows that, yeah, multiplication is well defined, optimalism. Okay, so how are we going to do it for the degree n maps? Like if you give me two maps of degree n, how do I add these guys? That's the next question. That's the next question. And the solution is: we're not going to figure it out. We're going to do something else to fix it. So the group part is supposed to correspond to composition morphisms. Bend it morphisms. No, it's not composition. It's like, because P1 is a sphere. So you can think of it as you can add homotopy classes together by doing this like, oh, sorry, that's what we do. Yeah. Yeah. So it turns if you if you do composition, then you get some kind of multiplication structure on this GW thing. But that messed us around with these units, so don't want to do this. The problem is you can't see this pinching directly algebraically. Yeah, right. Okay, so there I guess this is a theorem of a This is a theorem, but there exists an action by degree zero maps on degree n maps. And how do I do this? I take my matrix AB minus VU and recall that I And recall that I just take two sections that I just do this multiplication. I get this pair A S 0 minus V S1 V S 0 plus U S 1 and it turns out if S0 and S1 already generated and And AV UV is an SL2 matrix, then this thing is still going to be a pair of generating sections of your one. Or of the module, sorry. Or generating sections of the control, but generating elements of the module. So an example is if I do, I'm just going to write it. I'm just going to write AB because it doesn't matter how we complete the matrix, as we just saw. Just saw. And if I do this, for example, AB acts on 100 end, this is just going to be A minus V B U in degree at. Cool. So we have some action. I guess the next thing is a theorem. So let F be a map from J to P1 all its degree. Not equal to zero and then there exists M and SL2R such that M acting on one of the two. On 1, 0, 0, 1, and so which means I can pick any morphism and I can essentially decompose it into some piece that I pick in this page. I pick this guy and some matrix. And this thing you can really turn into an algorithm. You can write a computer program that does this for you, which is cool. Uh and it also shows that for Fg this is corollary Fg degree N, then there exists a matrix M such that M plus F is equal to G. So We're needing to define a group structure. And that's equals or homotopy? So this is actually equals. Actually equals. But there's a small caveat that the thing that comes out from this thing, this M here, I was talking about pointed things all the time, but I'm just, it's But I'm just, it's not the main focus right now. But this M is not necessarily pointed, but you can find some other matrix that is pointed such that this thing is true on homotopy. It means, yeah, that's why I've been dodging it the whole time. But. Well, then you didn't tell us what it was, so we can ignore it. Yeah, we can just ignore it. It doesn't matter at this stage. Your original formulation of the problem is supposed to correspond to a base point, if you want to go into a base point. Yeah, so you pick a base point of HJ that you want to map to H everything. So now, how do we do? How can we use the splitting somehow to give us a group structure? First. First, we have this map j that maps to p1 and it turns out you can show that this like the class of pi really represents in this realtor nickbit weird guy over here really is the class bracket one but unit one. You can show this. You can show this. Yeah. Okay, so we identify this class. Then we can actually, it turns out you can use for n larger than 0, you can use Kazanov's techniques to actually identify what a representative for this map. It for this map for n times pi. So, what you really do is you find some representative for pi, and you find representatives or for any n tuple of pi. And we do the projection corresponds to the identity max, what you're saying. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. But there is one. Yeah. But there is one problem here. Okay, so we've understand the positive degrees. If you ask me, what's this class? Or can you find a representative of this? This is a problem. We don't actually know how to, we have some very good candidates for what this should be, but we can't actually show, find a map that, and like prove that there is, or the represent the representative exists, but we can't. Exists, but we can't prove which map it is. But it's just a mono, and why would you have a minus? No, this is so the whole point that we're using the genre device is that we get enough maps to represent all the homotopy classes. Oh, okay. So, this map exists inside our set. We just don't know how to find it. So, one very Very, this is like the biggest candidate, but regardless, you take some representative for this thing, which means for any map f, I can write it as some m plus n times pi. I can do this. Or actually, just delete this. I can decompose it into pieces like this. And like, if I take a mount G, well, this is confusing, but let's turn this into an M and this into an N, so it's more consistent. And I can just show that F plus G. that f plus g should just be m times n plus n plus n times this thing. And this gives us a group structure. So now we have a group structure. That's great. We have ten minutes. That's great. And another weird thing is that this And another weird thing is that this group that we created on the degree zero maps is actually commutative. But if you give me two maps and tell me, can you make them commute, I can't do it. It's like writing down an explicit homotopy that does it is just impossible. But it is, you can, through like some abstract nonsense, show that it has to be computative. But you just can't write that one. And right, that explicit holidays to do much more. Yeah. As a quick question, not to get too pointed and unpointed, but you said you can turn this theorem into an algorithm to find this M where you have literal equality. Can you also turn it into an algorithm to find the pointed M equipped with the naive homotopy? Yeah. It's literally just like a one step. You just need like one, a very simple homotopy to fix it. It's just quote. Okay, so. Okay, so now we've just created some group structure and through it's just saying you have a commutator in SL2, you want to write the elementary matrices. No, that's the weird thing is that is since we're in size two, there can be like homotopy trivial matrices. Be like homotopy trivial matrices that are not products of elementary matrices. Make sense? Sure. And they just make things very difficult. That's why you get something. Yeah. Okay, so we have a group structure. Great. That was the main goal, right? And you can show that. And you can show that this group is in fact isomorphic to this one. Just the problem is you can't write down the isomorphism. The problem, of course. But now in the last eight minutes or so, all so in this naive world, is there a general definition of what the root structure should be? Just So it's not that this definition is increasing. I don't know. Well, this is, yeah, you can show that this is the group structure you want. You just don't know that it's... You don't... You can't show the isomorphism explicitly. Like if you give me a map, I I can't tell you which element in here it is unless it's under some very special circumstances. Over some very special circumstances. But sorry, we are saying if you take two matrices, M and N, then take Mn and M No, so I'm saying Mn is homotopic to Nm. Through a naive homotopy. So there exists some. Oh, I see. This goes. Oh, I see. This is an A1 family of matrices, which are one thing you're at MN and the other one is MN. I see. Okay, great. Yeah, but it's like some page. I'm not saying it's a product of elementary matrices. Writing down one might have one time. Yeah. Great. But writing a down list is basically impossible. So now. Can you say which elements it puts it? It will not correspond. Yeah, so this is. Yeah, so this is the next part. We can write now some very explicit guys. I'm just going to call them GUV: X plus V, U minus V, Y. And in short, these guys, you can actually write down what class they correspond to. These guys are, I guess. I guess classes u minus v u divided by v. These guys, you can actually show explicit which classes are. And I guess so in the last minutes, I guess there is a map which we'll call pi over. Which we'll call pi upper star n, which goes from like this monoid cosmop the fine to the monoid we just, delta the group we just created. Or this plus is this group instruction or group thing I just wrote down. Thing I just wrote down. So there's a map like this, and we have a theorem that says i n star is like a completion. No, that's not exactly correct. Not exactly correct. So I take these GUDs and I GU as subgroup generated by GU V where U and V are units. Okay, so I can take this subgroup here and then I can yeah this we're we're this guy is a subgroup of you could say uh J to A2L0N which is the same as degree Which is the same as degree zero maps. Okay? This is some subgroup in here and generated just explicitly by these guys. And now we'll just write g is g and we add the generator pi. Pi, I don't know a good way to write this, but it's generated by GUV and our map phi as a group. Then this map here to G is a group function. Yeah, this is pi n proper star. Pi n upper star, and the theorem is that this thing is a group completion. But g is really a subset of j and this is kind of weird, but like for in the conjecture conjecture uh the map I is equivalence. It's equivalence. I is just this inclusion of G into this full set. Our conjecture is that this thing is actually an equivalence of set, and it's true for finite fields. That's what we know really about. Yeah. So you yeah, you show that there is a group relation, but it's kind of weird that it only maps into some concrete subgroup that you can somehow control, which is then by definition isomorphic to the full thing, but it's also a subset, and it could be a proper subset of the full thing. Let's see. And that's the conjecture. But it's at least true for finite fields, just because then this group is finite and this group is finite, and you can do some smart things. But otherwise, But otherwise, in general, you can't really say questions. And I'll stop there. Thank you very much for your time. Any questions? This general, like this method of replace a projected variety, it's fifty one by something alpha, and then you One by something alpha and then use the node. This is something that works in higher generality, like it's every question. It's every whatever positive projective variety equivalent to an app at all. Yeah. Can you see that like degree maps correspond to better forms of rank? Yeah, that's what they do. Yeah. But now But now, using this thing, right, since we actually know the class of these guys, and we can use Kazanov found a way to go from his set of maps to, like, he found this isomorphism for his set of maps. Combining that, we can create like a map, say, that represents the class, like 1 minus 1 minus u, where u is some good. Minus u, where u is some unit. And this is a map you wouldn't be able to represent anymore before, but now you can. As I understand classically, is like if you f over g degree n and you look at the coefficients, it's a big outline space, and take two points up there corresponding to endomorphisms. You want to explicitly find a path that avoids the results of the endomorphism. That's incredibly hard. Purpose. That's incredibly hard. So, is your result, I guess, as I understand it, you have these distinguished points 1001. And if you take their SL2R orbits in this output space, you get like the distinguish point in every chamber. And then if I have one chamber, you've got algorithms for getting to that distinguished point. Is that right? Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yes. If I understood your question correctly. That's true. You just go to the distinguish points and then you go to the other one. And that's not for explicitly constructing any points. For explicitly constructing any homotopy between any two frames of our homotopy. Granted, you, but you need to write down the homotopies in the first place. More questions? Yep. Ten minutes here, right now. Thank you. Kurt has another question. Kyrto's explanation of Kurto. I know where he's sat, and he's about to ask a question. I'm about to ask a question, but there is a choice. So, notwithstanding the comparisons to the rest of everything, how many of your... Do these constructions work over a basis, not a field? I think we you need field to have control over many of the items. Have control over many of the ideal tricks you do with some of the ideals. Just to keep control of the algebra that you're using. But I haven't thought too much where it breaks down if I were to knock forward over a field. But like characteristic does not matter, for example, for constructing this group operation. Yeah, and let's so unlike the other days, well, first of all, we have an afternoon schedule, which is new, if you haven't noticed already, but we're starting at one, so the previous times, the afternoon talks, have started two, so I think it's still plenty of time for lunch. So I think there's still plenty of time for lunch, but just take a second look at the schedule. Let's do it begun by file. Yeah, that makes this done earlier, makes gaps a little bit easier. So we're starting to have two points a little bit old. Portfolios. Well, yeah, I mean, just you know, getting. I like the naive approach. That's nice. I can actually understand. It's actually just going further into
