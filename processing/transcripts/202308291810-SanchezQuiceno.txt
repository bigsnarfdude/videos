Yes, let me introduce you. Yes, okay. Yes, we can see the screen. Okay, now our next speaker is Elder Leandro Sanchez Quinceno from the University of Sao Paulo in SÃ£o Carlos. And he's going to talk about a strong partial non-degeneracy of mixed functions. Okay, first of all, I would like to thank the organization. All I would like to thank the organizer by the opportunity to present my work. Today I will talk about another general C condition of mixed functions. This is a joint work with Benjamin Bot. The results that I will talk today appear in this preprint in archive. And this work was supported by This work was supported by FAFESP Brazil. Okay. Before to start, to give the main results, I would like to fix some notations in preliminaries. We consider real polynomial maps from R4 to R2. We also consider the set, the variety of F, this is the zero set of F, and we also consider the singular set that is defined. That is defined as using the Jacobian real map matrix. For these types of real maps, we consider two types of isolatedness of the singularity. On the figure, in the left hand of the figure, I show the weakly isolated singularity, and the right hand, I show the isolated singularity. I showed the isolated singularity. For these two types of isolated singularities, we have a well-defined link of the singularity. That is the manifold that is the intersection between the variety with small spheres, three spheres. In order to distinguish the two types of links associated to weakly isolated singularity and isolated singularity, And isolating singularity, we call the wiki algebraic and real algebraic respectively, right? And the main goal of our results is in order to study the characterization of this link, right? For the case of weakly algebraic links, we have the characterization. We know that all links on the tri-sphere is weakly algebraic. three sphere is weakly algebraic. This is a result by Akubuli King, but recently also Benjamin Bolt proved provide a different construction of this result that proved this result, right? And the characterization for the real algebraic case is still open. This problem is called the Benedictine Schotta conjecture. They say that this say that all five That this says that all fiber link is real algebraic. Why fiber link? Because they work by Milner, right? It proves that real algebraic links are fiber link, right? Well, in the new results around the conjecture, we noticed that there are a close relation between the conjecture in the study of mixed polynomial, right? This is the reason that why we study mixed polynomials. Why we study mixed polynomials. Before to introduce mixed polynomials and so on, I would like to say that the story of mixed polynomials is quite recently, right? We can see the relation with singularity theory from work of Acampo Lirudos that he presented some examples that. Some examples that related with the theory, the singularity theory, but was within the words of Siade, Rua, Lewowski, Siade, Pichot, Cisneros, Oka, that these polynomials was studied systematically. And then many other results appear from the results that this mathematician, right? Okay, mixed polynomials are Mixed polynomials are complex polynomials, and for our case, we study mixed polynomials with this variable, two variables, it's just a complex polynomial in holomorphic variables and their conjugates, right? And we use a multi-index notation, right? Nu and mu. We can see that the sets of The sets of mixed polynomials are the same that the set of polynomial maps. But why do we study mixed polynomials? This is the question, why? And I can say that we can define a kind of homogeneity of these mixed polynomials in terms of mixed monomials, right? That is called Rayal degree. Okay, the Raya degree is defined as this. Defined as this equation one, and we use our the degrees and the variables and their conjugates, and we sum them, and we use a sum, weighted sum, right? And we define a radial weighted homogeneous polynomial are this polynomial that has a radial degree constant for some p, degree pin, right? And okay. And okay, this is a derival weight homogeneous that we can define on the set of each polynomial. But and what happened when the general case when we can admit node radially with homogeneous polynomials? And for these cases, we can use the neutron polyhedron for these polynomials using this radial degree. And for that, we use a support. We use a support as using the sum of the multi-index of the mixed monomer. And with this deep support, we can define the Newton polyhedra and then we can define the elements that is related with the Newton polyhedra. As a Newton boundary, we can say when the mixed polynomial is convenient, and we can also define the phase functions that. That's as an Mirna Mirna talk, she say about the initial forms of the Newton polyhedra or the zone, right? And the phase function, the Newton boundary is the union of the compound phases of the Newton polyhedra. And for this Newton boundary, we can define the phase function that we can. Define the phase function that we can relate with a positive wave vector. Okay, the way as we associate this phase function, that does not matter for now. This is just a data detail that you can find. And this phase function is radially weighted homogeneous, right? This is the important theme of that. And they define it as a And they is defined as the restriction of F of this phase that is related to Q. Okay? The second thing that is important, the second thing that made this study singularity important is that we can define the singular set of the miss polynomial in terms of. mixed polynomial in terms of other mixed functions and we can prove as a lemma in this lemma that the singular set of f is the seroset of these three mixed functions that is one f s2f s3f and in the particular case when f does not depend on u bar and the conjugate the conjugate of the first variable we call this family We call this family U-semilomorphic. And in this case, the singular set is defined for two equations that is defined in this FU, is the partial derivative with respect to U, and F3F. And if we can also ask for F to be V is a molomorphic, then the polynomial is. The polynomial is allomorphic, then we recover the characterization, the singular set of allomorphic polynomial, right? This is a kind of generalization of the holomorphic case. And now I will talk about the knowledge generation of the mixed case. Okay, I would like to compare the progress of knowledge and erasure from mixed policy. Generacy from mixed polynomials and compared with noise generation of holomorphic polynomials or complex analytic polynomials. And on the green table, we can see that holomorphic polynomials, neutral polyhedra, the noise generacy introduced by Koshnirenko, and then we can find inner noise generasi introduced by Wov and partial noise generation introduced by Mondo. And the mixed polynomial. In the mixed polynomial case, we can see the mixed Newton polyhedron defining as before, the strong noise generality defined by OCA in 2010, and the recently noise analysis that we introduced. The inner noise general and the partial noise general that I am talking about, right? Then strong enough. Then the strong innovative strongly neutral partial in our generation is defined in this way. You consider a wave vector P, then you take the equation that defines the singular set of F, right? S1, S2, S3. Then you take the phase function of each mixed polynomial and you form the system given by this. The system given by these phase functions. Then the noise generation condition is asked that this system of phase functions does not have solution. The condition I is quite technically, but is similar in some sense, right? But the idea behind of this knowledge generalis is to consider the equations that define the singular set. Okay? And then this is the definition. Okay, and then this is the definition. The question here is okay, the main goal is to study the conjecture of the neti shot that say that you can find a real polynomial map with isolated singularity that realize the links, fibrillate links. Okay, then something important is study the condition of this thing isolated singularity. And we know. And we know that node generation are helpful to provide conditions to give a isolated singularity or weakly isolated singularity. And the question here is if a strong partial general is a necessary and sufficient condition to get isolated singularity. In this diagram, we can see that a strong partial noise general is sufficient condition to guarantee isolated singularity. Guarantee isolated singularity, but we can see on the diagram that there are examples that provide that strong partitional degeneracy is not a necessary condition. Okay, but the idea of this talk is to show how this fail and how we can fix that. I mean, we can put extra conditions in such a way that for this set of niche polynomials, strong partiality. Strong partial generation is necessary in sufficient conditions to be a desolated singularity. Then, this for that, we can explore this decomposition, just a technical thing, but it's not so difficult. We can take a mixed polynomial f, right, and we fix a weight, weight, weight vector. weight vector, positive weight vector, PI. And then we define this Fi, okay? This just to associate F, Pi, right? And we use I because if we put Pi in this way, it looks like a phase function, but it's not a phase function, right? And this Fi is defined in this way, right? When Right when where ki is the quotient of pi one pi two r is the model of the second variable in t is the argument of the second variable right here we can have an example if f is radially weighted homogeneous homogeneous of radial type pi the pi then f i is just the i part of f p i right I part of FPI, right? It just coincides. And we notice that Fi does not depend on R, right? F i does not depend on R on the radial equation within the scale. And Fi is a function from C times S1. And we can see that we can decompose Fi as a one sum that is the phase function. That is the phase function, the i part of the phase function plus high-order terms on r, right? This is very important for our result, okay? The i-power of a mid-polynomial f can be decomposite as the i-power of the pay-to-fusion plus high-order terms in r. And we can see that when r is equal to zero, this the behavior of f i is equal to the Behavior of Fi is equal to the behavior of the Iparus effect function. I will return for this condition later. And okay, now this is the main result on the semolomorphic case. We consider assemblomorphic polynomials. Okay, this is more easy to explain on semi-omorphic case, but this result also has the analogy to general case. To general case. We consider f as a monomorphic polynomial, and then we can see that the strong partial generator is simplified by this considering the following thing. The singular set of F for the decimal model case is given by FU S3F, right? The zero set of this system, right? And then instance we consider S1F, S2F, S3F, and the S2F, S3F, and the system given by the phase function, we consider the system given by the phase function of this system here, Fu S3F, right? This simplifies the strong partial generas for the symbol of multiplication. Then here I will introduce the condition that make strong partial generas a necessary condition. The first condition says that the missed polynomial F u, that is the This polynomial f u, that is the partial derivative with respect to u of f, is inner generated. This is a condition that belongs allow us to parametricize the zero set of f u. We can ignore a little bit this, but it's just to parametricize the zero set of u in such in some way. And then the second condition follows in the say in this follow. Say in this following way. We take the roots of Fu and then we evaluate in the second equation in the SGF. This gives us certain curves on earth, like in the figure, in the right hand, right? And the second condition says that we can avoid the points. The points like T1, right? That is a certain tangential intersection with the horizontal vertex that represents the X, the axis, right? Then S2 say that if there exists a local extreme, minimum or maximum, they happen outside of this zero. This zero, okay. This is different to zero. Then the result says if F satisfies these two conditions, F has an isolated singularity if only if is strongly partial node generating. This says that strongly partial node generating condition is a necessary condition. Okay, here I will pass through this general case quickly. For the general case, we have to modify We have to modify the two first conditions by using the three equations that define the singular set, because in the general case, we don't have the simplification. But we have to add some three conditions that involve the partial derivatives of the phase function of the partial derivative. And then when these three, if f satisfy these three conditions, then the strongly partial derivative. Then the strongly passionate general C transforms in a necessary condition. Okay. Okay. As a colorary of these results, we have conditions in order to guarantee a no-isolated singularity. I mean, it's quite, it's a color. We obtain condition on the mute in. the new in the new term boundary point of view that below us that allow us to guarantee no isolated singularity okay i will explain a little bit here this is the corollary uh but on on the ousemolomorphic case that is quite simple to explain uh okay again we consider the singular set of f that is the solution Of F, that is the solution of this system that I will refer as an original system. And then we consider PI and we take the phase system, right? The system given by the phase function of the original system, right? And as I say, we consider the decomposition of the I part of S3F, right? That is the composing in some part that is given by the I. Is given by the I part of the phase function plus a high-order term on R. When R is equal to zero, we obtain the behavior of the phase system. And as I showed before, we get something like this. Okay? And the behavior of the original The behavior of the original system is given by consider R small enough, right? It's quite a perturbation of R. And we can see that point like TI, T1, we can see that after a perturbation of R are small enough, we have two, not two options, but we can. Not two options, but we can have these two options. On the left side that I show here, we see that the parabola go down and this generalized give two new singular points or solution of the original system that represent singular points. But also, can be happen that the parabola. Happen that the parabola goes up, and then there are no singular points of the original system or solution of the original system. Then, when appear some minimals, some maximals, we don't know what happened with the original system, okay? But if appear some point like T2 that is not a minimal extreme, then we can see that after two mega. That after to make a perturbation of R, the intersection between the quirks and the horizontal axis remains. That means that a solution of the phase system also appears as a solution as the original system, right? A perturbation, right? Then we can guarantee. We can guarantee that if this condition happens, that means if T2 appears of the phase system, then F has no isolated singularity. This is the application of the, I mean, the colorario or result. And just to conclude the idea, in the preprint, we In the preprint, we give conditions as that isolative singularity equivalent to strong personality generasis. We can see on this diagram how is the relation between the different strong knowledge generas conditions. And we see that the missed polynomial that are strong partial knowledge generas is a proper set of isolated singularities or mispolynomial isolated singularities. Listen up when these relative similarities. And the main message of our paper or result is that we have a better understanding of mixed polynomials when it's on the singularities. From the point of view of Newton boundaries of the system that defines the singular set. And in particular, we have a better picture of the week. Picture of the weak and strong isolators of the singularity of this polynomial. We have fit various, and we have a better picture of that. And that's all. Thanks, Gracias, and Obrigado. Thank you.
