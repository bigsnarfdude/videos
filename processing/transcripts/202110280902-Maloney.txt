So I'm going to be talking a bit about some work on trying to understand averaged ADS-CFT dualities. Most of what I'll be talking about today is contained in this triplet of papers up at the top. But of course, there's been a lot of other very interesting work on this area over the last several years. I'm just including a few of the references here to other interesting works, but of course, this dot Other interesting works, but of course, this dot dot dot represents many interesting and important papers, some of which were written by people who I think are in the audience today. I'll begin with a little bit of an overview. This is a relatively short talk, but then again, I have no particular agenda of things I want to get to. So I encourage everyone to stop and interrupt me and ask questions if the mood strikes you, or if there's anything I say. Strikes you, or if there's anything I say that would be good to elaborate on. So I'd like to start with a puzzle that I think was first articulated most clearly by Moldo Sena and Maus about 15 years ago, which is that we usually think of the ADS-CFT correspondence as an exact equivalence between two different quantum theories, one of which is quantum gravity and ADS, the other of which is a conformal field theory. Is a conformal field theory. And when we think of this as an exact equivalence, we really mean an exact equivalence. That is to say, the Hilbert space, ADS gravity is quantum theory with a Hilbert space and a Hamiltonian. And that Hilbert space and Hamiltonian is supposed to exactly match that of some corresponding boundary CFD. But of course, as Modocena and Mao's pointed out, this way of thinking about ADS CFD is in tension with the Is intention with the existence of Euclidean wormholes, which are connected geometries that have two disconnected boundaries. So here I've sketched a cartoon of a prototypical Euclidean wormhole that connects two disconnected boundaries. And the contribution of such wormholes to the path integral of a gravitational theory would seem to lead to non-factorization. That is to say, Factorization. That is to say, the partition function of a gravity theory in the presence of two boundaries does not factorize into the product of one boundary partition functions. And of course, this is in contrast with the way that we usually think about ADS CFT, which is supposed to be an exact equivalence between a gravity partition function and a CFT partition function. And of course, CFT partitions, almost by definition, will factorize. By definition, they will factorize when you consider them on a union of two disconnected geometries. So there are several potential resolutions to this puzzle. I think at the time that the Maldesena-Mao's paper was written, probably the two potential resolutions that people most cared about were, first of all, the possibility that there's some reason that we don't understand. Some reason that we don't understand that wormholes just don't contribute. You know, maybe we're not understanding the correct contour of the space of integration through the path of metrics or the path of geometries in a theory of quantum gravity. The correct choice of contour maybe would just not include any wormhole contributions whatsoever. Or a different potential resolution is that wormholes do contribute to the path integral, but there are other sorts of contributions, things that we don't really quite. Contributions, things that we don't really quite understand, which will exactly cancel these out. But I think over the last several years, a different picture has emerged where one takes seriously the contribution of these Euclidean wormholes, and you interpret them by relaxing somewhat slightly your definition of the ADS-CFT correspondence, where we interpret ADS-CFT as not a duality. As not a duality between a theory of gravity and a conformal field theory, but rather a duality between a theory of gravity and a family of conformal field theories, or more precisely, a duality between a theory of gravity and a probability distribution on the space of conformal field theories. Alex, I feel like you've neglected an option, which is sort of in some sense the best option here, which is that there are other contributions which are of the same. Contributions which are of the same order of magnitude, but it's not that they cancel, it's just that for some observables, the other contributions are of the same order of the wormhole, so you shouldn't trust results from the wormhole. And in some computations, they're smaller, and so you should trust the wormhole. But it's not that it's canceled, it's just sometimes it's you know, sometimes it's dominant, and sometimes it's not dominant. Okay, I don't think I ignored that possibility. I think that was the subtext of what I said. Was the subtext of what I said. So that's different than canceled, right? I mean, because when you say canceled, canceled sounds like they should never be important, right? But they can be important, but be consistent with factorization, right? Well, if they're consistent with factorizations, then there are other contributions that are just as important. That I agree with. Okay. Isn't that what the word canceled means? Because you have a contribution that leads to a non-factory. Have a contribution that leads to a non-factorization. No, because another contribution that leads that restores factorization. No, because there are calculations like in the page curve where they are the dominant contribution. I mean, there they're not canceled, right? So like in n equals four, I think the wormhole does give the right calculation of the page curve, even though n equals four is the theory that factorizes, right? I mean, that's why I don't like the phrasing here. Okay. I don't think we're disagreeing about anything. If you don't like the If you don't like the way that I'm using the word canceled, I mean, I'm thinking strictly in the context of Euclidean partition functions, not in terms of a page curve, which is why I think it's okay to use the word canceled. I think there are more, let's put it this way, I'm not going to disagree with you. I think I would love to argue, but I think there are more interesting arguments that we can have later on in the talk than just an argument about what I think is mostly semantics. Okay. Okay. So. Okay, so in any case, what I was really trying to get to is what I think is a different interpretation of the existence of these wormholes, which is as a probability distribution on the space of CFTs, so that the ADS gravity partition function, the gravity of ADS, of asymptotically ADS gravity, is not a CFT partition function, but an average over many CFT partition functions with some. CFT partition functions with some probability distribution on the space of conformal field theories. And then in this interpretation, a Euclidean wormhole is computing some statistic of this probability distribution. So for example, you could compute, say, some two-boundary gravitational partition function, subtract off the square of the one-boundary step. Off the square of the one boundary stuff, then you would be left with a sum over Euclidean wormholes. And these Euclidean wormholes are computing the variance of your probability distribution for this observable, namely for the partition function on this surface. So indeed, in this interpretation, the existence of Euclidean wormhole is just a statement that the variance of this probability distribution, the variance of this observable, is not equal to zero. Uh, is not equal to zero so that the probability distribution is non-trivial. Hey, Alex, quick question: Do you imagine summing over all CFTs at a fixed value of the central charge or with some width over all CFTs? I have not yet been specific. In principle, I would imagine summing over all conformal field theories. In practice, you know, the probability distribution would be determined by what theory of gravity we have. In ADS3, the Brown-Hano calculation would tell us that. Calculation would tell us that it would seem that we should fix, if we fix the cosmological constant of our ADS theory of gravity, we would fix the central charge of the corresponding family of CFTs. But that actually might be a little too simple, and you could certainly imagine more complicated things. You could let it fluctuate at least a little bit without violating. For example, I think that one plausible interpretation is that the cosmological constant could be a chemical potential conjugate to the central charge. Chemical potential conjugate to the central charge instead of the central charge exactly. I think that's something that's perfectly plausible. Thanks. Good. Okay, so then this naturally leads to a question of when should gravity be an ensemble average as opposed to a particular conformal field theory? And I think the picture that has emerged is that the theories of gravity that are probabilistic, that are represented by a probability of the graph. That are represented by a probability distribution are quote-unquote simple theories. That is to say, theories where we can compute a path integral, often exactly, but they're simple enough theories that they don't correctly describe the exact microphysics, for example, of black holes. So they wouldn't necessarily have a discrete spectrum, but they are simple enough that we can compute things exactly. And these are to be contrasted with what I like to think of as fancy theories. With what I like to think of as fancy theories of gravity, like string theory. These are theories where you get an exact set of black hole microstates with quantized spectrums, but they're too complicated for us to exactly compute things like gravitational partition functions exactly. And so if this picture is correct, then that really leads to a set of questions. And these are the questions I want to try and address today, which is how Today, which is how close can we get to exact microphysics, such as exact microscopic structures of the spectrum of black holes in one of these quote-unquote simple theories that has a probabilistic description rather than an exact description. And moreover, what happens to the wormholes as you change the probability distribution on the space of CFTs? So, if it is the case that wormholes don't contribute, don't Don't contribute in some way or are canceled out in exact UV complete theories of gravity, where the probability distribution is just a delta function, then that means that somehow the wormholes must disappear as we move around in the space of probability distributions. So I'd like to try and understand exactly how these things can happen. And the model that I'd like to talk about for most of my About for most of my time today, where we're going to try and understand this is a model that we described last year, as well as many other people, which has come to be known as U1 gravity. So this is a theory that was developed in a paper I wrote with Edward Witten, and also in a very nice paper by Nimav Kamigeti, Henry Cohn, Tom Hartman, and Amir Tajdini that came out at the same time. Same time. And I think of this model essentially as a toy model for an exact holographic duality. And it's a simple theory of gravity in the sense that it's described by an ensemble of CFTs averaged over some moduli space with a probability distribution. In particular, the set of CFTs that we think about are theories of n-free bosons. So these are 2D CFTs. So these are 2D CFTs with central charge equal to an integer n. And there's a finite dimensional space of such CFTs with dimension equal to n squared. And I've written down the moduli space of such CFTs here. This is the Narain moduli space of conformal field theories. And the one thing that I want you to note about this moduli space is that it's a homogeneous. Moduli space is that it's a homogeneous space, right? Because it's a coset. So that means that there is a unique metric on this space of CFTs that is invariant under the symmetries of this space. And so there's a unique volume element. That is to say, there's a unique probability distribution that one can define on the space of CFTs that's invariant under this symmetries of the moduli space of conformal field theories. And moreover, And moreover, the volume of the space of theories with respect to that measure is finite. So that means we can think of it as defining an honest probability distribution on the space of conformal field theories. And the remarkable mathematical fact is that you can compute averages over this space of CFDs, and you can compute averages of an arbitrary observable. And that's summarized. And that's summarized by this very exciting formula that I wrote here. The most exciting thing about this formula is that I figured out how to put handwritten diagrams in the middle of a tech formula, which is pretty cool. I can explain that if anyone has any questions at the end. But the way that we should think about this formula is that I'm computing some partition function of a theory of free bosons on some surface. I'm averaging it. I'm averaging it over the space of conformal field theories. So I'm averaging it with this probability distribution. And that's represented as a sum over saddle points. So in particular, the saddle points are represented by handlebodies. So they're ways of filling in that Riemann surface. Okay, so some solid, so I'm trying to indicate it here, some solid surface whose boundary is your Riemann surface. Boundary is your Riemann surface. You sum overall ways of filling it in. You weight it by an appropriate classical action plus one loop correction. And then you have an equality, right? This is an exact equal sign, right? No approximation or anything like this. So this is some sort of toy model of holography with two very special features that I don't expect to be true in more general fancy theories of gravity. General fancy theories of gravity. The first feature is that the bulk theory is one loop exact. So I only included a classical and a one-loop piece. And the second is that the saddle points that appear are relatively simple. They're what are known as handle bodies. They're an infinite number of them, but it's not such a bad infinity that you can't get a handle on it. And that's really what I'm going to talk about today. So what would we like to go ahead and What would we like to go ahead and compute in this theory? Well, the simplest thing that you could compute is the density of states. So let's talk about computing the average density of states in this ensemble. So the density of states is packaged into the torus partition function. And if I wanted to compute the average torus partition function, it would be a sum over geometries of the type that I have written here, where my geometries are going to be sum over. Where my geometries are going to be some solid donuts, okay, where one of the cycles in the boundary is contractible. So there are an infinite number of such solid donuts. The way that you think of them is really quite simple. You think about your boundary torus as having a spatial cycle, which is the usual angular cycle of ADS, of a CFT on a cylinder. CFT on a cylinder and having a Euclidean time cycle. On the boundary, those two cycles are indistinguishable. They're treated completely democratically. But in the bulk, we have to choose one of those cycles to be contractible. And so you choose a pair of co-prime integers that I've called C and D. That labels which cycle is contractible. That labels which cycle is contractible in the bulk, and you need to sum overall such ways that these cycles can be made contractible. And if you're computing the primary counting partition function, because the descendants are very easy to keep track of in this theory, those are just the oscillator modes of the free CFD. If you want to compute the primary counting partition function, then it's given by this relatively simple sum over coprime integers C and D. And the important point. And the important point is that the different terms in the sum have nice physical geometric interpretations. So, for example, if C and D are equal to zero, one, then that means that the phi cycle is contractible and the time cycle is periodically identified. So that gives you a saddle that you would think of as thermal ADS, right? Because you're just periodically identifying Euclidean time. Periodically identifying Euclidean time. But on the other hand, if it's the Euclidean time cycle that is contractible, then that's the Euclidean BTZ black hole, right? When a cycle is contractible, that means the coefficient of dt squared is equal to zero somewhere. That's an event horizon. Okay, so that's the Euclidean black hole. And so because black holes are contributing to this partition function, and indeed they give a dominant And indeed, they give a dominant contribution at high temperature or at high energy. I think it's fair to think of the heavy states in this theory as the black holes of this theory of gravity. So let's go ahead and compute the black hole entropy. That's easy to do. I've handed you the average partition function. It's just a matter of an inverse Laplace transform in order to extract the density of states. And here it is. So up to some numerical factors. So, up to some numerical factor that I didn't bother to write down, this is an exact answer. You can see that you have a delta function because you always have a state of dimension zero. That's the ground state. And then you have some heavy states. So the first thing you notice is that this theory of gravity does not look like Einstein gravity, because in Einstein gravity, you would have a density of states that goes like e to the area over 4, which goes like e to the square root of delta. This thing is only. Of delta. This thing is only polynomial at high energies rather than exponential at high energies. So it's a bit like a theory of gravity where the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy goes like log of area instead of linear in area. But nevertheless, these are the analog of the black hole states in the theory. And as was pointed out very nicely in that paper by Tom and collaborators, this theory has a gap, which is defined by the place where this average density of states approaches. Where this average density of states approaches one, which you can easily see is then of order the central charge, right? Just using Sterling's formula for n factorial. Okay, so that's just a review of how one would compute the density of states and how you would think of the heavy operators as the analog of black holes in this theory. It turns out that you can compute higher statistics as well. And indeed, there's a formula for the two-point function. There's a formula for the two-point function of the torus partition function, which is nearly identical to the formula that I wrote down on the last slide. So the only difference is now I have a two-point function for a pair of thermal partition functions. So I have a tau and a tau prime. And now it's again a sum over integer over C and D, except now C and D are two by two matrices. And D are 2x2 matrices instead of just being integers. And it's a sum over these pairs of 2x2 matrices C and D that are in some sense co-prime in the same way that the integers C and D I summed over on the last slide had to be co-prime. So what do I mean by this pair of matrices C and D being co-prime? Well, what I mean is that the two by two matrices C and D make up Matrices C and D make up the bottom row of some element of SP4 in the same way that a coprime pair of integers C and D make up the bottom row of an SL2Z matrix. And again, there is a simple geometric interpretation of the terms in this sum. In particular, just as the wormhole here corresponded to C plus D being contractible, now Now, these wormholes correspond to a particular set of Euclidean time and angular directions being contractible. So here now our boundary is a pair of tori, two disconnected tori, with a space and a time circle for each torus. And so you can quickly see that some of the terms in this g Terms in this sum will correspond to disconnected geometries and some will not. So, for example, on the last slide, I said that the C equals zero, D equals one corresponded to thermal ADS. Well, the exact same thing is true here as well. As you can see, that now if the matrix D is a two by two identity matrix, this is the union of two thermal ADSs. And similarly, one, zero corresponds to the disjoint union. Corresponds to the disjoint union of two Euclidean black hole geometry. But now there's other stuff that appears. So, for example, if I take this set of 2x2 matrices, you can check that you can find some sp4 matrix that these guys are the bottom row of. And this corresponds to a cycle where T1 plus T2 is contracted. plus t2 is contractible that is to say t1 is equal to minus t2 and where phi1 minus phi2 is contractible that is to say phi1 is equal to phi2 and you can if you think about it for a second easily identify this with a topology where you have a euclidean wormhole that's just a torus times an interval and the relative minus sign is And the relative minus sign in those two terms that I wrote down, the T1 plus T2, phi1 minus phi2, just comes because you do an orientation reversal on one of those tori. So this is how we would go ahead and think about computing the two-point function as a sum over wormholes in this theory of gravity. And it turns out that the sum can be computed exactly. And I've written down the answer here. Down the answer here, and just as on an earlier slide, I wrote down an answer for the average one-point function of the density of states. Here, I'm writing down an expression for the average two-point function. And I suppose I'm using dimensions instead of energies here, so I should put dimensions there. So I'm not going to spend too much time trying to unpack this formula. I just wrote it down here so that I could point out a few. Here, so that I could point out a few of its interesting features. So, this is a formula that we wrote down mostly in this paper with Scott over the summer, but we also made some very closely related comments in that second paper. But really, the paper that Scott and I wrote over the summer was primarily involved with unpacking some beautiful work by the mathematician Maas from 50, 60 years ago, where all of the technology for computing Where all of the technology for computing these sums was developed. And so, actually, you know, we spent a whole appendix in that paper just summarizing the contents of the very lovely book on modular forms by Moss, where such things were computed. So let's stare at this formula for the two-point function for a second. So the first thing you notice is that you have a delta function here. So what does that delta function tell you? That delta function tells you That delta function tells you that the existence of a state with some energy delta one is perfectly correlated with the existence of a state with some energy that's a rational number times delta one. And we're talking about free boson theories, and so such a thing is not a surprise, right? Because if you ever have a primary operator of some dimension, then you're going to have other primary operators that correspond to different momentum and winding modes. To different momentum and winding modes. And these things will always be rational multiples of one another. So, such a delta function, so usually, if we were talking about random matrix theory, for example, you would just have a term that looks like this, delta one minus delta two, okay, which corresponds to the fact that if you have a state of delta one, then as delta two approaches delta one, you're going to get a divergence in the two-point function, just because that's what the two-point function means. And here we see we have. function means. And here we see we have a slightly expanded version of that formula, which takes into account the momentum and winding structure of this ensemble of free boson theories. And then the second term that I have is the thing that would be interesting in random matrix theory, because that's the thing that would describe the level repulsion and it would give you the correlation function between Between on the level spectrum, on the level statistics of the conformal field of the theory. So, in random matrix theory, this takes a universal form, which is known as the sine kernel. And what we can see here is that we found some expression that I would interpret as the analog of the sine kernel in this family of theories. So, I should note that this is not Poisson statistics. So, Poisson statistics is what you would expect. So Poisson statistics is what you would expect of an integrable theory, nor is it random matrix statistics, which is what you would expect in a generic chaotic theory. So it was suggested to me that these might be what are known as Merman statistics. They're called Merman statistics because random matrix theory was invented by Wigner and Dyson, who were humans. Poisson statistics were invented by Poisson. were invented by Poisson, who's obviously a fish. And so something that's halfway between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics would then be merman statistics, because it's half human, half fish. Okay, this is one of those examples where I can never tell if that joke made people laugh or not, but I'm just going to assume it did. But I didn't invent that joke. That joke was invented by a random matrix person several decades ago. Good. So Good. So in order to unpack a little bit this formula in more detail, let me write down the spectral form factor. So the spectral form factor is the thing that captures the level statistics. And the first thing that you note is that the sum over wormholes that I wrote down reproduces the plateau. So the late time behavior of the spectral form factor is supposed to approach a To approach a constant at late times. And indeed, that is exactly what happens here. So, the spectral form factor, as I've written it here, so it's the sum over dimensions, analytically continued to Lorentzian time. It's bounded by z of 2 beta at late times. And indeed, we see that this sum over warm holes is precisely reproduced this bound. And I think of this really as a consequence of the discreteness of the theory. So we began. So we began talking today by asking the question: Can these simple theories of gravity reproduce details of the microscopic structure of heavy states? And here, the answer is now a cautious yes. The reason being that when we average over the space of CFTs, we're not getting a discrete spectrum, but we're still getting this echo of discreteness, this residual consequence of discreteness, which is Consequence of discreteness, which is the plateau and the spectral form factor. And it is coming from a wormhole sum, or at least the analog of a sum over wormholes in this theory of gravity. The other thing to note is that although we have reproduced the plateau behavior by the sum over wormholes, we don't have a ramp in the theory. So in a typical random matrix theory or fully chaotic theory, you approach the plateau from below. Approach the plateau from below in a linear fashion. This is known as the ramp. That's related to long distance level repulsion in the spectrum. And our theory does not possess this long distance level repulsion. So we don't have this linear ramp. So it's in that sense, which this theory is not fully chaotic. Perhaps not surprisingly, we were able to write down the spectrum exactly. So maybe we shouldn't be surprised that it's fully chaotic or not fully. Fully chaotic, or not fully chaotic. It's interesting to think about the semi-classical limit. I'll just mention that as one might hope, connected correlators are exponentially suppressed relative to disconnected correlators. So, for example, if you look at the connected two-point function relative to the one-point function squared, One point function squared, you find that it's exponentially suppressed. So, in particular, when beta is equal to one, that's the analog of the Hawking-Page phase transition in this family of theories. And you can see that no matter which side of the Hawking-Page phase transition you're on, you're always going to have connected correlators exponentially suppressed relative to disconnected correlators. This is what would normally This is what would normally be associated with self-averaging in a theory. And the same holds for higher moments as well. I will mention that something rather funny happens if you work at finite values of the central charge, which is that sufficiently high moments of the partition function actually diverge from the sum over wormholes. I think the interpretation of this is a little unclear. At the moment, my preferred interpretation of this is that this divergence is just This divergence is just an artifact of the fact that things like moments of the partition function are really annealed quantities. And the right thing to do is think about a quenched quantity like the quenched free energy, which is really always finite whenever you have a good probability distribution on the space of theory. Let me now turn to the last question that I began with this morning, which is what happens when Happens when we try and make the wormholes go away? That is to say, how can the wormholes disappear when we have an exact conformal field theory rather than an ensemble of conformal field theories? And here, I'll just say that one can use the spectral theory of the upper half plane and do some harmonic analysis, as we described in the paper. We described in the paper that I mention at the bottom here to obtain an interesting expression for these free boson partition functions. Roughly speaking, the expression that I've given here says that what we should do is think about the space of conformal field theories and the moduli space of a torus. And you should think of the partition function as a function. Of the partition function as a function on that product space and expand in eigenfunctions on those two spaces. And it turns out that there's this magic equation related to something that mathematicians call the theta correspondence, which says that the eigenvalues of those two different eigenfunction expansions have to be perfectly correlated. So, for example, you have to have an eigenfunction on world sheet moduli space with an eigenvalue. moduli space with an eigenvalue that equals the eigenfunction on the target space moduli space. And this leads to these sort of relatively simple expressions for these free boson partition functions, where any individual element of the ensemble can be written as an average plus some corrections to the average that restore unitarity. And it's these terms that are really the analog. Terms that are really the analog of what are called half-wormholes in this theory of gravity. They're the deviations that restore unitarity. So that leads, I think, to some general speculations that I'm just going to close out our discussion with today, which is how can one characterize precisely the difference between a simple theory of gravity described by a probability. Of gravity described by a probability distribution and a fancy one, which is an individual conformal field theory. So, what I really want to do is think about the light part of the spectrum and its modular completion. So, I want to, by which, and there are many different ways that we could modular complete the light part of a spectrum. I will just think about, for example, a Poincaré sum or something like that, but there are other ways. But the basic idea is that the modular completion of the light part of the spectrum is the thing. Light part of the spectrum is the thing that captures light degrees of freedom, as well as black hole dynamics and the corrections to black hole dynamics. And that's the thing that should play the role of the simple part of the theory. And then it's the rest of the partition function, which is the part that is normalizable as a function on a world sheet modulized space, that is the fancy part of the theory. And this is the thing that encodes the contributions that restore unitarity. That restores unitarity. And this is true as a mathematical fact for the Naren ensemble that I talked about earlier, but I would like to speculate that this is a plausible way of thinking about fancy versus simple theories of gravity in general. So I've gone into what's supposedly our question period. So maybe what I'll do is not bore you any longer. I will say You any longer. I will say that there are many other interesting things one could talk about: other ensembles of CFTs, other probability measures on the Norayend moduli space, other kinds of averaging formulas you could write down, ways that we could think about flowing between fancy and simple theories, all of which lead up to, I think, the most interesting questions of what is pure gravity? Really, the drawback of Really, the drawback of these Norrain theories is that they're too integrable since the central charge is equal to the number of currents. And so, what I think this subject is really begging for are more chaotic examples, things where the spectral form factor really has a linear ramp or something like this. Obviously, one might want to speculate that pure gravity should be the average overall conformal field theories. It should be some sort of average solution to the conformal field. Average solution to the conformal bootstrap. But that's rather difficult to understand. And so I think I'll just leave that as a question for discussion in the minus nine minutes remaining in this talk. Thank you. Okay, well, I didn't do a very good job with my moderation, but we have time for a couple of questions, I think. Daniel, go ahead. By the way, but I wanted to really dwell on the joke that I did make up this morning, okay, which is putting the variants back on modular invariants because I went through it a little quickly. And I just want to make sure that everyone got that. Okay, good. That joke doesn't require us to know French. But this is an education. You're in Canada. This is a Canadian conference. It's a goddamn official language. Official language. Okay. So, yeah, I wanted to suggest a comment that's related to your last two slides. So, you know, it's true that there's the light spectrum and the heavy spectrum, but then as you know, we should also think about the OPE coefficients. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah. So I wanted to suggest that actually saying that gravity is the average overall CFTs, I think, is too restrictive. I think you should probably also allow things that aren't CFTs. Maybe it's enough. Aren't CFTs? Maybe it's enough to, you know, because you just want to fix low energy effective theory, some effective gravity, effective field theory, right? So maybe it's enough to say that the light, light, light, and maybe the light, light, heavy OP coefficients have to be good CFT things that are consistent with crossing and so on. But maybe it's too much to demand that heavy, heavy, heavy is also consistent with crossing. I mean, that has to do with the modular invariance. To do with the modular invariance and so on, and maybe we should be unbiased about that. But the way that I think about it is that, you know, heavy stuff involves black holes, and black holes are relatively universal in the sense that all of the, like, you know, Cartier's formula is a dumb statement about Einstein gravity. C, heavy, heavy, heavy. These are kind of dumb statements about black holes. The thing that a fancy theory does for you. That a fancy theory does for you is it gives you exact microscopics. You know, it gives you the exponentially hard to measure degeneracies in the spectrum and the exponentially hard to measure exact values of OPE coefficients. So, you know, I mean, I would say that things like C, heavy, heavy should be included in our simple theory of gravity. Maybe in some crude sense, but not, I mean, not in a, you know, not in an exact sense. I'm not sure that exact crossing symmetry of. That exact crossing symmetry of the heavy operators is something that you should require. Yeah, I mean, what I would say is that one should require solution of bootstrap equations on average. Yeah, but I think that should come out, right? Like, I think the things, maybe what'll happen is that you'll have this set of pseudo-CFTs or something that you average over. Yeah. I mean, if we wanted this to make sense in higher dimensions, I think we're going to have to do this because exact solutions of crossing are just two constraints. No, that's exactly what you want to get something sensible. That's exactly what you want to get something sensible. I think you're going to have to relax to what I call pseudo-CFTs. Yeah, I mean, I think that's what I'm trying to articulate in that box sentence on the bottom, which is that we're not trying to solve exactly the conformal bootstrap equation, but only smear it out a little bit. Well, so maybe in your equation, when you have your thing that you can't decide is a sum or an integral, you should not have it be over CFTs. You should have it over quote CFTs or something like that. Okay, fine. I mean, it's both a sum and an integral because. A sum and an integral because, yeah, uh, uh, uh, yeah, it's both a sum and an integral. And for example, like for n equals four, we think there's only one CFT that has all the symmetries, right? So we probably want to be more open-minded if you want this to make sense. So I'd kind of, oh, sorry, let me ask Alex, why don't you ask your question? No, no, go ahead, go ahead. Awesome. No, no, go ahead. Go ahead. Awesome. All right. I just had a kind of a general question. And you had discussed the simple versus fancy picture of gravity. And so if we think from the gravity point of view, I guess there's another separate way that we would get to the idea that you have to consider spaces of CFTs together. And I'm trying to connect it to, I'm wondering if there's some connection. To, I'm wondering if there's some connection. So it's just the observation that you know you could have domain walls between various regions in gravity. And you could imagine some asymptotically ADS region that has some low energy effective description and another one with a different one, and you have domain walls. And so you should be considering multiple CFTs. In the CFT language, one can interpret domain walls. Interpret domain walls sometimes in terms of RG flows that connect different CFTs, right? I mean, like, so for example, if you have something that looks like one particular ADS gravity theory out of the boundary and a different one in the interior, you could describe that by an RG flow. I suppose they could both go out to the boundary, in which case you would have some sort of domain wall. I mean, I guess you've worked. You've, I mean, people work on this. Or a wormhole with, or a Lorentzian wormhole with two different things. Hole with two different things on either side, yeah. Yeah, so is there a way to get from that to ensemble averaging? Yeah, that's a good question. It's a good question. Maybe we have a coffee break. I mean, and this is also related, I think, to the question that Daniel mentioned. I mean, I'm sort of reminded of this old picture of string field theory as a theory where you Field theory as a theory where you integrate over the space of quantum field theories, and the critical points are given by conformal field theories. And then the beta functions are some approximation to the equations of motion that flow from, you know, that can interpolate between different saddle points. I mean, that may be worth revisiting, but I don't have anything quantitative to say. Okay, why don't we quickly go to? Okay, why don't we quickly go to Alex and then we should move on to the next talk? Yeah, my question is very short. It's just a bit technical. Maybe you said it and I missed it, but in the spectral form factor, the thing that replaces the ramp, do you know what time behavior that is? Is it a power law or? You mean at what time it kicks in? No, like what this curve is. Is it like, you know, square root or I don't know. Oh, in fact, you know, I chose. In fact, you know, I chose this particular one because it was reminiscent of a ramp. It really depended on this particular value of the central charge, sorry, that S is the central charge of the temperature. There are other examples where it sort of looks like this. So really what it is, is a fluctuating envelope that decays down to zero as you approach the plateau. So it's not like this is a square root or simple power or something like that. Okay, and it even depends. I hadn't appreciated that. It even depends on what you're doing. I mean, I chose a particular set of parameters here to kind of make it, you know, give an interesting instance of what can happen. But I don't think there's a simple characterization as a square root or something like that. Actually, the envelope does decay with some power that I Some power that I don't remember. Yeah, the envelope does decay. So I guess if you were to smear it, yeah. I forget what power, it decays towards the plateau with some power that I don't remember. But it is a power of T. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. All right. So let's thank Alex one more time. Thank you. Thank you. And then Toby, do you want to
