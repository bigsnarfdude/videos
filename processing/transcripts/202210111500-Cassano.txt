Thank you. So, first of all, I wish to thank the organizers for the invitation. This place is crazily beautiful. I'm very happy to be here. Also, a conference is very interesting. I open my talk at the end. So, I will spend the first part of the talk talking about just defining what the Dirac operator is and what I mean by delta share interaction. And then, after I do that, I will. And then, after I do that, I will somehow tell you what is the plan of the talk, what are the aims what I'm going to talk to you about. So, let's start immediately. I have to say, of course, that what I'm going to talk you about is part of a collaboration with Vladimir Lotoreczyk and Matiy Tuszek in Prague and Albert Maas in Barcelona. Okay, so let's start. So, let's start with the main character of the talk: that is the Dirac operator. The free Dirac operator in Operator. The free Dirac operator in R2, I will talk always in R2 for this talk, is defined in this way. Here you consider minus i, the complement, the square root of minus 1, minus i d1 plus minus i d2 with some coefficients, sigma 1 and sigma 2, plus m, that is a real number, times a coefficient. The interesting part about this is that sigma 1, sigma 2, and sigma 3 are not real numbers, but are in general polymatrices. are in general poly matrices, that are these two times two matrices. So again, here we are considering a linear combination of the partial derivatives with an i minus i in front of it with these coefficients plus a real term, a real number, times this matrix. So the Dirac operator is in general a matrix value operator and it acts on functions that are C2 value. So here I'm just using this notation that I just explained now because I will use it for the interest of the Explain now because I will use it for the rest of the talk. So, whenever I have a C2 vector, I write sigma dot a to say the formal scalar product between these two. That is basically the linear combination of sigma 1 and sigma 2 with coefficients alpha 1 and alpha 2. So, I'm already using this notation here. Well, yeah, this is P. It is. Okay, now it's not really important what is the explicit formula for the Dirac operator. In fact, you use just the properties of the Pauli matrices. But if Of the polymatrices. But if anybody wants to know which one it is, it's this one. But as I said, it can be interesting, of course, but for the purposes of this talk, it's not really important. What is more important is what the properties of this operator are. So this is, of course, an unbounded operator in L2. It is essentially self-adjoint in synthetically compacted superfluid functions. It is self-adjoint on H1. And it has this very interesting property, that is, whenever you square it, That is, whenever you square it, you get the diagonal matrix that has on the diagonal minus Laplace and plus n square. This is clear because when you square it, you have to square this guy. The square of each polymatrix is the identity matrix, 2 times 2. Minus I d1 squared, that is minus 2 times the derivative with respect to the first variable. And this one is minus 2 times the derivative with respect to the second one. You don't have mixed terms. Terms because the polymatrix is anti-commute. This is basically why we defined everything in the beginning. So, other properties, the Dirac operator is not positive, it's not semi-bounded, and this is in fact a problem because one cannot use immediately all the strategies of calculus of variation or whatever. You cannot use positivity when at least not immediately when dealing with the rampote. And what are we interested in? First of all, What are we interested in? First of all, this operator is interesting because once you realize it as a self-adjoint operator, it describes Bierston's theorem the dynamics of a particle in the relativistic quantum mechanics. And also in the two-dimensional setting, it is interesting because it's associated with the dynamics of low-energy electrons in graphy. But I will not really be interested in this. So, what is a delta interaction? So, in the following, I will So, in the following, I will always say take omega to be a infinitely bounded simply connected opposite set. That is, say, something like this. This is your omega. I will also denote it omega plus. You denote the outside omega minus, and its boundary will be what they call sigma. I denote n the outer nova and t the tangent in the counterclockwise set. The counterclockwise sense. Okay, and so yeah, and in the following always, whenever I have some f, I can write it as a f plus plus and f minus, where the f plus is in this side, f minus is in the outside. So imagine that for some reasons, you can give a meaning to the traces of these two, f plus and f minus, on sigma, from the outside or from the inside, then we define. From this side, then we define the delta interaction to be the average, in the sense of distribution, of these two traces. Okay, so we have the two definitions. Let's put them together. So, as I said, the Dirac operator is in general a matrix-valued operator, is a two times two matrix with derivatives inside. So, we add the the Dirac delta on the surface and we can consider as a coefficient a general two times two matrix. Uh, two times two uh matrix. Of course, we want it to be admission because we want in the end the operator to be self-adjusted. Okay, so let's uh see first one can say I want to consider this operator on the biggest set I can consider. So, what one can do is to consider the functions that are L2 in the, say, for example, let's read this line for the plus. They have to be L2 in the interior, and the action of the diraperator must still be. The operator must still be L2, must stay in L2 and also in the outside. And one thing that people can prove is that if you are in this space, then you have traces in the sense of h minus one half. So we have defined the delta interaction, and we can try to understand what it means to define this operator as an operator from L2 to L2. So we take an F in this maximum domain. Take an F in this maximal domain, and we compute in the sense of distribution the action of the 3D operator plus the delta shell with this coefficient M on F. So we want to compute this. Now, when we compute M sigma 3 on F, we will have some, this is just a bounded matrix, these are constant coefficient matrix. So, when we compute this times F, we will get some something L2, something regular. When we compute M delta sigma on F, we will have M. On F, we will have M, the average of the two traces supported on the surface. And when we compute the derivative of F, we will have the derivative outside, the derivative inside, that are regular because we are in this domain. Plus, as you know, when you have a jump, you are deriving a function with a jump, you will have a delta in the jump, and the coefficient of the delta will be the size of the jump. And in this case, this will be in the direction of the outer normal. Normal. That is precisely this. This is the direction of the alternormal times the job. So we want this to be in L2. So if this is in L2 and this is L2, we will require this guy to be zero. So if we want to define this as an operator from L2 to L2, we will need to require these transmission conditions between what is happening outside and what is happening inside. So sorry, transmission conditions across the surface. Across the surface. Before setting what is the operator, I will just spend some few words on what is the coefficients we want to choose. So as I said, we want it to be a 2 times 2 admission matrix. So since the identities sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3 are a basis of 2 times 2 admission matrices, one can say point by point we take a linear combination of these. In fact, it is more convenient that we use a different basis, that is this one. To use a different basis, that is this one. So this is the identity sigma dot t. Again, I'm using that notation I said in the first slide. So this means sigma 1 t1 plus sigma 2 t2, where t1 and t2 are the components of the target. And the same this with the normal. So I use this, that is again a basis of two times two emission matrices. And I call the coefficient sita lambda to omega eta. So we collect all what I've said up to now. All what I've said up to now, and the Dirac operator with a general local delta interaction is this guy. Here, I rewrite the three-dirac operator, I add the new term. It is useful to rewrite this in this way. So, I leave eta and to here, and here I factor out the sigma dot. So, I rewrite it in this way. Now, some notations: the interaction eta identity, delta sigma is called delta static. Delta interaction. Deltrostatic delta interaction. Tau sigma 3 delta sigma is called Lorentz-scale interaction, and they discuss both a distribution of charges on the surface or a distribution of masses on the surface. And the main character, if you want, the main novelty of our work is the introduction of this new term. So this one has never been considered before, and we introduced it, we called it magnetic delta interaction, because as you see, it Death interaction because, as you see, it completely perfectly fits here. Okay, very good. So, this is a bit of understanding what we want to do. Let's define the operator. So, here you take eta tau lambda omega constant coefficients, and you define the operator in this way. It acts as the free operator inside and downside. And here you are in the maximal domain you can think of, and you impose the transmission conditions across the boundary. Conditions across the boundary. Here I had written before this with m, but now I decided what was m and I written it explicitly. Now, in fact, one can consider infinitely variable coefficients here, but this is not really important. Somehow, if you can do this, then you can generalize it immediately unless you are in some particular cases. But say, main difficulty in the beginning is to understand this. Very good. So this is the operator we are interested in. Operator, we are interested in. So, what we want to do is the following. So, first, we want to show that the interaction omega sigma dot n can be removed with a unitary transformation after a change in the other coefficients. What does this mean? Let's go back here. Here I'm saying basically that I can put this term to be zero, and in some sense, of course, it's wrong because. In some sense, of course, it's wrong because here we are in a singular setting, but I'm saying that I'm choosing the right gauge in order not to have this term. And this is more useful to do computations. Okay, now the yeah. Okay, so for the following, I will always put the last coefficient to be zero. I will just denote this way, because omega, considering omega to be zero, is not restricted. And it is true that when this condition is true, we are in the non-critical case, so said. Critical case, so said, and when this condition is zero, we are in the so-set critical case. I'm going to talk you about what happens in the general non-critical case, the one particular critical case, that is this one. And finally, the last question is, here you are considering, if you want, the mathematical idealization of a problem. So you're considering something supporting on a deeper surface. But then one can say, okay, consider the free Dirac operator. Okay, consider the free Dirac operator plus a potential that is concentrated in a neighborhood of a curve. Is this a good approximation of the Dirac operator? And we will see what is the answer. So just some history of the topic. So shining operators with the delta point interactions have been considered since the nineteen thirties, and delta interaction curves has been considered in the eighties. Let's focus more on Virac operators. Let's focus more on verac operators. Delta point interactions were considered on the line in one D for the first time by the Stevensian Sheva and then are very well studied. I mean there are many many following works on this. For example graphs. What about surfaces? So in the 3D case the first work was by Dietrich, Hexen and Sheva. So Sheva is the same one as here. Basically here they understood what was happening on the left. Basically, here they understood what was happening on the line. And so, once you understand what happens on the line, you can do a spherical surface, because then you consider the radial problem, and it will be again the problem of a line. And it needed quite a long time to get to what happens in the general case on C2 surfaces when these papers by Arisabala Games and Degrees in the 2020s. Here they deal with non-critical interactions, but then there was. Not critical interactions, but then there were these two papers by Tomás Biamafo and Vega, and independently at the same time by Bert and Solzman, where they treated that case. So, in fact, this group is, they are set in GRAST, they are a group that is very good in what is called the topic named boundary triple. So, they consider this problem using boundary triples. So, they restated all of this. So, they've restated all of this in the boundary triple language in this paper. And there are many more contributions here. I'm just listing some names. I just want to list this one alone, because it's really, if you wanted the theoretical basis of what we did in our paper. So, they did everything without considering the magnetic potential, but basically we use the result to extend them, to understand how to deal with the magnetic temperature and temperature. Magnetic temperature and temperature. So let's go to the non-critical case. So, as I said, non-critical means that this condition holds true. And here I'm just rewriting what I said was the Dirac operator. As I said, the omega is not really important. I will set it to be zero. I will erase it. Okay. And the theorem we have is this. We show that the operator is self-adjoint in L2. Its domain, the functions in its domain. The functions in its domain have, in fact, H1 regularity, so the traces are in fact H1 half. The essential spectrum stays as the spectrum of the 3D recognator, and there can be again values in the gap of the essential spectrum. They are a finite number. Okay, I want to give just one slide on what are the tools behind, because somehow just to look through the curve point and see what are the instruments we're using. The instruments we're using. In fact, the idea is to reconuce the study of this operator to the study of a problem on L two of the surface, and you need to study this guy where lambda is a half derivative. So this guy basically contains informations on the coefficients. V is this matrix, so T was the tangent. So here you see, if you want, geometric informations on the surface. And this C theta is this guy. Is this guy, the singular boundary integral operator, the principal value with this kernel, where the kernel is the dream function of the 3DR. Where k0 and k1 are the modified peso functions of the home key. So just to understand what are the issues, k0 behaves like the logarithm of sarcraft zero. So it behaves like the logarithm of the the absolute value of x, while k one behaves like the one of x. 1 behaves like 1 over x. So here you have a 1 over x square with this denominator. So this guy morally behaves like the Cauchy transform on the surface. That morally behaves like, if you want, the Hilbert transform on the line. So these are the difficulties when we're dealing with this. In fact, our contribution is in fact to consider this off-diagonal term. This is not hard, it's not safe. Hard, it's not straightforward, but it's needed to define attention. Good. What happens in the critical case? As I said, this paper by Ben Toltz by Krashkin, they've done it already, but without magnetic field. They have shown that in the critical case, for them is this condition, the operator is self-adjoint, you don't have any sobal of regularity, and that there is this interesting thing, that there is a new point in the essential spectrum. Is a new point in the essential spectrum in the delta. We did not treat the most general case, but we just treated the case of critical and purely magnetic coefficients, that is this case. Why this is interesting? Because the phenomenon of confinement appears. So let's spend a few words on what is confinement. So when this number is minus four, then it is true that the transmission conditions That the transmission conditions, in fact, are prescribing that no transmission at all happens. So it's a particular case of transmission where you say nothing. So the two words inside, outside, don't communicate. So it is true that you can decompose your operator as a direct sum of what happens inside and outside. And then one can say, so from my point of view of dynamics, this means that the particle initially located outside or inside cannot cross the surface. Then one can say, okay, Now one can say, okay, but there must be results on Dirac operator on domains, so let's see what they say. So, in general, the most general local boundary condition for Dirac operator on domains is this one, that is called quantum dot boundary condition. Here a theta in general can vary. For example, when theta is 0 or pi, that is, so when theta is 0 or pi, the sine is 0, and the cosine is plus or minus 1, when this happens, we say that. When this happens, we say that we are in what is called infinite mass boundary condition. Well, when the cosine is zero, in this case, you have what are called the zigzag boundary conditions. And it is true, this is this theorem by Bengurio, Furnessov, Meyer and Vadenbosch, that whenever theta is varying but never touching the zigzag boundary conditions, you have in fact self-adjointness with functions in H1, so in the House way. While when you are in the zigzag boundary condition, you don't have any soap or irregularity, and you have in fact that zero is a point in the spectrum, it's an eigenvalue of infinity, basically. So, somehow there is a difference between these two settings, and this is not really clear. But then, let's understand what we said. So, take, for example, eta to be zero, then you multiply by minus, you divide by four, and it is true. You divide by 4, and it is true that you can write minus lambda over 2 like the sine of theta and tau over 2 like the cosine of theta. So you can rewrite the quantum dot, so the our transmission conditions in this way as a quantum dot boundary conditions. So when you take theta to be zero pi, that is infinite plus boundary conditions, you can realize them with the Lorentz Lorentz colour interactions. This was understood. This was understood, but it is interesting to observe that you can realize zigzag boundary conditions if and only if you are considering a purely magnetic critical interaction. That is, until now the two problems were not completely symmetric. You could not treat one with the other because you didn't have the complete picture. Once you have the magnetic interaction, you can also realize zigzag boundary conditions through delta interactions. And then And then, why is exact is different? Because, as I said, this case is the only one that is confining and critical. So, the zigzag boundary condition has worse properties because, in fact, it comes from a critical delta interaction. Good. So, as I said, we didn't treat the general case, but just the purely magnetic critical interaction, and we showed this. That is, in this case, That is in this case, this is somehow easier because we can square the operator and it will look like it's very similar to the Laplace operator with the Dirichlet boundary conditions. So this is why we treated this case. And the operator is self-agent in L2. You don't have sobolet regularity for the functions in the domain. You don't have eigenvalues in the gap. Plus and minus m are eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity, and you have a single Infinite multiplicity, and you have a sequence of immediate values that come from the initial Laplacian display. Okay, very good. And now, the last point I wanted to talk to you about. So, as I said, the question is: you have a potential that is, say, supported on a neighborhood of your surface. You want this potential, the width of this neighborhood. The width of this nibble to go to zero. Of course, this is interesting because, from the point of view of applications, we've never had a delta shell supporting on a side of measure zero. And one can wonder what happens in this case. So the question is, you take a V, and here this is a bit sad, this is a bit not clear, but this is the way I have to write it. So you take a potential that depends on if at all, lambda, and epsilon, a bounded potential. And you say, if this tends to the tends to the delta interaction with right coefficients in the sense of distribution, we want to understand what happens to the 3D hoverital plus this potential. Now, since the potential is L infinity, this guy is self-adjoint and defined on H1. And the question is, what happens when epsilon goes to zero? Well, it is true that it will tend to the Dirac operator with the Delta interaction, but in general, the coefficients of the delta interaction will be different. The delta interaction will be different from the starting points. This is what happens. So let's see how. Here are just some notations. So I call sigma beta the total neighborhood of width beta of the curve of the boundary sigma. And it's clear that if beta is sufficiently small, I can write all the points in this neighborhood as x sigma. So x sigma is this x sigma. X sigma plus some say Bn you move in the transverse direction over P and so I take on the transverse direction some function that tends to the delta on the line and I rescale it. So I rescale I mean this is the obvious way to think about an approximation of the delta. You take your coefficient You take your coefficient and you multiply all of it. So you define your potential to be zero outside this two-buller neighborhood, and it's inside you want the approximation of the delta times the coefficient. And one can immediately see that it is true that when epsilon goes to zero, you tend to do the direct delta on the surface with this coefficient. Then what happens is the following. Take eta to L lambda such that this condition is fulfilled. That this condition is fulfilled. Now we will read it later. Just let's read it in total and then we will comment it. Then you call eta hat, tow hat, and lambda hat to be this triple multiplied by r, where r is defined here. And if the new ones are not critical, then it is true that you can show strong resolved convergence of approximating the free. Approximating the free Dirac operator with approximate potentials to the Dirac operator with the delta sh. So let's go back here. I want you to focus mainly on this case. When d is positive, it is true that you can have this coefficient to be zero, because the tangent is zero in many points, I mean in every k by. So basically, you can start with the potential that is non-zero, you go to zero, you you Go to zero, you take the neighborhood to shrink to the surface, you will have a free operator in the limit. This is kind of surprising, and it's completely different with what happens with the Schrödinger operator. Okay, what else? So it's gone. So, some more details. If you so, as you've seen here, this number. You've seen here, this number is important, what I call d. It is eta squared minus tau squared minus lambda squared. Compute the new one, and it will be this guy. Now, when d hat is minus 4, you are in the confinement case, and here you will never have the case d hat equals minus 4, because the hyperbolic tangent never reaches minus 1, 1, minus 1 in this case. And so it is true. One in this case. And so it is true that we cannot in this way provide a strong convergence to a Dirac operator with a data share that is confining with this construction. And also, then one can wonder what happens with d hat smaller than minus four, but this is not really a problem because it is true that if you have some coefficients such that d hat is smaller than minus four, then this operator is in fact unitarily equivalent to another one. In fact, unitarily equivalent to another one with the coefficients in such a way that you are in the other region. These are called isospect regulations. So this is not really a limitation. Okay, and I know, yeah. So what was known and what is new? The problem of understanding this limit was already asked by Sheva in 1989, where he studied the problem in 1D and he proved the norm resolution. And he proved the normal convergence of the shrinking operators to the operator with a delta shape. And he said that, but just considering the two separate cases of the electric potential and the Lorentz colour potential. And in the particular case of this potential, it showed exactly what we got. So we are in the tangent of hyperbolic tangent. So this completely fits. So, this completely fits to what we get. Of course, this is 1D, we get something 2D. I will comment on it. And also, this paper by Maas and Pizzikillo, they tried to understand what happens in the 3D case. So, they did the same. So, they considered just the electric and the Lorentz-Carrot potential separately. And what they did is the following: they used an analogous paper by Bert X-Merolts, and Lutoreczy, where they tried to do the same with the Lorentz. Where they try to do the same with the Naplacian. And in this paper, they could prove normal resolvent convergence. In this paper, they could not. Using their techniques, they just show strong resolvent convergence with small potentials. Why? Because the thing is basically, say rough, the shell, the surface where you are considering your interaction, has coding. You are considering your interaction, as CODI mentioned one, and the Laplace is order two. So you have compact operators to deal with. While in this case, you have a surface of per dimension one and your operator has order one. So this is really a problem because you will have a singular integral operator. So it's not as easy as in the case of the Laplace. Okay, so Okay, so we see that in 1D and in 3D we get exactly the same formulas as they got. Because basically it's something related to what happens, what is happening in the transverse direction. Okay, and yeah, and I don't have time for a sketch of the proof, so I will just thank you. Questions? I can't show the proof, but in your proof you use just the operator and the first order, I mean, so you never square the operator. No. Not even in the purely magnetic case. No. No, it's just everything here. And see, the important thing is that we never consider it. thing is that we never consider resolvents. This is why we could do big potentials, while in the paper by Albert Marx and Feuli Pizzigillo they considered the resolvents, so they need inverse something and they need smallness on the potentials. But in the purely magnetic case you would in principle square it without spoiling uh the the structure so and maybe a follow-up question? maybe a follow-up question. Um you said that you consider it a purely mathematic case because this is somehow related to the zigzag boundary. So in some sense we wanted to complete at least in the case of the quantum block boundary conditions. And the critical case but in the general case or not purely magnetic has more difficulties because somehow you have different answers. The first answer is so to speak The first answer is: so, this paper is already quite long, so we decided to we have to decide if to treat the general critical case or just the purely magnetic. And it was interesting because in the purely magnetic critical case, we could square it and get more information. So, we did that. But in fact, we are working on the general critical case. And in the proof, you need to treat apart the purely magnetic critical case. So, we stay tuned. Any other questions?
