Thank you. Hi everyone, I am Dhyana. I am a graduate student at Brown State. And today I will be talking about chiral brown states of ferroelectric liquid crystals. So to begin with, a pneumatic liquid crystal is formed by elongated air chiral molecules which show uniaxial non-polar order N3P. And if we talk about ferroelectric liquid crystals, they are again formed by elongated Are again formed by elongated egg iron molecules, but they have a polar order FEC, polar linear order FC in 3D. So here we talk in terms of polarization vector P and here I show a structure of one of the NF materials that we study. It doesn't have any channel center in the chemical structure. So now suppose if we have a uniformly aligned NF material, then the thing is since the molecules have large dipole moments, so it will create a surface charge at the boundaries and that will create a huge depolarization field. So if we estim estimate that field using these parameters, it comes out to be of the order of k to the power sample. Be of the order of 10 to the power 7 volt per meter. So the question is: what if we give the freedom to the material to reorient or readjust itself? So how it will respond. And to do that, since the liquid crystal molecules in bulk are controlled by the surface interaction, so we can treat the surfaces in different ways and In different ways and manipulate the bulk structures. So, for that, we designed a system where the bottom plate is unixly aligned, which is coated with polyamide and dropped unixly. And then the top plate is providing azimuthly degenerate anchoring. So, edgemoothly degenerate means at the top plate, molecules. The top plate molecules are free to rotate or reorient themselves. So for the degenerate anchoring, we used three different type of cases. One is just the top plate is left free, means the top surface is air. And in the second case, the top plate is coated with polystyrene. And in the third case, we used glycine as a top surface. So if we see the results of this system with NF material in the pneumatic phase it show if we see under closed polarizers by keeping the rubbing direction along one of the polarizers then it shows a dark texture uh which is showing the minimum of intensity at the close polarizers means the molecules are following alignment provided by the water plate. Provided by the water plate. And if we cool it down, the same sample, if we cool it down to the NF phase, then still the rubbing direction is kept along the polarizer and we are looking through the cross polarizers. So the first thing is the material splits into domains and you see the texture now it has significant amount of Has a significant amount of light transmittance. So that means the molecules are not following the alignment provided by the bottom surface. It has some kind of twist and to analyze it further we did the decrossing of polarizer and analyzer. So by fixing the polarizer along the wing direction we decross the analyzer. So decross means we rotate it either clockwise or counterclockwise from the wind. Clockwise or counterclockwise from the closed polarizer. So if you focus on domains denoted by numbers 1, 2, and 3, then in one case, when you rotate the analyzer in clockwise direction, domain 1 becomes more bright and domain 2 becomes darker. And if you rotate the analyzer in the opposite way, domain 1 becomes darker and domain 2 becomes more bright. So that means the twist in the domains is. Twist in the domains is of opposite type, and to measure the twist angle with the help of Maxim, we did the numerical simulations using Jones matrices and we fitted the data of transmittance as a function of rotation as a function of angle between analyzer and polarizer. And you see the here the black curve is for drimatic, and you see the curves for And you see the curves in color red and blue. These are for the domains in NF phase and which show minimum of intensity other than the cross polarizers. And for domains 1 and 3, the twist angle is 164 degree, and for domain 2, the twist angle is minus 169 degree. That means the domains next to each other have opposite kind of twist. Have opposite kind of twist or twist of opposite handedness. So, here I show the scheme of this twist. So, now as a result, we can say that to reduce this depolarization field, the material reorient itself inside the domain so it twists so that at each edge we have both positive and negative charges. Negative charges. And this structure was first described by Kachaturian in 1975. In his paper, he considered a linear twist in a single-domain structure. So now the next thought is can we somehow externally reduce this twist or reduce the use depolarization field? So if we have some ionic impurity, If we have some ionic impurity or ions added to the material, then these freely moving ions can screen the charges and it might reduce the depolarization field. So to do that, we added this ionic fluid BMIMPF6 to the NF material in weight concentration of 0.5%. And now you see the result. The result. So, here some of the domains are still twisted, but some of the domains show pneumatic-like texture means in this region molecules are following the alignment provided by the waste. So, that means the ionic impurity helps to reduce the waste or to weaken the waste. So, in conclusion, we can say that the ground state of NF. Ground state of NF materials is chiral rather than being homogeneous, or here chirality means the domains have at least of opposite-handedness and even though the constituent molecules are having no chiral centers. And from this work, we can say that the polar orientational order of molecules can trigger the chirality in some microsystems. Thank you. Thank you very much for your attention. When you have neighboring regions of different heaviness of twist, can you tell if they have the same pitch? Or do they have a varying pitch between the two? So in the neighboring domains, the twist angle the pitch is of the same It is there, it's called neighbouring domains. All right, well, let's let's thank Grinto, let's thank all of you. And please don't forget to pick some microphones to finish this.
