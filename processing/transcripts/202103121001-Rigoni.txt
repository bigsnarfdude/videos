Giara Rigoni, who will be presenting Tamed Spaces, Dirichlet Spaces with distribution-valued lower bounds on the Ricci curvature. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you very much also to the organizers for the possibility to attend this very nice workshop and also to present this result here. So the purpose of my talk is to present a generalization of the concept of synthetic lower witchy bounds. Synthetic lower Ricci bounds that goes far beyond the framework of uniform bounds. I start with a brief introduction and recalling that in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, the fact that the Ricci tensor is bounded from below by a constant k is actually equivalent to the fact that the Boekner inequality with parameter k holds. Parameter k holds for any smooth function. This result was generalized by Berkeley-Emery in 85 to the setting of Dirichlet spaces. And so they managed to introduce a synthetic lower Ricci bound, so a synthetic definition, which relies just on the fact that we have Dirichlet, so in particular, which has a Carriedouchan, and we can also. And we can associate also an iterative care douche. So we have this inequality which holds almost everywhere, and again the parameter k appears. So as we were saying, all these notions rely on the fact that this k is a constant in a real-valued constant. So what we have in mind is to translate this kind of setting in a Of setting in order to include some more general structures. In particular, here I have a selection of examples that we were considering, which are the case in which we have a lower bound on the Ricci curvature, yes, but this lower bound is given in terms of a continuous function, but this function can be also unbounded. This function can be also unbounded. And for those of you that know a little bit of this theory, this function has to be also in the Cato class, but it's not so relevant. Another example is the one in which the lower bound is given in terms of a locally unbounded function, which lies in Lp for some P which is greater than the dimension of the manifold over 2. Over 2. This situation, for example, appears once we have a Riemannian manifold and we apply some conformal transformation or we make a time change with a singular weighted function. Last example we considered is the case in which the Riemannian manifold has a boundary, and in this boundary, we have that the second fundamental form is bounded from below in terms of a manifold. Below in terms of an LP function, and this LP function we mean with respect to the boundary measure. So, clearly, all these examples are not included in the setting of the Riemannian manifold with a lower bound on the Ricci curvature, with a constant, a uniform lower bound. And so, our plan is to replace the constant Kachi-Melico and to replace it by a distribution. Replace it by a distribution, a suitable distribution, and so then we should consider this inequality no more in an almost everywhere sense, but in a distributional sense. And the idea, the fundamental idea behind is the fact that this distribution at this point is acting as a perturbation of the energy of the space, since we are this case acting on the gamma operation. On the gamma operator associated to the Dirichlet form. So, again, as in Backli Emory, in the Backli Emory setting, our setting is the one of quasi-regular, strongly local Dirichlet forms. So, quasi-regular, strongly local Dirichlet space. And in particular, we require the existence of a correlation energy for this Dirichlet energy. And the Carado champ is nothing but a symmetric bilinear map which goes from the domain of the energy squared and gives back an L1 function, an L1 positive function, which this Carré duchamp satisfy the Leibniz rule. And in particular, the main advantage is that we can represent our Libichlet score as the integral of this colour. Of this Carrie duchamp, and this for any couple of functions in the domain of the energy. Let's see the most important examples, the most natural examples. First of all, we have the case of a Riemannian manifold that defines naturally the Lichlet space because we consider the space itself as measure, we consider the volume measure which comes with the Which comes with the Riemannian tensor, and then we define the energy. So everything is smooth, we take a smooth function, we can define the gradient of this function. We take neuron, we squared it, we integrate, and one over two, and we have the Dirichlet energy. In particular, the domain of this form gives the subolet space constructed on the line. Space constructed on the manifold. All this construction can be generalized in the case of metric measure spaces in a suitable way actually. Because in this setting, we don't have anymore a way to define a gradient of a function. So we have to pass through a relaxation of this argument. And so we define the minimal recap gradient, which We define the minimal recap gradient, which is this object, which is defined with this weak notion. And we square it again, we integrate, and we find what is called the Tiger energy. In particular, the fact that here we have the infinitesimal Bertianity requirement relies exactly, it's defined as the fact that the Tiger energy is quadratic. So the infinitesimal Bertianity requirement So, the infinitesimal British anti-A hypothesis is important in order to have a quasi-regular, strongly local Dirichlet space. Another thing to observe is that in these situations, we have the existence of the Carré douchamp in both the situations. In the case of the Riemannian manifold, the Carré douchamp is not nothing but the scalar product between the gradient of F and gradient of G. Of f and gradient of g. While in this second cost structure, this cost structure actually relies a little bit more or more sophisticated tools. But also in the case of metric measure spaces, we can prove that actually we have a scalar product and we can define the Carré du Champ exactly as in the case of the Riemannian manifold. Many manifolds. So, this was what we wanted to introduce for the reflectors. Before, we were saying that the bacteria emerged condition is like a perturbation of the energy. So, in the bacteria emerging, it's a perturbation by this constant K. In our situation, we want to find singular the order perturbation of the energy. To consider is the one of distributions, which are so in this terminology means that they are in the dual of the domain of the form and they are quasi-local, meaning that there exists an exhaustion of the space made of quasi-open sets, such that if we localize our distribution to Our distribution to each one of these open sets, then we have a distribution that lies on the dual of the Dirichlet form, of the domain of the Dirichlet form in that quasi-organized state. For this class of distributions, we then have we can define the team in semi-group and this is done. Group and this is done making use of the Feynman-Katz formula. And so we define it in terms of the stochastic process associated with our initial space and in terms of this local continuous additive function AKT, which is the functional associated with our distribution. Very well. So now we know that the existence of this. We know the existence of this taming semigroup, but we don't know still if it satisfies some nice properties. In order to do it, we have to introduce a further condition on the distribution, which is the fact that this kappa is a moderate distribution in the sense that we have this bound on the expectation which holds. Expectation which holds uniformly in space and time. In particular, this condition means that the Taming semigroup is exponentially bounded in L infinity. So now once we have also this notion, we know that when K kappa is moderate, then the Tamine semi-group is strongly continuous. Group is strongly continuous and it's also exponentially bounded not just in L infinity but also in L2. So it satisfies all the nice properties that we were expecting. And in particular, this generates a lower bounded closed quadratic form that we call Taming's energy. So we started with a distribution and With a distribution, and going through the Taming Sami group, we can define now also the Taming energy, which is a perturbation of our initial energy. So mimic the construction of the or better generalizing, extending the cost structure of the energy, define what is for a Dirichlet space, what is the What is the class of tense phases? And so we say that the Richlet phase is stained if there exists a moderate distribution such that the following Bochner inequality holds true. And this for sufficiently many F and phi. And in this case, we say that this kappa is the distribution valued lower Ricci bound. So what we have here is we said the perturbation of our energy. Of our energy, which acts on our initial Care Douchamp. And then here we have in this term, we have the Care Douchamp acting on F and on the generator of the Dirichlet form applied to F. So in the particular case in which our kappa was exactly the uniform bound K, we find again the initial Bochner inequality. The initial Bochner inequality. What we proved, moreover, is the fact that the validity of this Boekner inequality is actually equivalent to the fact that this gradient estimate holds true, which means that if we have the Care Douchamp of our Dirichlet form, which is acting to the semi-group of the associated again to the starting Dirichlet forms, and we want to switch them. Formed and we want to switch them, then we find this inequality and that the new taming semi-group is appearing applied to the Care Douchamp associated with the initial form. So we have this fact that actually things are appearing, the new factory, the new semi-group is appearing once we want to switch. And in this setting, many of the results of the inequality, which were proved to hold in the case of the validity of the Bakri-Emery inequality with a uniform constant, holds still true. So, if we have a Dirichlet space which is tamed by some kappa, then local and reverse local Poincaré inequalities are still holding. And in this situation, also the new taming semi-group is not appearing, which is a little bit surprising, but it's like this. Then we have the local and the reverse local log sobolive inequality. Again, they hold true. And this, I think, it's the time to stop. So I thank you very much for your attention. Let's give a round of applause to the speaker. Did you have a, were there any questions for the speaker? I have one question. So, yeah, thank you very much for the nice talk. And it seems really interesting to me to just generalize the lich lower bound in the sense of the distribution. So, in the distribution. So in the usual case of the Boknas type of the formula, then one might expect to get the Gaussian heat corner estimate, I think. But as long as we now have just an integrated condition, so it might be reasonable to guess that the corresponding heat corner estimate should be encoded in terms of the Green's function. So did you investigate the sort of the asthma in Green's function under this new condition? I'm just curious. Actually, probably one of the problems is really to define also what is the green function. To define also what is the green function because it's not now we don't have anymore a Riemannian structure lying down, so also like defining what is the dimension, which is the right, which was actually one of the problems at the beginning. Once I presented the results, the examples, because this Kato class is really relying on the Really relying on the existence of green functions, the standard technique to define the Akata function. So, what we did is to apply the semi-group and to define in a suitable way these objects. But actually, I have no idea if you can do something like this also to generalize the green function in this setting. I'm sure it's a very interesting poll. Thank you so much. Thank you, too. Are there any other questions? Yeah, sorry. I forgot how to raise my hand, so I think I'll just ask a few questions. So, oh, first of all, thank you for the very nice talk. I think I actually don't exactly remember the definition of your F inverse of F inverse of quasi-local that space. But I'm guessing if I understand correctly, the main goal of it is to, when you like add it into the derivative form or something, it so is it like we want to be able to control this kappa potential by the Dirich form?
