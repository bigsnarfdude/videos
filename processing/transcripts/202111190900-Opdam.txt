Thank you very much, Barklau. So I'm extremely honored to be speaking here. So I thank the organizers and also I thank Bill for making a special request that I talk about this topic. So I remember that we spent some very enjoyable time in Israel. Enjoyable time in Israel at the birthday meeting for Joseph, and that you learned about these results. We told you that, well, there is a mistake in those results. But nonetheless, you were extremely enthusiastic and supportive. And, well, that was very meaningful to me. So that really stimulated me to keep going. So, and of course, I also. So, and of course I also want to congratulate you very much for your 80th birthday. So, let me start sharing my screen. Let's see how do we do that. Share screen and then this one then I should maybe do full screen, something like this. Is this working? Okay, so um yeah so so now I do not have the controls it seems yeah I do. So I want to start explaining an application of something I did a long time ago with Garrid Heckman, study of residue distributions. Residue distributions to spherical Eisenstein series. Yes? Is it okay? You seem to be muted. Oh, no, no. We can hear you. You're fine, Eric. Sorry, my fault. Okay. So, so, and then I will explain what type of What type of problems we are experiencing with that and how we think we have now solved it and where we are at this point. Well, I sort of did not want to talk about this, so I cancelled several invitations or did not accept several invitations, but this one I really couldn't refuse. It was just Refuse. It was just too nice to talk at this occasion on something that Bill was so supportive of. So let me go over the basic theory of the things I did with Ferritt Heckman. So that is the basic residue lemma for pale linear functions in a specific sense. So we have some vector space and a finite arrangement of affine. finite arrangement of affine hyperplanes in it and then we have the usual palinar space and also we we use we will use later on the the the palinar space where we just define them in a in a sphere in the real direction with radius r and then in the imaginary direction it's the usual fast decay Fast decay condition. So, that is a bigger space, which is sometimes very useful. So, suppose we have a rational n-zero form on the complexification of V, whose zeros and poles are contained in that arrangement. And then we consider functionals of the form written there. So, you take a The form written there. So you take a regular point, not on one of these pole hyperplanes, and you want to just integrate your pale linear function against that form. And so, excuse me? Okay. So, such functionals, they appear in the harmonic analysis a lot. So, the first goal is a basic So, the first goal is a basic decomposition theory for such functionals. And so, a little bit of notation for that. So, when we take something in the intersection semi-letters of that affine arrangement, then you can look at the total order with respect to all the hyperplanes. So, you look at all the hyperplanes containing that space L and you add up all Space L, and you add up all the orders of omega along those hyperplanes. And we call an affine space residual for this form if it is an intersection of pole hyperplanes for that form. And if the order defined as minus this NL that I just defined minus the co-dimension is greater or equal zero. equals zero so for example the space itself is a residual subspace and yeah if if you have a hyperplane which has a negative order so omega has a pole along it then the order oh is minus that nh minus one which is bigger or equals zero so it's considered the residual space tall space now Now, if you have a residual space, we define a vector space, V sub L as the linear subspace underlying the affine space. And V upper L is its orthocomplement. And the center is the intersection of this orthocomplement with L. So it's the closest point to the origin. And the tempered form of the space. And the tempered form of the space is the center plus I times the underlying vector space of the affine space. And then there is this very elementary, but I think useful proposition, which I took with Heckmann, that there exists a unique collection of tempered distributions XBC, where C is a center of one of the Of one of the pole spaces such that the support of XBC is the union of the tempered spaces of all the residual spaces with that center C. And second, for all palinear functions, you have a decomposition of the functional as a sum of the evaluations of those distributions, of the restrictions of your paliwiner function. Restrictions of your paliwinar function to the spaces C plus I times V. Eric, can I ask a question? In your applications to residues, does your space come with a natural inner product or is the inner product something that you're going to just choose to apply this calculus? Yeah, that's well, I think any biogroup invariant in a product. Any biogroup invariant in a product will give the same answer. So I choose one. Okay. So now, well, this is if you restrict the Palinar function to such a space, you get a Schwarz function. So since these distributions are tempered, this is a meaningful expression. And just to give some examples, if v is the real line and omega is just dx divided by x minus. dx divided by x minus a constant in the real line then yeah it depends on the position of b relative to that center c so if if c is non-zero and b separates the origin and c then you get at that center c you get a sine times well you get the multiple of the delta function there the delta distribution and Distribution and at the origin you get simply x minus c inverse restricted to i times r. And if there is no separation, then you get the zero distribution at that point c. If the point c is in the line, then you get the partifini of one over x on i times r plus some multiple of the of the delta distribution at the origin. At the origin. Okay, so this is all very, very simple material, but it is the basis of what I'm going to tell. So now we are going to look at the relevant case of interest. So suppose now I have some complex connected reductive group with a Borel and a torus in it. And I take for V just the span of the. The span of the co-character letters inside g hat and sigma check is the root system of g hat. Then I define a rational function which is the c function. It's this nice product of alpha check lambda plus one divided by alpha check. And we consider the following two functionals. So the x function. functional. So the x-functional is integration of your pay-winner function against d lambda divided by c minus lambda. And the y distribution is a symmetrized version of that where you replace this d lambda by c minus lambda to d lambda by c lambda times c minus lambda and that is a w invariant expression and you get it by symmetrization. Representation. So, and B is here some arbitrary regular point. Now, the X distribution has some hidden symmetry, which is very interesting. Well, first of all, there is a very elementary algebraic relation. If you average this one over C minus lambda over the Weo group, you get this form that I used for the Y distribution. But also, if you But also, if you take a palinear function and you look at the center of a pole space, then a while group element. So then at WC, at the center WC, your local distribution of the XB is the Y distribution at C composed with some averaging operator and a translation, so a pullback with W to. So, a pullback with W to get you to C from W C. And this averaging operator is not just a Weil group symmetrization, but you have to sort of take the weighted sum with the C functions in front. But that gives you a Weil group invariant, Pale-Linear function again. And in fact, it shows that the X functional has this funny symmetry, that if you replace the argument by the averaging in this sense of this A operator of F. Of this A operator of f, you get the same result. It's a hidden symmetry of that x. Now, there is, because it has an interpretation, as we will see in terms of harmonic analysis, you can show that it has some positivity properties and the y has strong regularity properties. So, first of all, all the poles of the y distribution are simple. So the order of any subspace in V with respect to the y distribution is less or equals zero. And so the maximal order that you can have to get a pole, it is just zero. And such a space we call a residual subspace or omega y residual subspace. It means that the number of poles is equal to the number of zeros plus the coding. And so that makes it possible. So that makes it possible to prove that, in fact, the Y distribution gives you measures, smooth measures, in fact, supported by these tempered subspaces. And these measures can be computed explicitly. We call them here d nu prime L. So there is an explicit set of measures associated to the y distribution. Then we have a support theory. So, the following statement is true. If you look at the support of the Y distribution, it's only for centers that are in the anti-Casso Monko. And in fact, you can show that these residual spaces for the Y distribution. Spaces for the Y distribution. If you look at the Wow group orbits of those spaces, they are in canonical bijection with the nilpotent orbits. And the centers are half the rated Dinking diagrams of the nilpotent orbits of G-Check. So, of course, that's quite a bit of work to prove this, but this is the result that you get in the end. So, there is a sort of non-cancellation theory. non-cancellation theory we can show that any residual subspace does give you a contribution in a local contribution to y and then it has an interpretation in terms of the hacker algebra spectrum and you can relate it to castan-luster theory to get this result now i want to interpret this uh very simple setup to something that physicists like very much it's called the attract the bose gas with attractive delta potential Gas with attractive delta potential. So we take a Hamiltonian, which is minus the Laplacian, and then minus the sum over all the roots, all the roots, not only the positive roots, the composition of delta with the root. And so if you do this for type A, this one-dimensional Bose gas describes three particles that are quantum particles, and they are on the line, and they are attracted to each other, but only at very short range. Very short range, and then they have this tendency to lump together in partitions, and so it has some interesting properties. So, you can describe on the usual vector space for type A, two the eigenfunctions for this system, for this quantum system. And in the dual space, you have the anti-Casselman code where, and you see the pole lines for these X and See the pole lines for these x and y distributions. Now, I'm not going to go in any detail here, but I just want to say that the eigenfunction for this, what is called a Yang system with this attractive delta function potential, is just this A operator applied to the plane waves. And so you get this nice expression, the one over, which of course is very well known for people who know spherical functions or things. Functions or things in spherical Hecke algebra. So it's the sum over the Weyo group with the C function and then the pairing of lambda and X. But you have to, so in the X variable, it is not a differentiable function. You take this expression on the positive chamber and then you expand it or propagate it W invariant to the other chambers. But in the lambda variable, it is Weil group invariant. It is while group invariant and holomorphic. And we have a wave packet operator. So we take wave packets for the Yang system. You take a palinear function and you get an L2 function on V, which is W invariant by just taking the usual wave packets. But well, in fact, not the usual wave packets. I have to take the wave packet. Wave packets: I have to take the wave packets according to this xb operator. So I take the pay-liner function times this eigenfunction, then I divide by my c minus lambda, and that I integrate d lambda over b plus i times v. And well, there is an anti-evolution that plays a role, or an antilinear evolution on the play-linear functions. And the play-winner functions is just what I wrote there. So you take f of lambda conjugate conjugate. And in so that function we call f bar, and then there is a similar averaging operator as the A operator, but we write it as an R R F Yang system, which is this sum with the minus W lambda and the F bar minus W lambda. Here is the pertinent formula in the Yang system store. Formula in the Yang system story: that if you take the inner product of two wave packets, you get the X distribution applied to G, the Pale-Linear function G times Rf Yang system. And this RF Yang system is this averaging operator we can think of. Yes? And now you can use, because this is Pali Wiener, you can use the expansion theory of which I Expansion theory of which I derived with Hetman, and you can write this as a sum over the residual subspaces of this nice symmetric expression. So it's an inner product of the A averages of F and G against this measure, which is explicit and smooth. And well, I already explained that these omega y residual spaces, they are really in bijection, the Weyl group orbits. The while group orbits of those in bijection with the new potent orbits. So, this formula is very beautiful. And now, I want to apply this yoga of these distributions to the story of Unremified Spherical Eisenstein series. Now, of course, that problem has been studied by many people that did excellent work. Did excellent work. So it's a well-known problem with many important results. And so we had a pre-print where we made some claims and those claims are not... Well, I think the claims are correct, but the proofs are not. And as I said, so I met Bill in, I think it was 2018. I told him that. I told him there is a gap, but nonetheless, he was extremely positive. And so, what we have been doing since then, and it takes an embarrassing long time, is trying to fix the problems. So, well, this is much more familiar to all of you. So, we have the theory of unramified spherical Eisenstein series. So, we have a split connected reductive group over a number field. Field and we take just the projection map as is written here, MB. And in terms of that projection map, we can define the Eisenstein series in the usual way, where you sum over the cosets Gf mod Bf. That's the Borel-Eisenstein series. Epsilon lambda. Epsilon lambda g and this has many known beautiful properties, so it's absolutely convergent at some provided you are in the correct cone. It has a meromorphic continuation to AC star as a function of lambda. If we compute, if we say that the completely data cassette, data can be The completed data ginzetta function of the field is capital lambda. We can regularize its poles in zero and one. So we call that regularization rho of s. That will play quite a role in the story. So it's good to remember that. And the function r lambda is just the product of all these rows over the positive roots, positive co-roots. And the c function is the thing that you have. Is the thing that you have to take into account because to accommodate the poles of the zeta function. So it is this C function that I introduced before. And then you have a following very nice co-cycle behavior of the Borel-Eisenstein series. Well, it's an eigenform for the spherical Hecke algebra, of course. Algebra, of course, and we can form the pseudo-Eisenstein series and we get L2 functions on GA mod GF, which are K invariant. And this is just the usual palinar packets. Now I want to define what I call the normalized Eisenstein series. So because now sort of the eigenspace is only one dimensional for generic lambda. For generic lambda, we can just normalize in a nice way at lambda. And I do that by multiplying with essentially r minus lambda and c minus lambda. And I call that epsilon zero. And you can also see that this is equal to this averaging operator of r times epsilon minus lambda g evaluated in minus lambda. Well, this is a very nice function. It is holomorphic, W invariant, and it is moderate growth in vertical strips. And this function you can now make pseudo-Eisenstein series for, which is just again this xb distribution applied to a palinar function times the normalized Eisenstein series. So it is this integral. But I divide now away. But I divide now away this factor c minus lambda. But still, you can see that this is a special case of an unnormalized Eisenstein series, where you multiply your function f by this r minus lambda, here if you compare to the original formula. Okay, so it is again, we can write it in terms of the x distribution, and well, we know that. Well, we know that the L2 space is the closure of all the pseudo-Eisensteins. And I define a subspace where I take a zero here as the closure of all these normalized pseudo-Eisenstein series. The problem is now to decompose, of course, the L2 T1. So the things supported. The things supported by the cosmical character one of t k invariance as a module over the spherical Hecke algebra. And we split this problem in two parts. So first I want to give the spectral decomposition of this subspace. That's a unitary representation of the spherical Hecke algebra. And then I want to show that this subspace is actually the whole space. Now the first part for that I can look at the Langlands formula for inner products of pseudo-Eisenstein, of pseudo-Eisenstein series. And you can see that it expresses formally as this XB distribution exactly as we saw it for the Yang system. Only now this function here, of course, is not payliner. It has additional poles because of the Pulse because of the critical zeros of the zeta functions. And so, therefore, everything that we applied before, you have to do with much more care. You cannot simply, for example, use the hidden symmetry that we saw in the case that the argument is a pale-linear function, because now there are all these poles in the way. But you can simplify the situation by looking at these normalized ison signs. By looking at these normalized Eisenstein series, because then you just remove all the problems. So, if I look at Legend's formula for normalized Eisenstein series, then I get on the nose exactly the formula we had for this physics system, for the Young system. It's the Xb of the product of the averaging operator I introduced for the Yang system times G. And so, in other words, you see that the Young system. Words, you see that the Yang system has somehow is well, if you map the wave packet for F of the Yang system to that of the normalized Eisenstein series, you just get that isometry with this subspace of your L2 space of the Yang system. And it is somehow very remarkable. This we see it just by the formula, but I think there is something behind. Formula, but I think there is something behind it. Because, in fact, you can see that the Young system is a representation of the graded affine Hecke algebra. And on the right-hand side, of course, it's a spectral decomposition for the spherical Hecke algebra. And it's very remarkable that the same space somehow serves the spectral decomposition of both representations. And you can express, because the X distribution is related to the Y and the Y can be expressed in support in terms of the nilpotent orbits. Support in terms of the nilpotent orbits. And it's not hard to express everything in what we call unramified anti-tempered global arter parameters for the support T1. And well, I think it's not very important to go over it very precisely, but it's just a reformulation, but it's a very nice reformulation. You can see that if you look at this linear map, assigning to an arter parameter. Parameter, this value in the orbit space of A C star, you get a bijection with the support of the y distribution and this space of equivalence classes of these spherical unipotent global arter parameters. And so you can now reformulate it as follows. You can say, okay, the L2 space with the zero, so the normalized space. With the zero, so the normalized space is isomorphic to an L2 space supported by this equivalence classes of Arter parameters with respect to an explicitly known positive measure, which is smooth on every component. And well, in fact, you get now the result that for any distinguished nilpotent orbit. Any distinguished nilpotent orbit, the normalized Eisenstein series is a non-zero element in L2. With an explicit L2 norm, you can just compute it. Which is quite powerful because now you know that all the local representations are unitarizable, including at the real place. So that's quite intriguing that you get such results in such a soft way. Okay. Okay, so that is quite nice results, but then of course, yeah, we claimed that we actually had the complete space L2K T1. Eric, I'm sorry, I missed it. Did you say what distinguished means? Ah, yeah, so that in fact it is borrowed from an old. That is borrowed from an old paper. It means what I just mentioned: a residual point. So, the distinguished nilpotent orbit, of course, you know. Can you just recall the definition for distinguished nilpotent orbit? It means that if you look at the centralizer of the SL2 of the orbit, it's just a finite group. And that corresponds to the And that corresponds to the discrete spectrum, that the discrete points, residual points, I would say, or the discrete Arter parameters of this simple type. The term distinguished comes from Balak Arter. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. Yeah, so, and then we called also our points distinguished, but that we discarded. I see it as just the balac terminology. Okay, so now let's look at this claim that in fact the span of these normalized pseudo-Eisenstein series is the same as the full span or closure of the span of the Eisenstein series of this type. And I can only prove that for all cases and for E8, except for E8 at the moment, and for E8 we think. At the moment, and for E8, we think we have a method to also decide it, but there are some lines that well they require more attention in the E8 spectrum. But we believe everything hints us that it will be true, but we just need to do the detail. But for all the other cases, in any case, this is true. And so here is the And so here is the approach. So we take again the formula of the inner product, inner product formula of Langlands. We need now to truncate it in the usual sense. So we choose a large T and then we look at the spaces over which we integrate at this inequality over time. And yeah, so we will prove that we can move all the base points arbitrarily close to the centers of the spaces. But in order to do so, you need to have that the kernel in your expressions, except for the algebraic part of the kernel, that those things along the parts where you Things along the parts where you want to move your contours are holomorphic. And okay, so that is something that is the challenge. And here we once you are close to the centers, you can symmetriz again with this AWC symmetry. And then you can see that, in fact, once you are close to the centers, this XB distribution. Centers, this XB distribution again has this symmetry by comparison with the normalized Eisenstein case. So it is these two steps. And both of them are, well, I call that admissibility. So it means that I will indicate in each pole space that we encounter a certain subset, which I call the admissible set, where the contours. Where the contours are allowed to be moved without creating weird residues coming from the critical zeros. Okay, so, but we tried to do this directly many times, in many ways, and always the computer said no. It is very, very hard. And so, we used, in the end, McGlan's idea to induce from a very induce from a very for from the most complicated proper parabolic or proper levy so we take g prime in g and if you choose that well then you you clear up a lot of the mess by partial symmetrization not over the full weal group but over the wee group of t prime and so you have an induction hypothesis that that already That already cleans up a lot. And these kernels behave, for of these partially symmetrized integrals, they behave much less wild than the kernels of the unsymmetrized xb. And so what are the pairs we take? Well, for the classical cases, it is done by Maudlin, although we do have a bit of a different method now as a byproduct. But then for the exceptional cases, we use these pairs. And so the induction hypothesis makes it possible now to rewrite Langland's formula in the following form, where the well, we have now a different omega. It's not omega x, but and not omega y, but it is symmetrized, omega x symmetrized over w prime. So you get d. Over W prime, so you get D lambda over C prime lambda times C minus lambda, where C prime is the C function of the G prime. And also the A prime, A0 prime is the averaging operator for the biogroup W prime. So we have this expression, and it is a sum over all the residual subspaces of G prime, which are in standard position. Which are in standard position. So you put them, it should be a standard, the constant roots on that pole space should be a standard levy, and you take the center dominant. And then we take an initial point which is very high up in the direction which is orthogonal to the roots of G prime in the positive direction. So we call that initial point. So we call that initial point P L infinity, and that's where we start this integral. And then we have to go down to the center, and we will pick up poles as we do that. And this is exactly what Merglin did in the classical case. Now, the kernel that I wrote here, this partially symmetrized kernel, has a very nice expression. If you work it out, it is two averaging. Two averaging operators of your palinear functions multiplied by some quotient of r vectors. And we call that first factor sigma prime because it is a sum over the w prime and the second factor we call sigma of phi. So we move the in the initial integrals, we move the base point phi at infinity to the center. Infinity to the center along a generic curve. And yeah, then we want to make at the center this symmetrization for the full bile group, which fixes that center. And there is a theory, and that is already using quite some tricks and computer calculations, that this first initial interval from P L infinity to the center. P L infinity to the center is holomorphic. That means you can move the contours and this sigma prime psi sigma phi expression is holomorphic along that. But of course, you have also the omega, the algebraic part, the omega L here in the formula, and that will pick up some poles. And so you start an algorithm like this because you pick up poles and then you do. Because you pick up poles and then you do the same thing. You get a pole space at an initial point. So, this sigma L is this interval here, this segment here, and you meet, it intersects with some pole space in between. You get an initial point, and then, well, depending on what kind of pole space it was, you need to do something. If it is a subspace of a residual space, that means there is a residual subspace. There is a residual subspace such that the tempered part of the pole is in the tempered part of that residual space, then we have to move that initial point to the center of that space, of that pole space M. So then there is no choice. If it is not sub-residual, then moving to the center will get you in all sorts of trouble and you don't need to do it, it will turn out. So we move to something that you look what you received. You look what you received as integrals, that you obtained as integrals in prior stages of the algorithm. And if you see that you had already this space up to a W prime transformation, everything is W prime invariant a priori, then you just move to a cleverly chosen point in that set. You map, of course, the point to your space M using W prime and then Using W prime, and then you have to choose it so that it is close by, in some sense. So you need to find a clever way to do it, not to generate too many poles in between. And so we get something that stops in finitely many steps, and the cascade is then all the pairs of a segment and a pole space M that you obtain in this way, representing, well, we take for... Well, we take for every W prime orbit of pole spaces, we take one representing space and we put all the segments in that space. So that's called the cascade. And well, something to note here, it's very important that if you have a pole space, which is a simple pole, which means that the order is zero, then the integrals are much easier to handle than the general case. So in general, the integrals look like something like this. The integrals look like something like this: you have a base point plus i times vm truncated of some residue datum of order omega m. So, this involves all sorts of normal derivatives of your function sigma prime psi sigma phi. But if the order is zero, then it simplifies. It's just some residue of your form, omega m, times the restriction of this product, and that second is. And that second part is much easier to handle. In the cascade, we, in general, have up to five levels. So you have to repeat this five times until it stops. For classical cases, it stops always after two steps. And you get pole spaces also of higher order, up to order three for E8. And then there is the set of And then there is the set of points where the function sigma prime psi sigma phi is holomorphic. That we call the admissible set. So a cascade is called admissible if there exist subsets in all pole spaces in the cascade, which are non-empty closed convex sets. The function should be holomorphic on that set plus I times VL. The initial pole spaces that we had from the induction principle that McGlen used, and then the points at infinity, they are admissible. For the residual spaces, the center is always admissible. And then there is a very important compatibility condition saying that if you have a child of a pole space in your cascade, so the segment, there is a segment that intersects a pole hyperplane. That intersects a pole hyperplane in the pole space. Then, if you take the admissible set of the big space and intersect with the child, then you get something contained in the admissible set of the child. That's a very important condition or property for inductive for the induction argument. Now, here is the theory: there exists an admissible cascade again for E8. Again, for E8, pending certification of the admissibility of the centers of certain lines, it's one W orbit, 10 W prime orbits, where we have to come up with additional arguments. But the line is very simple in some sense, because it is order zero and it is only one singular, which means that we surely can decide it. It's not a difficult line. Such that we can move. such that we can move all the for all pole spaces the base point to a single point B L which is admissible and for the sub-residual cases it is close to the center without creating new residues and such a movement is not guaranteed by only the admissibility of the cascade because if the order of a pole space If the order of a pulse space is bigger than one, then, well, the admissibility is not enough to be able to move your contour, because it's not the restriction of the functions that you are looking at, but it is these normal derivatives which throws everything off the rails. But fortunately, we found a cascade that with almost no exceptions. No exceptions has the property that if the order is positive, you are directly met at the center. And this is something that also Merglin notes in her paper for the classical cases, that very often, if a pole space is not residual there, it's always met at the center. This is something related to that. And well, there are only three exceptions for E8, of course, always E8, and two of them are. And two of them are easy to deal with. One is not. It is a residual line of type E7A4, so it is five times singular. And it is order one. But then you can see, if you use the results of Barbers in Chubotaru, that the potential critical pulse, which you can estimate only very roughly because it is an order one space, but you An order one space, but you can still say enough to see that it is completely disjoint from the strip where you can have unitary representations. And so there cannot be poles in the region that you are worried about. And now there is comparison. So you can feed to XB just an ordinary paleolinar function. And because we have the uniqueness statement of the local. Uniqueness statement of the local residue distributions, we know that it will compute also if you use the contour, the contours in the cascade C, it will compute for you the same residue distributions. And now you can compare with what you did for the Eisenstein series. And that gives you quite powerful results. You see that the contributions of all the non-sub-residual pulse bases, that they will cancel. So you don't need to move the points to the center. Need to move the points to the centers, but once you move them all together, then you can see that they have to cancel each other, these contributions, before going to the center. And that really makes the cascade manageable. And you can see that the sums of the local results at the centers has this additional symmetry for the full symmetrization over the full bio group WC. Biogroup W C. So that should be a W sub C. So it is the fixator in W of C, but not only W prime, which you put in. And then if you have that, then you can rewrite your formula easily and see that indeed the inner product formula for the pseudo-Eisensteins is given by the desired formula, the same formula on the same measure space that we had for the normalized pseudo-Eisenstein series. pseudo-Isenstein series. But again, there is for E8 there is one biogroup orbit of lines that we still need to check something for, but I'm optimistic we can. Okay, happy birthday, Bill.
