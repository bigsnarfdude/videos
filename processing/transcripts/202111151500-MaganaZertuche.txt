Okay, thank you for the introduction. So, I am a PhD student at the University of Mississippi, and I'm gonna talk a little bit about some kind of a little bit of a review of some of the how ring dump fitting is being currently done, as well as some of my latest work on this. Let me see. Let me see. So, as most of you have seen, here I have shown the extrapolated waveform for GW150914, the first binary black hole detection event. And in the orange box, you see the inspiral part of the waveform, which is usually calculated using post-Nichonian theory. As you get closer to the merger and including the merger, you need to use to solve Einstein's equations by using numerical relativity. By using numerical relativity, and after the collision of these two black holes, you want to use perturbation theory to be able to understand the dynamics, and you can get the final spin and mass of your black holes. So, my research mainly focuses on this, on this part of the waveform, which is known as a raindown. Now, this raindown can be mathematically described in the following way. So, on this, in the first equation, you see on the left-hand side, our You see on the left-hand side are an elliptical waveform in bonded coordinates. So, you hear is a retarded time and it has some angle dependence. Now, the ring down is a superposition of sinusoidals, of decaying sinusoidals. So you can express it instead of with sines and cosines, you can also express it with this exponential factor. And in this exponential factor, you will notice that there is a omega. There is a omega L prime mn, and this is what we call the quasi-normal mode frequency. And I was talking about how you can decompose your waveforms as a superposition of modes. So here I want to emphasize that the plus and the minus signs on your class-normal mode frequencies and your class-normal mode amplitudes denote whether you're looking at what we call the pro-grade or the retrograde solutions of this mode. So if you look at the prograde solutions, These modes. So, if you look at the prograde solutions, those are the modes that are excited when you are co-rotating with in the same direction as your black hole spin. While if you look at the retrograde, so the minus sign, you are counter-rotating with your black hole spin. So depending on your system, these modes can become very important or have a lesser effect. For example, in systems where the black hole spin is anti-aligned with the angular momentum, the retrograde modes or this retrograde Retrograde modes or these retrograde frequencies are going to become more important for your model. The second thing to note here is that I've depicted the spheroidal basis in this top equation, and I will show you in the next slide where that comes from. But the quasi-normal mode frequencies that we are getting from an equation that we are solving for, they are complex frequencies. So when you So, when you have complex frequencies, this spheroidal basis is no longer a complete basis, and therefore we choose to express our spheroidal basis in terms of spherical harmonics, as you can see below here. But to go from one basis to the other, you also get these capital C's, which are called the spherical-spheroidal coefficients. So, it tells you about this mixing between one basis and the other. Between one basis and the other. So, the way that you are getting all of these equations is that, so from Tokoski's equation in his 1973 paper, you get a master equation that tells you about the, it describes the dynamical black hole perturbations of rotating black holes. And this is a set of second-order linear partial differential equations. Fortunately, Fortunately, they are separable. So you can separate, for example, into the radial equation and the angular equation. And those are pretty difficult to solve in the sense that people have used something called Liever's method, which is a continued fraction technique to be able to solve for both of these equations. However, in some recent work by Kuk and Selotsky and some recent work that And some recent work that I've been doing, we instead use spectral eigenvalue method decomposition for the angular part of the equation. It's a much faster method to use. And while you are solving for these equations, you not only solve for the quasi-normal mode frequencies, but at the same time, you are able to solve for these spherical-spheroidal mixing coefficients, these C's that I mentioned before. So you are getting a two-foot one by using that method. Now, the fact that we can Now, the fact that we can solve Tukolski's equations and we can get our quasi-normal remote amplitudes, as you see in the equation below, you're able to essentially find the solutions for this part of the expression. You can also find your mixing coefficients from that method, and you can decompose it in your bases. So, the only thing that you have left here to find an answer to is these amplitudes of your quasi-normal modes. Plus in our modes. And in order to find the solution to those amplitudes, since they do not fall out of Tukolsky's equation, you need to look at numerical relativity and compare your analytical waveforms to numerical relativity waveforms in order to be able to fit for these amplitudes. There is no equation that just gives you the amplitudes. And that is a little bit more difficult than it sounds, but that is the main idea. Main idea. A second part of looking at raindown and modeling raindown is to take account not just the multiple modes that one can model, but also the waveform that you're looking at. So typically we look at the extrapolated strain, and this is again GW5914 that I showed earlier, but this is actually not the correct waveform that we want to use. Waveform that we want to use. What we want to use instead is this characteristic Cauchy evolution waveform. So the difference between these two waveforms is the following. So for extrapolated waveforms, which are the waveforms you find, for example, in the SXS catalog, you take your binary black hole system and you look at specific radii away from that waveform. Now, if you take two Now, if you take two world tubes at different radii, you can interpolate within those world tubes and then extrapolate after you make a fit to future null infinity. So you are not solving Einstein's equations throughout time, but you're just solving Einstein's equations at specific world to radii or boundaries. And then extrapolating. For the CCE waveforms, what you're doing instead is you are taking Is you are taking some initial data on your world tube radius, but then you are evolving over time to future null infinity. So you're actually evolving Einstein's equations throughout. So in a way, this is the more correct method to use. Now, one thing that you will also notice is that your waveform seems to be shifted upwards, and that is due to a memory effect. A memory effect. So, when you actually use CCE waveforms, you have this memory effect that is intrinsically accounted for because you are solving Finns' equations, while for the extrapolated waveform, since it's sort of an approximation, you are not resolving the memory. Now, one of the questions that we're interested in is how does this affect aquas normal mode? Because clearly, it's shifting the ring down upwards. It's shifting the ring down upwards, but what other effects does it have? So, this is the waveforms that we are using, and they are publicly available in the SXS catalog. However, right now, I think there are only 14 families of waveforms that have been extracted using CCE. So, just a different method. But, why do we care about this? Why do we care about looking at ring down? Well, the main thing. Looking at ringdown? Well, the main thing is that ringdown studies give us a very nice way to understand the binary black hole systems. So we can use perturbation theory and calculate this final mass and final spin of a remnants. And they're pretty straightforward calculations in a sense. And on the other hand, we have the inspiral of a waveform. So if you start looking just as the inspiral phase of a numerical relative. Phase of a numerical relativity waveform, you have the initial masses and the initial spins of the system, you have your initial data, but you can actually infer something about the final products of this in spiral, of this merger. So you can compare the inspiral part of the waveform and the parameters it predicts, the final parameters they are predicting, and you can compare it to what the final parameters are from protruding. Parameters are from perturbation theory. So, in a way, it is a very nice way to do a test of GR. The second motivation behind these kind of studies are that third-generation detectors and beyond, like LISA, will be sensitive to ring-down frequencies, to a lot more ring-down frequencies that one can currently resolve with LIGO. So, LIGO right now can essentially resolve one frequency, and you can argue whether it can resolve Whether it can resolve more, but this is going to become very, very clear in the future. So, we want to be able to model this ring down very well. And the third motivation for doing this is that there has been a lot of work recently in trying to do ring down fitting. There have been people who have looked at the spherical spheroidal mixing coefficients using that instead of the spheroidal basis, they use a spherical basis. Basis, they use a spherical basis. So you have to take that into account. There have been a lot of papers on overtones, taking into account different overtones. So your quasi-normal frequencies that are labeled by L and M, those are your regular angular numbers, while N is what we call your overtone number. So these overtones, if you take overtones of the same mode, they have shorter dampening times, but they are still important to include. They are still important to include at, for example, at early times of your ringdown model. And I will show the effects of overtones on ringdown modeling. And also a lot of papers have started looking at retrograde modes. And I've listed at the bottom a few of these papers that have looked at either one of these effects or a combination of these effects. There are a lot more papers, but there's just not enough space to put them. And so one of the things that motivates us. Of the things that motivates us is that we want to be able to do to fit to make ring down models with all of these effects being taken into account. But we also want to fit for multiple modes because most of the waveform models that are used today or approximants essentially use just a 2-2 mode. There are a few that have started to include two other modes like the 3-3 or the 4-4 mode. But of course, for different systems, different modes are going to be coming. Systems, different modes are going to become important. So you cannot just by hand start picking modes. And additionally, we want to see the effect of overtones on different systems. So how many overtones do you need to include? And so this is some work that has been recently done with my advisor and a couple of collaborators. And another thing that we have done that has not been done before is we look at Done before is we look at we fix a DMS frame. So, what that means is we look at the frame of reference that we're working in, and we do realize that the DSXS waveforms, so the numerical relativity waveforms, are not in the same frame of reference in which the quasi-normal mode equations are written in. And I will expand on both of these two big projects in the next few slides. Few slides. So, the main questions that we really want to answer. So, the first one is a million-dollar question, which is which modes are important to include in these ring-down models? So, we know that for different systems, whether you have, you know, spin anti-aligned, you have precession, you have eccentricity, and how does that affect the dynamics of your remnant parameters? How does that affect raindrop? And also, what about mass ratio? So, mass ratio, we'll probably have a Ratio will probably have a very important effect when you start getting into extremely high mass ratio mergers. How does that affect the quasar normal modes that you're trying to model? And so the second question is, okay, so we can pick which modes are important, but how do we pick them? So that is a big question that we are trying to answer. Additionally, how well can one actually model this? How well can one actually model these higher modes? At what point is numerical error going to mess up your fits? And what are some of the effects that DMS transformations have on waveforms? And what effects do they have on classonormal modes? So I will expand on all of these points above. So the first thing I want to talk about is modeling multiple ring non-modes. So what we have done in recent work is we've created a greedy Work is we've created a greedy algorithm that's based on the power contained per mode. So, this greedy algorithm takes a few inputs. You give it a numerical relativity waveform of your choice. You tell it the final mass and spin of that numerical relativity waveform, which is found in the metadata. You pick the time at which you want to start modeling ring down. And this is a very ambiguous point because. Ambiguate because there is no defined time where ringdown begins and merger ends. There is no clear cutoff. So, what we do is we start our model a little bit before, you know, sometimes the peak of the waveform, and you look at every single time, essentially at time slices throughout this. So, since we do not know if you know ring down begins at peak, we don't want to start all of our models just. Don't want to start all of our models just to sick, so we look over time. Additionally, to be able to model to do multi-mode fitting, you want to pick a fraction of unmodeled power in your waveform. So what that means is how much power do you want to model, do you want to capture in your model? Are you okay with capturing 50% of the power or do you want something that's over 99% of the power? 99% of the power. So, for example, for LIBO right now, it's not too important to be able to capture a lot of the power since you need higher modes. But as you start using, as you know, the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA go online, you really want to be able to capture all these powers that are in the ring downs of your systems. Additionally, you can tell this algorithm how many, the maximum number of How many the maximum number of modes that you want it to model? So maybe you just want to pick top five modes, but maybe you want to pick the top 50 modes. You tell it whether you want to include overtones and retrograde modes. And again, retrograde modes, it really depends on the system that you're looking at, how important they are. So, this is how the algorithm works. I'm just going to give you a quick analysis. So, you take your Analysis. So you take your numerical relativity waveform and you decompose it into different LM modes, into spherical harmonics. You look at all of these spherical harmonics and you rank them by the power in each harmonic. So essentially, you see which modes are the loudest in your waveform. And once you pick the loud, once you rank your modes by the loudest, the 2-2 usually being at the very top. The 2-2 usually being at the very top, you take the lowest overtone number. So, in this case, the n number here. You take the lowest overtone number because that is thought to contain the most power. And we include in this case both prograde and retrograde modes just to use both parts of this solution. So, what you want to do is you want to take your loudest mode, take the lowest overtone, The lowest overtone, and then you look at you try to minimize the residual power. So you take your numerical relativity waveform, say your H22, and you take your analytical waveform that models just the 2,2-0 mode, just subtract them, and you look at the residual power that has not yet been modeled. By looking then at this, by minimizing over this residual power, Residual power, you get your class normal mode amplitudes. So it's a feeding procedure. And once you get those amplitudes, you can build it into your analytical model. So you essentially solve for the script A's that I showed in the equation. And once you solve for these script A's that minimize your residual power, you have your fit, your model. Now, you also want to calculate the fraction of a model power that I mentioned before. Model power that I mentioned before. So you decide how much power you want your model to capture. And if that one mode captures enough power, then you are done and you can go ahead and calculate the mismatch between numerical relativity and your analytical model. However, if you say, okay, that only captures, you know, 20% of the power, I want to add more modes, then you go back to the first step and you. To the first step, and you take the second loudest mode, where the second loudest mode can be the next overtone. So, for example, 2, 2, 1, or maybe it can be another mode like 2, negative 2 or 3, 3, and so on. And so, you do this until you find you're able to capture as much power as you want in your waypoint. So, this is how it works. Now, to show you all of this in action, so that's kind of like the code perspective of it. Code perspective of it. Now, to give it more of a physical meaning, I want to show you just some results that we have using the waveform SXSBA4305. And this waveform corresponds to GW150914. So a lot of the ringdown studies that you will see from the past few years, they have focused on this specific waveform just because it was the first detection of. First detection of the binary black hole system. So if you just take a model that fits for the 2,2-0 mode, the fundamental 2-2 mode, your ring-down waveform can only capture 30% of the power. Again, this is just for the specific waveform, but it's not going to vary too much over parameter space. If you instead start including overtones, so a lot of So, a lot of studies by like Giesler et al., for example, they looked at the importance of adding overtones to your model. You will notice that you are able to actually fit for about 50% of the power of your ringdown waveform. And so, you know, you're still missing half of the information in ringdown. So, even though it does, adding overtones does have a very good add a lot to the model, it's not. A lot to the model, it's not the end at all of multi-mode of ring-down fitting. So, what we do instead is we use the greedy algorithm that I described earlier, and you arbitrarily choose five modes ranked by power. And by modeling just five modes, you can already capture 98% of the power. So, take into account that these two, two, zero through seven over two model, that's actually using eight different modes. Actually, using eight different modes, right? So you have two, two, zero, two, two, one, up until two, two, seven. So you're actually fitting for eight modes. But by wisely, more wisely choosing just five modes, you're able to get more physics out of your model. And if you want to, say, choose 25 modes, then you can recover over 99% of the power. So this shows how it's important not just to include overtones or, for that matter, prograde and retrograde. For that matter, prograde and retrograde modes, but you want to really add more modes to your models. Now, I'm going to talk about the second part of this work, which is BMS transformations. So this is a little bit more abstract, a more abstract concept. And for that, I want to go back to this waveform, this comparison between the two waveforms. And I told you that this is a more correct waveform to use, and that you do notice there seems to be. And that you do notice there seems to be a shift in the ring down, well, around the merger part of the waveform. And the reason why you see this shift, which has been exaggerated, by the way, in this picture, is that there is a super translation that's happening. Now, what does that mean? And what does that mean for quasi-normal modes? So, the formal definition of this BMS group, which is the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, it is the symmetric group for The symmetry group for asymptotically flat spacetimes L future null infinity. And if you want to look at it in the algebraic way, it's just a semi-direct product of the Lorentz transformations and the super translations. So for Lorentz, the Lorentz group, you have your boost and you have your rotations. But these super translations are a group that contain the Poincaré, you know, your typical space-time translations. Typical space-time translations, but it's a kind of like an extended group, a much richer structure that is infinite dimensional. So there has been a lot of work by Keith Meetman on these BMS frames, both for the inspiral part of the waveform and for the ring down portion. So you have this, what we call these super translations, and this And these super translations are what cause essentially show the effect that you see your ring down, your whole waveform shifted towards the end. And the reason why this happens is the following. So you have your binary black hole system, say you have numerical reactivity, and you evolve your binary black hole system. And as your black hole is evolving, at some point it merges, it imparts some sort of kick, and you have this super translated. Translated remnant black hole. And this super translation is what shows up in the waveform. Now, when Tokowski was solving his, was writing his master equation, he was working in a different frame of reference. And this frame is the center of mass of the remnant black hole frame, but it's also called the super rest frame. So he was ignoring any past history that this black hole had, and he was just perturbing this black hole in its rest. Perturbing this black hole in its superrest frame. But of course, we know that astrophysically, remnant black holes do have a history. And so it's this history that shows that you have this super translation. So you cannot work, you cannot analyze ringdown correctly if you're working in the wrong frame of reference. So what we do is we take our Our, we take our CCE waveform, so our super translated waveforms, and we actually super translate them back to what is called a super rest frame. And that's where we do our quasi-normal mode analysis. And I'm going to show you what effects this has. So here, sorry, I have lost my legend. In this blue solid line, we have the H20 mode of our CCE waveform. Of our CCE waveform. And the first thing you will notice is that at once, on the x-axis, you have the time. So what we call here zero is the peak of the waveform. So as you go with time, you will notice that your waveform does not end at zero. But we know that your gravitational waveform should decay to zero at infinite time. K to zero at infinite time. So there's already something weird going on here, right? Then we say, okay, well, let's try to build a quasi-normal mode ringdown, quasi-normal mode model and try to fit for the amplitudes and model this H2C remote. And what happens is that the dotted, the dashed orange curve is our quasi-normal mode model, and you can see that it has a very hard. And you can see that it has a very hard time trying to fit at early times. And then it just kind of looks like it just gives up and decays down to zero. Now, the thing is that we do want things to decay down to zero. That's how they should be. So the fact that your numerical relativity waveform or your CCA waveform is not decaying to zero tells you that you're working in two different frames. There's this whole shift upwards. And on the lower plot, you can look at the resistive. On the lower plot, you can look at the residual of numerical relativity waveform with our analytical waveform that has up to seven overtones, apart from the fundamental overtone. So there's something wrong. Now, one thing I will mention is that for this memory effect, this displacement memory, the 2-0 mode is the mode that has the most memory. So that's why this effect is so large. If you look at different modes, this effect will not be as large. Effect will not be as obvious. On this slide, we take the same numerical relativity to zero mode waveform, but we super translate it so that it's in the super rest frame. And once we do that, we get this blue line, and then we build our model according to this super translated waveform. And you will notice that our quasi-normal mode ring down fit actually works, and both of them decay down to zero. So now we're Decay down to zero. So now we're in the same frame of reference. So now we can start analyzing these waveforms. On the lower plot again, you will see the residual. So you will notice actually there is a big difference between the residual of these two waveforms. Earlier, before super translation, you had residuals of the order of 10 to the negative 2, which are pretty high. But as you move into the correct frame, the BMS frame, you see that your residuals are much smaller. Much smaller. And this red line, I will tell you what that is for in a second. So, why do VMS transformations matter? So, the first thing to note is that these super translations are time translations, but they are angle dependent. You cannot just translate your whole waveform over time without losing some information about the modes. So, to put this mathematically, your time translation is Your time translation is a regular time translation, plus this angle-dependent constant that affects all of it. So you will see that this creates some mode mixing, right? If you're changing, if as you translate your waveform, you have some angle dependence, that's going to matter for the ring down. And to look at the effects of this, you can say, okay, well, how does this time translation or How does this time translation or this super translation how does it affect our strain? Well, it affects it in the following way. So if you super translate your strain, you have this mode mixing effect that comes from the time derivatives of your strain, and it's multiplied by some powers of this alpha variable. And additionally, you get this extra term that is a constant shift. Term that is a constant shift. So if you look now earlier at this plot, if you just take into account the shift only, you get a residual that looks like the red line. So just by taking into account the shift or shifting an R by a constant, you do get better ring-down fitting, but it's not the full correct thing to do. You want to also look at the mode mixing. And so let me just show you some results of what happens when you do multimodal feeding and what happens when you actually move to the correct frame of reference. So in this plot, on the y-axis, we have the fraction of unmodeled power in the news domain. And so the reason why this is in the news domain and not the strain domain is because the news domain is where you have power. You have power, the power of a waveform defined. So it's the it just is more logical to work in a frame where power is defined since we are looking at the unmodel power. And on the x-axis here, you have again your time before and after the peak of the waveform. So if you look at just the solid lines, if you look at the blue one, let's say you pick five modes to model with this gritty algorithm. By modeling five. Algorithm. By modeling five modes over time, you will see that you model about 90-98% of your waveform, depending on when you want to choose your ring down. But as you model more and more modes, you will notice that you actually start being able to capture more and more power in this fits. Now, the dashed lines are essentially. Are essentially, we take the quasi-normal modes at the time equals 20, and we choose those same modes, and we evolve them essentially backwards in time and forwards in time. And we just change the amplitudes. So, one thing you can notice here is that you cannot just take a set of modes and fit the amplitudes whenever you want to. Amplitudes whenever you want to. So, some modes are going to be more important at the beginning, closer to what is considered the merger region. For example, overtones are very important in this phase. However, if you're starting to look at your analysis at later times, those overtones are essentially going to very quickly die off, and you instead want to start adding more LM moments. So, this is kind of just So, this is kind of just to see how it changes over time. Now, if you want to just model five modes, as I said, you can capture 98% of the power in your ring down. But if you want to pick 100 modes and try to make your ring down with 100 modes, you can capture 99.999% of the waveform. So, you can see how it is very important to be able to do multi-mode modeling. And I should mention that the power here. And I shall mention that the power here is over the whole two-sphere. So you're doing all these, you're looking over, you know, over all modes. That's how you're doing your comparisons. And this is kind of a similar plot, but at this point, we are looking at the mismatches because, okay, you know, you say, okay, I'm going to use, I don't know, 20 modes and I'm going to model my ring down. So that should be okay, right? Well, you know, capturing just the power. Well, you know, capturing just the power is not enough to see how well your model actually does. So, we want to look at the mismatch. So, you want to make sure that your analytical model is actually quite close to what numerical relativity tells you it should be. So, at this point, we do a similar analysis where we take 5, 20, 50, and 100 modes, and we look at the mismatch over time of those modes over the full sky. So, sorry, this plot. The full sky. So, sorry, this plot is a little bit busy. You can essentially ignore the dashed lines for now. But if you look at this blue solid line and then follow the orange line to the green line and down to the red, you will notice that the more modes you model, the lower you mismatch. So your waveform is really starting to look like a numerical relativity waveform, which is what we want. And just for comparison, I've plotted two lines, which are a little bit hard. Plotted two lines which are a little bit hard to see. So you have this purple dot dotted line that is just above the blue line. And this line is what your model, the mismatch of your model, if you use just the 2, 2, 0 and the 2 minus 2, 0 modes. If instead you add to those two modes, you start adding overtones, you can lower to this yellow dashed dotted line, you can lower your mismatches quite significantly. Lower your mismatches quite significantly. However, you will notice that still your mismatch is only going down by an order of magnitude or two. So it's not too great. You want your mismatches to be below 10 to the negative 4 or so. So you really need to use multiple, multiple modes to more accurately model your ring them. One thing that you may think about is: okay, well, at some point, RN, you're going to just start overfitting. Just start overfitting, and the answer is yes. So, the test that we did to make sure that we are not overfitting, we found we took the highest two resolutions of this numerical relativity waveform, and we looked at essentially the numerical error. And the numerical error lies below this gray solid curve. So, this is where numerical error starts to dominate. And you will notice that all of our That are all of our mismatches are actually lying above that. So we are not worrying about overfitting in this case. Now, okay, so it seems like we can get, you know, we can capture a lot of power and our waveforms are starting to look very much like numerical relativity, but how well can you actually recover parameters? Because you can make many things look like numerical relativity, but if you're not recovering the correct parameters, then you're not doing. Parameters, then you're not doing something correct. So, this is a third check that we wanted to do. So, how well can you recover these parameters? And this plot has been reproduced in multiple papers that look at overtone number and retrograde modes. And so, in my recent paper, we also started doing multi-mode fitting to this. So, if you look at the okay, so I will mention this plot looks at 86 simulations from a surrogate model. From a surrogate model that is called NR Hybrid 3DQ8. And when you look at all of these different waveforms and try to recover the parameters, the masses and the remnant masses and the remnant spins, you will notice that using just the 2,2-0 mode, which is this blue dashed line, you get an error that is on the order of magnitude of 10 to the negative 1. So you still get pretty high errors by just including that one mode, which is. Just including that one mode, which is why we want to be able to include more modes. So, as you increase the number of overtones, you get this orange and then green dashed curves. And here on the epsilon axis, we have actually put the median error for all of these 86 waveforms. So you can see how it changes as you add more overtones. So, including more overtones does change significantly, but if instead you add four But if instead you add four remotes, at that point you can lower by essentially another order of magnitude the errors in these in the recovering of these parameters. So just to one last thing to mention. So these delta m's and these delta chi's, the way they're calculated, is that we take the masses that numerical relativity gives us, and then we take the masses, the mass that our Koisanova mode model gives us. Quasinova mode model gives us, we subtract them, and that's how we get that. So we're looking at the error in that way. And so now to highlight the importance of going to the right super rest frame, we have done an analysis over all 14 waveform families that are available to us at the moment. So if you just look at, let's just look here at the very last column, so GW150914. Which again is the 0305 simulation from SXS. If you look at the mismatches between numerical relativity and our quasi normal mode model using 100 modes, if you use extrapolated waveforms, you get a relatively low mismatch of 10 to the negative 6. If you instead use CC waveforms, you get this red bar that is labeled as none. I need to update the label. I need to update the labels. So, if you just use CCE waveforms, you get much worse mismatches. And this has to do with the memory effect that everything is super translated. So you are actually doing an analysis in the wrong frame of reference. If then you move your waveform to the correct frame of reference, which is called a super-rest frame, you get this blue, blue bar over here. So you will notice that going from extrapolate a waveform to the super-rest. To the superrest CCE waveform, you actually get better mismatches. Now, the difference doesn't look too big in this case because, again, this is just one waveform family. If you look at something like a equal mass system with a super kick, you will notice that you can actually decrease your mismatches by over an order of magnitude. So, it can become more important in different things. And even though the difference. And even though the difference looks kind of small in this strain, it is very important because once LISA and third-generation detectors are up, you're going to need very precise ring-down modeling. So we want to be able to take everything we can into account. And then on the bottom plot, you will just see the same exact thing, but now we are in the news domain. So the first derivative of the string. And so And so, since this workshop is on machine learning, I want to kind of tie this in. And so, one thing where you can use machine learning with Ringdown is that you can build surrogate models that actually use Gaussian process regression, so GPR. And there are a couple of ways that one can do this. So, you can model waveforms for all of parameter space. You can just get a bunch of, you know, do a bunch of ring-down models. You know, do a bunch of ring-down modeling to fill your parameter space and then interpolate between these parameters and try to make a fit using Gaussian process regression. Another thing that you can do, which is actually something that we're going to look at next, is that you can map the parameters that numerical relativity tells you about your black hole system to the remnant parameters like amplitudes, masses, and spin. Amplitudes, masses, and spins from your class normal mode model. And you can make predictions about what your remnant parameters will be if you have the amplitudes and the masses of this. So essentially, you can use Gaussian process regression to make these predictions. And I don't know how much. And I don't know how much work. I know there is a paper by Finch et al. that looks at using building surrogate models for ring down. And besides that, I'm not aware of any other paper that does that. But this is something that definitely we want to be able to do because once we build a surrogate model of ringdown, you can attach it to an in-spiral and merger waveform model. And then you can just use that when LISA and these third generation detectors go. And you know, these third-generation detectors go online, and just for my conclusions: so, I hope that I've convinced you that multi-mode ring-down modeling is necessary in order to be able to take full advantage of the data that the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer and Lisa are going to give us. By being able to pick these multiple modes in a smart way, you can actually increase. You can actually increase your mismatches by 10 to the five orders of magnitude. And also by working in the super-rest frame, so by translating your waveform to be in the correct frame of reference, you can gain another five orders of magnitude in the mismatches of these models. And so being able to use multi-mode fitting with the BMS fixing, building a surrogate model using Gaussian products. A surrogate model using Gaussian process regression and then tying it into the you know an earlier part of a waveform, you will be able to actually do very, hopefully, very good analysis on future detections. And that is all. Thank you Thanks, Lorena, about the wonderful talk. Lorena, that was a wonderful talk. Uh, are there any questions in the room or in the chat? Let me quickly check. I don't see any questions in the chat. Oh, there's a question from Deb. Hi, Lorena. Sierra. Nice talk. It's exciting to see it. I have a question. Did you by any chance, I don't think this was part of your study, but did you notice if as you change the parameters for those 86 hybrid waveforms you guys were looking at, surrogate waveforms? Looking at surrogate waveforms. Did the amount of modes you needed to do a good fit change? Was it always a similar number? I was just thinking that the more interesting the parameter space is, my naive expectation is you would need more modes. Yeah, so we haven't, that's another thing that's in the works. And so we have not looked at specific, I mean, the only black hole system we've looked at very closely is this TW15 and 914. But we do want to start doing studies on how. Doing studies on how essentially trying to model for different waveforms families change, well, first change which modes are going to become important because the three, for example, I think the 3-3 mode is going to become much more important in some cases than in others. And we want to see, you know, we want to look at all of this waveform specifically and the effects that it also has on specific modes. Also, it has on specific modes. So, one thing that we've looked at that I have here, which doesn't really fully answer your question, but it's sort of related, is we've taken this GW50914 waveform and we decomposed it into different modes. And we looked at the power, the unmodeled power in each specific mode and how it changes when you look at the super rest frame. So, essentially, what we want to do is we want to do this sort of analysis, but with other. Sort of analysis, but with other families, but we have not done that yet. And we also want to do what you mentioned, but with retrograde modes for spin anti-aligned systems. There's a lot of work to be done in this area. Okay, so Lauren, I was also wondering one thing. So, Lorena, I was also wondering one thing. Are you planning to have these things imported into LAL suite at some point of time so that we can do injection studies or studies with these kind of waveforms? Yes. The ones that are much better ring down fits? Yeah, so I haven't thought about putting it into lawsuits. So I'm no longer in Lego, so I don't know if I can still do that. But yeah, that, so like I said, there's so much to look at, and one thing you'll be. So much to look at, and one thing it would be nice to do is to inject these waveforms and see the recover parameters, how well you can recover these parameters. I know Lily Sun is interested also in doing something like this. And we just talked recently about doing that in the future. But yeah, I mean, I will be happy, you know, this can be useful integrated into LIGO and the lawsuit. I'll be more than happy to have. Be more than happy to have this there. Yeah, I think it will be really good. And from outside, yes, you can still contribute into LASIE, I think. It'll be good because in O4 will have higher sensitivity. So using better ring-down waveforms is important. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll talk to Lucian about maybe how quickly we can do this. How do the results depend on where you start the ring down? So you mentioned that you don't know exactly when the ring down starts. So do the multi-mode fitting changes if you change the starting time? Yeah, so that's exactly, yeah, so that's kind of what we wanted to start exploring with this like dashed versus versus solid line. Um, versus solid lines, so we said, Okay, what if you just take the same set of waveforms, just naively, sorry, the same uh set of quasi-normal modes and just look at them at different times and look at how the amplitude change over times. And indeed, you see that you know, it becomes less jagged, uh, but it's not a it, I will say it does really depend on the starting time, and that is. Depend on the starting time. And that is one study that still needs to be done. When do we want to start this modeling? Like, for example, if we include it into last week, maybe that's something we can do, right? We can keep the start time of the model as a variable, but what range of start times seem to give more accurate parameter recovery? And that's something that still. And that's something that still needs to be done. So, this is the first time actually that this multi-mode bidding has been done greedily. And it's the first time that BMS fixing has been done for ringdown. So, we just opened the whole can of worms. And there's really a lot to still explore in this area. Okay, I think we should thank Lorena once again, and we have the Once again, and we have the next talk.
