Originally, Sergei asked me to give a review of the use of monopoles in quantum field theory, and I got so scared I almost refused to participate in the conference. But then he was kind enough to offer me something more modest and maybe more creative. So I'll try to talk about what I know as opposed to what I'm Know as opposed to what I was supposed to learn in a week. So the ambition of this program is to use the knowledge accumulated in quantum supersmatic gauge theory in four dimensions. So this is something which comes from So, this is something which comes from physics, but I will review what it means mathematically to say something precise about the geometry of the moduli spaces of monopoles and instantons on spaces with translational symmetries, but with also with some periodicity. So, unlike the classical case of monopoles on R3. On R3. Here, my main interest would be on monopoles on the product of R2 cross S1. And I will allow certain Dirac type singularities. Or I will be talking about the instant dance on the product of a plane and a two torus. And in this case, I don't need to allow for any similarities. For any singularities. And the gauge group for this monopoly problems would be the general ADE-type simple Lie group, which in my story will arise as actually as a Machete dual tool to a finite subgroup. Finite subgroup of SU2. So this is, of course, by now a very familiar story. So I will have kind of a two-column story, not unlike the mirror symmetry story. So this is something of along the Of along the lines of the four-dimensional version of the mirror symmetry, where on one side you have the enumerative or topological story, and on the other side you have a geometric story. Have a geometric story. I recall in the usual mirror symmetry, which I will call the two-dimensional mirror symmetry, the left-hand side is in the simplest form. Of course, there are various ramifications and dressings, but in the simplest form, the left-hand side is the Gromov-Witten story, Gromov-Witten theory. Gromov-Witten theory. So it's counting holomorphic curves, so pseudo-holomorphic curves. That is to say, very roughly speaking, solutions of the equations describing holomorphic maps. So these are like non-linear versions of Cauchy-Riemann equations. Cauchy-Riemann equations, and we are counting them. That is to say, we assign certain numerical invariants to the moduli spaces of solutions of this equation and then organize them into a generating function. So, the generating function depends on some parameters, and then so beta. So, beta, for example, could be the degree of the curve. There could also be a special parameter for the genus of the curve, and so on, so forth. So, you organize them on the generating function, and the result you get a function of continuous parameters, the generating parameters. And on the right-hand side, you get the theory of variations of Hodge structure. Hodge structure and the manifold in which the curves lie on the left-hand side and the manifolds in which you study the variations of Hoch structure are not identical. The relation between them is pretty complicated. And on the right-hand side, this function, the same function z of t arises as some kind of a, it's related. It's related to the to the periods of our let's say of so in the simplest case of Calabriao manifolds so you on the dual side you study the periods of the holomorphic top degree form over various cycles and out of these periods you And out of these periods, you can form a generating function using the Lagrangian nature of the image of the period map. So for many years, I've been working with various collaborators on the high-dimensional versions of this duality, where on the left-hand side, We would be counting the solutions of the instant on equations with various simplifications so we count so the challenge is to say what what's what's So, what is first of all the proper form of the genetic function, and what is the object on the right-hand side? So, what kind of higher-dimensional version of the period map or some analog of that you would encounter. And so, things which one finds along this. lines along this this uh this route are the uh things like uh special special uh kalar geometry algebraic integrable systems hapical geometry and various points Various quantizations. So, one lesson which seems to be emerging from these studies is that the problem of finding the hypercalometric on some of the spaces which we will talk about seems to be related to the problem of quantizing. These manifolds in one of the complex structures. So there is some relation between the, let's say, Planck constant and twister coordinates. So that's what we will arrive at this conclusion in the end. Okay, so are there any questions so far? Okay, good. So, let me review the enumerative story. So, this is this is a generalization of dots. Of Donaldson theory. So, Donaldson theory uses moduli spaces of SU2 instantrons on mostly compact four-manifolds to produce invariants of smooth structure of four-manifolds. Here, we will not be interested in general four-manifolds. We will be working on Euclidean space. On Euclidean space R4, and we will be studying the modular spaces of solutions of so this is the framed moduli well it's modular space of framed instantans framed instant on moduli space Framed UN So it's a it's a space which charge so you can start. So, you can start with instantons on the four-dimensional sphere viewed as the one-point complexification of R4. And so, there you just study, let's say, SUN instantons on means that the curvature is antisolled dual. So, you study SUN instantons on the bundle, SUN bundle over S4 with the second choint class. Second joint class equal to k. And the equivalence relation consists of gauge transformations which are trivial at the fixed point at infinity. So in some sense, with this restriction, you can actually define the space in terms of R4 only by specifying the appropriate asymptotics of the. Asymptotics of the gauge field and the allowed gauge transformations. And with that definition, the resulting space will be actually hypercaler, unlike the standard modulus space, which is not even even dimensional. So the usual modulus space of instantons is, roughly speaking, the quotient of that space by the group SUN. So, this is hypercaler and non-compact. And there is a famous ADHM construction which describes this space as the space of solutions of certain matrix equations, which I will very briefly. I will very briefly recall. So it's a space of matrices. I'm using the Kajima notations where the space K And are the complex vector spaces of dimensions little k and little n. And these matrices are required to obey the certain quadratic equations, which are nothing but the hapical moment maps. And we divide by the we divide by the natural action of the group uk which acts in the by by linear by the linear transformations unitary transformations of the space capital k so this arrangement of matrices and equations are usually summarized by the so-called quiver diagram so this is something which i will use extensively and the usual nomenclature is that the space where Is that the space where the group the symmetry is being divided by, we denote by the circle, and the space where the symmetry could act, but we don't divide by it, is put into square. And so the maps which I just introduced are summarized by these arrows. Okay, and then there are certain conditions which this map are required to obey. In addition to the equations, there are certain open conditions, like stability condition, which is imposed in addition. And that guarantees that given this data, you can construct a non-singular gauge field. And the famous Corygon. The famous Korrigan-Goder construction expresses these operators B1, B2, I, and J in terms of the solutions of Dirac equation in the instant on background. So there are two constructions, direct and reverse construction. Now one can relax some conditions on the matrices to produce a better space, and that's justified. And that's justified on one hand by the fact that in quantum field theory, we're not interested in the space, in the particular points of that space, but we're more interested in being able to integrate over the space certain expressions, which are motivated by quantum field theory. And so, when you integrate, sometimes you can add measure zero locus if you're integrant. locus if your integrand extends to that to that locus and so that's so well that's the story of its own i will not i will not um go there i just say that from now on i'm going to work on a partially compactified space mk in bar which has two descriptions one is the algebraic geometric Metric this is the moduli space of rank n torsion free sheaves on P two, on C P two, which is Now, larger complexification of R4. So, I'm choosing a complex structure on R4. So, this choice is needed to define this partial complexification. And so, we study now torsion-free shifts on the projective plane of rank end. Of rank n of second churn class equals to k equal to k, which are trivial, in fact trivialized on the line at infinity. So they identify it with this vector space n. Which I recall is just that. So here what is used is that on the complex four-manifold, in fact, if this four-manifold admits a complex structure, then the instanton defines a holomorphic structure on the corresponding vector bundle. And so this partial complexification consists. Partial complication consists of allowing the holomorphic bundles to degenerate into torsion-free shifts of the same rank and the same topology. And there is sort of a differential geometric description as of the instantons on non-cumulatives are formed. And so, the parameter of the non-cumulative deformation of R4 is the parameter which enters the modification of the ADHM equations. So, basically, this is how we modify the construction to arrive at this partially compactified space. Partially compactified space. So zeta is related to the non-compactivity parameter theta. Nikita? Yes. So the compactification is for one specific zeta, and as zeta goes to zero, you recover the non-compact one. Is that what you mean? So if zeta goes to zero, what you recover is the so called Ulenbeck compatification. So-called Ullenbeck compactification. It's still partially compactified. So this is a well, you don't include in your condition the non-digital. You don't include in your condition the non-degeneracy condition. So, the way it goes is that the ADHA modulus space is non-compact, period. You can partially compactify it first by just relaxing the stability condition on ADHM data without modifying the equations. And so that will produce this space m tilde. That's that's that gives the Williambeck optification. But that space. Modification. But that space itself is not very convenient to work with. Not that it's too singular, it's not too singular, but just that in computing the integrals, you would like to, I mean, certain regions of that space are more important than others. And the most important region for, I mean, in the approach, which I'm going to review, is the region where the instantons are invariant under the Are invariant under the rotations of R4. And on Lindbeck space, that is just a single point with a very singular neighborhood. So it's hard to do the analysis there. Whereas on the space M bar, which is the Nakajima Gizeker space, it is smooth. So this space is smooth, and so you can do many. Is smooth, and so you can do many, many, many things. Unfortunately, that description only exists for the unitary group, so there is no analog of that nice complication for other gauge groups, whereas the Ulenberg complication exists for any simple group. But well, that's a fact of life. So now I'm going to generalize this little bit. Well, okay, so before I generalize, Okay, so before I generalize, so what is it that one can integrate? So what are the enumeration which one enumeration problems, they consist of computing the integrals over the space kn of the Euler classes, Euler classes of various Natural bundles or even shifts. And so these are this can be constructed. This could be so V could be a cotangent bundle. In this case, this story is called in physics the n equals four. It physics the n equals four superior Miels theory or its close cousin n equals to two star it could be direct sum of the tautological bundles so the space K which was the auxiliary space in the in the DHM construction In ADHM construction, which is in Corrigan-Goddard story, is identified with the space of solutions of Dirac equation. So it's a bundle of the modular space of instantons, and there is an analog of that bundle for the torsion-free shifts for the Gizeker and the Kajimo completification. So you can take several copies of that. Of that bundle and study its Euler class. And because this place is non-compact, all this is only meaningful with some sort of regularization prescription or in equivariant cohomology. And that's the approach which I will take. So this is all done in equivariant cohomology of the group. The group, so the group H, which involves the rotations of R4. Well, of course, the original instanton equations are invariant under the full conformal group. The fact that we singled out the point to infinity reduces it to the group of translations and rotations. And the ADHM data actually. Uh, and the DHM data actually uh requires the spin cover of rotation group, but uh this geese Nikajima complexification requires the choice of a complex structure, and that this reduces the group of rotations to the subgroup to the U2 subgroup. So, this is so this requires identification of R4 with C2. And in addition, we have the gauge group. So that's the group which acts on the framing, on the trivialization at infinity. So this is framing rotation. Infinity. And there are other silly groups, namely, if, for example, if the bundle is consistent. If the bundle consists of several copies of k, so I can view it as a tensor product of k with some multiplicity space, then it would be the unity group acting in its multiplicity space. Or in case of the contangent bundle, there is a U1 group which acts by rotation of the fibers. So in this case, so So, in this case, so that would be the u1 in the n equals to the star case. And so, one defines this integral in the covariant sense and then forms a generating function. So, with some over all k from zero to infinity, with some fugacity, some additional generative parameter for the exactron charge. Instant charge, and that gives us this partition function. More precisely, this is called the instanton partition function. So it's a function. Well, the way I define it, it's actually a formal power series in Q valued in rational functions. On the Lie algebra of the maximal torus of group H complexified. So, more precisely, at kth order of the corresponding, and At kth order of expansion in q, the degree of this rational function, the how to say, the denominator of this rational function is bounded. Because we're integrating over the fine-dimensional space, the denominator is equal to the degree of the denominator is the dimension of the space, and the dimension is the complex dimension. The complex dimension is 2kn. So this is equal to the degree of denominator. And the good theories, and so the theories which I listed are so the good theories are such for which this bundle V has the same rank as the dimension of the space. Of the space so that the sorry, Nikita, is there these rational functions, do they have a Q parameter as well? Are you really getting a polynomial? No, no, it's a sorry, it's a formal power series on Q. Okay. But in fact, it's Uh, but in fact, in fact, it is so for good theory, it is actually a conversion function. It's actually a function of Q and the function on the Lie algebra. It actually is a Meromorphic function. On the Lie algebra of the symmetry group, and it's a function with the finite domain of holomorphicity, of holomorphy in Q. So it's like a modular function. That's the way to think about it. I mean, the simplest case, which is not very interesting physically, is the case of rank one. Rank one. So if n equals one, then this Giesecker compactified modulus space is actually the Hilbert scheme of points on C2. And the simplest generating function which you can define for n equals total star theory turns out to be turns out to be essentially the delicate eta function raised to the funny power m plus epsilon one m plus epsilon two divided by epsilon one epsilon two where epsilon one epsilon two are the elements of the cartan of the rotation group and m Is the covariant parameter for the U1 group acting on the fibers of the quadragent bundle? So, this is the in fact, this is the generating function of various integrals of various chunk classes of the cotagent bundle to the Hilbert scheme of points, to the scheme of Hilbert scheme of points. And so, as you can see, this is the function with finite radius of convergence in Q, and actually, actually, so it has a And actually, actually, so it has a the domain of holomorphic in Q variables is in a disk. So maybe I should be more specific about the meromorphic. So of course, this is not a meromorphic function as far as epsilon 1, epsilon 2 is concerned. And M. This is Meromorphic in. Is meromorphic in the Lie algebra of the maximal torus of the framing group and actually has simple poles at certain walls, which I will not list because I'll run out of time. Okay, so this is the name this So, this is the flavor of this enumerative problem, which one can study. And using localization, one can actually write more or less explicit formula for this function, Z instanton, in terms of the fixed points of the torus section on the modular space of instantons. And so the Z instanton is a sum over Anciples of partitions, also known as Young diagrams. So these are the fix points of the torus of the symmetry group involving the framing rotation and our And our forotation on this modulus basically. So now I want to move on and include a discrete subgroup of SU2 into the story. So there is one way, quick way to do this. So that. So that well, maybe I should say. So I will say some words which are maybe not too familiar, too meaningful, but then I will make it more explicit. I will state explicitly what I mean by that. So the n equals to two star theory, which I recall concerns the study of the Euler class of the quoting bundle. This can be interpreted of studying torsion shifts on C four. C4, so it's a now four-dimensional complex space with support given by a plane inside this four-dimensional complex vector space. So this is C4, and inside I take a plane C2. C2 and this C4 should be viewed as a local model of a collabio of four. So even though we are studying instantons in four real dimensions, this is actually secretly a study of a higher dimensional gauge theory, which in this particular case happens to be concentrated in real dimension four. But somehow this order class of the cotangent bundle has to do with the fact that the deformations of a Lagrangian submanifold. Of a Lagrangian submanifold inside the collab inside the symplectic manifold correspond to the sections of the well, the sections of normal bundle, which are the sections of cotangent bundle. And so that cotangent translates somehow to the cotangent to the modulus space of instantons. So the symmetries, the C star symmetry, which, sorry, the U1 symmetry, which was actually Sorry, the U1 symmetry, which was acting on the fibers of the cotangent bundle, in this picture is interpreted as part of the symmetry of the space. So it's part of the rotations of the ambient C4, which preserve the collabial structure. And so U1 times U1 cross U1 inside U2. Inside U2. So this is the maximal torus of SU4, which acts on C4. So once this is made more precise and understood, one can now modify this construction by allowing the orbifold structure. Namely, one can now, well, one can make the group gamma, this group of SU2, act a different. Professor 2 act in various places, and that way one can define lots and lots of modulus spaces. Historically, actually the first such modular space was actually studied by Kronhaber and Nikajima, who studied instantons on the quotient of C2 mod gamma. But I will study something else. I will study the instantons whose transfer space is C2 mod gamma. So now study. So instatons will still live on R4. So, this is motivated by considerations of string theory. So, this is my code. Well, sorry, not the code. Okay, this is this cross is meant to represent the action of the finite subgroup of SU2. And then there is a transverse space C2 cross the fixed point. And so everything sits inside the singular Calabi L4, which is C2 cross C2 mod gamma. One can actually deform the singularity, one can resolve the singularity, so we'll get some non-contractible two-spheres, and then these sheaves which are These shifts, which are supported on a complex plane, may get somehow deformed into shifts with supports on exceptional cycles inside the resolved C2 mod gamma. But it's actually easier to define the, well, to compute the generating function which I'm going to define using the orbifold construction. Using the orbifold construction. So, what is this orbifolded version of the instant on partition function? Well, we need to construct the machi corresponding to the discrete group gamma. So, its vertices are. So its its ver its vertices are irreusable representations of the group gamma and the edges. They correspond to the multiplicities of the composition of the tensor product of the reducible representation with the defining two-dimensional representation of gamma. So gamma being the subgroup of of SU two, SU two acts on C two, and so gamma has the canonically has a two dimensional representation. Canonically has a two-dimensional presentation. So, given any node of that quiver which corresponds to your useful presentation, you multiply it by C2 and then decompose with some multiplicities. It is well known that these multiplicities are related to the Cartan matrix, and from that you can recover the graph. Sorry. The graph. Sorry. Of course, there is a slight. Well, there is some subtlety here with the doubling of the edges because we're multiplying by two-dimensional representation, which I will sweep under the carpet for now. So here is the example of this graph. Graph for the G-type subgroup. This is all well known. The main point is the following, that we will now define a new moduli space, which will be the product of the vertices. Vertices of my quiver of the moduli spaces which we discussed before. So these modules spaces are the same. I mean, these are the Gizika and Nakajima moduli spaces of various, various corresponding to various ranks and instanton Charges. So this is gamma, and it depends on the vector of exoton charges and the vector of ranks. The ranks have to obey a certain relation which well okay I will so this is the condition of the This is the condition of the theory being good, which is a certain convergence property of this generating function. And that requires these ranks to be proportional to the dimensions of the irreducible representations of gamma. So, the good theory of the type which corresponds to the discrete fine subgroup of SU2. Discrete fine subgroup of SU2 depends on one integer n and we have many generating parameters qi so q corresponds to the vertices which will be the fugacities for the instanton charges. Nikita, when you mean good theory here, do you mean that they are good from a physical point of view or that the partition function That the partition function you're going to get is a function like above? Well, apparently, these properties are related. So, the good theory originated, the term originated from physics requirements. So, this is something which can be defined as quantum field theory. So, in principle, you could define it on a lattice and put it in a computer. And then it has and so good physical theory leads to a reasonable partition function. To a reasonable partition function, which happens to be a function as opposed to the formal power series. If this condition is not obeyed, you can still define this partition function. It will not be a function. It will be formal power series. It will not be convergent. So in a sense, good is not those for which we are currently better at doing it. If they're not good, they're actually problematic in a sense. Right, right. Right, right. They are not hopeless. I mean, I still think about them and play with them. It's just that sometimes the theory which looks bad appears to be a limit of a good theory and a limit in the sense which I probably mentioned. But being good means that it doesn't matter what theory you start with, the limit will be well defined. The limit will be well defined. But if you start with, if you look at a bad theory, it means that you don't know which good theory it came from. There are different good theories it could come from. And so it's like with divergent series. Sometimes you can resum them using Barriol resumation, but sometimes this resumation is not unique. So you need some additional information to define it as a function. And so here it's a similar story. Here it's a similar story. Okay. It turns out that one can actually, by playing with the bundles, which with various parameters, one can actually arrive at what appears to be generalization of this story where instead of the quiver for the Mackay, for the so sorry, sorry, sorry, I should say that. So, sorry, sorry, sorry, I should say that these quivers are the so they coincide with the so-called affine with the with the with Dinking diagrams for the affine Lie algebras and so there are there are A D A hat D hat E hat classifications of those you can define the Define this partition function for any quiver, actually. So the z instant on can be defined for any quiver. I didn't yet explain how. I just explained that this partition function is the sum over the vectors of instanton charges. So the vectors are So, the vectors are integers assigned to the vertices of the quiver. And then we integrate over the modulus space, which is simply the product of the modulus spaces of torsion of reach shifts for each vertex. But the vector bundle, whose Euler class we put here, that vector bundle consists of two things. So it involves the sum. So it involves the sum over the edges and then the homes of the universal shifts assigned to the source and the target of each edge. So these are Holmes in the derived sense. So these are like physically these are like solutions of Dirac equations coupled to the tensor products of Tensor products of two bundles, bundles corresponding to the gauge groups corresponding to the ends, endpoints of the edge. And in addition, you can also have the sum over the vertices. So, this is the analog of the so this is the same thing as the k-space with some multiplicity as in the same. With some multiplicity, as in the single vertex case, as before. So the good theory corresponding to a fine quiver does not allow this piece, but for general quiver, if you relax the condition that the quiver is affine, this can be Can be introduced. So, the condition of the theory being good actually reads as follows: that twice the rank of the gauge group assigned to the vertex should be equal to the sum of all multiplicities of edges connecting to the vertex. Of edges connecting to vertices times the ranks of the corresponding vertices plus the rank of the multiplicity space. And so this equation, it's a famous equation, and it's well known that its solutions are either the quiver corresponds to the affine dinting diagram, and then all m's are equal to zero, and all n's are proportional to the dimensions of irreps. Dimensions of irreps of gamma, or little gamma is an ordinary dinking diagram, and then this multiplicity m is allowed. So these are the two prototypical examples which we discussed in the beginning. So there are two, basically, so there are two, so there are two cases to Two good classes. So the first is where the gamma is affine Lincoln diagram, and the second gamma is Lincoln diagram for the AG Lie group. So in the first case, So, in the first case, all ranks are proportional to linking labels, and in the second case, there are many choices for n, and then m is given by 2 minus the Cartan matrix applied to n. All right, so I'm running out of time. So, I'm running out of time. Let me state a few results. So, the first result, which is my work with Vasily Pestun from many years ago, and I believe the conjecture for the A-type was due to Cherkis Kapuyin. Kapustian, even much earlier. Although, so this is Cherkis-Kapustian work was the brain construction and string theory. And with the work with Peston, it's more or less a mathematical theorem. So we defined the partition function and we made a certain claim about it. So what is the claim? The claim is the following. The claim is the following: that if you take the limit when the equivariant parameters for the rotation group action on R4 go to zero, this partition function with proper normalization actually behaves, has the essential singularity. So it has the exponential asymptotics, just like in the Hilbert scheme example. In the Hilbert scheme example. And the function f is the generating function for the special Kayla geometry. So it's actually generating function for Lagrangian, which arises in the following symplectic story. So, and we have two stories to tell. So, the first case, which was the affine. Case, which was the affine case, consider the moduli space of instantons with the gauge group G. So this is the ADE group corresponding to the quiver. So we study instantons with that group on R2 cross T2 with the instanton charge N. So the N, which was So, the n, which was the rank, the common multiple of the ranks of the gauge groups on this dual side, so this is now this geometric side, translates to the charge of the instant on. And so, since this is this, so R2 is non-compact, we should specify, say, something about the asymptotics of the gauge field, and so we require. The gauge field, and so we require it to approach a flat connection, which we can view it as a. So, if we choose the complex structure identifying, so R2 cross T2 with C cross E is elliptic curve. So then the modular parameter of this elliptic curve is recovered from the generating parameters. Generating parameters qi by this formula and the rest of there are precisely rank of the group of those this is the holomorphic. Holomorphic bundle. So it's G gamma holomorphic bundle on E at infinity. So the instant on R2 cross T2 defines a holomorphic G bundle over the product of a complex line and elliptic curve. So you can view it as a family of holomorphic bundles over the Over the ellipsic curve, not all of these bundles are stable, so you don't actually get a map to the modular space of bundles on the ellipsic curve. You actually get what's called a quasi-map, but at infinity, it should approach the fixed holomorphic bundle. And that's that this data is encoded in these coupling constants. Now, that space, that moduli space. Space, that moduli space actually is an algebraic integrable system. So it projects onto the space of quasi-maps of CP1. Sorry, let me do it. Okay, so this construction with ellipsic curves in the fiber and the line in the base, which you can capacify to CP1, allows you to define a projection whose base is the space of quasi-maps of P1 with fixed infinity to with fixed infinity to the space of the the modular space of semi-stable G bundles on the elliptic curve with a fixed bundle at infinity. So these are quasi-maps with requirement that one point at infinity this actually maps. And so this is actually an affine space. This is actually A fine space. This is actually, thanks to Lehenga, this is a weight projector space of dimension equal to the rank of the group and with the exponents given by the same Dinkling labels. And the total space is like the space of maps into the stack. So there is some certain fiber which actually has the same dimensionality as the base. And so that fibration happens to be an algebraic contiguous system. Happens to be an algebraic integrable system. So you have a locally flat structure on a base, and from that you can define the pre-potential, which we identified with Paston, with the asymptotics of that partition function. So that was the case number one, and then the case number two. Number two, it's a similar story where you now talk about G gamma monopoles on this space. And again, the asymptotics of infinity will define the coupling constants. And now the vector of the multiplicities for the matter bundle will define the position, the types of. The types of Dirac type singularities. Okay, and now I'm out of time, so I'll just state that including the equivariant parameters, which in this discussion were sent to zero and And adding defects allows to probe further the geometry of these moduli spaces. So when epsilons are sent to zero, you only see these modulus places in a specific complex structure. You don't see the full Happy Keller glory. You only see them in the so-called I-complex structure where they look like algebraic contextual systems. Where they look like algebraic integral systems. However, when you turn on epsilon one and already one of these epsilon parameters, you start probing the other complex structures and you probe the certain families of Lagrange and submanifolds, which depend on the parameters of the well, like complex structure. And when you include And when you include both epsilon parameters, then this is where I believe we'll get a headway in producing the full twister picture. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Nikita, your twister parameter will be what? Quotient of epsilon one. What quotient of epsilon one epsilon two? Yep. Okay. And can you explain on one of your previous pages this C2 transversal C2 mod gamma story? You probably need some stability condition which yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, exactly. This one. Well, okay, so when I said that these are torsion shifts, yes, there is a okay. So there is a stability parameter in the equations which describe this modulus space. So I can explain this, I mean, I can define it as a space of stable collections of Collections of how to say this. Okay, so so I have the analog of the ADHM description of this modular space, which there is stability condition on this ADHM matrices. Yeah, yeah, this I understand, but algebra geometrically, what does it mean? I don't know. I don't know. This is the question to algebraic geometers, which I've been asking for many, many years. What are the speakers? Say it again. What to the speaker? Yeah, okay. All right. So then. But this modular space is defined. So I can. Well, you know, it is defined. I don't. I understand how to define it in ADH. It in ADHM way, yes, after you, but I don't know how to define it algebra geometrically. Sorry. Okay. Okay, thank you. So on this, isn't it, I mean, this interpretation in terms of sheaves over the C2 or over C2. Or over C2 cross C2 mod gamma that are supported on the C2. That's really an algebraic geometry description. The differential geometry description, and maybe you've hinted to it in your so that also involves non-connectivity of geometry. So you can, so this is so the shifts with the support on C2, they can be viewed as. They can be viewed as non-cumulative gauge fields now over non-cumminative R4, but with specific asymptotics. But I guess my question was, by the way, I mean, of course, you didn't fully write the thing because we don't have time for everything, but it gives the impression also that it gives that this is related to the instantons on ALE spaces. Okay, so because you seem to have been using the Because you seem to have been using the ADHM data for those. So, how should I say it? You will see, so, okay. So, instead of studying the shifts which are transfers to the ALE singularity, one can study the shifts which are which are on the ALE singularity. Which are on the ALE singularity. So those would involve the modulus space, for instance, on the ALE space. And one can also combine them. So one can allow now shifts which have support both on C2 and C2 mod gamma with some multiplicities. Vector multiplicities here, another vector multiplicities here. Another vector multiplicities here. So, these will define the so-called QQ character observables. So, they are in some sense better observables for those theories than Donatson observables. So, the full theory involves those. And so, those observables are given by the integration over the modulus points of Eli instant dots. Okay, so when you have that, that this. Okay, so when you have that that uh that description of the partition function with uh Erler of V, a couple of slides earlier. Yes. Yes. Eh that that that in itself it's only that's only this part. You can modify that description. I mean you can define another partition function which which which is like so I mean the partition function by in physics is correlation function of one. But you can also so this is the partition function. But you can also define correlation You can also define correlation expectation value of some observable. And so that's a different. So there's an observable which for which the so this will be the integral over the instant over the shift modulus piece of shifts on that combined space. And in fact, in order to prove some of the statements which I made, I'm studying these, I'm making huge use of these things. So it's an interesting, I mean, it might look like a trick, but in fact, it's a useful trick. But in fact, it's a useful trick. You allow instantons. The point is that the instantons, which are like codimension four objects inside this space, they can travel from one space to another. And the fact that they can travel between these components allows you to prove various theorems. Any other questions? Yeah, Mikita, just refer. Yeah, Mikita, just a reference question. This example was which you consider with Pestunway called 10 years ago. And this quasi-map interpretation, I think it's something more recent. No, no, no, we do we found quasi-maps basically basically. You mean that all the details already think. What's more recent is this double quint and this sort of understanding better understanding of this double quintization. So in particular with my student Norton Lee, we and also with Sachet Simbalug And uh Sembiog. John, we f we proved that the analogous partition functions which involve defects in A1 theory obeys Knushen exemological equation for four and For four and five point conformal blocks.
