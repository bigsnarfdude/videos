to have this together with to add to these earlier lectures whatever maybe he may have time for and also to present problems related to classification and realization. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, I will start with the problems essentially, but to introduce the problems I need to introduce some terminology. So let me go with this. I hope I I hope I don't forget things I wanted to say. So the problem comes in essentially three frameworks. One would be realization problems. The other would be classification problems. And the third is would be some rigidity type of process. But the way the process will be formulated, it will be quite intermingled. So when one generalization, maybe you want to classify the system that can be used to Classify the system that can be realized or things like that. So let me start with just a couple of basic problems that don't need much introduction because it were quite well discussed this morning. So there is this funding realization problem that every abstract Every abstract ergodic, or even not ergodic, measure-preserving system, whether it can be measure lesomorphic to a smooth diffeomorphism-preserving body. As Philippe remarked, so Kushnienko showed that it's not possible that there is one invariant that is an obstruction, which is entropy. So entropy has to be finite in order that this be possible. And so far, it has been the only result towards. The only result towards uh formal manualization in this generality, other from realizing some families of systems, like Bermoudi system, can be realized, identity can be realized, and any smooth system can be realized. So then it's it's it's a very hard problem. So this is one type of realization. I will talk later of other types of realization problems, but Problem, but continuing on this type of realization, so I think it is important. It's just a matter of approach to problems. It's not really any new problems. It's what I in general try to do when I approach a problem. I cannot solve it, not even Epson solved it. It's just uh try to attempt to concentrate on different kind of systems. So instead of trying to solve von Neumann, this Trying to resolve for Neumann is what kind of system we can realize. So instead of looking to which we cannot realize, look to which we can realize. And so odometer, as again, Philippe mentioned, so it's one of the hardest to realize. At least people have tried and tried and tried and not yet succeeded. So maybe it's time to start with others. Maybe it's time to start with others which are not alone there. So that's maybe better. And and here is i if you want even a slightly more complicated question that may help on the other hand which is related with these realizations that Mark was doing with range wise and also now Philip with Marlis which is Which is I'm trying to ask more than von Neumann, so can this realization be made Borel? So I have the space of measurable preserving maps. There a Borel map into the union of all different morphisms of well, there are too many manifolds. Hopefully there is no need to do all of them. That's reasonable. Actually just the ball should be if it is possible, just the ball should be enough. If it is possible, just the words should be enough. And so that one can realize on this space. So just as a model question, maybe it just falls from the very beginning. And actually, with these anti-classification techniques, maybe it's not really too hard. Maybe it's hard, very hard, you know? So with your model map G from measured how is it called? Automotivism of the interval with the depth measure. So interval is 0, 1, lambda is the tech. And I will put And I will put finite here, which means h lambda of p is finite. So I know we can only realize finite entropy system, so it's we have to ask this to happen into so this is and it is quite actually. And it in the form the n. That would be my guess. Isn't there an example that n has to be at least three? I still didn't put quantifiers on the n, yeah. Sorry, okay. So is there a world map in G here to here? And actually, let me just bypass your question by yes? Yes? You are free to choose your dimensions. At least accountable union solution. And what else I want it to be? Okay, I want them to preserve lambda. Lambda is second. It's hard measure on the torus t n and such that g of t is a measure of t. This is a method for it. So, on Neumann just asked for a G without being bothered. Most likely, if you can realize, there are some techniques that give some hints that if you can realize, there is somehow to be able to realize on balls or on torus or things like that. So, just for concreteness. Maybe it's. Maybe it's very probably very false. Hopefully, actually, it's not only false. Hopefully, it's false in finite time. So, we don't need to wait 200 years for it to be false. Hopefully, in two months, or maybe in two years. Why do you want it to be false? It's too much to ask. It's better to be false because then you start seeing what's going on. So, let me put it this way. I think that it may take maybe 100 years for it to be true. But if it is false in two minutes, I have some insight on what's going on. So, why I prefer it to be false to be true. Now, the prime question is because it's second, not because it's Is what about restricting the class? So instead of all automorphisms, we find an entropy. What about zero entropy automorphisms? That again will include odometers. So that's too hard, but what about, I don't know, any special class of automorphisms that maybe what about K automorphisms. Well, they were defined already here, so Komogorov means no zero. Kolmogorov means no zeo entropy factors. All Kolmogorov automorphisms is centralized. Are all Kolmogorov automorphisms realizable? So that's one question. The other way of of trying to get an an insight on on this type of realization problem Type of organization problem would be change the isomorphism and two or every finite entropy version of the serving system. I can die at least. Okay, so the only advantage I have seen to this question so far is that the big problem, as I said here, is odometers, but all odometers are calcutanic currents of rotations, and rotations can be realized. Realize that. So then polometers are not a problem in this question. Still, I'm sure there are plenty of. What is Kakutani realized? What is what? Kakutani realizes that is any okay. Let me just put so Kakutani equivalence realizable, so it means that for every T, so let me just translate this into symbol, for every T. Symbol for every P in this atom of freedom lambda finite, there exists an F of some M such that the scatter type of the And then you can go to your favorite isomorphism between measure-preserving transformations and ask the same for your favorite relation on this measure preserving. And again, so it is and don't think that this is I don't think that this is any simpler than that, but I do believe that if you start playing with different equivalence relations on the space of automorphisms, then at least you may hope to get what is the realizable equivalence relation and start pushing from there. So, how much finer you can take it. And this actually prompts a From the start questions, which again, these are mostly model questions. One can take start from there, a lot of things. So which this question will be more equation problem, but also is for polarization problem. So if T T is Kakutani realizer the pathology This it okay I will now put yet another thing that is undefined isomorphism realized problem. Meaning, I can realize it by a guy that is isomorphic. So it's the same as this, but no. I recur this isomorphic, so it's natural. So and as I said, this is a model question, so uh one can One can make several types, which is this is a way of restricting to the class of system you want to pay attention. Okay, and again, question three, depending on who is T, may be very hard. So if you take T, the odometer, as I said, I can't realize the odometer because it's an irrational rotation form, but how to But how to really realize anodometer at the deep amorphism level is very hard and consuming. Okay. Question four is more about classification, although I will go back to realization in two seconds, which is the same but the same Borel property for the Classification, but actually both for classification and placidity. So, something like the following. So, assume this even T is the isomer phase on Borel inside the Carcutani class of T. For this one, we'll need to know that the Carcutani class of T is at least Borel, I guess, or something that makes sense to be Borel. I'm not even sure what this is. To be bothered, I'm not even sure what this is. Extremely true, maybe I have no idea. In Builder equivalence class, I think it's certainly true for the equivalence of rotations because they are the zero of the F-bar metric, and that seems to fact that this is fraudulent. fact that this is probably for L space or for L subset of automorphism probably for the for the if this rotation then for other for that for other this maybe it's trivial yes I have no clue so for rotation there is these things that uh Marlin is called the F bar metric. The F-bar metric, and there is from this F-bar metric one can define an invariant which is something like the entropy and which was defined by Radner. And the class of rotations is characterized by being this zero entropy, so to speak, or zero Radner or Kakutani variant property. And this sort of Kakutani variant. this uh sort of Caputani variance, which is entropy-like, I think or L, so the zero. Could you repeat the last part? Last part. So one question for Prime is Steve Caputani. Well, maybe it is just from the definition that Marlis gave. I'm not sure, because you have to take sections and you have too many sections to take. But square brackets T Capitani is all of the Caputani instructions. So yeah, this is all the automorphisms that are Caputani equivalent to this given T. Capitan equivalent. Okay, yes. And it's this a Borel set. So this So this atom of this partition. And I think maybe yes if P is an irrational notation. Then you said something about radio. Yeah, there is something called the Cakutani invariant, which was introduced by Radner, which is an invariant similar to entropy. An invariant similar to entropy, and this invariant is just a real-valued invariant, and I think it's more measurable. I mean, it's as entropy. And for rotations, so the class of rotations is the same as having zero Kakutani variant. So it's the pre-image of zero by a borel maps or this Borel. So it is or but that's why most likely yes for this rotation, but for other guys maybe yes, maybe no, maybe find the guys that are more electrons. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But not in general, right? R maybe it's asking that one. Well, yeah, yeah, it's for four prime, exactly. Four prime is asking whether the classes are ORL space. If any atom of the partition is every equivalent class, yeah. Sorry. Class, yeah. So for is asking: is every equivalence class a bottle? No, not the question. Question four is is each borel is each equivalent class the borel substance. That's what question four is prime is. I interpret it. I interpret it is the Poisson space that also mentions isomorphism. Or is different. So if you restrict isomorphism to Kakutani, is it a Borel relation inside? Yeah, so that to be a Borel Corelation, I would imagine you want it to be defined on a Borel set. But I don't know, maybe one can make sense of. One can make sense of whatever space. But take all the time you want. So, but I don't want to go too much. So, this, in a sense, So this in a sense would be closer to some specific type of notions that I will also touch later. So, which is you have two equivalents, one finer than the other, and when you restrict to one equivalence class of one of the relations, do you get better information about the other relation? So maybe they coincide. You know the equivalence relation when restricted one of those chippoty. Constructed one of those carbotany classes is not soon. My guess would be here that one may hope to build what Matt did for the rotations and still not be bored. So the same construction, maybe one can show doing what you were doing with MarcLease, showing that all these odometer guys which are standard or loose-given. Standard or loosely bernoulli zero entropy are also standard loosely permoly zero entropy there. They have enough for the solution. I think that if one looks at the loose Libernouni, zero entropy, loosely permoly class, and so I thought about that one. So the answer is no, so it's not what it is actually. Okay, good. So answer here for me and well most likely, let me put most likely. Okay. So answer Answer if T is irrational notation alpha irrational is most likely known and see further and so at least I suddenly but weren't okay. I thought it were both of you that were showing that uh Both of you that were assuming that whatever was lost even over here was also lost there, so that the focus are. Oh, no, it's the other way out. Oh, no, the other way. Okay, that's if you don't use it. But here it would be. Oh, yeah, because this is understanding the astronauts. Yeah, what have you modified uh format revise construction that says that the things that you get uh stay uh usually by moody. Uh Yeah, so the rational rotations move slightly is not for L, and but well then for other pieces that's one type of realization problems I wanted to discuss. There is a second type of realization problems, which is something related with something called universality. I I forgot to mention one thing. I forgot to mention one thing about this realization that I didn't know before Philippe mentioned Daginary Man. There seems to be that question of realization, whether you can realize by homeomorphisms. Maybe not by diffomorphisms, but you can realize by homeomorphisms. And this has been answered. So you can always realize by homeomorphism. Again, at least modulo the finite entropy assumption, I Assumption because also you're asking these questions on compact nanopaults, right? And compact, yeah, and yeah. I mean for a non-compact network, I thought that alone a lot of people show. Yes, that's true. Yes, yes, yes, actually there is very low dimension because actually you can first realize on the interval itself with piecewise. I just wanted to. This is a well, yeah. So for this remote side. Sorry, I didn't. No, no, it is, it is. Yeah, actually, about that, so it's is there something known if you now take the measure to be sigma finite and take instead of probability, yeah. Uh okay. Yeah, okay. One can actually, yeah, this indeed I think is also very broadly open, and you have this type 1, type 2, type 3, and then you have to start changing which of the guys you are to make. Because having a sigma finite measure is not so much different to having a quasi-master. Much different to having a quasi-biod measure, but finite measure. Just by the rodent discussion. But then, yeah, then you have the, again, the hof that tells you you have to look at the recurrent part by using a transient part. But still, so yeah, I think it is still quite open. About uh which eigenvalues of the company operator can be there are some work on that that I that I from the top of my view building that follows from I follows from this by Atta Pikina rotation. Then they are really isomorphic for that. If you are isomorphic to the rotation, then you can do. But maybe what subgroups or what different spectrum you can expect. different spectrum you can exactly yeah there is well there is a whole but this yeah whole theory of which spectrums you can realize for the cookman but anything is very well but now with the smoothness any kind of subgroup of the in the circle quadratic and dual realms just multiply smoothness I don't know yet Blueness, I don't know yet. The the things you can realize with circular systems is pretty broad. The the the symbolic systems that that Philip talked about. Yeah, I guess the contracts use the rational. Sorry. The rational values. Oh, how do you utilize rational values? So like minus one to be. So you can know you can realize because you can put essentially something periodic. So let me just do a simple one. So we take an ergodic system here with a fixed point. You take an ergodic system, or even better, whatever you want here, Bermoudi system with a fixed point here. You open the fixed point to Here, you open the fixed point to a circle, and then you glue with the other guy. But now, your dynamics is you first clip and then you cut back, and then that way you realize minus one. And if you want to realize anything a little bit more, you put more holes, and then you just put all the guys around and ask the guys for different things. But there is a lot of problems. But but there is a lot of problem in the spectral theories. I I'm yeah, I I I'm not an expert on anything at all, I'm even less in spectral theory. So I would say I would forget more names that I'm forgetting now. But there are very important roles in spectral dimensions and even in the realization because this implies realization Because this implies realization problem. So, are all spectrums realizable even in photofold? Now, what is all spectrum? Yeah, I mean, add that as a question. Yeah. Five. If I want me to write it, no, I don't want to write it. How about is every subgroup a new intercourse there? A subgroup, and you're going to circle them in as the coupon. Okay, Fleet, why didn't you put that in? Okay, okay, he's going to put it in. You don't have to every day, of course. So let me... I need it. So yeah, one observation on this realization business as well, which will make me a link to the second type of realizations I want. Type of realizations I wanted to first is this Krieger simulator so what does it say? It says that if T so it can be read in two forms so let's say T mu is herbotic and H mu of T is small H mu of t is smaller than log n and find different number. Then there is a generator with n elements, meaning that C is the partition P requires to Request to in one is to n x such that I do minus infinity to infinity of Tn of P, I get the trivial partition. I'm not sure how this is standard partition, but it's partition into ones. That's a clear generator, but that's in a sense one way of reading. But that's in in a sense one way of reading it. There is a second way of reading this uh trigger generator theorem, which is is equivalent. It says that there exists an age from T mu into shift on hand singles. So I call it here into the Z with some measure muffin. Which you essentially use this partition as your symbols, and this is telling you that whenever actually the math goes increases from here to there, but it becomes an aximorphism. So, but what does it tell you? It tells you that you can realize any guy whose entropy is more than log n as a subsystem of your shift. So, in this sense, you can always realize for some measure. So, that's not for bad money measure if you are not badmouth to begin with. Now, then it is also known by By how names escape my brain, but Lind is part of it, and probably Adler as well, Wise as well. There's a set of people related as well with massive partitions that will tell you that. I have to say the term, but I don't know the authors. Add it when we write the list. So it says that it's just putting together this theorem by of trigger by joint with maybe a joint with Markov partitions for an Markov partitions for anos of systems. And essentially, it will tell you that for every embodic measure-preserving map, or anything measure-preserving map, T with finite entropy that is That is a matrix, a 2 by 2 matrix acting on the torus, or we think of things as an outcome of this of the torus, and an antiviral measure new among people such that Such that T is its invited measure is isomorphic to A is this measure. That's essentially because even any matrix A will have a shift of finite type associated to this and is a finite to one quotient of this. And it's a finite to one quotient of this shift of finite type, and then the shift of finite type can be embedded into a large enough full shift and you just bring trigger into your really playing a little bit, but it has been proven even before. Anyway, the point is that you can realize now, so you have almost unknown realization, but the problem is that the measure is not the best. Not Lebesgue. So that's why this is not fundamental deception. But then you have the following observation. Well, that's not observation. It's actually the theorem. Is it absolutely continuous? No, there is only one absolute continuous and it will be detected. So it cannot, it has to be singular. But what can be done is yes. So So what can be done is, and it's non-trivial, so it's not just a consequence of the trivial, so it's really non-trivial construction, is that mu above can be taken fully support. Then, then you have a secondary that for every ecologic Probably convention for setting E mu that exists and centrally there exists this guy um Come you Communication F the vector is isomorphic. So now you have fundamentalization, but F is only a cognitive. It's not synthesis. And the reason for that is that every non-atomic, so I didn't say that these measures are never atomic, so they have a potential atomic. So every fully supported non-atomic Every fully supported non-atomic measure on a manifold can be sent into the web by a homomorphism. I'll go back to the time speed point. But then you're just taking the home that takes your measure nu to the back, it will bring A to F. But this is a home. There is no much home of this. So this measure mu. This or this measure new. So there are all sorts of questions of how good you can make this F to begin with, and make it a bit color or things. And there are some discussions. As always, this is getting hard here. So still, this device has a name, so going back to A, so now instead of insisting on this vanilla, Now instead of insisting on this one normal and having the effect, you free the mesh a little bit and you call here this A system universal, essentially, or well here, of course the A depends on the system, but as I said, maybe I said it. So the only obstruction for trigger realization is uh entropy. And actually here it's also true that you can realize anything below the entropy of the matter. Anything below the entropy of the matrix. And that's essentially how you finally prove it here. So, okay. So you can arrange everything below the entropy. So you just need a matrix A with very large entropy. But the entropy of the iterate is multiple of the entropy. So as soon as you have entropy positive, you can just take values of A. But in any event, so the point is that given the matrix A, I can realize any system you want with n. System you want with entropy less than the entropy of A, that's the important statement, and that's why it's called universal. So you don't need to look at the integral 0, 1. You can look at the strange Lebeck measure, but the strange transformation. You only need to look at invariant measures. So the boundary, so these are ergodic, so it's the boundary of the simplex A and the matrix that actin is A. The matrix of acting is A, so it's not. It doesn't make anything simpler. But these systems are called universal. And then one question is what are other universal systems? There is some decorations to the word universal when you can realize universality with uh full support. Then it's like a stronger version of English universality. At this university, right? And then again, the question starts going both ways. So which systems are universal, or given your system, which subsystem can you realize inside? This is a, if you want, even a canonical guy associated to systems, so even F, M now is whatever abstract compact metric space and F. phase and F is a home. So then you have this phi sub F from invariant measures for F, the codic invariant measure for F are not always a good city nice. Algorithm for instance of U lambda just take a measure and bring it to the corresponding measures. The corresponding measurements. So high F of measurements. And then you can caution by the equivalence. Then what resting Suggesting that when you take this guy as being this matrix A, you are getting an element in each equivalent class which will have entropy smaller than the entropy of A. That's a way of restating this. Or for the shift of the ensembles in trigger, you can. Now the question again is what is the image of this light image portion by the glasses? So how big these guys are can even go and restrict your attention. The eyes that can only be realized inside a very specific guys. In your situation I would imagine that since your systems are say all motor based or circular based is like restating your It's like restricting your attention to only the guys that are odometer based. And it's a little bit. We don't have to realize any odometer phase. Okay, so again, this doesn't need to be a manifold, so this could be a compact metric space for this question. So then, and again, one can restrict here to the fully supported and Measure. Now, I think that there is a very important observation here, which is actually comes from a theory by Antoniquas and Terry Su. So, they showed, so they gave a very general condition that will guarantee the universality. Actually, they gave two conditions: one that will guarantee universality, and the stronger one that will guarantee the Stronger points that will guarantee this full support universality, and essentially it's a general form of specification. And then it's very natural that it is true, as most of the results after you see them, it's very natural that they are true, but or what is the natural thing to do. So the point that you Uh the point is that you have specifications, so you want to produce this dynamical system. So so you you just take orbits, or they need a little bit more than this specification, they need something. Not triviality clear, but still so you take orbits or pieces of orbits or pseudo-orbits that mimic your aster dynamics. And then specification will tell you there is a two-orbit that is doing that. And then you take the limit of this, you'll And then you take the limit of this, you'll get a measure that will be doing more or less what your dynamics was telling you to do. And well, if you put the right definition and the huge effort they did, so make this into a tool to amazing data, and it's a very weak form of specification property, which I will find. And they use it to prove. Uh and they use it to prove uh all sorts of systems has the specification, as this universal. But then the question is what else? Do you really need specification? Is some screenshot that you need some sort of specification at least some place in your space? Also some freedom. Then the question is: what systems have universals? What systems are universal? Oh, okay. I have a question for you and then I have a question for you. Could you talk a little bit about your virginity type of break? Maybe I should have stopped right now. Okay, we don't have a break schedule. But do we have kind of a I mean it's it's fine for the normal people take a break before I mean we need to even go the jelly has touched up I mean she she doesn't w we have I mean she she doesn't we have uh she doesn't have to have more conference related stuff using this is more confident so so but let me make the transition because uh there was a more specific question I wanted to was there well this Well, this universality. So, which is related actually to the contrary of this question. So, which systems are very badly non-universal? So, which you can rely very little on that. That's more due to the utility problem. So, now this transition first to large looks. So, almost everything I have said, or maybe not almost everything, but maybe some percentage that I have said. Maybe some percentage of what I have said, you can formulate for other groups. Now, let me just now it's almost intersection of the three. Guys? So there is a famous problem by Fustenberg, which is the times two times three problem. So you take, now it's not a group, it's a semi-group, but you can always make it into a group if you ever want to do it. So this is multiplication by 2, 1 times 3 1, and this is time 3. Okay, so you have this multiplication by these guys, and Hustember asks of what happens which measures mu Happens which measures mu. So let mu be erodic and t2 t3 and ergodicity means ergodicity for the pair. And then the answer so far is by well there is a whole history but essentially is by But essentially, is by Rudolph Rudolph who says if H mu
