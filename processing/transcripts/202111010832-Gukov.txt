I can see the screen, I can hear you, and I think also it's recording. Yeah. Okay, excellent. So first, of course, I want to thank the organizers for coping with unusual circumstances and bringing us together now in hybrid format. That's already great progress. And I also want to thank the organizers and many participants for developing this wonderful topic of non-semi-simple tensor categories, TQFTs, and logarithmic vertex algebras. Right away, I have to apologize that, first of all, I never had my personal intention to study non-semi-simple TQFTs and logarithmic vertex algebras and Vortex algebras and naturally came to the subject via a different route. I realize my camera is not working for some reason. Can you hear me? Does the audio still work? We can hear you, yes. Well, I'll just continue like this then. So, yeah, my apology that I personally did not have planned to study this, but Plan to study this, but we were with various collaborators, including Comran Waffa, Don Zagir, Tutum Tumofta, and others, working on a program that surprisingly led to many non-semisimple structures. And I guess this is why I'm here. And this program has been going on for 20 years. And I would say many years were not super successful. Of course, there were lots of attempts that we tried, but I'll. Attempts that we tried, but I'll try to describe developments in the last five years where things surprisingly took off and completely new structures showed up. And some of the structures are actually relevant to study of non-semi-simple TQFTs. That's why, even though there will be very little non-semi-simple in this talk, I hope that there are many elements and parallels that can be borrowed, and for a good reason, because here the main goal is to develop. Here, the main goal is to develop the QFT for quantum groups at generic Q. And when Q is specialized to root of unity, then of course, there will be parallels with things that other people have worked on. So, I also want to thank my collaborators. There are many of them. And here I list those who were helping to make these pioneering steps in discovering these new structures. About five years ago, Dupay, Pavel Putrov, Kumaran Wafa. Paivil Putrov, Kumaran Wafa, and Chiprin Manalescu. All of these people are fairly senior, maybe with the slight exception of DuPay. So I guess if you want to snatch him for senior position, then that's a great opportunity. And finally, the last apology I want to make is that there is very rich physics in the story, but since I was asked to give an overview, I'll try to cover a lot of ground. I'll try to cover a lot of ground, and my main focus will be on mathematical structures, outcomes. I apologize to my physics colleagues that many interesting physics components which are present, and I would like to certainly be glad to talk about them, but they won't make it into this talk, at least mostly. So, first, I'll try to explain our motivation or goal. Explain our motivation or goals of this large research program, where it's going, and where else could it connect, why is it useful? So, one of the main goals, the first one I want to emphasize, is to understand better connection between quantum groups, not only a generic queue, but in general, and two-dimensional conformal field theories or vertex operator algebras. So, we're going to approach this subject through the lens of three-dimensional TQFTs. Three-dimensional TQFTs, which have connections to both quantum groups and CFTs, and also geometry. And for this talk, geometries that appear will be referred to as Coulomb branches. I remind you that in topological, three-dimensional topological quantum field theories, we associate vector space, Hilbert space of states, to Riemann surface. And among those in genus 0 and genus 1, Hilbert spaces place. In genus one, Hilbert spaces play a specially important role. In genus one, we get a Hilbert space associated to torus, which tells us about the spectrum of line operators and relates to a growth in the group of the category that TQFT associates to a circle. And for a two-sphere, it encodes local operators and they form a commutative ring. And it's a good question to ask: what's the spectrum of this commutative ring? Namely, what's the so that will. Namely, what's there? So that will make a link to geometry. It's a good question to think about and something we should keep in mind. The second motivation, which is actually how myself, Kumranwaffa, and many others came to this subject, were via SL2C transients theory, which is another name, roughly speaking, for quantum groups at generic Q. In SL2C transience theory, the level is not quantized, so Q can be anything. And 20 years ago, there were many. And 20 years ago, there were many developments that include our work with Pyotr Sukhovsky, Judy Dimovta, and others, where many powerful techniques were developed how to compute partition functions on three manifolds of a CL2 feature in Simon's theory near Q equals one. And therefore, roughly speaking, all you want to do is to rewrite these expressions naturally in terms of Q rather than formal perturbative expansion in H bar. The third motivation. The third motivation for this work has to do with geometric representation theory. This makes closer contact to these geometries or Coulomb branches that appeared in motivation number one. And quantum groups have many interesting connections to geometry. Mostly for this study will be relevant geometry of various affine spring fibers, slices and affine Brassmannians. And affine Grassmannians. And there are many reasons affine Grassmannians will be relevant. Many of them go back to basic geometric satyric correspondence, which relates representations of one group and sheets on affine Grasmanian of its Langlands dual. And for this and closely related reasons, we'll see affine Grasmanians to appear prominently in this study. So the fourth motivation for this work. For this work, it is based on an analog of TQFT that I'll be presenting to you in dimension four. In dimension four, it's known as Waffer-Witten theory. It has a beautiful physics definition, which at least in principle can be applied to general four-manifolds. In practice, that's of course rather hard. And for this reason, mathematical construction of this theory exists only for complex surfaces in dimension form. And there are many parallels. And there are many parallels between this four-dimensional TQFT, which associates Q-series invariants to four-manifolds. This Q-series invariance turn out to be characters of various vertex algebras. For a given four-manifold, there are several of them. So there is actually a decorated structure which will show up in three-dimensional story and so on. So the 3D story is very parallel. Is very parallel. So the invariants I'm going to tell you about share many similar features. They also associate Q-series to a given three-manifold. Now, this is a theory that is physically defined for general three-manifold, at least in principle. But here, since we're in lower dimensions, things are quite a bit easier. It's much more computable. And in particular, I'll give you two mathematical definitions. Two mathematical definitions, one of which is fairly general, but not so computable. The other is going to be completely computable, but not so general. So hopefully the two will compensate for each other. And there will be again some parallel to Waffa-Witten theory, namely the Q-series invariance for these three manifolds will be characters now of logarithmic vertex algebras. This is where some of these connections to Where some of these connections to log CFTs and non-semi-simple structures start showing up. And I believe, of course, we should not ignore connections and rather explore them as fully as we can. And they are also labeled by certain structures on three manifolds. So the last and final motivation that I'll tell you about, this is also how many of us in early days, including myself, Qumran and others, Including myself, Qumran, and others, who are thinking about this problem, has to do with categorification. So there is a very successful categorification of John's polynomial due to Khovanov and later Kovanov-Razansky and many others that promotes coefficients, which are integer coefficients of the John's polynomial to other characteristics of graded vector spaces, which are homology. Homology groups of Hovan of Hoven of Rosansky and others. So, of course, there is a close parallel between WRT invariance of NOTS. This is where we recover John's polynomial and its cousins, and invariance of three manifolds. So we'll see some of these parallels between NOTS and three manifolds later in the talk. And therefore, you would expect that if for NOTS, we have a beautiful categorification story, which by now is pretty old, at least 20. By now, it is pretty old, at least 20 years old. There should be analogous story for three manifolds. So, in other words, you should be able to write the invariant of Frischetic-Hinter-Ivan-Bitten as some, perhaps, with some universal coefficients of graded dimensions of vector spaces. So write it in terms of integers. The issue, however, is that unlike the Johns polynomial, which is naturally a polynomial on Q with integer coefficients, if you try to look at W If you try to look at WRT invariants, even for some simple manifolds, there is no simple way to write it in terms of Q. So these invariants are defined at roots of unity, and the order of the root of unity, this so-called level K, shows up in all kinds of places, for example, as overall power, upper limit of the sum in this formula. So if you try to write it in terms of Q, it's completely non-manifest, at least for general free manifold. And there are various approaches. And there are various approaches. In fact, this is one of the most challenging problems in the Qatar verification program. And there were various approaches developed in the past 20 years to this. So, for example, Anna has been working on approach introduced by Nisha through hopological algebra. There is high representation theory due to Raphael Ruquer and his collaborators. And in this talk, I'll focus on the idea where these values. The idea where these values at roots of unity, WRT invariance at roots of unity, are supposed to be continued to values of holomorphic Q-series defined inside the unit disk. So these are going to be Q-series invariants that this TQFT will associate to a three-manifold. To me, a huge surprise was that there is going to be not a single Q-series for a given three-manifold, but a collection of such. And I should say. Of such. And I should say that to people like myself and Qumran and others, it slowed us quite a bit because we were for a long time expecting just a single Q-series, namely that to a given three-manifold, we were expecting to have only one invariant rather than a collection. And soon it was realized when we tried to make progress on this that first of all, we need a collection which is labeled by Which is labeled by elements of H1, at least in the rank one. So most of this talk is going to be about SL2. So in higher rank, there is an obvious generalization, but I will focus for concreteness on rank one. So in this case, this invariants are labeled in addition to choice of three manifold by an element of H1, or you could say a billion flat connection if you're working with SL2. And as I said, this is the same as choice of space. Same as the choice of spin C structures on a three manifold. And a couple of years after original work with Qumran, Marcus Mourinho, and others, it became clear that cutting and gluing properties, namely TQFT structure of these invariants, requires the label set to be spin C structures rather than H1. Now, part of the surprise was that WRT invariants are not labeled by any additional structures. Additional structure. So, if you have a three-manifold and a choice of root of unity or a level k, you just get a number. And therefore, if there is any relation between these objects, which is the subject of this talk, and WRT invariance, clearly we need to sum over information that never appears in WRT invariance. Namely, we need to sum over spin C structures. And indeed, the precise relation is such a sum where Such a sum where c's are some universal coefficients which basically don't even depend in any serious way on a three-manifold. So, in fact, in this coefficient c, there is a second hint that there is something, some relation to logarithmic vertex algebras or something non-semi-simple, because these coefficients are naturally written in terms of modular S metrics of non-semi-simple TQFTs at analogous roots of unity. Analogous roots of unity. So clearly, there were some hints related to non-semi-simplicity, especially as we try to take limits or q goes to root of unity. So anyway, to summarize, WRT invariance did not depend on any structure, and suddenly this extension to generic values of Q required spin C structures. So this is important, fairly important point, and And as a result, so once this is realized, then it's much easier to try to understand the structure and make some progress, but you have to accept the fact, at least from the perspective of this program, that you're not going to get a single Q series. If we're talking about homologies here, such as so-called small surgeries on knots and links, then you may expect a single Q-series, but if you, for example, work But if you, for example, work with integral surgeries, you'll have for a single knot some collection of such. Or if you talk about S1 cross a Riemann surface, you'll just get infinitely many Q-series invariants. And my favorite example here is S1 cross S2, because WRT invariants for any level K of S1 cross S2 are just equal to 1. So at any root of unity, W invariant of S1 cross S2 is just 1. So the most naive way to Just one. So, the most naive way to continue this inside unit disk and for generic values of q is just declare that there is a single object which is equal to one. But instead, what happens is that there are infinitely many invariants and they are not equal to one at all. I mean, I'll show you later in the talk the answer. It will be fairly complicated Q series, in fact, infinite collection of such Q series labeled by spin C structures. So, that's that's important part of. That's an important part of structure. And therefore, I want to focus on it a little bit closer. So, this is a survey talk. So, I shouldn't have any time to explain anything. It's just supposed to be a survey of results or developments and give you placeholders like where to go to find certain things. But there are actually two things I will try to explain. So, I hope I'm not going to run out of time by attempting this, but there are two. By attempting this, but there are two things which I personally find conceptually important and want to spend some time on. One is this role of spin C structures or other structures, which appears and plays a very important role in cutting and bluing. So these things and TQFT appeared in many different places. And surprisingly, there is not unifying rule. People didn't try to connect, at least not super seriously, different developments. Super seriously different developments which happen in parallel. For example, spin C structures that I mentioned you about appeared in various versions, such as bordered and sutured in Higert floor homology, which categorifies cyberquitan invariants or derived torsion. So of course it should depend on spin C structures. And if we are to study cutting and bluing, these natural questions appear. And more recently, they appear in the study of symmetry protected topological. Symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, where if such phases have some symmetry G, they are naturally described by G-crossed modulator categories, which again deals with additional structures and questions of cutting and glue. If G is abelian, which is going to be the case for everything I'm going to tell you about, then MTC basically breaks into pieces labeled by elements of the group in a way which is consistent with. Group in a way which is consistent with fusion. And the structure, which again appears in completely different parallel developments and topology, is actually something very familiar in the language and this Kazdenlustic type correspondence on the CFT side. That's where we have G-twisted sectors for each element of the group G. If group is non-abelian, then one needs to study conjugacy classes. The story is a little more involved, but I won't need it. I won't need it. In fact, I want to illustrate that even the most basic elementary abelian Turn-Simons theory with gauge group U1 on level K, it's completely Gaussian, path integral is Gaussian, actually has U1 symmetry. And therefore, at the TQT level, it can be enriched by the choice of flat connection for the symmetry, so background connection. So naturally, it's going to be labeled by its holonomies, elements on H1 with coefficients on G, G is the symmetry. Coefficients and G, G is the symmetry. And this is how you can introduce this to the action. At the level of VOA or CFT, it's basically the simplest version of a lattice VOA, namely free chiral boson at level K. And if you try to ask how this TQFT behaves with respect to cutting and gluing, you see that not only you need this decoration by the choice of flat connection associated to the symmetry, but your spaces associated. But your spaces associated to sigma should also be graded by cohomology of sigma with coefficients in the pantraging dual of our symmetry. And this example is so neat. And again, it's extremely simple, but we felt it's so neat that we recently summarized it in paper versus Franzo Accostantino. And I don't know if he is going to use this example, but definitely in his talk, you'll see more. His talk, you'll see more general discussion and more serious discussion of such background structures, which appear both in non-semi-simple TQFTs and in this story I'm going to tell you about. So that's why I decided to include this example. In this simple example, continuing with Yuan Shurn-Simon's theory, for each element of this U1 symmetry group G, the corresponding category has The corresponding category has K-simple objects, so K is the level. So again, notice very close parallel to non-semi-simple, some examples of non-semi-simple TQFTs. And they correspond to various choices of line operators in three-dimensional theory. The only interesting thing is that if this mu, which has to be congruent to G, U1 element that we choose, is not equal to zero. So in other words, if this charge If these charges of line operators have improper quantization condition, not integers, but shifted integers, then these line operators have to be attached to a surface operator. And again, this basic example is a precursor for BCGPTQFT, which is close analog of what I just described, namely it has zero-form U1 symmetry, just like a Zabillian-Turren-Simon's theory, or you could say C-star symmetry. Or you could say C-star symmetry, since everything is going to be analytic. And the story I'm going to tell you about has so-called one-form symmetry. It's a different degree. And it's also symmetry, which is integers rather than U1. So notice that they're related by pantrying duality, and degrees are kind of complementary. So that's the beginning of the relation between these two theories, which is again subject of Francois's talk. And as you can guess, that's some version. And as you can guess, it's some version of Fourier transform that if you incorporate spin C structures, physicists would call bosonization. Okay, this was my motivation and summary of the goals. Namely, this was trying to explain why would someone be doing this and where the subject would connect. So, next, I want to be extremely concrete about this development. And my next and important goal is to next and important goal is to tell you at least as a roadmap how can you compute this TQFT invariance associated to first of all three manifolds and then also two-dimensional surfaces which would participate in cutting and gluing constructions. So I'm not going to talk about extended structure in this TQFT in part because very little is known if you go to codimension two. Codimension two, but in three dimensions and in codimension one, namely for surfaces, I'll try to give you the answer. And I'll give you two mathematical definitions of this invariance that I already mentioned earlier. So one of them is based on a theorem of Likurich and Wallace, which says that every closed-oriented three-manifold can be constructed by surgery on a knot or a link with integer surgery coefficients. Integer surgery coefficients. In particular, if you see a three torus, don't think about it as a Cartesian product of three circles. Rather, from the surgery perspective, think about it as, say, boronine rings with surgery coefficient 0, 0, 0. So in the surgery approach, therefore, the most important ingredient is to associate invariant to a complement of an autolink. That's going to be step one. And then step two is to give. And then step two is to give a surgery formula. So, the simplest example of a link is a link made out of unknots, like this. In this case, you can actually replace this three-dimensional link diagram by simple combinatorial data, where every component is replaced by vertex. It carries an integer label, that's going to be the surgery coefficient. The surgery coefficient, and whenever the two link components are linked together, then we can draw an edge. So, this diagram is usually called the plumbing diagram. And naturally associated to it is the adjacency matrix, which has this coefficients on a diagonal, and zeros and ones encode in off-diagonal places and code whether vertices or link components are linked or not. So, in this case, I can give you a fairly general construction. A fairly general construction of this invariant. So, basically, for this entire class of links, what the corresponding invariant on surgery looks like. It's an integral such that we are integrating over many, many variables associated to vertices of this graph or link components. Link components and the integrand is associated in a very simple and rather canonical way to basically building blocks, namely the vertices and edges in this plumbing graph or in the link diagram. So you can package it all together in a very succinct form, which is very easy to put on Mathematica and program and with a slight assumption that With the slight assumption that Q is negative definite, you can take this data from the previous slide that's going to be invariant for not a link complement and take a convolution with a theta function. So this multiple integral that integrates over as many variables as link components will produce something that you can prove is, first of all, invariant under three-dimensional moves. In this case, Three-dimensional moves. In this case, they're called Kirby moves or Neumann moves. It converges, in fact, very quickly inside the unit disk. So that is easy to prove. It can be done by a simple ratio test or something like that. And manifestly, it has integer coefficients, which is perfect for this categorification goal that was very. Goal that was very important. And you can also prove that as Q goes to roots of unity, it actually relates to Rishitikin-Turive invariance. And now this has been extended in various other directions. So this is the theorem that appeared first in joint work with Pei, Putrov, and Waffa, and at least many elements here, which then were clarified and cleaned up in our work with Manalescu, as well as in beautiful. As well as beautiful work. In fact, a whole line of work that Catherine Brinkman, Carl Mellbrook, and Anton Milish are doing in parallel on this subject. So at least for this class, again, everything is super concrete, super explicit, and our assumptions, for example, that Q has to be negative definite, were relaxed. In this work, it was really. Relaxed in this work, it was realized that one needs much weaker notion, so-called weakly negative definite, and so on and so forth. But I want to come back to the most general three-manifold, and for this, one needs to be able to produce this invariance for general knots and links, not just the ones made out of unknots. So, those made out of unknots tell you what kind of surgery formula we should have. So, the second part of the construction. So the second part of the construction, therefore, is finished, but you need in crucial ingredient, namely the invariant for not or link complement. And since integration variables x, which we saw in this formula, or here they're actually called z for whatever reason, are associated to each link component. A natural modification where you replace unknotted component by some knotted component is fairly clear. You're basically going. Is fairly clear. You're basically going to replace that particular part of the integrand that depends on this choice of not k rather than a simple factor like this. So this was for a single vertex or for the unknown. So question is, how do you find such invariants or integrands for non-trivial nodes or links, namely how to produce this for most general links? This is for most general link complement. So, this is exactly the question we asked ourselves with Chipri and Manalescu. And we, in the paper, which is almost 100 pages, we proposed two procedures to compute such an object. And in some cases, we were able to, first of all, do this and show that the result is invariant under Kirby moves and has the same properties analogous to this theorem that I showed you. Theorem that I showed you. And the two methods are the following. So one was based on recursion that comes from quantization of the A polynomial curve. So this is fairly standard in the context of SL2C transients theory. And again, is not a big surprise. And also emphasizes why the story is basically not. This story is basically non-perturbative SL2CR and Simons theory. And the second method is a little bit maybe less traditional to quantum topology. It's based on so-called resurgent analysis, which as part of analysis, complex analysis exists for at least 30-40 years, but its application to topologies is fairly recent. And the goal of resurgent analysis, which Of resurgent analysis, which many people even outside of quantum topology like a lot, for example, Maxim Kancevich and others are working on it, is basically to change the domain for complex function. Say, if we have an expansion of a function as a formal series, which is something that I showed you earlier, for example, near q equals one, there were powerful techniques to compute perturbative turn-simons theory that gave. And Simon's theory, the gauge group SL2C to any desired order in this H-bar, then you can actually apply some of the techniques of resurgent analysis to resume into series and Q, which when written in terms of Q, of course, we mean expansion near Q equals zero. And the techniques are extremely powerful, in fact, both of them. So you can try to put both of them on a computer. Otherwise, there would be no way to compute high-order terms such as. High-order terms such as q to the 500 or q to the thousand. And as you can see, all coefficients here come out to be integer, they're growing, alternating in sign. So this is perfect now for categorification program. And question is how to implement this and start turning into easy to work with machinery. So that's what we tried for. And again, we use these both methods, and you would think that if Methods, and you would think that if two smart people use this two different methods, and we worked on this for about a year, we should be able to come up with something good. But all we managed to do is to do it for one single knot, namely a figure eight knot. That's all. So some of the knots for which this function that were variable x basically encodes dependence on spin C structure on a not complement. There are infinitely many spin C structures. So this function was not. So, this function was known for the unknot. That's basically the original GPV paper, or in GPPV, we generalize this to all torus knots. Those of you who worked with Taurus knots know very well that they're extremely special in knot theory. There are so many structures. That's why this whole infinite family of torus knots was sort of easier than anything else. And therefore, we only managed to produce with GPRAN this. Managed to produce with GPRIN this answer for figure eight knot, which was good for us because we wanted to see if this whole program is just a fluke, namely it's special to some particular knots, or if it can be applied more generally. So here, through these two methods, it was extremely clear. And again, figure eight knot is no special than others from this perspective. And we tried to get some partial results for 5.2, but it was clear that. But it was clear that this is not the way to go. Because if you have to spend a whole year on just one knot, it's not going to be super useful for topology. Well, at least not until computer power is developed to implement this much, much faster. Luckily for us, we didn't have to wait many years. So Sanyuk Park came along and proposed a very nice method, which takes us back to quantum groups at generic values of Q. Generic values of Q. He basically tried to replicate Rishiti Hinterif construction. So his starting point was very nice diagrammatic and combinatorial perspective on this invariance for NOT and link complements. So he works with quantum groups at generic Q decorated strands by infinite dimensional Vermont modules where this parameter X, which encodes the Parameter x, which encodes dependent on smoke c structure, now appears as basically exponentiated complex weight of the Verma module. And in two papers, well, he has more, but there are two most important ones. One is from the spring of 2020, the other is from spring of 2021. He managed to knock all of these question marks that were present in 2019. Namely, he developed these techniques for positive. Developed these techniques for positive braid knots first, then for homogeneous knots, and many other infinite families that include fibered knots, double twist knots. And by now, pretty much this or metrics technique can be used to compute anything up to roughly 10 crossings. So here is an example of a 10 crossing knot. So if you take his results for not complements, plug this in into the surgery formula that I showed you before. Formula that I showed you before, that surgery formula is exactly the same, then you get this invariant for surgery on a 10-crossing nut. That's pretty good. So the second thing I want to explain or dwell on a little bit in this talk, I mentioned that there was one, namely decorated structure, which plays an important role. And the fact that everything is decorated by spin C structures is extremely important here. So second thing I want to pause and To pause and discuss is the structure of the surgery formula. Of course, in reviewing these developments, I gloss over many technical details which are extremely interesting. And one of these interesting points is the structure that I want to spend a couple of minutes on. So what we saw, either in the case of surgery on a knot or in the case of this plumbing formula, which somehow is very popular, but again, it's just a special case of much more. Just a special case of much more general Swordieri formula, like here. Two things are going on. For every link component, first of all, you have integration. That already was mentioned in the previous slide. But I want to point out that it's always accompanied by summation, which in the case of theta function is hiding in the theta function. So for every vertex here in the Plymouth graph, or for every link with each link component, you have summation over integers as well. Summation over integers as well. So, therefore, if we look at this formula and ask what happens when we drill another hole in a three-manifold and glue something along a toral boundary, that's exactly what it means to do a surgery on yet another link component. Here in the story, we have integration over complex variables and summation over integers. Every time we have to glue something along a toral boundary, now if you think Now, if you think about this invariant for not only complements and what variable x is doing, remember it was a placeholder. It was basically a generating series that encodes dependence on spin C structures, or in this case, for single node complement, the spin C structures are in one-to-one correspondence with integers. So therefore, it's convenient to actually convert the integral over x into summation over the original variable. To summation over the original variable m, which takes values and integers. And this way you get an equivalent way of writing Sorgeri formula, in fact, which Chipriand expressed this somewhere in the middle of the paper, as summation over pairs of integers, m, n, which are naturally associated to A and B cycles of these two toras. Now I want you to compare this mentally to what happens in Rishi-Tiken Torrive construction. So for SL2, which is my example throughout the 2, which is my example throughout the talk, the summation is over a single integer the moment you do a surgery. In fact, I showed you an example before. It was exactly the sum over n running from 1 up to k minus 1. And the sum over integer is actually truncated. So therefore, to compare, Hilbert space over 2 torus for WRT theory consists in SL2 case of a lattice divided by k times the lattice. k times the lattice and then there is of course action of the while group but for the z-hat invariance or z-hat tq of t the hilbert space over two torus consists of two copies of the lattice and there is no truncation so no truncation by level k is obvious because well we're working on generic q so there is no integer to truncate it by like here so that's not that's not surprising and in theory of quantum groups that's of course very expected but what's interesting and less expected Interesting and less expected, but again, you can actually trace it to some properties of quantum groups, is that there should be actually two copies of the lattice. So the Hilbert space, even for SL2, rank one, so here lambda is the weight lattice, consists of lambda cross lambda check. And this is interesting because that's beginning of connections to double affine Heke algebras, Langlands, duality, and many other things. Duality and many other things. And in any case, at a very basic pragmatic level, what we saw is summation over these two integers m and n is exactly summation over this two-dimensional lattice lambda times lambda ch. Now, this of course sits extremely well with description in terms of Chern-Simon's theory. WRT invariants have to do with Chern-Simon's theory for a compact group. In my case, it would be SU2. And as I mentioned earlier, this had TQ. As I mentioned earlier, this Zhat TQFT is supposed to be SL2C transients theory defined non-perturbatively. And in Transheimann's theory, the Hilbert space is always quantization of the moduli space of flat connections with the corresponding structure group. So when group is compact, the phase space is compact. For SU2, it would be maximal Cartan, which is circle times itself divided by the well group. And quantization of this, of course, gives us the Verlinde space, which The Verlinda space, which participates in cutting and bluing of Reshitikin derived invariants. In the SL2C case, the circles are replaced by C-star-valued holonomies along A and B cycle of the torus. The quantization of that, of course, is infinite-dimensional space, and in fact, it has precisely the basis labeled by two integers, or in slightly asymmetric form, one integer and one C-star-valued holonomy. It depends on your choice of polarization, but either way, you require. But either way, you recover the same Hilbert space that participates in the surgery formula. So, this was a slightly long detour in one definition of this invariance, which at the moment does not exist for general links, but it's clear that there is a lot that's working and should be generalized to more general cases. That's ongoing work. And it's based on surgeries and Based on surgeries and quantum groups at generic QN strands colored by Vermont modules. The second definition I want to mention a little bit briefly is something else. It's much more global. And to get to this definition, let's recall what we said about three-dimensional TQFT. If you have a three-dimensional TQFT, it's a good to think about Hilbert space associated to a two-sphere. Hilbert space associated to a two-sphere, or its trace would be invariant of S1 cross S2. So let's take a look now that computational tools are very powerful with these surgeries. What does Zhat TQFT produce for S1 cross S2? So first of all, there are infinitely many spin C structures on S1 cross S2. And there should be one variable x such that if you expand this in x in positive and negative powers of x, you get exactly this Q series associated to different choices. Is associated to different choices of spin C structure. So we see the familiar variable x, we see the familiar variable q, which is inside the unit disk. And here, when we were doing these computations with pay-point-roven wafer, we found it also convenient to introduce yet another variable t, which had the sense of refinement or perhaps is related to categorification. It was yet another equivariant parameter, so since we had the liberty to introduce So, since we had the liberty to introduce it, why not? Now, naturally, we can ask: what kind of object is this? And if it encodes a trace over Hilbert space over two-sphere, then can we see this as a Hilbert series for something? In other words, if I take this Hilbert space for two-sphere and try to take its spectrum, what's going to be the variety? And the underlying variety here is. line variety here is a catangent bundle to the fine Grassmannian, in this case Grassmannian for SL2, or you can also think of it as a Hitchen modula space of SU2 Higgs bundles on a formal disk, where parameter Q in this description has to do with the rotation symmetry of the disk. Or in a fine Grassmannian, parameter Q is a loop rotation, X has to do with Cartan of SL2 and variable T. Cell 2 and variable t, roughly speaking, has to do with the stretching of fibers, namely that we're working with catangent bundle rather than a fine Bristmanian itself. So therefore, another definition of this ZHAT2QFT is that it's Rosansky-Witten theory with a target space which is a hyperkeler manifold. I remind you that Rosansky and Witten proposed a general construction of TQFTs based on hyperkelier manifolds. Hyperkelier manifolds. And indeed, our target space is a hyperkillier manifold. And this theory was then mathematically defined by Konsevich, Kopranov, and others using rigorous mathematical tools. So therefore, you can try to define Zhat as such Rosansky within TQFT. And it has slightly different flavor from the definition based on surgeries that I gave you before. You before. It's now not very local in the sense that when we work in Roshitikian drive type definition with diagrams, for example, of knots on which we want to perform surgery, everything is fairly local. It's localized to crossings and local operations. In this theory, it's not exactly like that. And also, I want to mention that computations here are much harder. In particular, In particular, we managed to reproduce the answers for three-sphere length spaces, but of course, it's extremely hard to do surgeries on 10 crossing knots of the kind that I showed you before. So these approaches are expected to be equivalent. There is no proof. But and this is much more general. So in principle, you can try to crank this machine for any manifold, but in practice, the diagram. But in practice, the diagrammatic approach based on our matrices is much easier to implement. I'll have only one slide on physics of where it comes from. So like I mentioned, there is a lot of interesting physics from which many of this formulae that I showed you appear. So the corresponding system that realizes this in string theory. In string theory goes back to the 90s and can be looked at from various different perspectives. And depending on how you look at this system, you get either one description or the other. In particular, many of the explicit formulae that I showed you come from so-called 3D-3D correspondence. There is Rosansky-Wittlin perspective and some of the perspectives which need to be developed. So I'll pose this as open. So I'll pose this as open questions a bit later. Although this one recently produces structural properties and construction of FK similar to what we have seen in the case of not theory and categorification. So I have five minutes according to my timer. So I want to mention now: if you have a construction of this invariance, what should be the properties, or what can you do with this? namely, explore its dependence on either variable q. So again, to a given three manifold, it associates a collection of q series invariants. So you can ask as a function of q what kind of object it is. So far we only cared about topology or mostly cared about topology on quantum groups, but now you can ask about q dependence and you can actually now ask about dependence on this additional decoration beta, the choice of background structures. Of background structure, such as spin C structure. Regarding the latter, you can ask what other Q series invariants of three manifolds do I know, and especially what other spin C decorated invariants of three manifolds do I know. Inside the unit disk for generic values of Q, there is not much. So therefore, this Z hat TQFT seems to be really the new invariant. It's not re-expressing anything that we have seen before. Anything that we have seen before. But as Q goes to various roots of unity or various special values, it can actually be compared to other invariants. For instance, I already mentioned connection to Rishi-Ti-Kin-Turivan invariants at roots of unity, but more natural is actually connection to decorated TQFT. And as I mentioned briefly, and Francois, I will explain in much more detail, the TQFT, BCGP TQFT. BCGP TQFT is roughly speaking H1 decorated with coefficients in C star, whereas Z hat TQFT is decorated by spin C structures. So this does not depend on choice of spin structure, and this does. So you have to convert one to the other. And this is a very nice, beautiful relation, which again was the subject of this recent work on which I hardly can say anything and due to lack of time. But Francois will. Lack of time, but Francois will explain it in more detail. There are, of course, many other STQFTs that depend on spin or spin-C structure. For instance, the Zethadin variants, when Q is near zero, are related to correction terms of Hugo's fluoride homology labeled by Spin C structures. When Q goes to one, they're related to derived torsion, which is also labeled by Spin C structures. Here, in all of these cases, you don't really have to sum over spin C structures. To sum over speed C structures, and at q equals y, you get a relation to Rochn invariant. Now, the second and last property that I'm going to mention is related to Q dependence. So, like I said, on many knots, pretty much on every knot up to 10 crossings, you can compute this invariance for very short juries. In fact, now you can relax the positivity of the quadratic form which we used and do computations for both original. Computations for both a regional manifold and minus itself, which means that at the level of surgery coefficients, you're flipping their signs. So let's compute this invariant for surgery on trefoil node and figure 8 node. In fact, with different surgery coefficients, you can verify topological invariance that these two different nodes give you the same manifold, and invariant comes out to be the same. And for minus the manifold, you get this. So, one thing I invite you to do is to So one thing I invite you to do is to take the value of Q in the first expression, now written as a Q hypergeometric series, flip it to 1 over Q, and try to multiply numerator and denominator so that everything again looks in terms of Q rather than 1 over Q. What you're going to find is exactly this expression. So therefore, what's happening here is that this invariance, Q series invariance of three manifolds labeled by spin C structures have the following property that reversing oriented Property that reversing orientation of a three-manifold is exactly going outside the unit disk and inside the unit disk. It's basically replacing Q by Q inverse. So of course, it would be extremely helpful for topology to go and do this for general three manifold. But what's really working here under the hood is a special property of this as a Q series, namely we're using some information as what kind of function of Q it is. kind of function of Q it is. And this is where it's extremely helpful to know the answer to this question, which at present is not known, but again, it's a lot of work is going into this direction to try to identify modular properties of these Q-series invariants. For simple manifolds where these first answers were computed, they quickly reproduce familiar characters of logarithmic vertex algebras. So they're not exactly modular. So they're not exactly modular, they're mock modular or even high depth modular, where we don't always know what kind of logarithmic C of T it is. But having the answer to this question, of course, is extremely important also for topology for this reversing orientation issue. And finally, I want to conclude with a list of open questions. I mentioned quite a few of them already. So here there are many more. Originally, we suspected that this Z-Helphin variant should be. That heter invariant should be not only of the same type, but actually related to Waffa-Witten invariants. This is discussed in the original paper with Paigel and Kumran. One expects some categorification many of the same properties that one sees for not homologies. In fact, there are many hints for that. So currently, at least one of the definitions that's based on surgeries is developed far enough that it's right time to start coding it. And in fact, like I mentioned, even before. In fact, like I mentioned, even with Chiprian, we were using computer codes which were a little bit clumsy, but everything is fairly systematic and explicit that it can be easily coded. So it would be nice to develop it further, streamline. There are many questions about modularity or computing this from various different perspectives and so on. So thank you very much for your time and I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. And let's unmute ourselves and give Sagan applause. So thank you very much. And we have some time for questions. Tudor has a question. Do you want to unmute yourself or to ask it in the chat? Sure, I'll unmute myself. Oh sure I'll unmute myself. Thanks for good. Thanks a lot for the talk. I was wondering if you had tried to compute the R matrix of or braiding of knots in this Rosansky-Witten theory to whose target is the FNGRSH-Mannian. It seems like a really hard thing to do, but I don't think so. Actually, yes, this is Part of the ongoing project with Kole Rishitikin and Bore Fagin. So we actually tried, and it seems that it's not too difficult. So that would be going toward proving equivalence of these two approaches that I mentioned in the talk. Yeah, that's a very good question. And it's actually not, I think it's not that hard. So, yeah. So I hope on the next occasion. So, I hope on the next occasion I can give a talk precisely about that. It's a great question. Okay, thanks. Leonard, you have another question. Yes, so in what sense your state sum converges at the unit circle? You mentioned that you reproduce with an HTLDRF invariant, but you also mentioned that it doesn't make sense. Mention that it doesn't make sense on the unit circle for Q. That's right. So that's, I guess you're asking about this theorem and there are two elements here. So first of all, it's a bottom line. I mean the bottom line. Oh, this line. So, well, actually, there are two lines, and both of them are interesting. And both of them are interesting. So, you're asking really, really good questions. So, in the case of this family, such as plumbing or surgeries on double twist knots and something like that, so in each case, we can actually prove that it converges again inside the unit disk. So that's this part. And then ask what happens as Q goes to root of unity. So it's true that it's not a typo, that here I mentioned Q strictly less than one. Mentioned q strictly less than one in absolute value because sometimes it doesn't actually converge on the root of unity. And that's exactly the issue that will be important in answering your question. So sometimes it just blows up if we try to take a limit to root of unity. But first of all, when this happens, actually, I don't have a good control over. It seems that it's nicer than was expected. But another nice feature. But another nice feature is that these coefficients which are used to repackage this to sum over spin C structures to produce, for example, a Richet interrupt invariant, which doesn't depend on anything on the three manifold, are such that even if a couple of these individual Q series invariants are diverging for different spin C structures, their sum somehow is converging. So definitely something nice is going on. Something nice is going on. I only have understanding of this at a very technical level, for example, the level that goes in the proof of this particular theorem. And there are a couple of analogs for, again, surgeries on double twist knots and things like that. But I don't really have a good conceptual answer. In some sense, we'll see something similar in relation to CGP invariance, where again, there is a sum over spin-C structures, but Spin C structures, but the SAM does not get rid of this information completely. So it's still repackaging them for different SPI C structures, but it's not just fully summed spin C structure, as is in Rushdikin Duraev case. And I think looking more closely at those cases should shed light on exactly these convergence issues and why certain combinations are beautifully. Are beautifully convergent after we do the summation. So, that I don't fully understand. To me, it's nice, but and then may I ask a second question? So, is the connection with 3D index of the effect? Yes, so in GPPV, we mention connection. So, there are two versions of a Are two versions of a 3D index. So there is one that includes only irreducible flat connections and based on triangulation. That's what we worked out at some point with Tudor and Davide. And then there is a 3D index of a full 3D theory, T of M3 related file 3D, 3D correspondence that also includes a billion flight connections. So the second one is The second one is basically decomposed into product of Z hat times another Z hat. So it's bilinear in Z hat. So here a relation to our T invariance involves just summing over spin structures. But in that case, we're summing over spin structures and taking roughly Z hat squared or two of them in a way that's very similar to appearance of holomorphic blocks and many other things in vortex partition functions in 3D. Vortex partition functions and 3D-3D correspondence. But it's important that that relation, which again, many examples are here in this paper with Pay, Pushroff, and Waff. In fact, for these plumbing manifolds, you have a complete, you can also try to make it into Ethereum. There is complete information there, but it's crucial that we use the full index that takes care of all flat connections. There should be relation also to the DG. Also, to the DGG index, but I personally haven't explored this. So it's a good question. May I ask another question? Oh, sorry. Okay. So, Sergei, so there are also refinements of the Witten-Richigen-Deriv invariants, which depend on spin structure or the cohomo.
