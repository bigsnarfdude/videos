I'm really happy to be here, head to head up to. So, I'm going to talk about. So, I'm going to talk about joint work with Tina Gerhardt and Vaikil. And I should emphasize this is work in progress. So, there are still a lot of unanswered questions here. And you should take the results with a grain of salt, because we're still kind of writing things up and double-checking things. So, there's two stories, two main themes to this talk that I want to discuss. So, one has to do with So one has to do with the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm and this sort of like version of the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm for complex lead groups, which at least you can define for S1. And then the other story is this connection to bit vectors. So let me start with the norm story. And so I'm just going to recall Look all some work. Engels by Bloomberg, Kenhart, Hill, Watson, all of whom are at this conference. And so, yeah, so what they do is they suggest that they're going to be able to do What they do is they suggest the following definition for the norm from the trivial group to S1. And actually, let me say the more general version for norming from some nth roots of unity to S1. So the norm from the nth roots of unity to S1 of R, where, so R is going to be an associative Cn ring spectrum. Then, this norm can be defined in the following way. So, you're going to do this kind of twisted version of the cyclic bar construction. And then, so if you've seen these Hill-Hopkins-Ravenal norms before, you know, there should be some change of universe, which is an equivalence of categories, so sometimes it doesn't actually appear in the notation. But so, let me fix some universes. U is going to be a complete. Some universes, u is going to be a complete S1 universe, and U tilde is going to be the restriction to Cn of that universe. So then we're going to first apply U tilde to R infinity, so this is the trivial universe. And then on the outside, we'll go from R infinity to U. And I should say what this twisted cyclic bar construction is. And so I expect that the cyclic bar construction is already known. So it's been talked about before. And so I'm just going to say what's different about it here. So the difference is that when you look at the n simplices of this, so I want to, let me just call this U tilde. I'm going to, for the sake of writing this whole thing out, I'm going to call it that R tilde. So the n simplices of this are going to be n plus 1 smash factors of r. And then we have a, so the same thing is going to be true for the n minus 1 simplices. For the n minus 1 samples, you also have some smash. And so there's, so for the dn, you have to incorporate a twist. So this dn you write as, at first you do 1, smash 1, and then smash g, and then you cyclically permute, and then you apply to 0, where g is the canonical generator. I'm sorry, I. Generator. I'm sorry, I'm realizing I'm sort of switching between notations, so I should be more careful. Sorry. So, yeah, so mu n is the cyclic group of the grad. Okay, and g is going to be the canonical generator of mu n. Fuck it. All right, so this is the twisted cyclic bar construction, which you can use to define this norm. And in order to really think of it as a norm, you In order to really think of it as a norm, you want to prove something about this. And so, what they prove is that this norm, so if you think of it as a functor from commutative ring spectra indexed on this u tilde, our Cn commutative ring spectra, and then going to commutative ring spectra, and then that's commutative S1 ring spectra. Commutative S1 ring spectra indexed on u, then this is left adjoint to the restriction functor. So since that's left adjoint to restriction. So this is one of the properties you might ask for a Hill-Hopkins rather non-linear to have. And then, moreover, they And then, moreover, they also show that this, so in the case when you're going from the trivial subgroup, then this is a model for THH, which is what we've seen in some other talks. And in fact, they also construct a cyclotomic structure on this. And so here I'm writing THH for the Boxchan model of Of THH. So I'm not going to go into that into details there, but that's also a slip atomic spectrum. And then, so, and then there was, yeah, and then this was proven to be a names in here. So, Dotto, Malkovich, Pachgoria, Segave, and Wu showed that this is actually an equivalence as. Equivalence as genuine cyclotomic spectra. And so here I'm using the term genuine just to distinguish it from the notion of cyclotomic spectra that's usually so I'm using it in the sense that Nicholas and Schulze use it. Okay. So great. So that's so that's right. So this is really like a nice model for This is really like a nice model for THH. And okay. Yeah, so then Yeah, so then so then one other thing I want to say here is they so A B G H L N they also show that when you restrict to let's say that H, the subgroup of G is a subgroup of S1. So we know that these are always going to be cyclic subgroups, so you could take H to be Cn. Or yeah, I realized again, I'm sort of switching between notation topologies. Notation, all of these. So, anyway, I was using UXCN for a long time, and then I started using UN. I think this is a nice notation that actually, because of JD and Jay Shah's paper, I think that it still kind of adjusted to that apologies. Okay. But yeah, so anyways, if we restrict to h of the norm from g minus 1. So, this is the same input as at the beginning, then you have something that I think of as like a multiplicative double coset formula for this. So, this is equivalent to the, yeah, so I guess maybe I also should assume that R has some kind of fineness condition. So, let me not go into that point, but so you have. But so you have the norm from g to h of r smash with smash over the norm from g to h of r smash r i with the norm from g to h of r. But then you you twist, oh sorry, did I swap my oh geez, okay, sorry swaps. Okay, so then you let G be a canonical generator of this group G, which is also going to be cyclic. And then, so what is this twist? So, ah yeah, sorry, so yeah, so this twist is given by Yeah, sorry, so that's the version one of the state. Sorry. Sorry, yeah, I think I would prefer to say this differently. Apologies. So you can think of this as the cyclic bar construction, this G-twisted cyclic bar. It's G-twisted cyclic part construction. H G of R H G of R twisted by G. Sorry. Okay, anyways. All right, so that that is the sort of background on this. Theory of norming up to S1. And then let me talk a little bit about what we've shown in this area. Okay. So is that I G, is that restriction to G the IG? What's in the beginning? What's the first? Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm taking note one a little bit. So this is then. Sorry, yeah, yeah. So this was. I guess the way I defined this already had a twist by G, and so. What are you asking about the restriction? Oh, this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Oh, sorry. Get it. Okay. Easier question than I thought. But what just happened on the right-hand side? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the six. Yeah, yeah, so the the cyclic bar construction already had this like twisted bimodule coordinate in it and I think it so I just don't want to talk about what we can say for O2 spectra. So, first, so first we're going to be So, first, we're going to be thinking about, instead of associative algebras, so we're going to be thinking about R being an E sigma algebra. And I don't want to go into too many details here. I'll say a little bit more about what it means to be an E sigma algebra in IP functors. Well, not too much more, but anyways. So, consequently, what do you have? Well, the restriction to E of R To E of R is going to be in E1 algebra. And then the norm from E to C2 of the restriction E of R is going to act on the restriction E of R. And then when you restrict this whole thing to E, or sorry, I don't want to have a restriction now. But when you restrict this to E, then you get the usual R smash, R off bimodal action on the. Baroff bimodal action on R. But that will come up later for Mappy Functors, so let me not go into that too much. But so with this setup, then you can define the following. So now R is going to be an E sigma algebra in spectra. So, or sorry, I should say sigma is the sine representation. Representation, and this is an NC2 structure. And also, I mean, maybe let me say it from the beginning. So we're going to be working with this group O2, and this is an extension of C2 of S1 by C2. And so I'm writing C2 for the subgroup, which is generated by generated by 0, 1, 1, 0. So we call this alpha. And then for this, the other copy of C, or well there's more than one copy of C2, but you also have the roots of unity sitting in here, and that's the mu n. So that's the reason for the distinction between these two. So then we can define then the norm from C2 to O. The norm from C2 to O2 of R in the following way. So we define this to be, so now we're going to take the dihedral bar construction. And I'll say a little bit about what that is in a second. So you take the dihedral bar construction of something. And so again, I'm going to have to fix some universes. So let me let W be a complete A complete O2 universe, and then W tilde be the restriction to C2 of the IO2 universe. Then we can take this change of universe functor, which again is an equivalence of categories, apply that to R, and then on the outside. And then on the outside, we again take a change of universe. And so that's a definition of this norm. So this would not be a very good definition. I mean, so far as just, I mean, we're just renaming things if we couldn't really prove anything about it. So let's see what we can prove about it. So yeah, so we can prove that sort of analogous theorem to what we just saw for those results we just saw for it from Engelweit, Bloomberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson, et al. So now we're going to be in the So now we're going to be in commutative ring spectra with a C2 action indexed on W tilde. And then going to commutative ring spectra with an O2 action indexed on W. And then again, we have in a junction like so. So norm from C2 to O2 is left adjoint to So you might not be happy with just having a left adjoint. You might prefer to have a left quillen adjoint. And because that's something else you have in this other setting. And getting it to be a quillen adjoint is like coordinate progress. Okay. So in particular, So, in particular, so this is going to follow from the following formula. So, you might be familiar with the thinking of THH as tensoring with S1. So, one way to think about THR we claim is to think of it as. Oh, yeah, I guess I haven't said much about TR to HR yet, but we'll call it. Okay, but so you can, so this is. So this is uh R tensor over C two with O2 and I'm going to say that over here So so okay, so basically what you do Basically, what you do is you do the usual kind of thing when you want to define like a relative tensor product. So, you define this as the equalizer of two maps. Actually, we want to look at these in a second. So, you can think of this as the norm from E to C2 of the restriction of R tensor with O2. And then, so that action of the norm from E to C2 with restriction of R on R that you get from having any sigma algebra gives you a map here. So that's the one map. And then the other map, you can rewrite this as R times R C2 cos O2. And then C2, of course, acts on O2. So you have a map like so. Okay, and so then you take the equalizer of this. So then you take the equalizer of this. Co-equalizer. Oh, sorry, yeah, thank you. Co-equalizer. And then you can change universe. And that's how we define this set. R tensor versus Okay, and then essentially what happens is that when you prove this, this is going to imply this previous term. And then moreover, so this is the thing I just alluded to earlier, so that you can show that this norm from C2 to O2 is a model for THR. So I mean, this is sort of, I guess this is sort of clear from the dihedral bar construction version definition. If you're familiar with THR, so this is a combo. So this is equivalent to THR, where now this is the, thinking of using Blochsted's model, or what I'll call the Bochsted model, but this was really defined by Hessebolt and Madsen. And this equivalence, at the moment we can show this is an equivalence as for an R equivalence where R is the family of subgroups O2. O2 such that H intersects us one should be. And I realized that I did not say what the dihedral bar construction is. I apologize for that. So this is something that came up earlier. So the dihedral bar construction, let me just add that in here too. So the dihedral bar construction. So that I'm just going to That, I'm just going to give a quick picture for that. So you have R tilde, R tilde smash 2, R tilde smash 3. And so if you're familiar with THH, you know that you have these extra automorphisms coming from the cyclic structure on THH. So that would give you CN actions on each of these. That's one way to think about it. And then in the dihedral setting, we have instead D2N actions. D2n actions. So D2, D4, D6, where D6 for D2N is going to be the extension of mu n by this by C2 sitting inside of O2. And let me not say more than that for now. Just, I mean, you can see. You can say this in terms of simplicial maps plus some extra relations, but this is a sort of simple picture to symbolize. Okay. Yeah, sorry, any questions? At the bottom there, you were saying that that's an equivalence for that family, is that? Yeah, that's right. So it's actually So for the regular, if we just put the dihedral bar construction here and show that's equivalent, you can show that that's equivalent to the Bogsten model on MC2 fixed points. At least this is what Dotto, Moya, and Pachgoria do. And then you can, it's not too hard to generalize what they do to get it up to be an R equivalence, because all these subgroups are subgroups of order two and they're conjugate. So yeah, we'd like to know that it's actually. Yeah, we'd like to know that it's actually an equivalence for the family of finite subgroups. And I have some ideas about how to do that, but haven't been able to do it yet. Although I guess there's something to be said for also just showing it for this family R, because if you think about the perspective of like Quigley and Shot, then there you really just care about naive S1 equivariance and genuine C2 equivariance for any, for essentially for this family. Essentially, for this family. So maybe there's something to be said for this being as much as you need. Okay. And then, so we can also show a little bit of a map. Also, show a sort of double, a multiplicative double coset formula. So, first, I want to just recall something that's proven by Dotto by Achoria. So they show that's THR R and when you restrict to C2. Now when you restrict to C2, that this is equivalent to R smash over the norm from E to C2, the restriction E to R over R. And then again, here we need R to E flat, suitably flat. So you have to make sense of in what category it's flat, but we not to deal with that. So you have this sort of, think of this again as a multiplicative double coset formula. A multiplicative double coset formula. And then we have an extension of this to any dihedral group. So, or actually, I should, sorry, I should say, at the moment we're pretty sure about what happens for dihedral groups of the form 2p to the k when p is odd. And we have some ideas about how to do this when when p is even, but let me not stick that respect. It'll be a little bit different. It'll be a little bit different. So if we restrict to d2p, to the k of this norm, of r, then this is equivalent to the following. So yeah, so let me give two descriptions, one in the flat case and one in the not flat case. So first, if you're not necessarily flat, then it's in terms of this. Then it's in terms of this two-sided R construction. Sorry, I keep forgetting to put the stars, but okay, so and then so as we saw. And then, so as we saw for norming from Cn to S1, we had some kind of twist. And here we have a different kind of twist, but you should also twist by something. So here it's twisted by beta to the p to the k minus 1 over 2. Where now I'm writing beta for the canonical generator of mu p to the k sitting inside of t to p to the k. And then we can tell. And then we can tell the penalties. So then, in addition, so when R is flat, then this left-hand side is equivalent to norm C2D2P to the K R smash over norm U to D to P to K. Restriction R norm C2 D 2 P to K R and the R and then the same twist. Yeah, apologies if that's not readable. But yeah, so this sort of construction will come up again. And there's something I haven't explained here, so I need to explain what this twist is. So the twist is the following. So we take the norm. So in particular, this is going to be a left action of this group, or of this ring spectrum on this spectrum. And so what do you do? You take the norm from e to t to p to the k of restriction r and then you can act And then you can act by the Weyl group, by beta to the P d minus one over two. And then you can apply, so yeah, so then you, this is isomorphic to the norm from C2 to D to B to the K of the norm from B to C2 of the restriction of R. And then, so I'm And then, sorry, I'm running out of room here, but then you apply the norm to the action map you have of this on R. And that's this module action. And then in this other case, I mean, you also have to say how this is a left or a right module over this. And there you just do these first two maps. Yeah, I'm sorry. Um yeah, I'm sorry. So from this description, I guess it's not clear that this is a left action, but you just have to put in this match factor of this on each of these and then have the identity and then you add. But maybe since I already drew this picture, I won't do that. Okay. So this is where you're using the structure. Exactly. E sigma structure. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So this last map is coming from the E-Sigma infrastructure. Okay, so this is sort of like the break midway. Then I'm going to kind of shift gears a little bit. So any other questions? Okay. So yeah, so then I'd like to say how these norms connect up with These norms connect up with the fit vectors. So, first, let me just recall a little bit about bit vectors for associative rings. I'm not going to say too much. But just so you have some background in the original settings. So this is going to be a different construction than this construction that you saw earlier in Thomas Nikolaus's talk. This is going to be the construction originally due to Hasselholtz of vectors of associative rings. And I'm not going to give it explicitly, but I'll just say some properties, basically. So let's slat A be an associative ring. And it doesn't assume unital, but for today we can assume unital. We can assume intal. And then we define W1 of A to be A mod the commutator, which is also known as the change group of A. Yeah, and actually let me put Lars Hesselholt's name at the top of the board, because I think he's like the godfather of method vectors. I I I would like to say though, probably just to say I'm interested to see if you can spot it. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it'd be interesting to see if we can adapt the stuff that what I'm talking about, the stuff I'm talking about today, to that setting as well. Okay, so anyway, so I'm not gonna say too much about what how you can actually construct WNOVA, but the thing is what you have is that this sense initial exact sequence. Is that distance in a short exact sequence, sort of as you might expect? And so you have a restriction map, and you have like a reshiva map, and you have the short exact sequence, but it's sort of different than the commutative setting, if you're familiar with that, because this doesn't split even as underlying sets. Even as underlying sets. So it's a little bit strange. But it's not sure it's quite always injective. Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Uh so then you can define W of A as the limit of the s of a file. So W of A is the one that you add over the restrictions. And then I want to sort of repackage that theorem that Husselholt proves in a way that makes it more clear how it's related to what I'm going to talk about later. So he shows that if you take pi 0 and you take the C P to the N Machiefuncours, that he added that course of T of J to A, and then you apply that to Cp Bn not C P V D N then that's isomorphic to W n plus V. So this is not how it's framed originally, but this is a way to think about it that connects up more with what we're talking about. Okay. Alright, so then uh then in the last uh couple years, um so Bloomberg, Gerhard, Helen Wasson defined some notion of fit vectors for associative monoids in Machiefunctors instead. So first of all, let me just remark that let's say g is a finite. Let's say G is a, G is a finite, or should we say H, H is a finite group. Then the category of mackerel functors is symmetric monoidal with the box product, which you can define as a left con extension or like deconvolution, however you want to think about it. And then the unit is the burn-side Nache factor. And so. And so it's a symmetrical nodal category, and then so associative monoids in this category are called associated green complex. Okay. And so then what you can do is you can sort of mimic the construction of the norm from u n to s1, but in this algebraic world, and then you get a definition of more causal homology for associative green functors. So let's let H be a subgroup of G, and that's a subgroup of S1. Then Then work I got also then let's select just n minus the associative H mapping functor or its associative H green functor, then you can define, or actually I didn't write their names on the board yet, but so this won't work. Gerhardt, Hill, and Lawson define the following. Oh geez, this is apologies for the boardwork. So they define the following. So you do the same sort of construction where you take E sick G, pull it. But you do this in the category of Machifunctors. So I guess I should say what the norm is in Machiefunctors. One simple way to define it is to just take the eye-bring-mclaim spectrum of your Machiefunctor and then apply the norm and then apply pi zero. So that gives you a norm that's integral to machine functions. So we're going to do this and then Do this, and then this gives you a simplicial Machief. Then, in their paper, they develop some language for homological algebra and Machifunctors. So, you can take the alternating sign-chain complex and then take homology. So, let me just write this for you. Okay, so in particular, you can show them so this is not just 880, it's like all It's not just H80, it's like all H8000. Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So then you can show that this recovers pi 0 of this relative th. So then pi 0 g of th, or let me just, I think I just called it the norm before ourselves. I think I just called it the norm before, so we'll stick with that. So this norm from H to S1 of A, where A is again going to be an associative H rate spectrum. And so this pi zero is isomorphic to H H zero G. G of pi zero h of it. So the pi zero, the h mackey functor, pi zero is going to be, I think that's going to be associated with green functor in this case. And then you can define this. So this is the sense in which this, so then yes, then we we call this thing the vectors for green functors. For green collectors. So yeah, so this allows you to define something that you could call the vet vectors for radio numbers. Okay, so Okay, so this is the end of the background section from this half of the talk. Any questions about that? Okay, so then what do we do? So first of all, you need to talk about what the sigma algebra is in Machu functors. And I'll be a little more specific than I was before, although it's basically the same data. I just didn't say I wanted to axiom, so I just said the ones that were. So they said the ones that were needed. So any sigma algebra and C2 Machiefunctors essentially consists of the following data. So sorry. So first I should say it's consists of a C2 magu functor. And that this has to satisfy the following. So when you apply C2 mod E, then this is going to be an associative rank. And the norm, or sorry, and then m is a norm from E to C2 restriction to E of M module. And so such that when you apply, yeah, so this is just say So, this module structure is going to look something like this. And when you apply this to C2 mod E, so let's do that on either side. Then, because Then, because we're applying this to C2 mod E, it's the same as if we restricted to E. And there, the box product is just the tensor product. So then it's quite easy. And when you restrict to E on this, you get E M C two E tensor E M four E two E up and then tensor. Tensor M C2E, and then that into M C2E. And now we have an associative ring, and then this is just going to be the usual bimodule structure of this on. And then there's one other condition, which I guess I'm just going to write here. Apologies, but it's because it's short. So 1 in m C2 plus C2. M C2 on C2 restricts to 1 and C2. And right, so you have some kind of unitality condition for E sigma algebra and spectra, but I just kind of didn't discuss that part. And yeah, so these E sigma algebras and MACI functors actually recovers a notion of Actually, it recovers a notion of that was previously defined in Dotto and Ogle, a paper by Dotto and Ogle, which is the notion of a Hermitian Machi functor. So these first two conditions imply that you're a Hermitian Machi functor in their sense. And then we ask for this one extra unitality condition. So then this is the structure that we need to apply some sort of algebraic version of THR. So, or to input into some algebraic version of THR. So then So then, so we define HR E dn. And again, let me just focus on P odd, where the two primary story will be a bit different. And so, and then let's say that M is a desigma idea in C2 Machi functors. Then we define this in a similar way to that construction we saw earlier in the talk. So this is going to be a two-sided bar construction from C2 to D2P to the N of M U R from E to D two P to the N. E of D 2P to the M, constriction E of M, and then norm C2 D2B of the M of M. And then this is a simplicial object, so then we can use this same sort of machinery where you take the alternating sign-chain complex and then apply homology, and I'll just write that. What's up? What are this? Oh, yes, that's important. Twist. Oh, yes, that's important. Of course, yeah, yeah. Thank you. So, yeah, you also have this twist, which is very important. Yes. So, and that twist is defined in the same way as before. Should I remind you how that went? Okay. So, so you multiply by this element, and then and then you do the individual action. Okay. But it's but otherwise it's it's pretty formalized. But it's but otherwise it's it's pretty formal and pretty simple. Okay, so yeah. Yeah, so then we can think of these things Yeah, so right I think I did not emphasize this point enough earlier on. So the case I would like to make here The case I would like to make here is that since THR is the norm from some subgroup of O2 up to O2, it makes a lot of sense to define bit vectors in this setting in an analogous way to how they define bit vectors for some norm from a subgroup of S1 to S1. So, this is, maybe this was clear, but I want to really emphasize this fact. And like, this is sort of like the Sort of like the main point. Yeah, so in particular, yeah, we also have that, I mean this is this is not that hard to show, but pi zero of sort of dp to the p to the n the norm from c2. A. So let's say A is in this eastern algebra in the C2 spectrum. Then this pi zero can be recovered by HH0 C2i. Oh, sorry, I should say feature. I should say if you do. All right. So moreover, you also, I mean, you have all these nice structure maps for vit vectors, and so you'd like to have similar structure maps here. Yeah, yeah, that's how we think about it. Yeah, and then I mean I guess we simultaneously think about this as like real Haushmont homology, but then you could also think of this as the fit vectors for Hermitian Machiavectors or the fit vectors for single-tracement Machi functors. Oh, sorry, that wasn't with another notational switch I made. Another notational switch I made at some point. And so I was writing dp to the n for the group or 2p to the n. At some point I switched to 2p to the n. And so yeah, I apologize for that. Anything else on the board? Okay. Alright. So then, yeah, so I just wanted to say a little bit about some of the, at least one structure map that you have here. I mean, maybe I won't go into too much into the construction map. Um I mean maybe I won't go into too much into the construction of it, but when you have a sort of restriction map when you apply dp to the n not dp dn, and this is going to go to h r 0 plus dp dn pi 0 plus 2 a d to the end mod. Can do the end of it. Minus one, start at minus one. And I, okay, and you're laughing at me because I switched back again. All right. So yeah, you have a restriction map. So for Mackie functors, you already have what's analogous to the Vershibung and the Frobenius. So those sort of come for free, but this restriction map is something special that you get in the setting. But yeah, you can construct this restriction map essentially by sort of mimicking. Essentially, by sort of mimicking the construction you do for geometric fixed points, but in this macu functor setting. And the construction here is the same as what they do in their paper, essentially. But the nice thing here is that we don't just have a restriction map here. We also can think of that this is also compatible with the restriction and transfer. Yeah, yeah, I guess you yeah, I mean you don't need to put this macu functor in, but you stick with that for now. So this is so these these restriction maps are compatible with that. So I just want to make sure I have this right session minus one. This should be mu mu. So yeah, so these restriction maps are compatible with restriction and transfer. And so you can define, so I'm going to define some vid vectors of E sigma algebra and Machiave functors. Yeah, so sorry, you didn't really need to apply this. Really need to apply this specific MACU functor, but I mean, it's a price is, I don't know, it's fine. So, this is going to be the limit in the category of C2 Mackie functors of the restriction of this diagram. So I didn't want to rewrite that. So, you take the limit over the restriction maps here in C2 Mackey functors, and then In C2 Machiefunctors, and then that gives you some Machu functors. So, in particular, you start with any sigma algebra in Machu functors, and your output is a C2 Machie functor, which is sort of what you would expect from these associative vit vector constructions. So, this is a functor from sigma algebras. Here, means this one. So, algebras, sin algebras, map functors to do math functions. All right, any other questions? Okay, so then I'm not really sure exactly how I'm doing time, but five minutes, perfect. Okay, so I'd like to end by saying a little bit about how you can By saying a little bit about how you can compute this. So, yeah, so let me say how this goes for HR0 at D2PN of the constant magu functor H7. Okay, so Okay, so first of all, in the construction, you had to take this norm from C2 to P to the N. And so you're going to need to see how to compute that norm for A to Z. And yeah, so you might be familiar with this work of Kristen Maser, where she gives some explicit constructions of the norms for cyclic groups of order P to the N. For cyclic groups of order p to the n. But it's not really known how to do this for d2p to the n. And we thought quite a bit about how to do this, and we're still like a little stuck on something. So if you have ideas about that, I'd be interested to hear. But then Mike Hill suggested this trick, which is nice, for computing this a different way. So let me just say something about that. So we'd like to compute this, but first we need to compute the norm from C2 to D2P to the n. C2 to the T, two P to the N. So first. You just need Z, not H C. No, I mean H C. Oh, sorry, Z. Sorry. No, no, no. I'm not going to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you were saying just Z and not underline Z. Okay. So this is a nice trick that I'd like to advertise. I think it's probably a little trick that Mike. Little trick that Mike suggested. So, what you can do is you can take the constant Machu factor Z, and you can resolve that by the Burnside ring, or the Burnside Machine factor, as I. So you have this map 2 minus C2. And then you might want to just apply the norm here and try and compute something that way. But the problem is the the norm is not going to be well behaved with these like exact sequences. These like exact sequences. So instead, you use this, you know, the usual gold-Kant correspondence. So you throw in, but kind of in the reverse array that's usually used. So you throw in some extra degeneracy, so that you have Bernstein-Machufunctor, Burnside-Mackefunctor, and then you have a split co-equalizer, like so. And so you have one direxon, two. 1 for X on 2, 1 for X C 2, and the restriction, and then you just include into the first factor. Or the second factor. Okay, so then we have a sifted co-limit, and norms commute with sifted co limits. So that's good. So then we can apply the norm. Okay, so this so the the the co-equalizer is going to be the thing that we're after. The thing that we're after. So I should say, well, yeah. So now there's some things that you have to compute. And so first you need to, right, so we know what this is. We know that this is just going to be the Burnside vacuum functor for d2p to the n. So that's nice. But here you have to do a little trick first. But here you have to do a little trick first. So you think of this direct sum as the Burnside Machu functor box product with the Machu functor represented by just two elements where I'm going to start to abbreviate a little bit. So this is, these are really two C2 mod C2s, but I'm just going to write A. And what is this representing object? So A. Object, so a subaxis for some C2 set is going to be the Burnside Machu functor, or yeah, sorry, the Burnside-Machufunct of X plus Machu functor. But then this is the unit of this metropolitan product, so this part is going to go away. And so then we're going to compute C2D2P to the N of A B. And so yeah, you have to compute this. And the have to compute this. And it turns out to be essentially the representing object by, like if you took the norm in C2 sets from C2 to DP to PvN. But then you have to compute what this actually is. So what is that? So first of all, this has trivial action, so you can quotient here. Trivial action, so you can quotient here at GPVN. And then, so then maps here are going to be, you can take, yeah, any map will, like, you'll send some subset of this to A and then the rest of it to B. So this is going to be equivalent, it's isomorphic to a power set on D2, P to the N. On C2. On C2. And this construction is actually natural in this variable, so then you get as this is an isomorphism as dp2p to the n sets. Okay, so then you have to rewrite this as in terms of d2p to the n sets. And so you have two fixed points coming from the empty set and the whole set. So that gives you two copies of d2p to the n. T2p to the n by T2P to the N. And then the remainder, like you could have some other interesting things showing up if there were other normal groups between these two, but there aren't any. So the remainder is going to be a bunch of copies of D2P to the N. And then you take a coproduct of, I mean, you have to. I mean, you have to have a cardinality match up, and so you do 2 to the p to the n minus 2 over 2 to the m. So yeah, so then, yeah, I guess since I'm out of time, let me just say what the answer is. So you finish computing this, and you know it's going to be some quotient of this Fernstein Machiefunctor, and it's going to end up being the quotient by certain maps, and so I'll say that in a second. Maps, and so I'll say that in a second by sort of an equalizer. But then the action of the vial group is going to be trivial on that. And so when you compute HH0, because the action of the vial group is trivial, and because we're in this commutative setting, then HH0 will just be isomorphic to the norm. So this is going to be isomorphic to this norm I was just computing. And what do you end up getting? Well, you end up getting maps. I'm just going to write it in the abbreviated form. So I'm just going to write it in a negative form. So you have maps D2 B to the N A to B C two minus maps C2 D2A to the N C2. And so anyway, so that's a competition. And then maybe I'll impact it all. Questions? Questions? So just for ordinary PTIP we could do this is that the foreseeable web map depends on a choice of rubber for MISER, which typically we don't think of because we choose companies. I wonder if these uh but also I mean, I guess I assumed the version would just be the transfer. But I'm not sure what choice ends up. But yeah, I'm not sure how to see it from that perspective. Other questions? Why do you have to assume that he is odd in all that he's just a little bit? Is odd? Ah, good question. So, yeah, so you don't have to assume P is odd, but the picture is just very different at the point two. So, we have an idea of what might be happening there. So, one thing that you can say is that this coefficient where you're twisting, you could, at least for like D6, I've checked this explicitly, you could also think of that instead of the norm from C2 to D2P to the n with a twist, you could think of it as the norm from From the conjugate of C2 by beta to d2p to the n. And those two things would be equivalent. And at the prime 2, I think you need to do this conjugate thing. And so the reason for that is, so if you look at, you want to look at the zero simplices in this R construction. And so let's say. And so let's say this is the case I've thought about a little bit more. So if you have mu at mu4 somewhere product C2, so CFD8, then you see that the Z mod2 action actually keeps one of these two copies, keeps, has fixed points for one of these two copies, and then the other one, there's no fixed points. There's no fixed points. So these are the, think of these as the two zero simpleses, and the zero simplices in this setting are going to be each g minus sets, right? So you have the zero simplicies coming from this. Yeah, so here what we think is happening is that you have the zero simplices are D8 mod mu4 for this blue piece, but then for the other one, you have d8 mod D4. And I think I said that right. And I think I said that right. So that's what you have like a copy of like as a as a D8 set you have a copy of like C2 plus C2 for these four and then for the other one you have this other this other coset. So it just behaves a little bit differently in that setting, but we haven't completely worked it all. Thanks. Okay, thank you again. And our next talk will be at the three blocks. And our next tribe will be at three o'clock.
