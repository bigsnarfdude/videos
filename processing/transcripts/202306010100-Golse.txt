Morning this day, and I'm very happy to introduce Fran√ßois from Eco Point Technique in Paris. He will be talking about Locat Regorado for the La Operation. Well, thank you very much for your kind invitation. It's a beautiful place, and I've been very lucky this academic here because it's my second visit to Granada, which is very high on my to-do list and to visit this. I need to be more precise. Okay, so what I want to Okay, so what I want to discuss today is joint work with Civil Ander from Eco Normale in Paris and Alexi Basseur from University of Texas, Austin. Very good. So what is the Landau equation? So the Landau equation is this way substitutes of the Wolfman equation in the case of repulsive interaction between charged particles. It's been known for quite a long time. Particles. It's been known for quite a long time that the Boltzmann kinetic theory of gases, so to speak, does not apply in this case. And in some sense, the Landau collision integral is a residue in the sense of homogeneous distribution, if you want. It's a residue of the Boltzmann collision integral, which has a logarithmic divergence in the case of Coulomb interaction. Contraction. So, yeah. So, the Landau equation has an unknown, which is a distribution function, velocity distribution function of charged particles, the single species of particles here. So, it's f of t and v non-negative. And here, let me say immediately that I'm going to focus on the space how much in this case. So, the velocity distribution function is not going to depend on the position variable x, as it should normally do. But even without the space dependence, the problem is complicated enough. All right, so if you don't have the space dependence, if you're space homogeneous, the Lando equation is written here. So it's del T of F is equal to this collision integral, which turns out to be non-local differential operator. So it's a divergence in V at the integral over W of A V minus W, some collision kernel, which some collision kernel which turns out to be a matrix field del V minus del W of F T V F T W. So it's quadratic exactly as in the case of the Boltzmann equation, but you have it's a differential operating. So now this collision kernel A of V minus W is given here. So A of Z is 1 over 8 pi, or the normalizations and sample basically, times the Hessian of the normal Z. Of the normal z, right? So if you compute this thing, it's 1 over a pi z times pi z. Pi z is the orthogonal projection on the orthocomplement of the line spanned by z. Okay, so if you, those of you who attended the talk by Hafe and Inter a couple of days ago, I think it was, it's, of course, a simpler, much simpler variant of the Balles-Fund-Leinard equation, which was presented to us. Which was presented to us then. All right, so if you don't like this way of writing the London equation, there's also a non-conservative form, right, where you actually first work out the convolution product in the W variable. And so you can write this right-hand side here as the trace of some diffusion matrix times the Hessian of F in V. F in V. And so the diffusion matrix here is simply the convolution product of F with your matrix field A. And you take the trace, I mean you contract with the Hessian of F, plus F of T V squared. So the fact that it's F squared here, it's a purely local term, is special to the Coulomb case. So anyway, people will tell you that the Nanda equation makes sense only the Coulomb case, makes physical sense, only the Coulomb case, and that's all. The criminal case, and that's other potentials, just some mathematical inventions, right? But that's perhaps a very extreme view. But in any case, so in physics, it's always for the potential. So the open question is that of a global existence of classical solutions for the quotient problem starting from any nice initial data, say smooth, compactly supported Q1, or with fast decay of infinity, or whether there is finite time. Or whether there is finite time blow-up for that equation. Now, that's not an entirely obvious matter because, I mean, first, if you look at this equation here, you might say very well. So if there's an obvious answer to this, that if f does not depend on the velocity, then you have lower because it's a Riccati equation. But people doing kinetic theory don't like this. They don't like n-infinity solutions. They want the solutions to be in L1 or Uh, in L1 or even L1 with some weight, because that solution has to be a probability distribution or some constant, the mass times the probability distribution. So you must have some decay V at infinity, and so the answer we say is you take F, which is independent of V, doesn't count. It's not what you expect. All right, but then you might think that the Landau equation, at least in its non-conservative form, looks like the semi-linear heat equation. looks like the semi-linear heat equation, which is written here, del u del t equals Laplace U plus alpha u squared. And for this equation here, it's known, it's been known for quite a long time, there is finite time blow-up. And one way of saying this is through this paper by Stanley Kaplan, which is about my age, even slightly younger, because the paper appeared in 1963 in CB. Appeared in 1963 in CPAM, which relates also that equation to the Riccati equation in the following manner. You take the grand state of the Dirichlet-Laplacian and the ball, so lambda naught is going to be the lowest eigenvalue, and you take phi to be positive on the interior of the ball, the open ball, equal to zero on the sphere, and sine sine minus Laplace phi equals to lambda. minus Laplace Phi equals to lambda naught phi and you take the average of your solution your positive solution here with phi on the ball and you can share by means of the green formula that the time derivative of this quantity here is on the below by minus lambda naught L of t plus alpha L of t squared. And with this, you see immediately that if initially L of t is sufficiently large, Of t is sufficiently large, if it's larger than lambda naught divided by alpha, then you have lower than finite time as for the Richty equation. Okay, so there is, however, a big difference here, which is that in this case, the diffusion is one. If you return to the NADA equation here, you see that the diffusion increases with F. And so, you know, maybe if low or some concentration. Low up or some concentration builds up at some point, then this will feed the diffusion matrix here. And you can hope that this diffusion term will offset the effect of this term here, which promotes flow-up. So it's an equilibrium between these two terms. And but still, you know, there's this matrix diffusion here, which you may not like because it has a degenerate direction. It has a degenerate direction here. The pi has a non-trivial north space. Okay, so it's not positive, it's not a positive matrix. So that reason, so some people have investigated instead an equation which they call the isotropic London equation, where you replace this trace of A star F times the Hessian of F by simply simply minus Laplacian to the minus one of the unknown function. So here u, right? So you look at this equation here. Del T of U equals minus Laplacian minus one of U times Laplacian of U plus alpha U squared. And you pick your favorite alpha between 0 and 1. Actually, alpha equals 1 is a thing that is really equivalent, I mean analogous to the Founder equation. And if you investigate this equation here, Investigate this equation here for the global or regularity, global regularity issue. Well, then, the best result that we have at that time, the best result known on this equation right now, is, as far as I know, the global existence of non-increasing and radially symmetric solutions. It's a paper by Maria and Nesko Vilen, which appeared in 2016 after. In 2016, after some previous work by Grassmann Figer and the Strain, who managed to go to alpha equals to 74 over 75. Okay, so but this is a tough, rather tough piece of math, actually. It's not easy. So, and so there's also this idea that if you look at this equation here, it's more diffusive than the true Landau equation. I mean, there's a reason. True Landau equation. I mean, there's a recent paper by Sasha Bobilev, which explains that essentially you can think of this as having diffusion, which is like one and a half that of the Landau equation. So yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't bet on whether things are regular or non-regular. Although people doing numerical simulations would tend to believe that solutions of the Lando equation do not blow up a kinine tax. Okay, so let's try to see what we can do about it. We can do about it. All right, so good. So it's what you learned day one of Kennedy's theory. So the Landau equation satisfies the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, which in this case, that if you take the solution of the equation, you multiply by 1 V normal V squared, you integrate by parts because you have the divergence here. You use the symmetries, the collision entries. You use the symmetries, the collision integral here, in particular. The pi of z is very essential to have the conservation of energy. And you find that these properties here are going to be time invariant. Good. There's another property which in this theory goes by the name of Boltzmann's HT, Ram, which tells you that you have a Japan function. Then, if you assume that f of Tv is almost everywhere positive, and how Almost everywhere positive and has sufficient decay at infinity, but in such a way that the log of F doesn't grow too fast in infinity. Say, think of something that decays at infinity with the log of F having polynomial growth at infinity, right? The log of F growing like a polynomially at infinity, right? So if you look at this quantity here, the integral of F log of F, which is minus the entropy. Of f, which is minus the entropy, it's dissipated, and the entropy production is equal to this horribly non-local expression given here, like which you can write in several forms. But, you know, I mean, it's very non-local as it involves the V and W variables in the same, I mean, it's very much symmetric in V and W. However, there is a very interesting result. There's a very interesting result proved by Laurent, 2015, which is that you up to a constant term that is controlled by the mass, the energy, and the entropy, initially. I mean, you can bound that from below. This term, this dissipation of entropy production, can be bounded from below by something which up to a weight is the Fisher information of. The weight is the Fisher information of F. So this is a functional inequality for any F that is in L12. So L12 means L1 with a V squared weight. So if you take F in L12 such that F log F is in L1, then you have this inequality here. And this inequality here insists nothing to do with the fact that you have a solution, the normal equation. You don't use the equation to prove inequality. It's a functional inequality. It's a functional inequality. Good, and the constant depends on these concerned quantities here. Now, if you see that, you see immediately that this beautiful theorem puts another equation in the same department, same class as 3D Navier-Stokes in terms of the back exponents, right? So, you know that for low-resolution and Navier-Stokes, the velocity field is anonymity in time with values in L2 in X, right? And del U, the gradient, spatial gradient of U, is Spatial gradient of U is in L2 in time and space. Now, look at what happens here. If you don't think too much of the weights, then we know by conservation of mass that F and energy, that F is in L infinity L1, but tells you that square root F is in L infinity in time, L2 in V. And if you account for the energy, it's L22 in V, right? Which is better. And if you look at this, they will add inequality. Look at this de Villette inequality that tells you that del V of square root F is L2 in time, L2 in V, with the weight one over V to the Q. So, I mean, in terms of the vague exponents, they seem to be of the same, yeah, I mean, they have the same number, so to speak. Okay? Good, but good or bad, I don't know. I mean, that's uh that's the that's what you have to work with. That's what you have to work with, uh, okay. So, here there is a little technical thing that is: all right, so you want to make sure that this diffusion constant is not going to vanish because you know there is still this direction of the projection. The projection is a rank two projection in a three-dimensional space. There's one direction where it vanishes. But the thing is that because of the entropy, f is not going to. Entropy f is not going to concentrate on the bad directions of pi, right? So that cannot happen simply because of the entropy with the f of f control. So the way you use this, for instance, you pick chi to be your favorite plateau function or modifier like this, and you build a cutoff, radial cutoff function in this way, and you are going to drop off the singularity. You are going to drop off the singularity near the origin in A of Z, and you have this A delta of Z defined in this way, which is, of course, below A of Z itself. And with this, you easily have an ellipticity bound that you can check that if you know that your mass is between two constants, little M0 and capital M naught, if you have bounded energy and bounded entropy, then for delta small. For delta small enough, F star A delta, which is the truncated ellipticity matrix or truncated diffusion matrix, which certainly is below F star A, right? So this bounded from below by a constant with the unpleasant weight one plus VQ times identity, right? So this really, I mean, this somehow deletes the effect of this projection pipe. Good. Pipe. Good. With this, then you can prove that locally bounded Lambda solutions are regular. So let me introduce the usual notation QRTV for the parabolic cylinder. So QRTV is a time interval of length R squared cross a ball, Euclidean ball, a radius R. So notice the R squared and R, which is the usual boundary scaling. And so now if you look And so now if you look at F star A, you can always split it as F star A delta. And because F is an L infinity L1, this term is going to be nice because A delta is bounded, right? And you have the other term, F star A minus A delta. So now this is supposedly near the origin. And so if you know that this guy is going to be bounded in the probably cylinder. Bounded in the parabolic cylinder center at T0 V naught, then up to reducing a little bit your parabolic cylinder. You see immediately that F star A is going to be bounded in a smaller cylinder. Then with the ellipticity bounds, you can use whatever parabolic theorem you like. For instance, Tila Safonov tells you that F would be C alpha alpha on a parabolic cylinder size one half. And with that, you can use Schroder's S. With that, you can use Schauter's estimates to gain immediately a classical solution. So you see one plus alpha over two, two plus alpha on a slightly smaller cylinder again. All right, so the target here is to prove, if you want to prove regularity, the target is to prove local n-infinity terms. The only thing that can go wrong with the Lambda equation is this Riccati term F squared on the right-hand side. This is really the bad guy. Good. A bad guy. Good. Now, there is a global existence result which I think was in C√©dric Villanyi's PhD thesis. So I was in the committee, a country member. I think it was in the thesis, yes. It appeared in 1998. It was a six thesis. I don't remember everything from it. All right, so with your truncation function chi before, so you Chi, before so you first cook up some truncation at large velocities and a modifier like this, no regularizing sequence. And the idea of Cedric to construct global weak solutions to the Nanda equation was to replace the A by A delta to add To add full Laplacian with a delta in front, right? So you have this Fokker-Pranc term, basic Fokker-Pranc term on the left-hand side, the truncated Landau collision integral here, and as initial state, you truncate F initial at large velocities, you modify it, and you add a little bit of a Gaussian to have a positive go around everywhere. Positive go around everywhere, right? And with this, you can solve the problem for each positive delta. And then the class of weak solutions that you can obtain about the Lambda equations are going to be limit points of the sequence F delta as delta tends to zero. They have many of them. Delta tends to zero. They have many of them, right? It's not necessarily a converging sequence, but it's limits of this limit of this object are going to be solutions to the Landau equation. All right, so they satisfy at least a property which simply gives the defined notion of H solution, but these H solutions are constructed in this way. But they satisfy additional properties that I don't really want to list, just want you to remember. List, just want you to remember the way that they're built, and you can think of these as these limit points as being Villani solutions. We call them in this way, you know, solutions obtained by the same procedure as Vilani. Yes? So when you mentioned before the Delilah theorem, was this the theorem using this class solution or was it? No, no, it's the Davilsizer and it's just a functional inequality, which is true for you don't use it, it's not for a solution. It's just a functional inequality for a function in this class. All right, so the thing that I want to discuss now is now in the following regularity result, local regularity results for functions, for solutions having some. Functions for solutions having some symmetries. So you take your favorite Vilagi solution and another equation with initial data, which is non-negative, which is fine, mass, energy, and entropy. And the first results that if F is radially symmetric, so in other words, if it's a function of the norm of V, you feed the norm of V, then F is going to be locally bounded, except perhaps at the origin. It's locally bounded on. It's locally bounded on everywhere except perhaps the origin. And in fact, this theorem one is a consequence of what we prove really is that if f is axisymmetric, in other words, if there is some axis of symmetry, so you do some unit vector in the space, and if f is invariant when you rotate around this axis of symmetry, then f is going to be locally bounded, except perhaps on the axis. Except perhaps on the axis. Okay, if you're axis symmetric, then you're locally bounded away from the axis symmetry. All right, how let me try to explain how this kind of thing is proved. So first I need to introduce the notion of truncated distribution functions. So that's very easy. So you take f minus kappa plus, right? So henceforth will be denoted by f kappa plus. Kappa plus. And so I'm going to truncate the log wherever the log is non-negative, right? So the log plus of z. And so when you're dealing with the h function, there is a way to write the h function, which involves this h of z being z log of z minus z minus one. But here you're going to truncate this quantity wherever it's, you drop off all the plates where this quantity. You drop off all the plates where this quantity is negative, right? So that leaves you with a function h plus, which is like this. And you're going to look at the quantity h kappa plus of g, which is simply kappa h plus of g over kappa. Because h is essentially, for all practical purpose, h, you can think of it as being one homogeneous function. Log, it's not homogeneous, it would be zero, but almost. Okay, so this is a graph of your function. Of your function. So, with this, well, I mean, the only a priori estimate that we seem to have about with the Landau equation is the Boltzmann H theorem for the n-truncadian entropy. So, you'd like to know what happens for the truncating entropy. What happens in that case? Well, what happens in that case, if you take solutions obtained by the Villani. Solutions obtained by the Villany process, like the Nordic equation on R3, then you can truncate the entropy by this H kappa at any level, say, and you can also localize in V and up to technical decays like you have to remove negligible set of times for which this inequality is not going to hold. I mean, things like this. So if you localize by some psi, which is going to be a smooth. Which is going to be a smooth test function. Then you end up with an inequality like this: which is truncated entropy at time t2 is less than or equal to truncated entropy at time t1. So of course you have the effect of the time derivative of phi, right? So that's quite natural. And you have what would remain will be the entropy production term. So the entropy production term, you have to account for the fact that phi depends on v. So phi Depends on v. So phi is going to be psi squared to make it negative. So you have to account for the play, for the variations of velocity of phi. So the term that corresponds really to the dissipation, as in the David theorem, is the term T1, and T2 is just some correction of it. And of course, you have to account also for the effect of introducing this truncation at the level of kappa, which This truncation at the level kappa, which destroys to some extent the fine symmetries inside the collision integral, which are responsible for the fact that at the end it's a non-negative term. So here it's not going to be a non-negative term, but you will have a non-negative contribution plus perturbations, right? So if you look at these perturbations, we are going to end up with an inequality. An inequality on which we are going to act by the scaling, leaving the Ronda equation in direct. So, let me describe first the scaling and then explain how the scaling is going to act on this equation here. But already in this equation, you see that you have this object, which is a truncated entropy that you have to think about, and you have the dissipation term, which is going to come from the product of these two terms. These the product of these two terms here. So, these are the two things which are going to be the nice guys because they're going to be on the left-hand side. And so, okay, you have to think about that, right? Keep them in mind. All right, so there is one feature of the Lambda equation, which is probably different from the Nadia-Sooks equation, which is that you have a two-parameter group of invariants, like two-parameter group of scalings. So, well, you can check that on the equation studied by Mario. It's easier to check it in this case, but it's the same for the true Lando equation. So in other words, if F is a solution of the Landau equation, so F of T naught plus T V naught plus V is a solution, so it's translation invariance, so that's easy. What's more important is that if you have lambda and mu, any positive numbers, Any positive number. So if f t is a solution, then lambda f of lambda t and mu v is also a solution. And lambda and mu are totally uncorrelated. And that is special to the Coulomb case. Because the Coulomb case, essentially, it's the same scaling as if you would consider a Riccati equation, TTF equals F squared, but a Riccati equation for a solution that depends on an extra variable V, which you do not have. So somehow this minus Laplacian minus. How this minus Laplacian minus one of f times Laplacian F, obviously the scale on the space scale disappears. All right, so you have these two parameter group scalings, but if you look at this inequality here, you might want this thing and this one to scale in the same way, and that's going to reduce the freedom of the scaling in the foreign manner. So if you scale A, if you, yeah, I mean, if you, so if you. If you, yeah, I mean, if you, so if you, so since F scales with lambda, you have to scale the truncation parameter kappa with lambda, right? So if you scale kappa with lambda and you look at the truncated entropy of the scaled distribution function, then this is lambda over mu cube, the n scaled distribution function, of which you take. Of which you take the truncated entropy at level kappa, right? So for the entropy at a given time, that's the lambda of a mu cube that comes out from this scaling transform. And if you look at the quantity, I mean the Fischer information, that's a one over mu, but now the Fisher information is integrated both in time and velocity, and it's a one over mu that comes out. So one over mu that comes out in front. And since this is the thing that is going to be the leading term in the dissipation entropy production term, then it's a good idea perhaps to try to have these two parameters equal. So that sets a particular scaling, distinguished scaling, where lambda is equal to mu square. And then you set mu equals epsilon. And from then on, I will always have epsilon f of epsilon. uh epsilon f of epsilon sorry uh epsilon square f of epsilon square t and epsilon v which by the way it's going to be the same scaling as in an Avias Oaks equation if you allow for the fact that the analog of the velocity field is square root F. Okay, very good. So there is one, so you pick your favorite global Pilani solution, Landau equation, you choose a T0, V0, right? And you V naught right and you zoom near T0 V naught in this manner here. Now, when you do this, there is a quantity which is obviously related to the diffusion matrix, which is the convolution of F with one over Z, right? So the Coulomb potential. And the thing is that this quantity here, it's critical, so it's invariant by the scaling in an infinity in space and time. In space and time. So if you look at f eps1 concluded in v was one over z, right? So whether you look at it for the zoomed function of the n-zoomed one, and the quantity doesn't change. The energy bounds doesn't change. Okay, good. So it's an important quantity here, obviously. And now let's see what happens if I do this scaling transform, right? So I move back here, right, and I'm going to Right, and I'm going to do the scanning transform on this inequality here. I will put the nice part of this term here, essentially, this one times this one on the left-hand side with this guy. And so, obviously, I leave all the thing on the right-hand side, everything else on the right-hand side, and see how it behaves under the scaling. So, if I do this, as I said, so I'm going to scale. So, I'm going to scale the level of truncation of the epsilon squared. The truncation, in fact that you modify the diffusion, the potential near zero is going to be scaled as delta over epsilon, because I remind you that v scales like epsilon v. The radius, similarly, is going to scale like r over epsilon. So, this is the space scale, if you wanted the velocity scale, more precisely. So, there is. More precisely. So there is this f kappa epsilon epsilon, so it's the zoomed distribution function truncated at level kappa epsilon. And we have our favorite truncation where we're going to choose it such that the first and second derivative are controlled by one over delta epsilon and one over delta epsilon squared, respectively. Okay, so with this, then this entropy, the Entropy, the result of the truncated entropy inequality, can be written here. So you have the swoop over the parabolic cylinder of the truncated entropy integrated in velocity, right? The zoo for the zoom quantity, plus the Fischer information integrated over the probability QR epsilon. So this is the good part of the inequality, the thing that's The thing that comes out of the HD RAM, that's the thing that comes out of the Debilet CRAM. And on the right-hand side, you have the perturbations which are due to the localization velocity and the fact that you truncate the distribution function at the level kappa. And you can control this term by this expression here. So it involves powers of one over delta epsilon. You might be scared by the fact that you have a stronger nonlinearity than A stronger non-linearity than on the left-hand side, but no worries because you also integrate in time and you have enough Lebesgue exponents to compute. So this integral is well defined, no problem. Yes? What is the Q of the line? Oh, field of rational numbers. I'm sure you. Why do you need it? Aha. Okay, so I didn't want to spend so much time. Yeah, so the fact when you When you construct this limiting solution, you don't have continuity in time, right? And you want to look at fixed time quantities. So you have to exclude some negligible set of times. And so the way you exclude this negligible set of times is by By some diagonal extraction. And if you do this, then the kappa had better belong to a notable set. So, okay, fine. But it doesn't matter really because, you know, I mean, whether you truncate for rational levels or not, it doesn't matter. Okay. Yeah. So that's a reason for that. Yeah, we forget about it. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Okay. All right. So All right, so you have this inequality here, and once you have this, then the idea is to use the Georgi iterations on this inequality to set up a local regularity criterion. So essentially, here's how it works. You look at your assumed solution, and I mean, you assume that the initial data, the unzoomed initial data has a mass. Data has a mass control between two quantities, two opposite numbers, as bounded energy, as bounded entropy, controlled by numbers which you know, right? And you assume that our critical quantity is bounded from above by some constant, z epsilon, like not much more, but it doesn't matter. I mean, it's bound by some quantity like this. Actually, you don't have to worry so much about the singular idea. A bunch about the singularity at the origin is more like the slow decay that you have to take care of. Okay, so then if the left-hand side of if the good guy is the left-hand side of the inequality here is bounded by some threshold eta that depends on the conserved quantities, right? Divided by Z epsilon to the three-half. Then you can prove that your F epsilon is going to be less than or equal to two. Be less than or equal to two, say, on a smaller cylinder. So, here you do this on a parabolic cylinder of size two, the ball of size two, and of course, like in the Georgian iteration, you get an infinity bound on the smaller diabolic cylinder. Okay, very good. So, let's see whether we can realize this with the symmetry that we have. So, with the symmetry that we have, there are two lemmas. There are two lemmas. Well, the first one is essentially a little technical thing which tells you that I'm not going to, I'm just going to explain the idea here. The thing is that if you have an axis symmetric solution, if you're away from the axis symmetry, if you zoom on your function, it essentially behaves like it was two-dimensional. So if it's two-dimensional, then the SOBALF embedding are going to be more favorable. Are going to be going to be more favorable, right? Because you essentially there's one variable on which you do not depend. So it's like two-dimensional. So it's better for Sobolev embedding. And with this, you gain an L2 in time and velocity control of the capital F, which is the axisymmetric profile. Okay, good. So that's the first thing. And the second thing, which is more tricky. The second thing, which is more tricky, is if you look at this quantity, which I told you would be is the critical quantity, which is the scaling variance at N infinity. So if you're axisymmetric, right, and you look at zoomed the Villani solution, you have some T0, V naught, then you can find some absolute constant C star such that for X1, it's small enough at least. Small enough at least so that you're really away from the origin. So, rho naught is the distance between your v naught and the origin. So, you're zooming on the point which is away from the origin, and you take epsilon small enough, right? So, then this term is controlled by one over row naught times the entropy. So, this is the highest nonlinear IT which you really control. Which you really control for the Lambda equation, okay, plus something which is like rho naught to the square. So, yeah, I mean, so this bound here is, I would hesitate to call it optimal, you never know, but so here you don't have you don't have much space. So, here you're pretty much at the limit of what you can do, right, for the Lander equation. Okay, but in any case, you estimate this quantity in. This quantity in some cylinder, parabolic cylinder, away from the origin. Once you have this, then you return to this inequality here. And what you have to do is to prove that this thing can be made small enough, smaller than the thing that appears in this parameter that appears on the right-hand side of the Georgian criterion. And that's it. You get local. And that's it, you get local energy bounds. And you have all the ingredients to do that because if you use the two bounds in lemma A and B, first if you use the bound on this critical quantity, you see that the right-hand side here is bounded by the integral of f epsilon, the assumed f epsilon squared, right, times some constant that involves the expound on the critical quantity. And this is going to go to zero as epsilon tends to zero, because in fact, As epsilon tends to zero, because in fact, this is the integral of your axis symmetric profile on a set of measures that vanishes as epsilon tends to zero. And then you, per epsilon small enough, you're going to be below the threshold and the Georgi lemma, and that's it. Voila. So, what's been done here? Well, yeah, I mean, the take-home message is asy symmetric or radially symmetric in any solutions to the London. Radial is symmetric delining solutions to the London-Poulon equation are going to be irregular away from the axis of symmetry or away from the original radial solutions. So, yeah, I mean, the proof is based on the Georgian method on the truncated entropy inequality. Perhaps you can find a different packaging, but this one we like, so why not? And it seems that one key ingredient in the proof is this upper bound for the diffusion matrix. This upper bound for the diffusion matrix of this lemma b for the critical quantity f convoluted with one over the raw potential. So, okay, with that, I'll talk to you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Do you have a good idea itself for some implications from last time you behave Europe? And so where you can write or get some information? Yeah, that I really don't know. I mean, you will need really global regularity if you want to. I frankly, I don't know. Yes. I think in all. I think, in order to say, for instance, you know, extra properties like uniqueness, perhaps also behavior at infinity would require some, would require double regularity. I don't know, maybe Laurent knows this better than I. Today, I think for equation, it's known that there is a stretch exponential decay towards equilibrium. Yeah. Yeah, but it's. Yeah, yeah, but it it's uh and it doesn't really need a lot of regularity within governance basically yeah but for clones yeah for clon for clones and without regularity yeah you don't need a lot of regularity uh i mean which solution guy solutions i know the point is uh that the stretch control rate is not the optimal one so okay that's ah okay okay okay so you get something okay so you get something but it starts Okay, so you get something, but it's not the given by the right EDS. Yeah. So I have a question. So the main point for the axis symmetric phase is that you can bound the diffusion metrics. Yes. Right. In a better way than without the axis symmetric. Yes. What is the key point there? Why can you bound it with your sophisticated entropy, right? Oh, yeah, I mean, you have to, it's a rather complicated computation. You have to, yeah, you have to really compute things. Yeah, I mean, you need a rather precise computation and you are going to use the behavior of some elliptic intervals. It's a little bit tricky. So it's, yeah, not easy. Easy. Yeah, because this one. I mean, it's not easy. And it needs to be away from the axis, definitely. Yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely. Absolutely. We don't know what happens at the origin of the wise. So actually, we have time for a very quick question. I was wondering if you're If the metric was not anisotropic, you would immediately get some regularity. If the one if the A was not anisotropic, would your method get something better? I don't think so. I think at the origin... The method tells you essentially that everything is going to be nice away from the origin. But if you take the isotropic case, I think the origin is treated differently. Origin is treated differently. If you look at the paper by Maria and Nestor, I think that there's a barrier function. I mean, if I remember, so it's a very different kind of proof to treat the origin really. Yeah, so thanks again, Fraser, for the next one.
