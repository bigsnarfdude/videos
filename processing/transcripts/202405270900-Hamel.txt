Thank you very much, Hiroshi, for the presentation. I'm very glad to be part of this meeting. So I thank you and all organizers for inviting me. And I would like to say that I'm very sorry that I cannot come in person to the meeting. So my talk is joint work, is based on some joint work. Is based on some joint work with Luca Rossi on asymptotic flattening and local planar symmetry in reaction diffusion equations. Okay, so let me start with the framework and the main question. So I'm going to consider a reaction diffusion equation in the whole space Rn, which is Ut equals Laplace U plus F of U. F of u, x is Rn, and T is positive. And the function F, which is the reaction, is a given function of class C1, given in the interval 0, 1. And we assume that it vanishes at 0 and 1. In other words, 0 and 1 are steady states for the equation. So there is a balance between the diffusion and the reaction. So typical examples of initial conditions, which I'm going to do... Of initial conditions, which I'm going to consider, are indicator functions of sets capital U. So, by that, I mean that is typically of the type, so equal to one when x is in u and zero outside. And typically, u is unbounded and it is a non-negligible, and the complement is also non-negligible. So, therefore, the Cauchy problem is well posed and from the maximum. And from the maximum principle, use between 0 and 1 for all positive times. Other initial conditions are also possible and will be mentioned. So since this is the first talk of the workshop, I'm going to focus on this very simple equation, reaction diffusion equation, and I'm going to ask very basic questions. So, what are the basic questions? So, the first one is is natural question which is the limit of u of tx when t goes to infinity so so the the Cauchy problem is well posed so the solution exists for all positive times so what happens at large times so can we have some conditions for u to converge to one locally uniformly in x we speak of invasion invading solution or to zero we speak of x We speak of extinction. Other possible limits are also, other limits are also possible. And what is the effect of the initial support capital U. So this is question one. So question two is that of spreading speeds. So we want to know more about the location as time goes to infinity of the regions where u is close to zero or close to one. And a typical To one. And a typical question is the following one for any given direction in the unit sphere. Is there a spreading speed, which depends on E and capital U, the initial support, such that U converges to one in a moving frame with a speed gamma less than W of Eu and to zero for gamma larger. So this spreading speed may not exist in general. Spanning speed may not exist in general. So, if it exists, so it is a sort of transition between the values one and zero. And the third question, which I'm going to consider today, is this one. So, once we know about extinction or invasion, once we know about spreading speeds, what can we say about the asymptotic local planar symmetry along the level sets as time goes to infinity? By that, By that, I mean the notion of flattening of the level sets. So, if we consider a level set of value lambda as here, so let me call capital F lambda of t the set of points x where u of t x is equal to lambda. So, the level set of value lambda, lambda is between zero and one. So, local flattening means that Flattening means that around every point of this level set, if we draw a ball around this point, then the solution, then the level set becomes almost flat. So it is trapped between two parallel hyperplanes which are very close to each other. So this is what I mean by the flatness, local flatness, flattening. Okay, so. Flattening. Okay, so this notion is associated to that of the capital omega limit set of U, which is a set of all asymptotic profiles of the solution at large times. So by that I mean capital U is the set of psi such that U converges to psi along a sequence of times diverging to plus infinity and along a sequence of points. Along the sequence of points xn. The convergence holds in L infinity log and even more from standard parabolic estimates. So this capital omega of U is not empty and it is included into C2 of Rn from parabolic estimates. So it's the set of all limiting profiles. So the notion associated to flattening is that of asymptotic local planar symmetry. So in other words, is it true that So in other words, is it true that for any psi in the omega limit set, psi of x will be a function of one variable, so capital psi of x dot e for some unit vector e and some function psi of depending only on one variable. So, and is it true that psi is constant is either constant or a planar training font profile? Okay, so I'm going to Okay, so I'm going to focus on this question three today. And a motivation for that question is the following. So if you think of an earthquake below the sea or a volcanic eruption, then it may happen that a tsunami occurs and then when we are Then, when we are very far away from the center of the eruption or the earthquake, then very far away the wave, the tsunami wave, looks like a planar wave viewed from very far away. So this just an analogy with what happens for reaction efficiency equations. So I'm going first to focus on the case of compactly supported infrared conditions, which is Supported infrared conditions, which is a very important case. And I would like to explain a very elegant argument of Chris Jones from 1983, which is about invading solutions. So assuming that Q converges to one locally in Rn, goes to infinity. And let me, so assume that Q0 has a compact support, it's non-negative. Compact support, it's non-negative, it ranges between zero and one and has a compact support. Let me call capital C the convex hull of the support of U0 and consider any half space capital E containing C. So E is here, E contains C and C and let me call H the boundary of E, and R the affine orthogonal reflection with respect to H. Okay, so now what happens in E? And let me also call V the reflection of U with respect to this hyperplane H. So, what happens in the half plane E? E. So at initial time, u0 is larger than v of 0x for x in e because because e contains the support of u0 and u0 is non-negative. So therefore we have this comparison. And furthermore, these two initial conditions are not equal in E since u0 is not trivial. So therefore we have a comparison and we in E at initial time and also At interval time, and also along h, we have equality by definition, v is equal to u on h. So, therefore, from the parabolic maximum principle, we have the strict inequality for all positive times. This is what is written here. You have u is strictly larger than v for all positive times and x in e. And since both functions are equal on h, we can say furthermore that We can say furthermore that the normal derivative of the, sorry, any outward, any outward derivative of the difference V minus U has a negative slope on H. So in particular, in the outward normal C on H, then if we compute the derivative of The derivative of u minus v, then we get twice the derivative of u, and therefore we get that the gradient of u scalar the vector x is negative for all positive times and x in h. So therefore, therefore, once we have that, this means that the line, if we take any x which is not in c, the line parallel to the gradient of u at time t and x containing T and X containing X has to meet C. Otherwise, we can include this line into a hyperplane H which separates C from its complement, for which C belongs to one side of H. Therefore, we get a contradiction. So, therefore, this line has to meet C. And therefore, since the And therefore, since the solution is invading, if we fix a value lambda of a level set, if we follow some points x rambder of t for which u of t x rambd of t is equal to lambda, so x rambder of t belong to the level set lambda, and these points are very far away from c at large times because the solution is invading, and therefore we get automatically that the gradient of u is uh Is almost parallel to the vector minus x round of t in this sense. So, and therefore, and this implies automatically that the level sets become asymptotically locally flat at large times. And furthermore, that any psi in the omega limit set of u is one-dimensional if u is invading. Okay, so. If you is invading, okay, so this is the beautiful argument of Jones, and okay, so which uses strongly the fact that C, the compact, the convex hull of the support of U0 is bounded. Okay, and several comments. So, furthermore, we cannot, furthermore, in general, the label sets do not convert to spheres and we can have further estimates on. We can have further estimates on the location of the level sets of invading solutions for various types of reactions F. And also, let me also say that if U is not invading, the label sets do not flatten at large times in general, since the solution may converge to some radio asymmetric steady state, converging to zero at infinity. Okay, so we have these remarks and These remarks, and we have there have been much work on this question and typical questions are threshold between extinction and invasion for monoton families of initial conditions and so on. So, but I would like to, since time is running, I would like to go to the second to the new main results. Okay, so I'm going to constitute. Okay, so I'm going to consider now the case of initial subgraphs, which are unbounded. So we consider typically a function u0, which is the indicator function of a subgraph. So which is defined here. So u0 of x prime xn is equal to 0 when x. equal to zero when x n is larger than a function phi of x prime and one when x n is less than or equal to phi of x prime. So phi is a function of n minus one variable which is in n infinity log. So with this definition so for all times t and x prime in r n minus one u of t x prime dot is decreasing in r conserving Equating in R, converging to one when xn goes to minus infinity and to zero when xn goes to plus infinity. And therefore, there is a unique value x sub lambda of t x prime such that u of t x prime x lambda of t x prime is equal to lambda. And let me call f lambda. So, the level set f lambda can therefore be written as the graph of this function. graph of this function x lambda at each time t. Okay, so there are, see this is for the notations. And now the question is the following. So there are two typical questions. The first one is that of the global shape of the upper level sets E lambda or the level sets F lambda. And this is and this first question is associated to that of spreading speed. Questions associated to that of spreading speeds and spreading sets of the solution. What happens at a large scale for the level sets? So, I'm not going to talk about that. I'm going to focus on this third question. So, can we say more about the local shape of the level sets f lambda of t when t goes to infinity? So, do the level sets asymptotically flatten at large times? Okay, so to do that, let me introduce an assumption which is called the evasion property for large enough initial conditions on large enough balls. So we assume that there exists a value alpha between 0 and 1 and a radius rho such that if the initial condition is larger than alpha, Is larger than alpha on a ball of radius rho. So B rho is a ball of radius rho. You can put it around any center because the problem is invariant by translation. So if u0 is larger than alpha on the ball of radius row, then u converges to one as time goes to infinity locally uniformly in space. So this is the inversion property, which is an assumption. Assumption. An equivalent condition for that is that f is positive in a left neighborhood of one and that the integral of f between t and one is positive for all t between zero and one strict. So, and this equivalence comes from several works by Peter Polaczik and Yahoo-du and Peter Polaccik. Okay, so. Okay, so this assumption says that, okay, if u0 is a large enough, in some sense, on a large ball, large enough ball, then u is invading. So some possible functions satisfying these properties, and we can see more about alpha and rho from Aronson-Weinberger. So let me, so there are four typical classes of functions which have been studied in the literature. So the first one is so-called Fischer-Keplic. The first one is so-called Fischer KPP for Komogorov Petrovsky-Pishkunov. And in that case, F is positive between 0 and 1. And below, and the graph is underneath the tangent at the origin. And in that case, we had the so-called Hertriger effect from Aronson-Weinberger. So saying that alpha can be arbitrary between 0 and 1, and ρ can also be arbitrary. When f is just assumed to be positive, so which is more general, then More general, then this Hertriger effect holds if f is not too degenerate at the origin when s goes to zero. A third class, important class is so-called bi-stable class when f is first negative between zero and theta, and then positive between theta and one with a positive integral. Then alpha can be any real number between theta and one. Between theta and one, provided that rho is large enough, and the last case is the ignition case when f is zero between zero and theta, and then positive between theta and one. And we have the same situation for alpha and rho as in the bisable case. Okay, so more general multistable functions are also possible. I refer to the work of Fife McLaughlin, but which But which follow immediately from the previous slide from the equivalence conditions. Okay, so let me skip that. Okay. I would like to now to state one first main result, which is the case of conical, so-called conical, which we call conical case. We assume that the invasion property holds and that for That for some L non-negative, the graph of the function phi looks like a cone at infinity, in some sense. Axisymmetric cone at infinity. So phi looks like that. So this is the graph of phi. So, we have a slope L at infinity. So, in this sense. And then, in that case, for every lambda between 0 and 1, we have local flattening that in the sense that the level sets x lambda, the functions x lambda, has a gradient with respect to x prime which contains. With a set x prime, which continges to zero locally uniformly in x prime as t goes to infinity. And also, the function u also becomes flat in the sense that its gradient with respect to x prime converges to zero locally and uniformly in x prime when t goes to infinity and also uniformly in xn. I feel the second condition follows from the first one automatically. Okay, so all. Okay, so other sufficient conditions on phi are the following. So we can assume that phi of x prime over norm of x prime converges to minus infinity as norm of x prime converges to plus infinity. We can assume that pi of x prime is axisymmetric outside a compact set with a function capital phi, which is the With a function capital phi, which is non-increasing, or which derivative converges to zero at infinity. So typically, think of an asymptotic cone and even if initially the cone has a tip, at large times, this tip becomes more and more flat. This is what the result says. So, just a very brief Plyden geometric argument is done by contradiction alla joins. So, somehow we assume that the conclusion does not hold, then we can find sequences of times Tn and Xn positions Xn for which the gradient does not, the gradient of X lambda does not become, let's say, asymptotically vertical. And then we can find And then we can find a hyperplane H containing the gradient of U, and which is therefore not asymptotically vertical. And we compare the solution U with respect to its reflection with respect to H in one side of H, and then we get the contradiction similar to what I explained based on the argument of Jones. Argument of Jones. But this is somehow more technical because we have to deal with what happens at infinity in some sense. But typically, this argument works like that. And let me also say that let me comment on the conclusion. The conclusion is false when L is negative in general. Since there are V-shaped fronts, we can have a function set. A function set a subgraph capital U, which is like a V, which has a V-shaped, and for which the solution U converges to a V-shaped front, which has a similar, the level sets have a similar shape, and therefore the label sets do not flatten at large times. Such solutions are known to hold for various non-linearities, typically KPP or bistable. or bi-stable. The conclusion is false also in general without invasion. Just reverse the situation, replace u by y minus u and f by minus f of y minus s. Automatically, then you get the opposite situation. And the conclusion is also obviously false in general without asymptotic symmetry. Just take oblique fronts. So I think how much time do I have left? How much time do I have left? Not much, I guess. Well, it's nearly over. Okay. So I think I'm going to conclude with this on this slide. So we have to think that the asymptotic flatness does not hold uniformly in X prime in general because of the counter examples with the. Because of the counter-examples with the Lichette France, and also that we have a conjecture in the sense that if phi is flat, if the graph, the initial boundary of capital U is flat at infinity, then we conjecture that the solutions flatten uniformly in X prime this time. And this is true at And this is true at least when phi is assumed to be bounded, and this is known, or this is all known also in some particular case when phi has a vanishing asymptotic global mean. And this follows also from some of our research with Luca Rossi. And there are more general results, a little bit longer to explain, but I think I will focus on this. I think I will focus on this. I will finish here and I thank you for your attention. Well, thank you, Francois, for your very nice talk, which is extension in some part extension of... Is some other extension of Christopher Jones' talk, Christopher Jones' result, and it's very beautiful. And you don't assume that F has just one and two zeros. It can be any F which if it satisfies. If it satisfies that condition, yes, yes. As soon as the invasion property holds, the conclusion holds. It's a little bit like in the work of Jones. So in the work of Jones, he assumes that the solution is invading and F was arbitrary. So in our case, we have the invasion property which depends on F, but F can be can be biased. Can be biased ball or ignition or non-negative. So it is a very general assumption. Are there any questions? So let me ask the audience, either the in-person audience here or the virtual audience. Is there any question? Could I ask a question? Yes. Yes, sure. Yeah, hi, Francois. Hi, Andre. I just want to ask about the last thing you said: the conjecture fails in the case when phi is a little low of x. So how about if you do just phi being sort of bounded above by some negative constant times absolute value of x prime. times absolute value of x prime. Just small negative constant, then it should hold, right? So something like that. So you said that phi is below a function with negative slope, you said? Yeah, on both sides, the slope doesn't have to be the same, just below. Okay, you just assume a comparison. Yes, in that case, we have a weak, if we just assume a comparison, the argument Aladdin's does not work as such. Not work as such, but we can have weaker results. We have a sort of asymptotic local flatness along some sequence of points and times. So it's a weaker result. But if we just assume that we just have a comparison at initial time. But under this condition, the conjecture should probably be true, or do you believe there is a reason why the full conjecture wouldn't be true? The full conjecture wouldn't be true. So, the conjecture here, which is that we have the conjecture, says that this is a sort of uniform flatness. It does not hold as soon as you have a negative slope like here, the conjecture cannot hold. Oh, sorry, no, I meant the locally uniform. The local, yes, we conjecture that there is a local, local, yes, in this local sense, yes. In this local sense, yes. And we have partial results in that direction in general, and also positive results in the KPD case, answering to your question. So maybe the local uniform would then also hold, even in the case, in the last sentence, when you say it fails, because it's the uniform that fails, but maybe the local. The last sentence, no, no, the last sentence, we assume that phi, right, that phi is little O of normal. I write that phi is little O of norm of X prime, but but in that case, there can still be large oscillations. So typically, in that case, we can still have large oscillations of the initial graphs, something like that. Sure, sure. But again, the local uniform, that one might still hold. Yes, yes, local, but not but not. But not uniform. It cannot be uniform because there can be some points where the graph has some big slopes or non-zero slopes. Yes, thank you. Yeah, thank you, Andre.
