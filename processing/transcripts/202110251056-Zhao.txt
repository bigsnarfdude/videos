Organizers for organizing such an interesting workshop and also for the opportunity to speak here. Today I will talk about quantum circuit and matter collisions in a book. It's based on a couple of recent work with Felix Hill and Alex Stryker and some ongoing work with Felix. By the way, about the time, what's the rule of time? What's the rule of time? One 40 minutes or 30 minutes, 35? So you get, I believe we're doing 30 plus 10. So I can give you a five minute warning before, after 25 minutes, if that's what you'd like, or I can just let you speak and then cut you off sharp at 30. Okay. Please let me know at 25 minutes. Okay, we'll do. Yeah. Thank you. So some quick motivations. Some quick motivations. Two distant black holes can be connected in the interior through a wormhole, and this is the famous statement of ER equals EPR. But this also causes a puzzle because two signals standing to the two different boundaries can meet in the interior. On the other hand, there are no boundary interactions, so what governs the law according to which the two signals interact? In particular, I want to consider two different scenarios. In these scenarios, the two signals, the red signal and pink signal, come from the same boundary. Signal comes from the same boundary system from the right boundary. In the second, in the right panel, the red signal comes from the left boundary and the pink signal come from the right boundary. There is a no-boundary interaction between the two subsystem. But from the bulk picture, signals should interact in the same way, no matter they come from the same boundary or come from two different boundaries. This is required in gravity, but it's not clear from the boundary point of view. And I will try to share with you some. Will try to share with you some of my understandings about this problem. So, an outline of the talk. I will do, I mean, considering the audience, I think most are experts, so I will do a rather quick review of a thermofuel double quantum circuit and a summary of what we have about meeting in the interior of a wormhole and overlap of perturbation in the quantum circuit. In this talk, I will particularly, particularly, in particular, I will focus on the geometry of a post-collision region. It's what does the space-time geometry look like? The space-time geometry looks like after the collision. And we'll do a comparison with collisions, let's say, consider two scenarios: the collision between signals coming from one boundary or two different boundaries. We'll compare the two scenarios. And I will comment on collisions between localized shock waves and the post-collision geometry. And at the end, I will point out some future directions and unanswered questions. So, first, it's argued that a bulk geometry reflects the minimal circuit preparing a state. The minimal circuit preparing a state. I always use this picture from a paper by Lenny Suskin because I think it really illustrates the idea. Let's say if we have thermofuel double, it will represent the thermofuel double by S-bel pairs, and then you can apply the unit operators on the qubits. These red lines represent quantum gates, and as time increases, the circuit gets longer. The key insight is that if you lay out the circuit horizontally, then as it gets longer, it actually corresponds to Einstein-Rossen. It actually corresponds to Einstein-Rossen-Rosen bridge. As time increases, the circuit gets longer. Einstein-Rossen bridge also gets longer. So, in particular, in this scenario of unperturbed thermal field double, I want you to pay to attention that these orange dots. In this case, I represent the unitary quantum gates acting on these qubits. If we really have a maximally entangled bay pairs, these unitaries have a property that they have undone from either side. What does it mean? Down from either side. What does it mean? It means that it doesn't change the density matrix of either Alice or Bob. I mean, in this talk, I will sometimes refer to the left system Alice side and right system Bob side. It doesn't change the density matrix. That means these gates make no sense for each subsystem alone. It's only meaningful when you have both subsystems. And correspondingly, the part of Einstein-Rosen bridge that's getting longer is actually stored. Is actually stored, it's in a shared region, it's outside of either entanglement watch. And in this particular case, the number of healthy gates per unit time is a constant. So a key property in this EPR bell pairs is that once we have entanglement, we have shared quantum circuit. And because this gates really is shared between Alice and Bob. Then one can ask a question: are there gates that do not satisfy this property? Are there gates that we can? This property that we can unambiguously identify them as belonging to either allicite or rhobobside. In order to look at this question, we need to consider different scenarios. We need to, let's say, perturb the black hole a little bit. Let's say we perturb thermofuel double at the lifetime, at some particular lifetime. And for now, I will focus on spherically symmetric perturbations. And it's represented, I mean, this perturbation will increase the coarse-grain entropy of a black hole. We represent this increase. We represent this increase of the coarse-grain entropy by introducing actual qubit. And keep attention that this actual qubit only belongs to Alice, not Bob. And this red arrow represents actual qubit. And any qubit that interacted directly or interacted with the perturbation will get perturbed. And this perturbation will spread exponentially in time. And in this case, the red gates, because they involve this extra qubit, so they can no longer be undone by Bob and they belong to Alice. And geometrically, the And geometrically, the increase of this number of gates corresponds to the growth of this red region. And in this talk, we'll be particularly interested in these orange gates, these healthy gates that still it's after time TWL, these orange gates. They're stored in a shared region, but also after the shockwave. So, in this talk, what will really be interesting is, let's say, when you have perturbations from both boundaries, left and right boundaries. Left and right boundaries. If you draw a quantum circuit picture, you can quickly see that there are two possibilities if you look at the relative time ordering between minus TWL and TWR. When minus TWL is less than TWR, the two perturbations do not have overlap in the quantum circuit. Correspondingly, the signal sending to the bulk heat is singularity before they have a chance to meet in the wormhole. A more interesting scenario is when, let's say, TWR is less than minus TWR. Is less than minus TWL. In this case, the two perturbations have overlap in the quantum circuit. What we mean is that there is a portion of the quantum circuit at which both perturbations appear. And the proposal is that correspondingly the signals collide inside a wormhole. And it should be intuitively clear that the larger the overlap in a quantum circuit is, the stronger the collision is. Actually, one can make this picture more quantitative. And one can diagnose the collision by a One can diagnose the collision by a particular six-point functions, and one can ask: does the collision happen or not? And once it happened, how strong it is. But I'm going to talk about that in this talk. If you're interested, you can look at our paper. So, Yin, can you just kind of illustrate with your mouse where the circuit that you have on the left lives? This is the overlap. So, can you say where I should think of that as living on the right? I'm not quite seeing the relation between figure A and figure B. Relation between figure A and figure B? I mean, I kind of know, but I didn't really get the question that it's this overlap give rise to this collision. But is there a slice that I should think of that network as living on? Actually, yes. I didn't do that in this in this talk. Let's say if I slice the the it this way. Slice it this way, I can correspondingly slice the geometry this way, one can make some correspondence. Or equivalently, one can also slice the geometry this way, one can make some correspondence. I mean, I don't have time to go over this in this talk, but maybe in future I will add some slides about this. Thanks. Yeah, it's a. Let me see if I have better slides. Maybe I have better slides later. Thanks for the question. Sorry, I don't. It's a. So, anyway, in this talk, what we are really interested in is to ask the question about what the space-time geometry looks like after the collision. It's what happens after the collision. So, in particular, we want to make a connection with the property of a quantum circuit with this overlap. I mean, as we said, that this collision is because of you have such overlap. And once you have such overlap, let's focus on these healthy gates in the overlap region. Healthy gates in the overlap region in a quantum circuit. And we argue that they can be undone from both sides. They are meaningless for one boundary system alone. So, first of all, they are in a shared region. Second, I mean, as we argued before, let's say if you just have one perturbation, then the healthy gates is sort of in this region. And now you have two perturbations, it's natural to identify this healthy gates as in the post-collision region, which is behind both shock waves, but it's in a shared intervention. Waves, but it's in a shared interior. And we want to explore this connection. Let's say if we trust this proposal about overlap in the circuit and collision in the interior, then we should be able to get the properties about the collision from the quantum circuit picture. Let's just check this relation between, let's try to understand this relation between the space-time geometry after the collision and some, this healthy gates here. Here. And first, one needs to do an estimate of the number of healthy gates in this overlap region in a circuit. In order to do this, one can actually, I mean, one can do this using define, one can just do some circuit analysis, or one can make this more rigorous by defining certain kind of size, which is related to certain six-point functions. Again, I won't go into the details here, but all I want to point out is that we define some kind of size. Is that we define some kind of a size which is related to a six-point function? The physical meaning is that this six-point function f6 is the probability of picking up healthy gates at a particular time. So if you are interested in what's the total number of healthy gates in an overlap region, what you can do is that you can do an integral in this overlap region of this probability of picking up healthy gates. I won't go into the detailed calculation. I won't go into the detailed calculation, but the only property I want to point out is that at the end of a day, it's only a function of delta t. This is natural because of the translation invariance of this circuit. So this is a circuit side. From the bulk side, we want to estimate how large the post-collision region is. We want to ask about the space-time geometry after the collision. And so I computed the space-time volume simply because the space-time volume is easier. Volume is easier, is easy to compute. In fact, I would expect that any other reasonably defined quantities like action or volume of a spatial slice, its various quantities would have similar time dependence. Roughly speaking, I did a calculation in BTZ. Roughly speaking, it's after a collision, you have a larger black hole in its post-collision region. And again, its size is only a function of delta T, where this is by the booster symmetry of this dark. This is by the booster symmetry of this diagram. So, before I give out a full detailed calculation, I want you to pay attention to some quality behavior which I think which will need in the later discussions of localized collisions. And I also find that it helped my own understanding. First, it's in early time regime where this delta T is less than scrambling time. In this case, if you draw the circuit diagram, let's say the red perturbation comes in and goes towards the left. Perturbation comes in and goes towards the left, the pink perturbation comes in that goes towards the right, you will see that the number of healthy gates in this overlap region actually grows linear in delta T, roughly speaking linear in delta T. And what happens in the bulk is that in this case, you can basically ignore nonlinear effect, and the two signals propagate freely just by themselves. And what will happen is that as you move this time downward, as you make this time earlier, you increase delta t. Make this time earlier, you increase delta t, this collision point will move downward. So the post-collision region will grow. It's this growth that matches this growth in delta t. In intermediate time regime, when delta t is larger than scrambling time, you can no longer ignore the... So, okay, let's first, from quantum circuit point of view, you will see that actually now the number of healthy gates start to decrease linearly with delta t. I mean, as delta t increase, because a large portion of the circuit has already been affected. A large portion of the circuit has already been affected. And as the delta T increases, this middle region will shrink. This would be intuitively clear. And on the, so what bulk feature realize this? In the bulk side, the collision point can no longer move downward because the collision point is already very close to the bifurcating surface, exponentially close. In fact, we can just assume that the collision point is at the bifurcating surface and the two shock waves are at the horizon. And the two shockwaves are at the horizon. However, in this regime, you can no longer ignore the nonlinear effect. The singularity will start to bend down. And the stronger the collision is, the more severe the singularity bending down is. And the post-collision region will start to shrink. It's this shrink matches this kind of a shrink, of a decreased number of healthy gates. In the third regime, it's a late time when delta is much larger than two scrambling time. In this case, we don't expect there are any healthy gates left. Are any healthy gates left? And in fact, if you'll do a rough estimate, you will see that the number of healthy gates is exponentially small. And on the bulk side, a large black hole forms, the collision happens exponentially close to singularity. There's almost no space-time left here. And I should point out that very little is known about collision at this high energy. There might be significant corrections from stringy effect, which I don't know, which we don't know about. And after a qualitative picture, let me give. After a qualitative picture, let me give a full comparison of the total number of healthy dates in the overlap region and the space-time volume of a post-glisher region. So it's, let's say, it's this orange line represents the number of healthy gates as a function of delta t. This blue line represents the space-time volume as a function of delta t. We see that both of them start to first increase linearly in time, then decreases linearly in time, then stays exponential small. Density exponential small. And this panel is a time derivative of this one. We see that basically, aside from first cup of scrambling time and also first cup of thermal time and also a couple of thermal times around the transition to scrambling time, these two basically have a perfect match. So, and so far, what I've been talking about are basically old work. And now we'll talk about something, it's things that we have been working on and some things. That we have been working on, and some new standings we try. It's some new understandings about this problem. At the beginning of the talk, I mentioned that one question we really want to understand is that no matter the signals come from the same boundary or two different non-interacting boundaries, from the bulk point of view, we expect them to interact in the same way. But what's the boundary mechanism? In particular, let's look at a case where we have two. Where we have two objects scattering with each other, but they come from the same boundary. We again start from thermofuel double, and we evolve to some future time. We apply an operator, we apply a red perturbation, then we go back to some past time, we apply pink perturbation, then we evolve to the future again. If you stare at this a little bit long, you will realize that the quantum circuit picture is actually very similar with what we just discussed. From what we just discussed, From what we just discussed, there are two directions of the quantum circuit. One corresponds to the right-time evolution, one corresponds to the left-time evolution. But in this case, there are the two directions of quantum circuit. One corresponds to the future time evolution, the other corresponds to the past time evolution. We have two perturbations growing in opposite directions in one quantum circuit. In particular, if we again ask the question about the number of heldigates as a function of delta t, we expect that we should have similar behaviors. Would have similar behaviors, which would have first a linear increase with delta t, then linear decrease with delta t, then stays exponentially small. But what's the bulk picture that help us realize this? First, let's look at a case when delta t is less than one scrambling time. And in this case, there's not much back reaction. The two collisions just happen here in the exterior. And in fact, one can show that, let's say, delta T is the W and V that is. Delta T is the W and V that is separated by delta T. The number of healthy gates in the shared region is stored in this region. And as delta T increases, one can show that this part, one can see that this part actually grows linear in time with delta T. The more interesting case is when delta T is larger than scrambling time. In this case, there will be significant back reaction such that the first signal, the W signal, the first signal we send in, can no longer reach the boundary. It will be pushed. Boundary. It will be pushed towards the singularity. However, this bulk picture is also very similar to the case of a two-sided collision. And again, one can argue that the healthy gates are stored in the post-collision region. Why? Because again, has a feature that this point basically is at some fixed radius. And as the collision gets stronger and stronger, this singularity will bend down. And this region will shrink. This shrink corresponds to the decrease of the number of health. Corresponds to the decrease of the number of healthy gates. So one sees that there are some universal features when the collision is strong enough such that it is behind a black hole horizon. Basically, the shrinking of the post-collision region has to do with the fact that there are no more healthy gates in the quantum circuit. And in particular, we see that no matter the two signals come from one boundary or come from two different non-interacting boundaries, the boundary mechanism with which a collision happens is essentially the same. Happens is essentially the same. That partly helped me understand why the interactions, the bulk interactions, is the same, even though it looks like it's from a boundary point of view, naively looks like different, but in fact, it's exactly the same boundary mechanism. When I started this set-out project, what I had in mind is ER equals EPR to understand ER is equal to EPR. But later I realized that things can be more general. What we see is that we have a boundary magnet. We see that we have a boundary mechanism with which matter gravitationally interacts. We mean perturbations overlapping in one quantum circuit. And in particular, we can go beyond the ER equals EPR and apply this picture to one-size black holes, of course, assuming the interior exists. Let's say, for example, black holes with end of vertebrae. Then we have a more ambitious goal, is that can we derive the gravitational interactions, at least approximately, from knowing properties of a quantum? From knowing properties of a quantum circuit. What's the right quantity to ask about in this case? So, so far in all our work, we have been focused on asking about the space-time geometry after the collision. But is this the only quantity to ask about in order to characterize a collision? So, what quantity should we ask about? That's just a potential future direction. Another thing we have been working on is about two. I've been working on is about to try to understand collisions between localized shock waves. First, let me quickly review the geometry with one localized shock wave is worked out by these authors in this paper. So again, we have a shock wave that comes in at a particular boundary time. But in this case, we have transverse direction x, and this shock wave is also at a particular location x. X. And the back reaction is that what the back reaction gives us is that we will have some shift of crucible coordinates along the horizon. And the amount of shift will be X dependence, will be X dependent. And if you stare at this a little bit more, you will see that what this says is that from the amount of shift, you see that if you go away from XWL, if you go away from From XWL, if you go away from the source, it is as if that the perturbation comes in at a later time. There is an amount of time delay. Let's say at a source, the perturbation comes in at TWL. Away from the source, the perturbation comes in at a later time. The amount of time delay is controlled by the distance from the source and the butterfly velocity. So here is the quantum circuit picture. Let's say. So here I draw this, this is a transformation. This is a transverse direction, x-direction, and this is the lifetime evolution because the source we assumed comes in from the left. And what happens is that it comes in at a particular t and x, then it spreads in x directions with certain butterfly velocity as time increases, also spreads in x direction. So this is a circuit picture with one localized shockwave. If we draw the picture of a, let's say, with the circuit picture with With the circuit picture with two localized shock waves, we immediately see that there are two possibilities. They may or may not have, again, they may or may not have overlap. And one should be able to tell the difference between the two cases from certain boundary six-point functions. As I said before, we can diagnose the difference between no overlap and overlap. I mean, in this case, again, we should be able to tell the difference between these two. And in particular, let's look at this more interesting case. Let's look at this more interesting case where there are overlaps and we can slice it at different x. We notice that they behave differently at different x. So at some x they may have certain overlap. And at some x they may have smaller overlap. And if you go really far away, it's the overlap, just no overlap. And so earlier in our discussion of spherically symmetric shock waves, we basically Symmetric shock waves, we basically say that everything is a function of delta T. We focus on the time dependence on delta T. Now, this delta T will have extra X dependence. And it's a delta T originally what we had. And subtract of this amount of time delay due to the spreading. I mean, it takes some time to spread to different x. So we have a different delta g of x. This is a circuit picture. This is a circuit picture. The bulk picture is a little bit tricky because the metric in the post-collision region with two localized shock waves is, in general, unknown. But we can ask the question that can we say do some estimate or at least put some bound or can we make some quality statement about the space-time after the collision look like. Here, we are interested in one particular quantity, is that we know the geometry is that, let's say, in this horizon. That let's say in this horizon it has shift h1 of x. In this horizon, it has shift h2 of x. And we can look at a product of h1 of x and h2 of x. If we write down the expression, we see that it basically characterizes the amount of overlap in a circuit at location x, because delta s is the increase of entropy, s is the central charge of theory. We're considering a planar black holes. And so this is basically the probability of a B. So, this is basically the probability of being affected by the first guy times the probability of being affected by the second guy. It characterizes the amount of overlap in the quantum circuit picture. On the bulk side, this H1 of x and h2 of x should control the nonlinear effect of gr. Because if you just have one of them, then just propagate freely, we know everything. But when you have two of them, they will affect each other such that at the end, the geometry here is unknown. Here is unknown. In particular, we're interested in the case when delt of x is larger than scrambling time, what we call intermediate time and late time regime. In this time regime, from the circuit. Yeah. Question? So in this time regime... Huh? Five minutes? In five minutes. Okay, thank you. In this time regime, from the circuit model point of view, the total number of healthy gates, if you do some circuit analysis, the total number of healthy gates in the quantum circuit at gates in the quantum circuit at in the overlap region at the location x is actually only a function of h1 of x and times h2 of x. And it's expected what we get as before that it's just as what we got before that when h1 of x times h2 of x is smaller than 1 this thing is basically decreases linearly in time. When h1x h2x bigger than 1 then this thing stays exponentially small. So if So, if we assume that this correspondence between quantum circuit and interior geometry is true, we can actually make some predictions about the space-time after the collision. We would expect that the singularity will bend down, and the post-collision region eventually will become exponentially small at transverse locations x, where h1 of x times h2 of x becomes order. x times h2 of x becomes order 1. I find it reasonable because this is exactly when the nonlinear effect of GR becomes important, when this guy becomes of order 1. So in order to further check this, let's revisit some of the calculations for sparkly symmetric case. Let's assume, in sparkly symmetric case, the good thing is that the geometry at the post-collision region is known. But what if we assume we don't know the geometry? Then one can write down the retarded equations. Write down the Richard equations, and we consider a family of a radio null geodesic in this direction going towards the shock wave. And there's a one term in retarded equation basically gives you, so by the way, this data is an expansion. This basically tells you that if you have a family of geodesics, how the transverse area changes as you move forward. And this term, roughly speaking, gives you the stress-energy tensor once you have a Stress energy tensor once you have a null factor. And in our case, even if we didn't know the geometry here, we know that there is a delt function source here from the shockwave. And from this delt function source, we know that there will be a jump in expansion. In particular, let's say right before the shockwave, we're at a bifurcating surface, the expansion is zero. We know that right after this point, the expansion will achieve a finite. Will achieve a finite negative value, which is proportional to this strength of the source, but it's up to a constant. Because this constant will depend on normalization of this factor v. And if we use retarded equations again, we will see that the amount of affine time left before this family of geodesic reaches a focusing point is. Reaches a focusing point is bounded by one over alpha. So I want to make some comment here that in general, if a family of geodesics reach a focusing point, you won't conclude that you have a singularity. But in this case, we'll consider geodesics at a radial location. And we actually know the geometry here. So we know that this distance is also the affine distance to the singularity. And it's bounded by 1 over alpha up to a constant. And this constant will depend on the normalization of V. Depend on the normalization of V. And because of this ambiguity in this constant, this affine time itself has no geometric meaning. However, once we have two shockwave colliding, we can consider two vectors, two null vectors, v1 and v2, and we normalize them such that v1 times v2 is equal to minus 1. Then the product of this two affine length actually have physical meaning. And one can Physical meaning. And one can show that it's bounded by the curvature scale over alpha1, alpha2, where alpha1, alpha2 is what we just have. Coming back to the question I was interested in, it's localized shock waves. For localized shock waves, it's for localized shock waves. At first I was confused because if we want to still consider family of radion lines, but away from the source, there is no stress-energy tensor. The stress-energy tensor. Stress-energy tensor, the stress-energy tensor vanishes, then what will give rise to the jump we want about inner expansion? But later I realized that radial null lines are no longer geodesic. This is because they will feel attraction from the source. So if they really feel geodesic, they will bend toward the source. If we stick to radio now lines, they are geodesics before the collision. So, sorry, they are geodesics before they meet a shockwave and after they meet a shockwave, but they are non-geodisics along the shockwave. So, in the retardable equation, you have an actual term characterizing this being non-geodisics. And this term actually is proportional to this shift h of x, and it's a delt function. So, what we see that we again have a jump actually exactly of the same form proportional to h of x, and we again conclude. x and we again conclude that this affine length L is less than 1 over h of x. And so in order to make this meaningful, we repeat our story. We introduce two vectors, V1, V2, and we conclude that the product of affine length here, L1, L2, is bounded 1 by the curvature scale over H1 of X times H2 of X, where H1 of X and H2 of Where H1 of X and H2 of X characterizes how large the overlap is in a quantum circuit. You're not into the QA. We're now into the QA, so if you could just wrap it up. Okay, can I give one more minute? I think there's so this, so once we have a bound in this, and a naive estimate is that, roughly speaking, this region will somehow be bounded by the product of this. It's certainly not true. Product of this. It's certainly not true in a generic geometry, but here, I mean, this region actually satisfies Einstein's equation with a negative, vacuum Einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant. A very naive estimate is that if I just assume this is ADS2, and one will see that what we have is that we can ask the area here, that it again, when H1x times H2X is small, it decreases linearly in time. When H1x and H2X is larger, it And H2X is larger, it actually stays exponentially small. I mean, this is far from being rigorous, but I play with this a little bit at different dimensions. I somehow find that this behavior that is actually quite robust. I mean, I do have some intuition if we are in Euclidean space that when L1, L2 is larger than the curvature scale, we have a tree. When L1, L2 is less than the curvature scale, then we have a flat space. We have a flat space, but since we are in Lorenzen, I don't have intuitions, but we just see some robust results. And I think at the end, I will just leave some unanswered questions here since I already run out of time. Thank you very much, Yank. And I think we're going to take questions. Now, I will take questions from the people who are remote, and then I remember the people who are over there. So I could relay questions from the So I can relay questions from the interest of folks, or you can just pipe up. Okay, questions? Questions here. Other questions in there? None here. Oh, we have a question in the chat. Diang, do you want to maybe read the question and answer it? Let's see, a lot of times beyond scrambling, do you expect work? Beyond scrambling, do you expect wormholes? So it's not exponentially large or not even entropy large. It's just a two-scrambled in time large. So the question, I don't know. I don't know in general how wormhole affects Lorentzian time evolution. Plus, this large time is really not that large. But okay, but one thing I think I could comment is that recently there's a paper by Recently, there's a paper by Douglas Stanford, Jin Binyang, and Xuan Yiao. They studied four-point functions and to show that in order to maintain a flow value, I guess you need to reach almost entropy time, that a warm hose becomes important. We do expect that for six-point functions and this kind of collision in the interior, similar phenomena will happen. Thanks, that would be kind of cool. Thanks. That that would be kind of cool because at large times the region is like very close to singularity. Yeah, the region is very close to singularity. I'm really not confident to say to I mean that that's the most interesting that's the most interesting regime. On the other hand, the matching between quantum circuit and the bulk geometry is that you just see that both parts are exponentially small. When things already become exponentially small, what Exponentially small, what really can we? So, how much lesson can we really extract out of it? I don't know. I agree, it's a most interesting regime, but I have to say it's the regime that we know we are least confident about. It would be interesting if you could say that these little e to the minus s wiggles and correlators are telling you about the singularity. That's an interesting idea. Maybe we can try to pursue that at this point. I don't know if that's the. I don't know if that's the yeah, I don't know. I think there's a question from the in-person audience. Can I just ask? I had a more general question about what the limitations and prospects of this circuit approach to gravity are precisely. So it seems to be some sort of discourse. So it seems to be some sort of discrete representation of gravitational dynamics. Actually, in the uh, I mean, I don't have time to show this slides. One of the unanswered questions is that how to make this picture of a black hole interior as unitary quantum circuit more rigorous. I mean, it helps us learn a lot of things and it qualitatively get a lot of match. So I'm confident that there is a lot of truth in it, but we definitely don't understand it as well. We definitely don't understand it as well as that we understand the tensor network in the exterior, and that's an important problem. Yeah, but I don't have an answer at this point. I mean, I hope in the audience, maybe people have some ideas how to push this further. Is your hope ultimately to take a continuum limit or what is the ultimate goal? Ultimate goal. Yeah, do you want to take a continuum limit and get continuum Einstein equations? Do you want to show Equations? Do you want to show incorporate sub-ADSK locality in the tables? Okay, okay, good question. I mean, there is one question already asked. At this point, one goal I have is just to derive, I'm not saying that derived Einstein's equation, derive how matter interact, at least when the gravitational force is strong, maybe qualitatively. I think that's the first step I could see as a potential possibility. Other things like deriving Einstein. Other things like deriving Einstein equation go to continuous limit, I would say that's a hope, but at this point, I don't have any idea. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? Maybe I'll just ask one very quick thing, which is I there Is I uh there are these examples of um of black holes without singularity. This is kind of following up a little bit on Danielle's question. Um, examples of black holes without singularity, like so-called regular black holes. And I guess I'd be curious if you have any thoughts on how you. I don't. That's a good question. I mean, I don't have time to show the slides about unanswered questions, but if I do have time, the first one is about the role of singularity. And in this entire setup, actually, the existence of singularity plays a crucial role. Of singularity plays a crucial role. It prevents the meeting of signals that send in too late. But what if you don't have singularities? Then I would say that the story is no longer true. But it also doesn't completely break down in the sense that, let's say if you have charge black hole, you don't have singularity, and the signals can always meet no matter how late you send them in. But if you estimate amount of proper time or space-time volume, they have the room to meet. Volume they have the room to meet is very tiny, it's never large, it's limited. So, and how to understand that part, I find it very mysterious. I don't know. Okay, thank you. Okay, so maybe we should move on to the next talk. So, let's thank Ying again.
