Okay. Yeah, sure. So, it is my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, speaker Katarina Vichesani from Tel Aviv University, who is going to speak about non-traditional costs and set dualities. Please. Thank you. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me. It's my great pleasure to speak and share with you my results. And share with you my results on an ongoing project that is joined with Professor Shiri Arsten Avidan and Shai Sadovsky. This project, you'll see, has to do with optimal transport theory. But as we all know, optimal transport has many useful applications in convexity. And I'll try to show and explain exactly where that convexity shows up, even if it's hidden sometimes in here. Sometimes in here. So, the main object of our study in some sense will be those non-traditional costs. And when I say non-traditional, I mean cost functions that attain infinite values. So, usually people, the main object of the main most common cost function that has been used was a quadratic cost that measured just a square of a distance between the particles being moved. But now we'll be But now we'll be interested in many other costs, and in particular, we'll relate to a polar cost that is related to polarity transforming. But I'll tell about everything in more detail on further slides. Also, please, if I'm not explaining myself very well or something is unclear, please ask and I'll happily answer all your questions. Okay, so let me start by telling you. Me start by telling you what this whole thing will be about. I'll first make an introduction to optimal transport problems. So, if you don't know any transportation, please don't be alert. I will introduce all the definitions and so on. I'll talk about cost and use transforms, which will lead us to the notion of subgradient and general notion of optimality of a transport plan. So, this will be in the first section. Then, I will move on to what are potential. Move on to what are potentials and the existence of them and their relation with optimality. Further, I will move to a setting really of measures. I'll be trying to understand which measures can be mapped to which measures, and this will be the question of compatibility of two measures. And finally, this will lead us naturally to set dualities, cost set dualities. And hopefully, I'll tell you about all of it. Hopefully, I'll tell you about all of it very, very soon. Okay, so transport of measures. Let us consider two probability measures, mu and new. And the question of Mange, who was a French engineer who actually wanted to build embarkments. He wanted to move pile of sand to form an embarkment. And he asked, What will be the optimal way? What will be the cheapest way to do that? His cost function was the His cost function was the distance, Euclidean distance of mapping one particle to the other. And he asked for the existence of a transport map T. And this map is a map which has the property that for any measurable set A in our in space Y, the measure μ of the pre-image of A under the transport map must be the same as the measure of the set A. That of course makes sense. A. That of course makes sense. However, such maps don't always exist. For example, imagine if μ was a discrete measure with two particles and μ was a measure with one particle. So in particular, you can say, this is a discrete measure with here, measure half, measure half, and this would be a measure, this point would have a measure one. Then, I mean, we would have to glue those points, right? Or there could be an option of like splitting the mass, and therefore we would. Mass, and therefore, we wouldn't be able to find a map. And therefore, Kantarovich introduced a generalization of the problem. So, instead of looking for a transport map, he was looking for a transport plan. So, what the transport plan is? Transport plan is also a probability measure on the product space X times Y, such that mu and mu are its marginals. That means that for any subset A in X, we will have that the measure of pi. That the measure of pi at a times the whole space y is the new measure of a, and for any subset b of y, we'll have that the measure that pi of x times b is the new measure of b. Okay, so with this definition, one can expect already to have a solution at any point. And then, obviously, one can ask for a certain type of optimality, right? Type of optimality, right? But for that, we need to consider a cost function. So, cost function will be just a function on the product space x times y and giving you values from minus infinity to plus infinity. Note here that I write that the plus infinity is included in potential values of the cost C. And this will be important, as I said, the non-traditional measures will be attaining the value plus infinity. So, one might be interested in finding the optimal plan. Finding the optimal plan of transporting measure ν to ν, and we will say that the total cost of the optimal plan is the infimum of the integral of the cost with respect to this measure d pi. And the infimum runs over all plans pi. So the plans whose marginals are mu and new. Okay, so this feels like a very natural question, but would turn Question. But what turned out was a beautiful theorem by Kant Torovich, for which I believe he actually got a Nobel Prize. He suggested that there is a dual formulation of this problem. Namely, instead of looking for this non-linear problem, one can actually look at the following thing. One can find One can find the supremum over the sum of the integrals of a function phi and psi with respect to linear measures mu and mu, such that phi and psi, the sum of them, is below c of xy for every x and y. And of course, there are some measurability conditions on phi and psi. But what's fantastic about this is that this infimum here, defined above, is under very mild condition of obviously Very mild condition of obviously some measures involved, and one has to assume something about the spaces. I'm not talking about this, but this is sort of a very important theorem in transport theory. And this leads us to a definition, a definition of an admissible pair. So we are thinking about a cost that is fixed, and we will say that a pair of measures is C admissible, or I'll be often saying just admissible if for any X. Admissible if for any x and y we will have that the sum of phi of x and plus psi of y is less than or equal than c of x y, like in the duality theorem. Okay, so if I need to run a supremum over those functions, it makes sense for me to just consider the maximal admissible partner, right? I don't have to consider all the functions. So we define this, what is called a C-transfer. Define this, what is called a C-transform. A C-transform of a function phi is given as this infimum over all x's, such that we consider the infimum of the expression of the cost minus the function phi of x. And clearly, this phi c, the c transform of a function phi, is the maximal admissible partner of the function phi. Okay, so a few things to note about the c transform as it is an important. About the steep transform, as it is an important object here, is that first of all, it's an order-reversing transform, which follows strictly from the definition. Moreover, for any admissible pair, we will have that phi c is the maximal admissible partner, as I said. And further, we have that phi is less than or equal to phi c c, which can be just seen. So, we'll use this condition two here for the pair phi c. The pair phi C phi, right? And from this follows that phi must be less than or equal than phi c c exactly, right? And from this in turn follows that the c transform is an involution on its image, that is, that phi c c is equal to phi c. How can we see this? On one hand, we can use the order reversion and apply the function of the transform c to this inequality here, right? So we will get that phi c. will get that phi c is greater equal greater equal than phi c c c on the other hand we can plug in any function phi uh in here so i'll plug in a function phi c and i'll get that the function phi c is less than or equal than phi c c c right so we have that um our our c transform is um an order reversing involution on its image and we call this And we call this image of the C-transform a sequence. This will be quite important. However, I'll in this talk I'll move on to dualities on sets later on as well. Okay. Are there any questions at this point? Okay. So some examples, right? So that we know what we are working with. So we have a C transform here. I have chosen a cost function, which is the square of the Euclidean. Is the square of the Euclidean distance over two? And then we calculate the C-transform. We plug it in, we see that some terms factorized. And one with a familiar with the topic will already know that, yes, we are seeing here a Legendre transform, right? Due to the works of Shiri Arsen, Avidan, and Vitaly Millman, we know that Legendre is the substantially only order reverse. only order reversing involution on the class of lower semi-continuous convex functions. So we will already know what the C class here is. The C class is this difference of a square of the norm over two minus a lower semi-continuous convex function, right? But what one can note is that in fact, we can use a different cost, just the scalar product minus the scalar product of xy instead, and all those terms Instead, and all those terms that here anyway factorize will vanish, and then we will have the Legendre of minus phi is minus phi C. Or in other terms, phi C is minus Legendre of minus phi. So the C plus here will be upper semi-continuous concave functions. Okay, the second example is, as I mentioned to you, part of the The project of Shiri and Vitaly about those order-reversing evolutions, and they have, as I told you, considered the lower order-reversing transforms on geometric convex functions, that is, convex functions, which are non-negative and attain a value zero at zero. Okay, this is supposed to be zero. So, it turns out that with this transform, this is the A transform here. Transform here where this plus means that I'm taking a maximum of the function in the bracket and zero. Okay, it turns out that this function, all this transform also has a cost associated with it. And this is what I'll be calling the polar cost. It's a minus logarithm of this color product xy minus one. And what one can see now, having this easy calculation done here, is that the C class of this function is the minus. This of this function is the minus logarithm of a geometric convex function. Okay, yes. So, this polar cost is in fact a motivating example for our whole project because it doesn't fall into any well-known categories. In particular, it attains infinite values, right? So I'll define it to be plus infinity if the notion in bracket is less than or equal to zero. All right. So. So, having those things in mind, let us come back for a second to the counter of duality theorem. So, we had the admissible pair, right? And some plan pi. It is clear, it is absolutely clear that this inequality must hold, right? Because this is an admissible pair. So, phi of x plus this should have been y here. Okay, sorry for the typo. This inequality is always true. This inequality is always true. So, the question is: where and when, under what conditions we get the equality. And for this, we introduce a notion of the C subgradient. So we consider the C subgradient for the class of C class functions, for the functions in the C class. And it's defined to be all the points XY such that the sum of phi and phi C is exactly. Of phi and phi c is exactly equal to the cost, and it is finite. Okay, and the c subgradient will be the section of phi c at x. So why the name? Clearly, if you consider that our favorite sort of cost of minus scholar product xy, this definition gives you exactly the subgradient that you think about when you write it. When you write it, namely, we can say that this can be rewritten since the phi c is the infimum over the difference. We can write that this is the same as if we have for every z that phi of z is less than or equal than c of z y i minus c of or maybe say um Z y, right? So we'll have a subgrade, C subgraded at point X if the following hold C of X Y plus Y of X, right? And this is exactly the standard subgradient, which you think about. And this is very, very useful. Moreover, it has to do with the notion of optimality. So, as I showed you, it already sort of is not. I showed you it already, sort of is natural to consider because of the counter-reviduality theorem, but moreover, it characterizes as well, as we'll see in the next slide, really the optimality of a plan. So to describe an optimality, we can use this notion of cystic monotonicity of a plan. It is a geometric notion, but what it means. So let me read it slowly and then I'll tell you what it means. So we'll say that a set. It means so we'll say that a set so now we are abandoning measures, and I wrote here Rn times Rn for our imagination, but it should have been probably X and Y. But I mean, you can think about the sets in Rn. So the set is syzyclically monotone if for any M, for any M and for any M tuple of points in G, such that all points in G have finite total cost, we have the cost of our pairing is... Of our pairing is in fact less than if we permuted it. So, taking the example of the French, if we would have some bakeries and then we would have some cafes and say we had the plan how to transport our croissants from bakeries to cafes, right? This plan would be cyclically monitorable, or in fact, or optimal, in other words, if the cost, so each of those arrows gives you some. So each of those arrows gives you some sort of cost, the C of X I Y I. So this is X I, this is Yi, is less than if we, for example, send our crossounds from bakery one to cafe two, right? And we rerouted all the all the crossounds, right? So this is the notion of cycyclic monotonicity. And it's very easy to check that the C subgradient, so the set X and X and phi C subgradient of phi at X is cisyclickly monotone. And this follows exactly from the definition of the C subgradient that I wrote you in a previous slide. So we can see I wrote that for every Z, we'll have that phi of Z is less than equal than C of Z Y I minus C of X I Y I plus. i plus phi of xi. Okay, so looking here, I have the sum of over, I will take for z here xi plus one, right? And I can take the sum of all of this, but then this sum from this notion of the cyclic monotony of the C subgradient will be less than or equal than the sum of phi of xi minus phi of xi plus one. One, but this is exactly zero. So we see that the C-subgrad is indeed cisyclically monarchic. What's interesting about all of this is the theorem due to Rockefeller, Rochette, and Russendorf. And it tells you that the opposite implication is also true, namely that for any real valued cost this time. So now this theorem only holds if the cost attains only finite. Attains only finite values. But then the notion of cyclic monotonicity is equivalent to the existence of a function such that our set G lies in its C subgradient. So we will call such a function phi a potential. The proof of this period, so Rockefeller proved it for quadratic cost and Rochette and Russendorf proved it independently for other real-valued costs. Real valued costs. But they used the same basically technique. They defined a function phi of x by this infimum over all m tuples of points in G. So we look at those differences of costs, like in the cyclic monotonistic condition. And the real valued assumption is crucial here to show that the function has a value on which it's finite. If this condition isn't, the real value condition isn't satisfied. That the real value condition isn't satisfied, then it turns out, in fact, that this theorem is not true. And we can give an example. So take our favorite polar cost. I say favorite because it's our favorite, but I hope you'll like it too. And it turns out that in one dimension, so if we take it on R times R, R times R, then it turns out that the cycyclic monotonicity or p-cyclic monotonicity is equivalent. P-cyclic monotonicity is equivalent to the function lying on a graph of a decreasing function. So, here I take a function. What this blue line corresponds to is that x times y is equal to 1. So, this is the boundary of our infinity costing set, right? So, this is our plus infinity cost. And we don't want to transport anywhere to any points with the cost infinity. But everything here, the whole graph. So, but everything here, the whole graph lies above. So, we are good. And this set is cis equal to model tone. However, it does not admit a potential. And this can be seen in quite an easy way. Namely, I'll call this point x1y1. So this is the point, say, three quarters and the corresponding y, right? So this will be x2y2, the point three over two and three over four, x2, y2. And I'll take a point here. And I'll take a point here. I'll be moving this point. So I'll just write it as ZW, which is obviously of the form T3 minus 2T. And what I can see from the C subgradient, we will have to have the following equations fulfilled. We'll have to have phi of x1 minus phi of z. So this is the, this comes from the C subgradient condition. the C subgradient condition must be more or equal than C of X1 Y1 minus C of Z Y1, right? So this is with Z and this point. On the other hand, we'll have to have that considering the points W and X2Y2, phi of Z minus phi of X2 must be greater than or equal than C of Zw minus C of Z Y2. So now I can sum those equations, right? Those equations, right? What you'll see is that phi of z will cancel. So on the right-hand side, on the left-hand side, sorry, I'll have some real value, while the right-hand side will depend on the parameter, say, t going to one. And as we send the point closer and closer to the bad set, the right-hand side will be unbounded, will be growing. This is an easy thing to check, so I'll leave it to you. But this already tells me that you're going to be able to. But this already tells you that the Rockefeller, Roshette, Russender theorem cannot hold for infinite-valued costs. Okay, so here is a theorem. It is due to Shiri Arsene, Avidan, Shaisedovsky, and myself. And it tells us that if the cost attains infinite values, then the existence of the potential, so the C-class functions, function for which G is a subset of its C subgradient. Gradient is an if and only if condition with the CPALC boundedness. So, this is a condition which is similar visually to the cis-aclifti monotonicity, and obviously it's a stronger condition. Let us see what it does. So, we call it CIPA-boundedness because instead of considering cycling rerouting, we only look at a path. But we must look, we take a starting point and an end point, and we must find. End point. And we must find a constant that depends only on the start and end point, such that the sum for any path of any length, so this m must be independent of the length of the path, the left-hand side must be bounded by this constant. Okay, so we call this c-path boundedness, and of course, c-path boundedness is stronger than synthesic monotonicity. Let us see why. So, first of all, So, first of all, if our set G is not cyclically monotone, then we could consider a starting and ending point, which is the same point. And then if cyclic monotonicity doesn't hold, then over a cycle, we would get a positive sum over all those differences of the costs. But then we can cycle through this path over and over again, and we could get an arbitrary large sum. So the set would not be C path bounded. The set would not be C path bounded. Okay. Moreover, for real-valued cost, the c cyclic monotonicity implies C path boundedness. And this can be easily seen. I'm just writing the C path, C cyclic monotonicity. I can move this side on the right-hand side, right? And this will be my M. But this crucially depends on the fact that the cost C X1 YM is a real value. So in Is a real value. So, in our non-traditional case, these points will have a finite value because that's how we choose G, which choose G in the finiteness zone, but this point could a priori have an infinite cost and therefore the bound would be meaningless. Okay, so I talked to you so far about having a set and some sort of notion of. Set and some sort of notion of optimality and certain structure on it. So the existence of a potential gives you something about the structure of the optimal plan. But I've totally abandoned measures here. So now I would like to come back and I would like to address a question of, okay, I'm giving you two measures. When for those two measures, I'll be able to find a potential. Okay, so I take a cost function as always, and I'll consider an example. Okay, so An example, okay. So, the easiest example is to consider discrete probability measures mu and mu, and assume they have the same cardinality and each of the atoms have the same the same weight. So now, if the cost was real valued, like in the standard, in the quadratic case, then we could say, okay, sure, I have all the edges in my graph. So I can think about this transportation as a, look at it as a. Transportation as a look at it as a bipartite graph with vertices and X and Y, and edges that are probably weighted. But at this point, I would like to just distinguish between there is an edge, and that means the cost of transportation of one point to the other is finite, or there isn't an edge because the cost of transportation was infinite. And now I would like to find a matching, right? So obviously, I say if we have. So, obviously, I say if we have all the edges, so the cost is real-valued, then certainly there is a matching, and say, one can try to find then an optimal matching, but just a matching, right? So in this case, it's triple. In this case, I'm sure everybody already thought about it. This is the topic of the Holst merge theorem. And we know that in a barbecue graph, we have the following condition: if the set If the set of edges from any subset, so we had the X, right? We had Y, and there were some edges. For any subset of vertices in X will have a certain amount of edges, and that amount of edges, sorry, that amount of vertices in S that we have chosen must be less than the number of vertices in Y to which we are connected. Okay, that the number of neighbors. Connected, okay, that the number of neighbors must be larger. All right, so this is the compatibility for discrete probability measures and Holzmer's theorem, but we can reformulate it in a more continuous way. So instead of saying cardinality of the vertices in X, we can say measure of a subset in A. So this will be a condition for every A subset X must be less than or equal. Okay, must be less than or equal than the measure of mu of all those points that have finite cost with x. So now note one thing. I am not a priori assuming that the plan I'm going to get has a finite total cost. If I have infinitely many points and the cost can be very, very large, then the total plan, the cost of the total plan might be infinite as well. I'm just wanting to find a I'm just wanting to find a condition that will tell me that there are points that I can transport to with a finite cost. And so we call this C compatibility of two measures. So I moved the new on the, I took the complement of the set. So now we have the measure of all the points Y, which have infinite cost with X. And that needs to be less than or equal to one. This condition, this C compatibility condition is. Um, the C compatibility condition is a necessary competition. Um, this can be seen in the following lemma. If, um, of course, we have some cost, we have mu and mu, if there exists a plan pi, which is concentrated on the set of finiteness, then mu and mu will be already c compatible. Okay, so our main theorem here is that despite the fact, as it turned, it's not. Despite the fact, as it turned, it's not hard to find examples that the C compatibility is not a sufficient condition. We can find plan, we can find two measures which are C compatible, but the transport plan will not have a potential. However, slightly stronger assumption, which we call strong C compatibility, and that is we just exchange the less than equal sign with the less sign here. With the slight assumptions, we have two possibilities. The slight assumptions, we have two polar spaces, we have, and this is quite important. We proved it for a continuous cost function. We write here the assumption that this is symmetric, but this is mostly for simplicity of notation. But the continuity is important. If the two measures mu and mu involved are strongly compatible, that is, we have this following inequality, then if there exists some plan with a finite total cost, then Finite total cost, then there will be an optimal plan which is concentrated on a C subgradient. So there is a potential for the plan. So this assumption here that there exists some finite cost plan is very common in literature. It's my question to you and to myself: how can we guarantee that the plan with a finite total cost exists? That's for later. But this assumption is here. This assumption is here so that we can use the well-known machinery and to say that if there is a finite total cost plan, then by some argument, by easy argument, I mean easy, standard classical arguments that one can find in Villani's book, we can say that there exists a C optimal plan. And if there is a C optimal plan, then with the mild assumptions on cost, it needs to be lower semi-continuous, usually that optimal plan will be cyclically monotone. And then what we do. On. And then what we do, we argue that this condition of strong C compatibility corresponds to the plan, gives us this C-path boundedness. So it merges the gap between being cyclicly monotone and C-path bounded. Okay. But I'm not going to get into details. This is available in our paper on archive. I hope you'll enjoy it. But I'm also obviously happy to tell you more about it in private conversation later. Conversation later. But I want to, very quickly, because we don't have that much time anymore. I would like to tell you something about the set here. So note that in our polar cost, so I have the cost p xy, I'll remind you how it looks like, minus logarithm of x dot y minus one. So if I consider this cost, then what it is set in the bracket. Then, what did this set in the brackets here become? So, I fixed a and I consider all the points y such that for every x in a minus ln of this is equal infinity. What that means? That means that the x dot y minus one needs to be less than equal than zero. Okay, but I'm sure already everybody sees it, that this is in fact just a polar. So that's how you can link it to convection. So, that's how you can link it to convexity again, right? So, we are retrieving the polar set. It turns out that this makes for a much more general definition, and this is what we will be calling the C duo of a set. So we'll have X and Y and a cost function. We'll have a parameter T, but in fact, it doesn't play much of a role, and I'll tell you why, so it will be omitted in the notation. So, we define the sedual of a set K as the intersection. As the intersection of all y's for which the cost of xy is greater or equal than t. The t doesn't play much role because you can consider instead a cost function c tilde, which is equal c minus t, and then take t equal to zero. So that parameter isn't of much importance. And as I told you, for example, if you have the polar cost, you retrieve the polar transform, but also if you took But also, if you took the cost minus xy plus and t equal to minus one, for example, like this, right? So then you also retrieve the polarity set. But in fact, one can get so much more. And a very basic lemma here tells you that those sets really do behave like as you can think about it. As you can think about it as polars. So we will have indeed that K will be a subset of KCC, that it is order reversing. If L is the subset of K, then Kc is a subset of L C and that this C duality is indeed a involution on its image. So we will call this a quasi-involution on the like all subsets of X, but it is an involution. All subsets of x, but it is an involution on its image. And this is all not hard to check. You do it exactly like it's done for the polarity transform, of course. Okay, so a theorem here. Oh, but one more definition before we go to the theorem is that we'll be calling the image of the class a C-class. I'm sorry for the confusion with the C-class of functions. This is C-class of sets. And this will be, we'll be assuming usually that the cost is upper semi-continuous. Usually, that the cost is upper semi-continuous, or because of those applications in optimal transport, that it is continuous because optimal transport theorems usually need the lower semi-continuity. Here, we need the upper semi-continuity to say that those sets are closed. This is just for our convenience. I imagine that this can be made as a different assumption. Okay, and then the set KCC will be thought of as a C envelope of the set K, and it will be all. Set k and it will be all, of course, in the c class. Okay, so now the theorem is as follows: if you give me any order-reversing quasi-involution, that is, for any subsets of x, k and l, we have that k is a subset of ttk and it is order reversing, that is, if k is subset of l, then tl is subset of tk. Then I can always find a cost function c. Find a cost function C. And here, as I said, we consider continuous cost functions, but if you had different spaces, you could consider a non-symmetric cost function, of course. But what is the point is that you can find a cost function which realizes your order reversing transform. That means that for any set K, we will have that Tk is equal to Kc. And this follows from the fact that From the fact that the image of this transform, or actually the pairing given by this transform, already describes the whole geometry of the set. So in the proof, what one actually does, we consider the pairings. So we consider the pairings TK times TTK, right? If I apply T to this set, I go back here, and from this set, I go here. And I consider the union of all those sets. The union of all those sets, okay subset X, and I call this this is a sorry, this is equality, this is how I define set X, and it is a subset of X times Y. And this set already gives us the whole information that one needs to have about this order reversing involution. And one can define the cost. C in a trivial way, we can define, we can say, for example, if the T from the previous. If the t from the previous slide we wanted to be zero, as I mentioned, we can. We can say that the cost is equal to one on s and s minus one everywhere else. And that already, it can be shown that already defines exactly the transform. So this is the part of an ongoing project, as I said, with Shire Arsenevidan and Shaisadowski. And there will be a lot more to tell you soon, I imagine, but for now. Imagine. But for now, thank you very much for your attention. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much, Katarjina. So please, questions and comments to the speaker. Can I ask something? Yes, please. Hello. This is a really, really silly question, but when you define Kc, the polar with respect. Kc, the polar with respect to c i was expecting to to the definition be more similar to the to the usual polar. So you put greater or equal than t. Yes. Is it the same if you put less than or equal to one and you change the costs? So yes. The way the fact like why we do this is because it came from this application in optimal transportation. Here really one needs the equality with infinity. That equality with infinity. So to capture this, we say greater or equal. Okay, I see. Okay, okay. I think I get it. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I have a question. So under what condition on C, the K colour will be convex or it's automatically convex. This, this K C, the C class. This case C, the C class, it does not have to be convex, no, not at all. You can make C to be a very weird thing, and then you'll get a very weird class. But there are many classes, there are many costs that will give you, say, subsets of context sets. Oh, yeah, for sure, like the inner product, right? Nective inner product. For example, yeah, that's the regular dual. Okay. Yes, but you can decide. So we are writing, it's a Writing, it's a paper, a paper in progress, a zoo of dualities, where we'll give a lot of examples. And those examples include costs that induce, for example, I don't know, I don't know if you've heard about flowers, that's vital moments, interest rate, or you can recover star-shaped sets, you can get unconditional bodies. So, there are many, many subclasses. There has to be certain properties. Subclasses, there has to be certain properties to it, of course, which follow from those two conditions. I'm sorry, I'm not sure which slide there was anymore. But this order reversion and being involution on the image. Yeah, I had a paper with my collaborators that we have a very special cost function here. I will just maybe. I will just maybe communicate with you later on. So, this course function is very interesting to us, also. Maybe you can have a better idea to explain what's going on there with our. I would love to hear about it. Yeah. Thank you very much for this nice talk. Thank you. Okay, more questions? Okay, if there are no more questions, please let's thank Katarjine again.
