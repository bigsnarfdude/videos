It is related to what my advisor, William Feldman, talked about yesterday about the dynamics of water droplets. So it's mainly about the anisotropic case. Yesterday, someone asked about these isotropic case. So I hope you would find something, would enjoy it, or maybe you will find more problems. So before giving the PDEs, I want everyone to look at this water. So if you look at this and hold it still, you think of it, the water surface as a flat surface, right? But it actually not. If you look closer and you look at this interface, I actually have a, I took a picture on my own bottle. I hope you would see it. So, if you look at this picture, this is the water surface. So, it's not flat. And here there's a flat, here it is flat, here it is flat, but here there's a transition here. So, sorry for the because I use my iPhone, which is not as clear as others. But you can see here it's even more wiggly. The curve is not flat. So, why? So, to understand this specific. So, why so? To understand this phenomenon, we would like to propose a simple PDE model, which is a toy model, but I claim it's not oversimplified. It's already a rich mathematical model. So we have these PDE. So on the upper half ball, which is V1, intersect X1 positive, we have U is a harmonic function. I assume that everyone here knows harmonic function. And on the function. And on the flat boundary, B1 prime, B1 intersect x1 equals 0, we have these strange nonlinear boundary conditions. So the minimum of the aeronormal derivative of u and the tangential derivative of u, the absolute value of it, you take the minimum of it, it is zero. So everyone with a prime would correspond to the tangential boundary here. Okay, so here gradient prime. Okay, so here gradient prime would correspond to the tangential gradient, and d1u d1 is just the derivative with respect to x1 coordinate. So it's the inner normal derivative. So this is a gradient degenerate version of the well-known Neumann problem. So Neumann problem would just be B1U equals zero. The problem is a generalization of the well-known theonovsky problem. Known the obstacle problem, which I don't assume you, it is a well-known disk community, but it is pretty well-known in the free boundary problem community. So we just replace the tangential derivative of u by negative u. So what does this problem solve? A typical solution is the negative real part of x plus yi to the power of three half. And the solution looks like this. Here we are extending. Looks like this. Here, we are extending this solution evenly to the whole ball. So you can see here, this is the function when the solution touches the zero obstacle, it is just constant zero. And when it is strictly below the obstacle, it satisfies a Neumann boundary condition. So it's a free boundary problem. Physically, this means that if you fix a platoon wrap, it's the boundary. And here there's a vertical plate. Boundary, and here there's a vertical plate, and you pull it up until the surface touches the plate. There will be such a touching here. And the problem is: what about what is the regularity near these thin boundaries? In 2004, Athanas Poulos and Caparalli, they showed the thin optical problem has optimal C1, one-half regularity. This is optimal because we have the Because we have an example that exactly has this, like the previous example. Here we can see there is a three-half exponent here, and it has exactly C1, one-half regularity. So this is an optimal. And from then, a large amount of attention has been paid to this area. And this problem has been found in applications in many areas like mathematical finance and etc. But I want to introduce the new regular. The new regularity results on the gradient degenerate Neumann problem, which I simplify at a GDN. So, in dimension two, we follow the same spirit of the phenoptical problem and we recover the same optimal regularity, even though they share the same optimal regularity. I would show later. There's a picture that is totally different problems. But in higher dimensions, there are many problems. We need to. We need to introduce an additional condition F, which I will introduce later. Under this additional condition F, we will also have C11 half, and which is also optimal. Even though we have this additional condition, this already includes the thin obstacle problem case. So we are actually giving a new proof to the thin obstacle problem in every dimension. If time permits, I would. If time permits, I would discuss something about the comparison principle, even though this is a degenerate problem, it doesn't have uniqueness. We have a comparison principle for the minimal super solution, and we have a characterization for that. So what is the condition F? Given a solution u, the boundary B1 prime can be decomposed into three components. So one is Cu, and we have NU, we have gamma U. Cu would be the set where the Du would be the set where the inner normal derivative is positive. And because of the boundary condition, it is contained in the set where the tangential derivative is zero. So this is basically, so this is an open set, subset, and it is basically composed of domains where U takes constant values. And NU is the relative complement of the closure view, a Cu. And on these sets, we basically have P1U0. So it's basically. So it's basically a Neumann problem on these subsets. And gamma U is the common boundary of these two open subsets. So gamma U is the called the thin free boundary, which is the most interesting thing in this problem. So here we have these three graphs. So on the right, so we fix the outer boundary data and we Boundary data, and we solve the three different problems. So, on the right-hand side, we have the Neumann problem, and we can see when we restrict to the boundary, it is just a smooth function, but it doesn't have flat thing here. But here, this is the thin obstacle problem. So when, as you can see here, it becomes flat when the function touches the obstacle. But here, there's no flat thing. It's always Neumann here. It's always Neumann here. This one is the minimal super solution to our gradient degenerate Neumann problem. So, as you can see, there are two flat faucets. And unlike this, everything can only go down near the obstacle, right? But here, it can not only go down, it can also go up. So, this is a completely different problem from the, actually a different problem from the thin obstacle problem. A different problem from the thin optical problem. And the values on each faucet here, this is this value. The thin obstacle problem corresponds to only one value, which is zero, or either it doesn't have any values. And UCU in this case, it has two values, right? Like these values, we would call them degenerate values. So the condition F. So, the condition F is about the number of degenerate values. If there are infinitely many degenerate values, there would be a lot of infinitely many facets piling up. And that would ruin the differentiability, actually. So this is one major problem that we're not able to resolve now. But other than that, if the condition F is if we have this finite. Are only if we have just finitely many, we can show C11 half regularly. Connection to other problems. So, why do we study this problem? So, this is closely related to the homogenized Banoulli problem. So, as my advisor, he discussed the dynamics of the water droplets, and he mainly talked about in the isotropic case. In the isotropic case. But when we do homogenization, we assume inhomogeneity and we do homogenization. The problem would eventually be an anisotropic Bernoulli problem. So here, the normal derivative on the free boundary of the positivity set would be dependent on the function on the inner normal of the free boundary. On the inner normal of the free boundary, which is n and next at the boundary. So we are talking about a very simple case, which is Q is one in all other directions, and Q is two is two in E1 direction. So this can happen in homogenization when we do like a laminar case. So we are actually dealing with a very simple case. And I will show you, even in this case, it is already. Even in this case, it is already pretty problematic. So, why can we derive the GDM from this problem? So, we consider solutions of the special form. So, W is squeezed by two linear functions, like this. And when the epsilon, we send the parameter epsilon to zero, we can show that W actually has this expansion. Uh, expansion. So, w would be approximately x1 plus epsilon u and plus the lower order terms, where u is exactly the solution to the gradient degenerate Neumann problem. So it is also related to other problems like the gradient degenerate problems. In 2013, Ember and Serba-Spray showed C1-alpha regularity of these type of problems. Problem. And in 2020, Hector Chang and Pimentel proposed a similar problem to our problem. It looks a little bit different, but here we just replace this by the inner normal derivative, right? So we are talking about something non-local, but here it is more local. And the gradient general annoying problem and these problems can end And these problems can, in general, be classified as the unconstrained problems, which has been overviewed by Higali and Shakoli in 2018. It's considered as some kind of interesting problem. Later, the gradient general problems can be, there are studies focusing on the non-local version. So we replace the Laplacian of U by the fractional Laplacian, especially when sigma is bigger than one and two, they can show C1, alpha, They can show C1α regularity. However, their estimate degenerates to Lipschitz one when sigma is sending to one. But our GDN is exactly in the critical case, sigma equal one. Because if we solve the global problem, the internal derivative, the Neumann derivative, is equal to the half Laplacian on the boundary. So to solve these GDN, we need to, we not only We need to, we not only need the techniques from the gradient degenerate problems, we also have to combine with the Nopso problem, the combination of both. Let me now talk about the techniques. There are several, there are at least two new challenges. The first one is we don't have obstacles in general, since it's a grading degenerate problem. As a result, As a result, there is no semi-convexity argument, which is crucial in the synopsical problem case. And they can use this semi-convexity argument to obtain C1 alpha. But in our case, we cannot use that. We don't find a general way to show semi-convexity. So we need to find other ways. So we resolve this by moving the classical harmonic analysis to asomates to show. Harmonic analysis to assimilate to show, for example, bounded harmonic functions have non-tangential convergence to the boundary, something like that. And we use the Amber monotonicity at this stage to show point-wise differentiability. And we use compactness arguments and C1 alpha iterations, which comes from, which is used, which is pretty classical, even though there are many fine details in our problem. In our problem. In other words, our method provides a new proof to the thin optical problem. The second problem is the extra condition F. It is a challenge we currently don't know how to resolve. So we need the degenerate values to be finitely many. We don't know how to do it when it has infinitely many. But we can avoid this by showing, we can avoid this in dimension two. In dimension two, we have who estimates. So, we in dimension two we have boo estimate by using complex analytic technique. This is a really cute technique. It is just one-page proof, I will show you. So, since I don't have much time to talk about my details of the proof, I want to show with this diagram. So, we start with some continuous viscosity solution. Continuous viscosity solution. If you don't know viscosity solution, you just think of it as some kind of double of weak solution, but it's just continuous. And it is obtained by classical viscosity solution theory, by Pern's method. And then we use the ancient Nishi lemma to show it's, you can think of it some kind of weak bursting method to show Lipschitz regularity. So we basically can obtain Lipschitz regularity for all solutions. And then All solutions. And then here is the difference between our method and the thin obstacle problem. So for a thin obstacle problem, they can show semi-convexity. And then from semi-convexity, they can obtain C1L by regularity. But in our case, we need to use the non-tangential convergence of the gradient of U. So because we have Lictor's regularity, so the gradient is bounded harmonic functions. And then, and then. And then we can show on P1 prime it is almost everywhere differentiable. And now, from almost everywhere differentiability, we use Almger monotonicity formula to show that it is actually pointwise differentiable. And with pointwise differentiability, we use the compactness argument and C1 alpha iterations to show it is T1 alpha. To show it is T1α. And after that, it is classical methods in the thin optical problem, which is using the algorithm monotonicity and ACF monotonicity to show the outcome regularity. Okay, so it's a long journey. And the major contribution, I think, is this part, which means because in the ethinops. Because in the thin option case, thin option case, the almond monotonicity is only used to show the optimal regularity. But here we need this to show even for the pointwise differentiability. So I would later give a sketch of the proof from this to this, but I want to first give a at least let you learn something about the two-dimensional thing, like what happens in the two-dimensions. Like what happens in the two dimensions, which is pretty easy to explain. So, why we can avoid the condition f in dimension two is: okay, so we define f to be d2 plus i d1u, and because u is harmonic in the upper half ball, this defines an analytic function on the upper half ball. So, the problem is what is the regularity of f when it crosses the b1 prime boundary. Now, if we take the square Now, if we take the square of it, we obtain the real part is d2u squared minus d1u squared, and the imaginary part is 2 times d1u d2u. But because of the boundary condition, this is satisfied pointwise, not pointwise, this is satisfied almost everywhere. And so, minima of these, and this is zero almost everywhere, so this is zero almost everywhere. So, two times d1u d. everywhere so two times d1u d2u on the b1 prime boundary it is zero almost everywhere so it's so it actually satisfies a there is a boundary condition there so it can be extended uh oddly to the whole ball which means this this uh analytic function g can also be extended to the whole ball as an analytic function now f square is g and and which means f is the square root of g. Which means f is the square root of g. So this C1 half regularity comes out because of the square root here. Okay, so this is not so rigorous, but at least you can see why we have these regularity here, at least in two dimensions. Okay, now in higher dimensions, let's talk about the proof of point-wise differentiability given almost everywhere differentiability purely on B1 prime. Differentiability on B1 prime. So, first, on NU, we have it as just Neumann problem. On Cu, it is just Dirichlet problem with constant boundary data. So, on these two open subsets, it's pointwise differentiable. The only problem is on the thin free boundary, gamma u. So, let's assume zero is in gamma u and u zero is zero, and we want to blow up ut is equal to utx divided by t. Divide by t and this is a Lipschitz blow-up, and we want to show it is uniformly converging to zero so that it actually shows it is differentiable and the gradient is zero. Okay. How do we prove that? We extend ut to the whole ball evenly, and we want to define these frequency functions, the NDR. This is the Elmgrim frequency function. And by Elmer monotonicity, And by Omber monotonicity theorem and the condition f, which is crucial in this case, we show that NUR is monotone, where U is the solution to GDN, is monotone in small R, and NUR, when NUR is constant, kappa, if and only if U is a kappa homogeneous function. So it is a pretty powerful tool here. How do we use that? How do we use that? So as you can see, N U T R converges to N U infinity R when Ut, so U infinity, if we assume U infinity is any limiting profile of Ut, okay? So when we take T to zero, this will converge to U infinity, and so the frequency function converges to this. On the other hand, On the other hand, because of the definition of here, if you plug into this, this is equal to nu, which doesn't have a t here, but you multiply t with r to the to the radius. So now, because this functional is monotone in r, you send t to zero, this would converge to a constant, n u at zero plus, which is a constant mu, which means, which means u infinity r is a constant. means u infinity r is a constant mu and u infinity is a mu homogeneous solution but because of the lips estimate we have mu is one it is it has to be one homogeneous and we can actually classify these one homogeneous solutions and because zero is in the in the thin free boundary it implies u infinity has to be zero so this proves uh the pointwise differentiability and but But due to the time limit, as I said, there are a lot of other techniques I cannot show you. But now, this is the regularity theory, and then I want to talk something about the comparison principle, even though we don't in general have uniqueness. A very quick example is if you give the fixed outer boundary on the circular, if you fix the boundary data on the The boundary data on the circular boundary. And you saw the thin optical problem and the Neumann problem. They both give solutions to GDN. So we don't have, in general, we don't have uniqueness. But we do have a characterization of the minimum super solution, which means, which is this, the boundary maximum principle. The boundary maximum principle says that if a solution That if a solution, a solution, a function u satisfies boundary maximum principle, if u, when restricted to b1 prime, which is the flat boundary, satisfies maximum principle. So, which means for any subdomain omega of B1 prime, the maximum of u on the closure of omega is equal to the maximum of u on the boundary of omega. So the comparison principle would The comparison principle: there is a comparison principle for these is if v is a super solution and u is a subsolution which satisfies the boundary maximum principle, we do have a comparison principle. And using this comparison principle, we can actually show the equivalence between three kinds of solutions. So, first is a solution coming from the flat asymptotic expansion from the Bernoulli problem, as I discussed in As I discussed in from the polluting problem. And the second is the minimal super solution to the GDN. And the third one is any solution that satisfies the boundary maximum principle. So we have these equivalents between these three kinds of solutions. Okay, I think that's it for in my talk and any questions? And yeah. Uh there is currently I don't know. I could then maybe say a little bit more about what this this last time you're. This is the slack iconic. Oh yeah, sure. This one, this one, I don't think it has. This is an anisotropic version. So it's a homogenization. This is a homogenized problem. So before homogenization, we do have a energy for this. But after homogenization, do you know any energy for this? Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, so before modernization, we do have, yeah, yeah, when you modernize the performance rather than doing the other related to this pinning that I have minimal sequencing different and the limited minimal specificity So have you look at other uh fractures that applies because it seems to me that you're looking at the critical one, which is dangerous, no? So the diffusion is order one, and then you have the gradient which is order one as well, no? So there may be things that are going on that level, no? For example, this problem for the Laplace. Plus if you have a function that is either harmonic or the gradient is equal to zero, it's automatically harmonic. Yes. But for fractional ones, it's problematic because we don't have these properties. Yeah. For other fractions, no, I haven't started. Yeah, I haven't started yet. It yeah, yeah. You mentioned some results. There are some results. Yeah, there are they are mostly. So when, yeah, uh, so when sigma, where is it? Okay, yes. So when sigma is in between, when sigma is in between one and two, they have shown it's C1 alpha. So, but when sigma is less than, is equal to one, I think it is Lipschitz's estimate. Is Lipschitz estimate, but less than one, it is C alpha, just a holder regularity. Yeah, so that's they're considering a pretty, their problem is a little bit more general than ours, but our problem has this special property that is also related to the thin offshore problem. So we have higher regularity than theirs. You mean rescaling this problem to the global ones? The meaning of the Neumann and the Vangensian kind of separate the Neumann minus And put the normal minus one, normal minus one, so it's like opposite sign it's just a right-hand side. Yeah, exactly. Oh, yeah, you mean uh you mean uh inhomogeneous problem? Like, yeah, so. So putting sorry I want to put out the yeah so you put put the F here oh yeah okay that's a very interesting question so we recently are doing something some other kind of homogenization problem and I think that would be related uh I haven't really finished so I couldn't Really finished, so I couldn't explain in detail to you. But yeah, we can discuss later. Any other questions? Don't forget the which one? Which one? Sorry, which looks like a thumb here. Okay. Yeah, we don't. Yeah, I would I was just for you, the first picture, like just for fun. Yeah, that was just for like intriguing. Just for like intriguing everyone, like, yeah. Energy, you mean, for this already arrived, I guess, kind of this class. Yeah, so there is in general no energy. I don't think there is a kind of the most vigorized thing. So, so, like, maybe it would be further. Yeah, I guess it's not, I yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's the it's the micro-inhomogeneity. So here this. Inhomogeneity. So, here this problem is derived after we linearize a homogenized problem. So, this micro scale friction coefficient, it is basically created by the, as you said, the glass. It's not smooth. And we assume the friction is oscillating at very small scale. We do homogenization. And after homogenization, we will. And after homogenization, we will get this anisotropic Bernoulli problem, which is basically the water droplet dynamics, as my advisor just talked about yesterday, but it's in an anisotropic setting. And we do the linearization of this problem, and then we obtain this GDN problem. Problem. So that's basically the most, as my advisor just said, the most linearized version we can obtain. Yeah. Yeah, we're talking about a very simple case, laminar median, laminar friction. In like more complicated situations, we haven't started doing that even. We haven't started doing that even because, even this is already a problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But at least I think the pictures, I think it's pretty intriguing, and maybe you can understand what I'm doing. The platform is like stopping different parameters at so many different navigation. Any other questions? If not, let us take our last question. Thank you, everyone.
