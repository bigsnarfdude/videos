So welcome back. Welcome back, everyone. So this is the second session of Geometry by Arithmetic. And today's speaker is Benson Fab, and he's going to speak about rigidity of modular spaces. So thank you. Okay, let me start my timer now. Thanks very much to the organizers for the invitation to speak and for. For the invitation to speak and for running the conference, I appreciate it. And if people, I love to have a lot of faces, I play off the audience a lot. And so the more people who could add their videos for whenever you can, that would be great. Okay, so let's start. Basically, what the talk is about, the story of how I got onto the subject. The story of how I got onto this subject is: I'm basically a third, I'm a Thurston student, and maybe 10 years ago I started to learn algebraic geometry, and it was just one miracle after the next. And so it becomes, as you all probably know, quite addictive. And so I started to want to come from a background of like rigidity, maast argidity, that kind of stuff, I wanted to understand kind of Kind of show that these miracles are truly miracles and basically understand the driving mechanism behind them. And so the general thing is where you start with an algebra geometric construction. And this gives you sort of a constant. And this gives you, so to sort of formalize this, this gives you a morphism, say psi, between moduli spaces, which are usually quasi-projective varieties. Or another example of kind of constructions, you can phrase them, and we'll see several examples. You can see a section of a bundle and a kind of guiding principle. A kind of guiding principle for me anyway is that psi is a miracle. And so more mathematically, precisely, you could try to prove something like holomorphic rigidity or regular rigidity. You could look at morphisms, but I'm going to look at holomorphic maps. It's a little more general, but you can think morphism. If you have any map between If you have any map between mod lie spaces that's non-trivial in some sense, for example, non-constant and holomorphic, then it has to exactly equal your map psi. And another variation on this would be what I'd call topological rigidity, which is if you have some map, and let's Some map, and let's say each of your moduli spaces is part of a family parameterized by the integers. This is a common occurrence. So, m sub m and n sub n. And suppose it's non-trivial in some sense, like not homotopically trivial, and it's just like continuous. Then what you want is that the only time this happens is for your specific parameter space. So, let me maybe call these m0. space. So let me maybe call these m0 and n0. And then m equals zero, n equals zero, and f is homotopic to your given. And there's many other kinds of rigidity for rational maps, regular maps. You're trying to characterize these miracles in terms of simpler data. And the theme here is that the guiding principle, this guiding principle is that you should have this kind of uniqueness. That you should have this kind of uniqueness, it produces many conjectures and predictions. I'm sorry. Can I just ask a question about the subscripts? So you're thinking of M and N as varying in families, and then and you're saying varying in families, but integer families parameterized by like the natural numbers, like the moduli of genus G curves. Like, like the moduli of genus G curves or something, and we'll see. Yeah, Benson, the algebraic geometers don't consider that a family. Oh, no, I know. Yes, sorry, collection, the collection. No, I understand about that. Um, so one thing I'll say about this guiding principle, it introduces a lot of, I think, definitely introduces a lot of conjectures. And I'm reasonably confident in the guiding principle because I've made a bunch of conjectures that have been proven by me, by other people. By me, by other people, and some are actually classical. And today, I just want to do three examples. And in case, and there are many other kind of types, but I want to concentrate on these. And everything is over the complex numbers. It would be really interesting to do it over other fields. Okay. So that's basically all I want to say. And I will just say one other interesting aspect that you may see a little today, but maybe not, is Do not is many different methods have been used to try to prove these things. So I've been using methods, cobological methods, algebraic geometry, several complex variables, geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology. So it's a kind of mixture of things. So let me give some concrete examples here. So the first example, I want to talk about something that's very simple and very classical, but it's still already extremely rich. And I hope to show you. And I hope to show you that to demonstrate that. So, resolving the cortex. So, let me start, though, with a clue, a tip of a kind of iceberg that's indicative of something. You'll remember from undergraduate algebra, I remember where I was sitting when I solved this homework problem for undergrad algebra. Math 431. Sorry, Cornell. SN, if you have a surjection from the symmetric. If you have a surjection from the symmetric group Sn to Sm, and N is bigger than M, let's say it's bigger than 2, then that only occurs when N equals 4, 3. And let me just remind you of the proof. Okay, so it's sort of this amazing thing that you have this rejection. So the first thing is A n is simple for n greater than or equal to 5. So the image of a simple group is either trivial or everything. Trivial or everything because it's simple. And so you can show just by counting the order of the groups. Psi of An is one, so you can't be surjective onto Sn because you factor through Z mod two. In the other direction, in the other direction, there's this thing that you learn, and basically you let S4. And basically, let S4 act by conjugation on a set of three elements, the conjugacy class of two cycles. And you show that this is surjective. That's not hard to prove. So it's sort of amazing that that's the only one that works. And my question will be why? I mean, you can try S5 and let it. I mean, you can try S5 and let it act on other conjugacy classes, and some of them have a smaller number of elements, but you won't act transitively, etc. But so if you want, this sort of indicates that something interesting is going on, but there's actually a lift of this picture. If I let Bn be the braid group on n strands, which you can take to be the fundamental group of the space of unordered configurations of n distinct points in the complex plane. Points in the complex plane, there is a surjection from Bn onto Sn. And what that surjection is, you label your points in some way, and this is uniquely defined up to you can relabel, but then it'll be up to conjugacy. And then you get a permutation. So let's see, one goes to three. So let's see, one goes to three, three goes to two, two goes to one. So you get that. So you have this rejective thing, and there's a proposition. I don't know who proved this, but this is easy using Thurston normal form for elements of the Bray group, sort of modern technology. If you have a surjection from the Bray group to the Bray group, n greater than M greater than 2 again, that's true if and only if Nm equals 4, 3. If Nm equals 4,3. And in fact, you have this commutative diagram, S4 to S3. And this bottom one is the same homomorphism as above. And I think what you do is you take, if the generator is sigma one, sigma i is switching the i and i plus first strand. And you send sigma 2 to itself. That happened. So, again, why 4, 3, though? It sort of seems like an ad hoc thing here. So, any questions so far? But let me give an explanation for this. Maybe I'll go to the next page. Let me give an explanation for this. So, I'll call it a lift of the lift. So, whenever you see something that's sort of even something like in group theory that's a little miraculous, Like in group theory, that's a little miraculous, you should look for some deeper explanation. And so, I'm going to let polyn this is going to play an important role. So, if you have just take the set of monic square-free polynomials of degree n over the complex numbers, z1 plus, sorry, a1 z to the n minus 1 plus a n, such that the discriminant of a1 to an Is not equal to zero. I.e., P is square-free. It doesn't have repeated roots. Okay, so note that it's very classical that there's a map from the space of polynomials to the configuration, square feet polynomials to the space of n-tuples of distinct points. You just send a polynomial p to the set of. Polynomial p to the set of roots of p. And there's actually an inverse map. If you take z1 to zn, you send it to the polynomial, of course, z minus zi, which just, if you write this out in the coordinates of a1 to an, it's just the elementary symmetric functions, maybe plus or minus. So this is an isomorphism of isomorphism of quasi-rejective varieties. And so the fundamental group of the space of polynomials is the Bray group. In fact, Bn of the space of polynomials is a k pi 1 space. All the higher homotopy groups vanish. So it really encodes all the homotopy, the Bray group does, of the space of square foot polynomials. Question? Questions? Okay. So Ferrari in 1545 found a method. It's called resolving the quartic. They were trying to solve the art, find a formula for the quartic, which they did. But for us, what the construction gives, it shows there's a morphism of quasi-projective varieties. Varieties, I'll call it FER for Ferrari. It takes any polynomial quartic and it produces a cubic in a way that varies. So these points, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, I'm thinking of this as an unordered n-tuple. So I'm parameterizing the left-hand space by the right. The left-hand space by the roots. And it gives a polynomial whose roots are z1, z2, and z3. And the map is just z1 is, let me write it down just because it's sort of fun. Minus q3 plus q4 squared over 4. z2 is q1 minus q2 plus q3 minus q4 squared. 4 squared over 4 and z3. And here's the remarkable thing about this map. Firstly, it's equivariant with respect to the symmetric group acting, S4, the homomorphism from S4 to S3, or from B4 to B3. So it's equivariant, but also, and you can see that too, when you permute the roots, the Q's, you get the same Z. The Q's, you get the same Z's, they're permuted in the same way that, you know, anyway, that the Z's are permuted. But more remarkable is, since the QI are distinct, the ZI are always distinct from each other. That's the miracle. The ZIs are always distinct. And as an exercise to you, I don't think this is like such a trivial exercise, but it's really fun. It's doable. Find a geometric interpretation of the Ferrari map. Ready? I give you four distinct points. Ready? I give you four distinct points in the plane. Give me a way to come up with three points in a way that varies algebraically. And there's a theorem. And this is not that hard to prove from a different point of view than Lynn used. Like if you know the Thurstonian kind of point of view on Bray groups, it's not. There's other proofs now, like I have other proofs. If you take any holomorphic map from poly n to poly n. poly n to poly m n greater than m greater than two and suppose it's non-constant there's always a constant map and holomorphic then one of two things happens there is one extra thing that can happen f factors so you can take a polynomial and you can just take its discriminant and then you can map the c star into polynomial And then you can map the C star into poly M somehow. Okay, so that can happen. This is sort of occurring because at the pi one level, just as a little comment, the fundamental group here is Bn, the fundamental group here is Z, and there is a surjective homomorphism of the Bray group that takes each generator of the Bray group to the generator Z. But more interesting, other than that silly thing that can happen, Nm equals 4,3 and our mystery map. And our mystery map is equal to resolving the quartet. Okay. So I'm not going to talk about the methods here, but maybe I'll just say quickly, you can see that any map polyn to polym will induce a map of their fundamental groups, which are ray groups. So you have to understand homomorphic. So, you have to understand homomorphisms of grade groups. And so, the problem I'd like to pose is to classify all continuous, regular, holomorphic, et cetera, maps from polyn. So, is there a way to canonically come up with a polynomial of a higher degree whose roots are also distinct? Yes. Hey, Benson. Yes. So, when I learned that fact you started with in the same class, we learned about the crazy embedding of S5 into S6. That's not the one that you expect. So, is there a braid group version of that? It was Andy Gleason who taught that. Good question. Good question. I don't know. I don't know. There is a paper of Snowden, Fakhil, and other people who might be here. I'm sorry. Be here, I'm sorry. Um, who explained using algebraic geometry the automorphism, which is related to what you're saying, the interesting outer automorphism of S6, which is sort of quite different. Yeah, I think you take the usual embedding and hit it with algebraic geometry terms. Yeah, so let me just say why I think this question is really interesting and challenging. Firstly, let me say there is a continuous in fact map from poly n to poly m plus. From poly n to poly n plus one and therefore to poly n plus k you'll see that just takes if you take an n tuple of distinct points so again i'm parameterizing polynomials by their roots and i can just form the polynomial i just need distinct roots so what i will do i'll add one element and i'll just plus one okay so that's definitely distinct and this is continuous question can you guys Continuous question: Can you guys do this in a holomorphic way? Maybe you just replace the zi by zi squared. Of course, that doesn't work because you won't be distinct. And in fact, it is known that this follows from work of Lin and Trevor Hyde has a proof that there does not exist a holomorphic polyn to polyn plus one and bigger than three. You'll see for three there does actually, but Actually, but such that F of the N tuple is disjoint from the original N tuple. So you can't add points, but it is potentially true that given a polynomial of degree n, you can associate a polynomial of degree n plus one with just different roots. So this makes it really interesting. And let me just mention, and this is in a paper. And this is in a paper. I mean, this part was known, but the statement is they're disjoint or that they disjoint. Oh, sorry. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. There exists many interesting homomorphisms at the topological level from Bn to B 2n. And so from polyn, just because it's k pi1 spaces. And I want to point out papers of two of my Papers of two of my former students and Kevin Kordak, Lei Chen, Kevin Kordek, and Dan Margoli. There's really interesting homomorphisms. Like you can do these like cablings of grades. So let me just say the, I'll just use the word cabling. And the question would be like, are these coming from something algebraic or not? I'm guessing not, but it would be really interesting to claim. It would be really interesting to classify. So it's a whole mystery. So those are all open problems. So that's all I want to say about resolving the quartic. But this is an example of, I think, that we sort of show that in some ways it doesn't solve the whole problem yet. But like this map resolving the quartic is incredibly special. It is indeed a miracle. And I think when you see the proofs of these things, you sort of understand resolving the quartic better. Okay. So I want to move to a different topic, but are there any questions? But are there any questions? Okay. So now I want to do other very specific. Yes. Go ahead. No, Shel, you could go. Oh, okay. So, I mean, what kind of technique did Ring use to prove such a statement, the Gargebird geometric method? Yeah, so I'll show you later one of the techniques. In the third example, I'll show you some of the techniques. Okay, but these are sort of new kinds of questions. Okay, but these are sort of new kinds of questions to some extent. So there's new techniques, but there's also well-known techniques, probably to some of you guys too. We'll add new techniques. So here's a question for the audience here. I'm concentrating on a very specific example. I could look at hypersurfaces and degree D hypersurfaces in PN, but let me focus all the way in on smooth cubics in the plane. Does there exist a way to continuously pick, continuously choose? Continuously choose a point on every smooth cubic curve C in P2. So, in other words, let me just restate this mathematically. Does there exist a continuous section? Sigma of the following bundle. I'm going to call it E1. You'll see why I'm going to call it one in a second. So take the set of smooth cubic curves in the plane. And now take the set of cubic curves equipped with a point. And that is a fiber bundle where the fiber over a curve. Fiber bundle where the fiber over a curve is the set of points is that curve. This is the universal cubic, and of course, there's a map that just forgets that you've chosen the point, and you're looking for a continuous section sigma. And more generally, can you choose an n-tuple of points of distinct unordered points? And what that would mean, I can replace the fiber. I can replace the fiber with the space of configurations of points on the curve. So you can think of that as the bundle, I'll call it E sub n. And it's the set of pairs, a curve, and then an n tuple of unordered points. And then pi not equal to pj. And then again, you can just forget. Can just forget, and you want a section to this, and so this is called an n-multisection of this bundle. But let me just call it n-multisection because we're just, so does everybody understand the question, can you choose a point continuously or not? And let me recall any smooth Smooth cubic curve in the plane has nine. To me, this is pretty amazing, nine distinct flex points. Sorry, something's sort of wrong with my writing thing here, but I don't have the time to figure it out. Of course, it only happens during a talk. So flex points, which just means the intersection multiplicity is at least three. At least three. So, what this produces, and you can check it out that the equation for the flex points varies algebraically in the parameter space. So there exists an algebraic nine multisection. So, sigma of a curve, I can associate to it the set of flex points. So, my very first conjecture. So, my very first conjecture was that there's no way to even continuously pick fewer than nine points. And in fact, there should be no way to continuously pick n points unless nine divides n. And Wei Anchen proved that. I'll discuss that in a second. But we just created every smooth cubic comes equipped canonically with these nine points. But let me remind you that if you have a cubic and a point, this gives you an elliptic curve. Curve and then you can associate to that the set of k torsion points. Sorry for my writing. So what this gives you is for all k greater than or equal to one, there exists nine k squared. There exists a nine k squared multi, an algebraic nine k squared multisection. And this leads to you can add multisections. So this leads to torsion construction, where you can add multisections, take the primitive K-torsion points, and this is like 19th-century stuff. I think Cayley wrote a paper. I think Cayley wrote a paper on this. I'll give a modern reference in a second. So there exists an algebraic n multisection for this strange list of numbers for all the n of the form 9, and then you add up over some finite subset of natural numbers j2 of m, where j2 of m Is equal to m squared times the product over primes p dividing m of 1 minus p to the minus 2. So for example, there's a 9 multisection, there's a 27 multisection, there's a 36. By the way, there's not an 18 continuous 18 multisection, but let me just say what is known. And these are going to be all conjectured by me in 2016, sort of using the guiding principle. And the two papers are Wei Anchen, 2018 in Advances. And then my other student, Yshan Banerjee. And Wei Anchan, who was my former student now, in 2021 proved the following results. The first one, actually, it's due to Kurt McMullen. It's in the Banerjee Chen paper. It's in the appendix. He allowed them to write it up in the appendix. Is that every Is that every, I don't know, algebraic and multi-section. So this is this one. Sorry. And multisection of the bundle we've been talking about equals. About equals an n-torsion construction, a torsion construction. Okay. So that's the rigidity, these miracles of taking the flex points and the torsion points. Let me point out that why it's 9k squared, once you pick a point, you get a group structure, but you're not able to pick a point. You can only pick. Don't, you're not able to pick a point. You can only pick a nine-tuple. So there's nine different choices, and each one gives k-squared, and you check they're distinct. The second thing that is known, which is due to Wei Anchen, is that continuous and multisections. So, this is answering my first question. When can you continuously pick points? This is still an open question. This is still an open question. Only if 9 divides n, but not for n equals 18, for example. And that's Banerjee Chen. So it gets really delicate. You're trying to match up what exists and what doesn't exist. But you'll see some interesting things start to happen. Banerjee and Chen show that any continuous, this is Continuous, this is topological rigidity, nine multisection is homotopic to the one that I talked about, adding flex points. So the flex points is the only construction. And I'll mention just one more, and this makes things really interesting. For all them, at least four, you can choose. You can choose in a smooth fashion n points where n is 18 is of the form 18 j2 of n, n greater than or equal to 4, not homotopic to any torsion construction, to any algebraic. So what's the meaning of this? I think the smallest one is n equals 2. I think the smallest one is n equals 216. So there's some canonical way to choose 216 points on a on every cubic curve, but not in an algebraic way. So maybe I'll just end this little section by giving a few open problems. Firstly, even for, you know, finish off, there's still many, many open cases. There's still many, many open cases, smooth cubic curves. There's, of course, the same question for degree D hypersurfaces in PN. And again, I'll show you some methods hopefully in the next example. I just couldn't do it for all just because of time. And another one, and this might be something that you guys. And this might be something that you guys can already do, but points on abelian varieties. When can you choose a point on every principally polarized abelian varieties? On principally polarized abelian variety. So it's sort of multisections of the universal PPAV of dimension G. And I can prove so far that, like, there's only one way to choose a point, and that's choosing zero. But choosing Using k-tuples, you can do that with torsion points, but are those the only ones? That seems harder, but maybe you guys already can give answers to that. And I'm aware that this is the same thing as finding rational points in the function field case in some degree and extension. So this is really a rational point. Should have advertised this as a rational points thing, but I barely know what a rational, what rational means. Okay. Okay, and let me just make one more remark before I move on to my last example. Sorry, I have a timer here. There exists a map. I'm going to connect the first two things. From degree three polynomials, there exists a morphism to like k squared. Can I too hush in? So pluton is the same. So it's the same as finding rational points over some extension. But how do you make sure that it's distinct, that the points stay distinct over every five? Oh, sorry, yes. Sorry. So it's not quite, sorry, you're right. It's not quite the same, but there's variations of the question. Sorry. So the question I introduced today is not quite the same as finding rational points, because I'm asking for distinct points, a distinct tuple. But there's related questions where you don't have to make them distinct. You don't have to make them distinct, oh, okay, okay. And there's different, sorry, and that's more closely related. See, I knew I'd messed that up. See what? Okay, don't thank you, Bourne. Thank you, though, for pointing that out. So here's a cool thing you can do. If you give me a polynomial, P of degree three. So that's three points in the plane. I can take my three points in the plane and then my point at infinity. Then I do a two-sheeted branch cover of that. Do a two-sheeted branch cover of that, and I get an elliptic curve, and it has a canonical base point to lift to the point at infinity. And there's four branch points. So I can take the set of k-torsion points, I guess, minus one of the elliptic curve y squared equals p of z. Anyway, so these things are sort of related, and there's a whole interest. Of related, and there's a whole interesting story for Poly 3. But for now, I'm going to leave it. But let me stop for a second and ask: Are there any questions for the last 10 minutes? I mean, this example you just showed raises the question of like, should we talk, should we be talking about maps from one of these spaces to the other, or should we consider even a correspondence between two of these spaces to be an interesting miracle that might be rich and unique? Oh, yes, I agree with you. And in fact, part of the stuff I'm not talking about today. Of the stuff I'm not talking about today is kind of correspondences between moduli spaces. Should they always come from some arithmetic explanation? Anyway, that's a really interesting thing. So let me talk about my last topic, rigidity of the period mapping. And this is coming from a paper, like partial progress here is coming from a paper by Farb. Just a few weeks ago on the archive. And so here's what I want to talk about. The final miracle. Oh, let me say I have posted on the website of Burrs or show several more examples and other kinds of related guiding principles of these kinds of miracles. Related guiding principles of these kinds of miracles, I wrote up just a thing for people who might be interested afterwards, because there's many, many more. I just had to pick, I thought it's useful to pick three specific special examples. Smooth genus II curve. Sorry. And yeah, sorry, since I'm running out of time, I think people here know what the Jacobian is. And there's a map. And there's a map from Ng, the space, the moduli of genus G curves, to Ag, the moduli space of G-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties that takes a curve to its Jacobian. And this is called the period mapping. It's been studied since Riemann. It's period mapping, period Riemann. It's amorphism, it's injective by the Terali theorem, etc. Okay, and my question is: is there another way to attach a principal polarized abelian variety to a genus G curve? And the theorem, which is just like I said, posted a few weeks ago, let F be a map. F be a map from mg to ah and I need g greater than or equal to four and g greater than or equal to h greater than or equal to one. Otherwise, the second thing is you need, or it's not true, be non-constant and holomorphic, then you're equal to the period mapping. Equal to the period mapping. For experts, you can make a G n and n greater than or equal to one, and you get the same thing. It's the period mapping. It factors through. So adding the data of some points doesn't help you. Okay. Again, part of the reason is to understand the driving mechanism of why these things are the only ones. Why is the very mapping the only mapping? Another one is to do like. Do you like a kind of systematic search for miracles now? And related to that, so I want to try to prove this theorem, but I'll leave that for the last six minutes here. But I want to tell one more example that's really interesting to me. And this is something Sam Grushevsk told me: algebraic geometers are trying to find many variations of this. So he was excited about what I was doing because. What I was doing because I can tell them to stop looking, or where my proofs break down, that's where they should look for the new constructions. But let me just do the classical one. There's variations on this. Let Pg be defined to be the set of X comma theta, where X is a genus G curve, and theta is just an element of the first homology, which you can think of as a homomorphism. Which you can think of as a homomorphism of the fundamental group to Z mod 2. Sorry, F2. So it's a curve equipped with an unramified cover, a two-to-one cover. Okay. And there's this amazing morphism. Well, before I say that, let me just say this moduli space is a covering space of, right, where you just forget the fact that you've chosen something in homology. The fact that you've chosen something in homology that's not zero, so it's a two to the two g minus one sheeted covering space, and there's this amazing morphism due to PRIM, I think in 1900. It's called PRIM and it goes from PG to AG minus one. It'll take a curve equipped with a choice of a two-sheeted cover, and what happens is you take the And what happens is you take the Jacobian of the cover, and transfer basically gives you an embedding of the Jacobian of your original curve, and you do a dimension count, and that's a principalized abelian variety of rank G minus one. So all of a sudden, you get a dimension drop. And of course, without saying the conjecture, you, I'm leaving the conjecture as an exercise. The only way to get a... The only way to get a Beline variety from a PRIM is either this one or the one where you forget the cover, and then, yeah, anyway, so I'll let you make the conjecture now. And I want to end up my talk the last three or four minutes with a cartoon of the proof of proof that if you take If you take F going from, let's say, Mg to AH, H, a G going or equal to H great or equal to one, and G going or equal to four, polymorphic, non-constant, then G equals H and F is the period mapping. Just to give you an idea. So, here's the criteria. So here's the cartoon. Step one, you look at F star, and this gives you a map from the orbifold. There's a stacky issue that I do not want to discuss, but basically the orbifold fundamental group of moduli space is the mapping class group of a surface. And then this will give you a map to the orbifold fundamental group of AG, which is the integral symplectic group. And so now. And so now it's purely a group theory problem. What are the representations of the mapping class group to a symplectic group? And this uses some work of Corkmaz, lots of work of Thurston, lots of people. Congruent subgroup property. Essentially, this is a result of Corkmaz, is that F star is trivial, is the zero map, or G equals H and F is F star equals. Is f star equals J star, but now everything in sight is a k pi one. So f is homotopically trivial to a constant map, or f is homotopic to j. So the entire difficulty, so this is kind of step one in all these things. A lot of the moduli spaces are k pi ones, so it becomes like a group theory problem. Now you have to understand how to navigate around in the group, and the whole thing becomes. And the whole thing becomes when is if you're constant and holomorphic, then it's not hard to show F is constant. So the key thing is showing that the period map is unique holomorphic map in its homotopy class. J is unique holomorphic map. In its homotopy class. Okay, I started two minutes and I want to end one minute early. So I have one minute. So maybe I will make myself stop writing. It's unfortunate. So let me say this. The things I use, and I encourage you to look at my paper, I use the fact I use curvature properties of AG, and it has a canonical metric that's less than a curvature less than or equal to zero. I do an energy argument. To zero, I do an energy argument to say if you are homotopic to the period mapping, this is holomorphic, this is holomorphic, let's restrict to a curve, say, and then you get a family of curves. And I prove that each individual one is holomorphic. I use Satake compactification. I know I'm just using buzzwords, but that's okay. Sataki compactification and Chow to show you get a family of curves coming from Mg that deforms, you get families of abelian varieties. Get families of abelian varieties, deformed families. Then I use faulting's in cyto to show to construct families that are not deformable. So it must be the trivial deformation. So now I'm equal at a point, and that's a really good start. F equals J, at least for one point. And then I can use hardcore several complex variables theorems of Narasimhan and Borrell to prove you're actually globally equal to each other. And again, a key property. And again, a key property is something we've seen already in previous talks: is that Ag is hyperbolic, Toby Ashi hyperbolic. It's covered by a bounded domain in C to the N. So you're using a lot of geometry here. Anyway, I'll just say see the handout for more examples of this kind of guiding principle. And there's some having to do with maps between finite groups. Maps between finite groups, but I will stop. Thank you. Just for the record, I was keeping track. I'm on time. I'm really against going over. And we started two minutes late, so I'm exactly on time. Just for the record. Thank you very much. All right. Is there any question? If you have a question? Did this study? Did this study, Professor Benson Park, thank you for a great talk. Did this study in complex category somehow give you some insights on further problems in arithmetic for you to pursue? I'm sorry, it's going in the complex category. Did this study in the complex category lender you some new insights, new problems in arithmetic over finite fields? Yeah, so I think all of the techniques that I've used and that were used in the I've used, and that were used in the other theorems. Especially, you can imagine you're obstructing sections using topology, but there's a um, it's all over the complex numbers, it's all using topology of complex varieties, it's all using this kind of rigidity of holomorphic maps into bounded symmetric domains. And so, all the methods fail for characteristic, they don't exist for characteristic. Characteristic P, they don't exist for characteristic P, but the theorems, I mean, maybe you guys could tell me. I think some of the things, some of the theorems, a lot of the theorems should, you know, they're definitely analogous things for characteristic P, but I don't know how to even go about proving them. Yeah, so that's my answer, I guess, is that it has either like a home space from Mg to Ag, wouldn't this complex statement have some kind of Complex statement have some kind of ramification over general base? I don't know. Never mind. Yeah, maybe someone else could answer that. All right. Okay. Is there any question? I mean, characters like P, you'd at least have to take into account the Frobenius. So, for example, you can send a curve to the Frobenius twist of Jacobian and things like that. Right. So, then you'd hope that was all you can do. And the Fourier square twist. I mean, you know this. Any question? So let me ask some questions. So there's a handwrite link, handout and team provided. And then so there are some, so this statement of Sarah Moho. This statement of Sarum was Hook's fault. Is it Hoxfault? So he attributes it to, he attributes it to my student, Peter Huxford, proved, yeah, he attributes it to Huxford and Magma. By the way, in the chat, someone was kind enough, Tim was kind enough to give you my handout. Thank you. Right. And then, so this is a unique. So this means that subjective homophys. That subjective homomorphism from this fundamental group to this Bay group, wire group, is unique. That's up to conjugacy. I see, I see. Interesting. So he did it so far with the computers using computer agent. But yeah, just for people who haven't seen, on the handout, there's some problems relating to there's a lot of interesting geometric group theory problems that come out of these that are kind of characterizing, you know. You know, trying to characterize why WV6 is so important for smooth cubic surfaces. I mean, we know why, but anyway. Okay. Any other question? Then let's thank the speaker again. And then maybe we can have a chat on the Galatan. Right. And then we will resume up to like so. Like a Sati. So I don't know which time are you in? So 10 minutes later. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Great talk. Thank you. Thanks. Just quickly. How are you doing, Bjorn? It's been a while.
