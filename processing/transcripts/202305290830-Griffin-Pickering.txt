Oh this um shall we wait for the new fun side which is from here or no we go okay fellows with the first talk of today's last section and the speaker is Megan Christian Fickery from UCL, University of College London and the talk will be on Pazineural Limit for the Ionic Plaza Rospon System. Thanks very much Maria and thanks to all the. Thanks very much, Maria, and thanks to all the organisers for the opportunity to speak here today. It's my first time in Granada, so it's very exciting. So, what I want to present today is the kind of the latest in a series of works in collaboration with Michala Yakobelli, who is somewhere right on time. And yeah, so this is, yeah. So the model that this is based on is a certain This is based on a set model for plasma. And I mean, most of what I will say in this talk will be strictly mathematical, but there are a couple of things about the physical setting that will be useful to understand what I'll talk about. So plasma is one of the states of matter, along with solids, liquids, and gases, but it's one that we meet less often, perhaps in our daily lives. But it's actually the most common form, at least, of the ordinary matter in the universe. So the kind of applications usually one has in mind. Applications usually one has in mind. Lots of things in astrophysics, so lots of the stuff they study there is made of plasma, and the kind of terrestrial application is coming from research into nuclear fusion. What we need to know for this talk is the essence of what a plasma is. And a short description of it is that it's a gas whose underlying particles are charged. So they are interacting with electromagnetic interactions. And there's one other thing that's important for what I'll discuss today. That's important for what I'll discuss today, and that's the types of species that you find in a plasma. So, the way that this kind of system forms is that you have a bunch of neutral gas, say, say, out in space, and it's subjected to, say, a high temperature, for example, in the sun, or a strong magnetic field that causes the dissociation of these neutral particles into charged particles. So, on the one hand, you have the negatively charged electrons that have come away from the rest of the particle, and that leaves behind And that leaves behind positively charged ions. So you have two distinguished species with opposite charges, and the other thing that's different about them is that they have very different masses. So an ion is much, much more massive than an electron, and this makes a difference to the kind of modelling that's used. Okay, so the model I'll present on today is a very classical model in kinetic theory, and it's a type of Blazo-POSM system. So this is something that was interesting. So, this is something that was introduced around the beginning of the 1900s as an approximation for a kind of a dilute plasma in an electrostatic regime. So not very much magnetic effects. And it's a particle of kinetic type. So the unknown in the system, F, depends on the time and space, but also the velocity variable. And the form of the model is that it should satisfy this kind of It should satisfy this kind of kinetic transport equation, which is expressing that the particles in a system move according to returning mechanics under the influence of some force, which here is called heat. And so the force under consideration should be the electric field that's induced by the fact that the plasma contains charges. The plasma itself. And I mentioned that this is an electrostatic approximation. So we get this from the approximation. This is from the approximation of Maxwell's laws, which is the Poisson equation. But the exact form of the Poisson equation differs depending on whether we're thinking about electrons or ions. So in the earliest, best known kind of form of this system, you typically model the electrons in the system and you make some assumption about the behavior of the ions. And this is reasonable because of this big difference in the masses. So if you're on the electron time scale, and then F is your distance. And then F is your distribution of electrons, and your ions are comparatively very massive and slow moving. So it's common to assume that they are fixed in some given distribution, which here is taken to be uniform. And then here, this quantity rho is the spatial density obtained from the full density by integrating over all possible velocities, spatial distribution of your negative charge. The model I want to speak about today is taking the other perspective. Is taking the other perspective. So, if we want to model the ions in the plasma instead. And so, thinking about the Prosson equation, we play the same game. F now is the full density function of ions, and rho here, therefore, is the spatial density of ions. And what do the electrons do? So, we can't use the same logic as before, because compared to our ions, the electrons are very light and fast-moving, so they're certainly not stationary. Stationary. But what you can use is that because they are fast moving, one of the things this means is that the collision frequency between electrons is relatively high. And that means that it's relevant on the time scale of the electrons, whereas this model is collisionless. So, what's assumed is that the electrons take on their thermal equilibrium distribution, which is known from statistical mechanics, to follow a Maxwell-Woltson law, which is. Or Watson's law, which is proportional to an exponential of the potential. And so I either call this the Blazer-Plotten system for ions, or sometimes what's obscured by this thing, but the Blazer-Platon system with massless electrons. And that's because it formally arises in the limits of typically the mass ratio between ions and electrons to zero. Okay, so as I said, this first model is the more established version of the system, and this one. Of the system, and this one has been studied kind of comparatively more recently. And that can be traced to this different structure in the Poisson equation because the coupling of this system and this system is non-linear, not only in the fact that you have these two systems, but also because this equation itself is non-linear. Okay. So, one place you can do this is thinking about the well-positioned theory for these systems. So, for the electron model, this Electron model, this is kind of a major breakthrough in the study of this, can be traced to kind of the 90s, showing that the model is globally well posed in three dimensions in the sense of classical solutions. And so, yeah, there's a few, a couple of different approaches in these results. And also, there's many works since then refining exactly the kind of assumptions you can take on the initial data. If you compare what's known about the ion system, What's known about the ion system? You can see that the first kind of result on weak solutions occurs much later than that for the ions, so around the 90s. And there was a result in 1D of Hampton and Nickeli in 2017. But then the 3D question of global warposiness was something that was open when we came to this model. And so that was one of the first questions that we need to answer. So this is one of So, this is one of our works. We show that the model is globally well posed in 3D in the two kinds of boundaryless settings, solving the torus or in the whole space. And then there's also a recent result of Lubex's Bronz and Nikola for the case in 3D boundary domains. So the good news is that this model is well posed. We have a nice class of solutions to work with. And there's another interesting direction suggested by what I presented, which is when. What are presented, which is when this argument for the massless electrons limits and the Maxwell-Woltsman law is valid. And there's a couple of works that I cite here. In particular, there's a recent work by Julian Guo making progress in this interesting direction. Okay, the result I want to present today is on a different question on this model. And this is something that comes from And this is something that comes from a motivation in plasma physics. And the notion is something called quasi-neutrality. And it comes from a kind of fundamental property of a plasma, which is the device screening. The intuition is this. So if you disturb the charge in a plasma, for example, introducing a test charge, because you have mobile charges within the plasma, the plasma will react to neutralize this disturbance. And so that. And so that screen happens at a certain scale, and that scale is called the Debye length, which has a dependence on the physical parameters of the system. So here you have kind of the temperature, charge, and average density. And if you look at the ratio between this to by length and the observation scale, in real plasmas, this is typically a very short scale. Here I have a kind of table of representative values. You can see here that, for example, for the topomatic reaction. See here that, for example, for the tokamak reactor, you're talking about like a tenth of a millimeter. Um, so in kind of in physics textbooks, in astrophysics papers, um, you often see a comment that kind of this parameter epsilon, which is the ratio, is approximately equal to zero. And that assumption is quite commonly made. So it's an interesting question as a kind of mathematical problem to ask what happens if you look at taking the parameter absolutely zero and The parameter absolute zero, and this is called the quasi-neutron. So let's look at it in the context of the Plasma-Poisson system for ions. Basically, what I did before was ignore all of the physical units, but if I write this in the appropriate scaling, the parameter epsilon appears here in front of the La Pacians in the Poisson equation. So as I send epsilon to zero, this is a kind of singular type limit, blowing up this cross. Is a kind of singular type limit blowing up this crossing equation. But formally, you get an equation that looks like this. So u equal to rho here. And this is something called the kinetic isothermal Euler system, because it's the kind of kinetic formulation of certain isothermal Euler equations. And we can think of this as a kind of very singular Blazov equation. It has a similar form to what we had before, but now the potential here, well, so let's say the force here, the gradient of the potential. Here, the gradient potential has one fewer derivative than density. Whereas up here, because of the smoothing effect of the passion, you expect to gain a derivative. And we can also ask this question for the electron model, and you'll get a slightly different kinetic Euler model with a kind of sudden flavor. Okay, so proving this rigorously is a kind of problem that's been studied since the mid-90s. The mid-90s. Some of the early works considered the case of monokinetic solutions. So, if you look at a profile, there's a certain density where all the velocity distribution is centered at a particular flow field u. Then there's an equivalence between the kinetic Euler equation and the corresponding Euler equation for R and U. And in this case, so there's proof of the limit in the electron and ion case. Electron and ion case. You can see again that the ion case comes along quite a bit later than the electron one. And then a very important kind of general result is this result of Brignier showing that the limit holds if your initial data are uniformly analytic in the X variable. And so analytic regularity is quite a strong regularity condition. So of course there's an interest in trying to go beyond this regularity in some way. And there's essentially two And there's essentially two things that you can do. One of them is to introduce a certain structural condition on your data, which roughly corresponds to taking a velocity profile that kind of has a single maximum. And if you do this, there's a kind of early There's a kind of early result in 1D for electrons if your solar electrode is high enough. And then there's also a very nice result from 2016, kind of working under a generalization of condition for the ion model where you linearize the Poisson coupling. The other direction you can take is more along the lines of what I'm about to present, and that's that you can work in a kind of perturbative setting, and this allows very rough data indeed, so as rough as L infinity. Indeed, so as rough as L infinity. And this is a direction that started in the 1D setting in a paper of Burley for both the electron and ion models. And then in higher dimensions, the same team studied the electron case. And yeah, there's also been a recent improvement that I'll talk about in the next slide. And then the ion case in higher dimensions was a joint work of myself and Nikaida. From the Kaida, um, it's from 2019 for here as well. Okay, so let me say a couple of words on why it's difficult to go beyond analytic regularity. And the reason is because of certain counterexamples that have been shown. And they're related to an instability behavior of this model that's well known in plasma physics. So in some sense, it's inherent to the problem. And it's something variously known as known as two-stream or bump-on-tail instability. To two-stream or bump-on-tail instability. And it goes back to this question of what does the velocity profile look like? So, if you take any spatially homogeneous profile, that is a stationary solution of your model. But some of them are stable and some of them are unstable. And the kind of things that are typically unstable are things that have this kind of two-bump shape. And if you think about the experimental setup, this would be something like firing. Setup, this would be something like firing a jet of particles into a body of plasma. And this is known to be unstable. You develop these sort of water seas, you know, both space over time. And what it means for the quasi-neutral limit is that if you build solutions around these unstable profiles, you can build counterexamples. And they exist in any solar space, any NHS, for both the electron and minot models. Okay, so this will play a role also in the setting I'm about to present, which is the rough data regime. So the idea of this setup is to take data that are perturbations around some regular scheme. So for example, here you have a part that's analytic in X and a part that's L infinity. And because of the analyticity condition, you would have the quasi-neutral limit if you started from the regular data. And the aim is to find a smallness condition. is to find a smallness condition on this perturbation such that the limit also holds for this rough data f. And the smallness we're going to quantify in a Baselstrain distance. So here I formulated a problem as I want to find a function eta such that if the Wassellstone distance between the smooth and rough data is small enough in terms of epsilon, then the limit goes through. Let's look at the previous results. The first block here The first block here is kind of about expectation setting. So, this goes back to this problem of instability. So, the consequence of these counter examples that I presented is that no polynomial can possibly work for this problem, because those counter examples exist within a polynomial of the analytic case. Okay, so the first result, as I So, the first result, as I mentioned, was for the 1D case. And in this paper, what they find is that for the electron model, you do have the limit if you take something with a kind of single exponential form. So, you can kind of see this as optimal compared to the polynomial case, which is possible. They also looked at the ion case, and again, they found that you could show a result of this type, but this time with But this time with a double exponential form in eta because of some of the difficulties from this exponential nonlinearity. Then the other thing that complicates things is to erase the dimension. So in the first result for the electron model, they found a double exponential again, but this time to do with the difficulties of raising the dimension. And then there's a recent result with McTylus that improved this result to a single exponential. This result to a single exponential, which again kind of is almost sharp since the polynomial is possible. So, then in our previous results on the higher-dimensional ion model, you could find the difficulties of going to the exponential non-linearity and the raising dimension. And so, the result that we found was that we could prove the limit under a quadruple exponential small condition. So, it's pretty restrictive. So, the So, the result that I want to present today, however, is that we were able to improve substantially upon this previous result. And our new result allows us to take the single exponential form, which is almost sharp. So I will tell you. Okay, so here's the formal statement. I've essentially says what I said in words before. You take your uniformly analytic regular data. Uniformly analytic regular data and some mild Lammick condition, which is not restrictive, it's the well-posness conditions, and the single exponential envelope, and the limit works. I don't have a huge amount of time, so I'll tell you a couple of things about the proof as fast as I can. So, there are three exponentials to get rid of, and there's essentially one main idea related to each each exponential. The first one Comes from the improvement in the electron model, so I won't spend too much time on it. Let's say first that the idea is to perturb around the regular case, and so what you have to do is estimate the Vascon distance between two solutions of the Vasme-Blasman system. And so, I want, I will get, it's possible to prove an estimate like this with some function h, and then I will find eta such that this joint limit holds, and that will be an immissible eta. And that will be in the miscalculation. So the question is: what kind of H can we take here? And this is something that's known in Delta Prosum system theory, simply electron model. There's a very important result of Lerkev, which provides the kind of stability that we need. And you note that this is not a standard Bromwell form, which would be an exponential of something, something times D, but you have this other form, and this is what did. And this is what gives rise to these double exponential forms in the higher-dimensional case. So, okay. So, the first improvement is based on paper by Poppyloh from last year, and that's to obtain an improved Weisterstein estimate with this other function here, which looks a little bit complicated at first glance, perhaps. The application of this is that it lets you show the limit with a single exponential, which you can find. Single exponential, which you can kind of see if you treat this first term as a root of log z, and you can see that you need roughly an exponential of what you have here to get the limit. And this is done by modifying the quantity that you estimate to estimate the maximum distance. And this is something that we could adapt to the ion model as well. So by using this technique, we prove a new estimate in terms of the form of this function h. However, the constant that you get in here is different from the electron. Get in here is different from the electron model, and it has a double exponential dependence on the Debye length. And that so we get down to a triple exponential, we lose one, but we still have two to go. Okay, so this is a bit more about the change to ions from electrons, and it's about how we estimate the electric field. So, the game is to analyze the semi-linear equation for the potential. For the potential, but using quantities that are well propagated by the transport equation that it's coupled to. So I want estimates on ρ, which is tricky to estimate because the integral of the full density against the velocity. So what we did in previous results was to use a certain splitting of the field. We split it into a part that satisfies the equation you'd have for electrons and a part that satisfies a non-linear equation. That satisfies a non-linear equation, but with improved regularity in this coefficient, so perhaps something smoother. And we showed that that indeed is the case, and we could quantify it in terms of certain norm of rho, which is controlled uniformly in time by the energy. However, if you want to use this estimate for the quasi-neutral limit, you have to look at the dependence on epsilon, and it appears up here inside this double exponential. So this is where this dependence is coming from. So, what we did was to change the perspective, go back to treating the full equation for u, and you notice that you can bound the nonlinearity in L P in terms of L P norms of rho. And so you have something where you haven't gained any regularity or integrability, but the constant is independent of epsilon. So, in any argument where we only need estimates of this type on rho, we can get the same estimates on the ion equation as we would for the electron. Ion equation, as we would for the electron equation. So, this applies to some of the estimates in these proofs, but not all of them. One place where it does apply is to the stability estimate. And so, we were able to show the estimate I showed before with this constant, one over epsilon, which is the same as the electrons. However, you notice that this estimate here also depends on the L and finished norm of the density rho. And this is something that when you estimate it, And this is something that, when you estimate it, it isn't enough just to have LP norms. You need a finer analysis, which is different in the ion case. And so this only got us to a double exponential dependence. So the final thing that we used to do was to reanalyze this argument for density. This is based on the strategy from the well-posingness theory, so this breakthrough in the 90s, and it relies on looking. And it relies on looking at the characteristic trajectories of the system. So, the motion of a typical particle. And we want to estimate the growth of the velocity coordinate because we can extract the boundary density from that. And basically, the problem is to break the non-linearity. So, this will estimate your characteristic, and you need some good estimate on the electric field. And so, what you do is you use the fact that you have a linear equation, you can write it explicitly as a You can write it explicitly as a convolution against a kernel, and you split up that integral in a certain way, which I won't describe. But it has three parts, and the interesting one is this last term, which is where your relative velocity between two trajectories is relatively high. And this is what allows you to gain a bit and close the estimate using the second-order structure of this system. Because if you have two parts. Because if you have two particles that are close together but with high relative velocity, if you let the evolution evolve over a little interval of time, they're likely to move apart out of singularity. So in this term, you integrate in time first, you gain a little bit, and you can close this. But we used crucially the fact that we had a linear equation where we knew the kernel to convolve with, which is we completely lose in the non-linear case. And we also used that you were convolving with. Used that you were convolving with something that you could write in terms of the density f, and we know that it evolves along the characteristic flow. So we lose all of this when we go to the ion case, but we were able to close this before by using the splitting. So if we split into the singular and regular part, we could use all of the techniques from before on this explicit term. And on the remainder, we have these better estimates. However, again, if you However, again, if you're now looking to optimize the quasi-neutral limit, you have to look at the constants. And the constant appears inside the exponential. So that's where the last one was hiding. So what we did was to change the perspective on the PDE again and to treat the nonlinearity as an unknown. And you'll see that it satisfies this equation. Using this, we can prove a gain of interpretability where you do still lose something epsilon, but now it's polynomial. And you do this by an elliptic estimate and then optimizing carefully between how much you want to gain at the expense of a loss in epsilon. So you put this together and you get a certain estimate on increments. This is kind of similar to something done in the electron case, but we have to adapt it to include these additional terms and optimize the kind of estimate that we get with respect to epsilon. But we can do this, and that's how we take. And that's how we close it. So, yes, we proved a new posinutual limit in this rough data setting, and we substantially improved the class of data that we could allow from this quadruple exponential to a single exponential. So, that brings the theory into line with the electron model: in that all of the rates have this single exponential form. And this is kind of an almost optimal result. Stop from a result in the sense that since no polynomial is possible, yeah. So, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Do you have questions? Thank you, Barrett. I have some. I have some rather general questions regarding this type of equations. I noticed that you are working on tours, periodic solutions. Yes. Is there any practical reason for doing that? Because I'm also working on cinema. So what I didn't mention at all in this talk is that to write the system on whole space, you have to make some choices about how you set up the model. So the model that we studied involves a kind of confinement. Studied involves the kind of confinement at infinity of the electrons. I think it would be possible to work with that model as well. But you, yeah, there are some choices to be made. So another question, like, is it possible to consider here should pro because I know, especially for this type of equation, there's some difficulty. Because of neutral limits, I am not. I am not sure. So, there is the result for Glaucus in a son-bounded domain, so Mikhail and Ludovic. And I don't know what would happen in the quasi-neutral limits, but I think we could use similar techniques. So, now the Cosidental Link in particular should always be installed in. But in all ways I thought in our sense. Yeah, yeah, this double exponential condition in 1D. So is that yeah, I didn't talk about that. So 1D is special, so it doesn't go like in this. Basically, one of the ideas, I think the so the first thing I spoke about on the potential of thinking. Spoke about on the potential of thinking of the potential equation as all together rather than in split form. We're taking from two to one in our case. But in 1D, you have kind of a better stability estimate, so there's less to do. Any questions? Well, if not, Casey
