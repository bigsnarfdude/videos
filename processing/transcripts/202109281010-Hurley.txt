Well, thanks, by the way, for setting up this amazing conference. So far, I've learned a heck of a lot, even from Jay. Sometimes I still pick up tidbits and I talk to him a lot about his biology. So I am Jennifer Curley, and I'm kind of the cream and the Oreo cookie of the circadian sandwich that you guys are gonna get over the next couple days, whether or not you like the cream. Whether or not you like the cream, I like the cream best. So I like to think I'm the best of the bunch. But I'm really here to tell you about all the data that we have. And when Bill comes up to talk, he's going to talk about the modeling that he's doing. But I'm really interested in the next steps in circadian biology after what Jay has just talked about. So to remind you all what Jay just told you, the clock is a transformation. The clock is a transcription translation negative feedback loop, right? And so the basic mechanism is that we've got a positive arm in Rossper, this is the white collar complex, turns on transcription translation of the negative arm. Negative arm interacts with that positive arm again to turn it off. Negative arm goes through a very specific life cycle to time the clock, is degraded and removed from the system, and then the positive arm reactivates. And the long-term view or long-time view of the clock. Or a long-time view of the clock has really been that this positive arm binds to clock control gene promoters to turn on transcription and translation. And when that positive arm is active, it's on those clock control gene promoters. And when that negative arm is inactivating that positive arm, it's not on the clock control gene promoters. And so in this way, the basic idea of clock timing is really that the oscillation of the negative arm will lead directly to the oscillation of clock. To the oscillation of clock control genes. And you can see why, for a very long time, that a common convention in the clock has been that we can go in and transcriptionally sample all these transcripts, and we'll know what the clock is going to control. And that makes one big assumption. And coming from a protein biochemistry field, it was an assumption I didn't really like. And that assumption is that mRNA is going to accurately represent a protein counterpoint. Protein counterpoint. And it is a very hotly debated field: how protein correlates with mRNA. The study I'm showing you, of course, is on the side of there's a lot of discrepancies. So 2011, this nature paper was published by Schwanhauser, and they showed that there's a correlation between RNA and protein of about 0.4. There's lots of arguments to be made about how we're going to have some sampling issues with massback versus transcripts. Versus transcripts. But in general, the story there is that there's just not always a perfect correlation between what your mRNA and your protein is. Now, in parallel with this, even back when I was still a postdoc with Jay, there was lots of stuff coming out about how there's post-transcriptional regulation involved in circadian timing, whether it's chromatin remodeling, and some people are starting to work on that. Subcellular localization, which Jay is now starting to show so beautifully, degradation, which is really being nicely touched on. Degradation, which is really being nicely touched on in plants these days, there's all these different levels of post-transcriptional control that may be coming out of the clock. And so, towards the end of my postdoc, after I'd finished up one story and I had done the transcriptomics, I said to Jay, look, we really, we need to take this to the next level because we have to understand what's going on in the proteins. And fortunately, my post-doctoral advisor always said yes, which was great. So, we worked on Neurospara. So, we worked on Neurospira, which, as Jay has just told you, is an amazing model organism and is great not only for clocks because it's beautiful clock phenotypes, but it's also very straightforward and easy to work with. We can get large quantities of tissue, and so we can use all of that to get the level of data that we needed to do at the time, some pretty deep-scale proteomics. And so, you've heard all this part before, so that's why I'm going a little faster through it. But what we did. Through it. But what we did was to take norospora and grow it up in individual petri dishes. And then we cut plugs using a cork borer so that you can take from that same hyphal mat individual plugs of neurospora and move them into individual flasks. And you can grow these flasks up in the light for 24 hours, which is what we did. And then we slowly moved the flasks one every two hours for 48 hours. And we did it in triplicate. And then we sampled. Triplicate, and then we sampled so that everything was age-matched, so that we really knew we had a strong cohort of neurospora that is under the influence of the clock, is synchronized in the clock, and that we can get lots of interesting information from. And then, as Jay talked about earlier, we sent the first half of this data off to the Joint Genome Institute after doing QPCR to demonstrate that FREEC was oscillating quantitatively over circadian time over the 48 hours. And then once that was done and actually published, we gathered our proteomics data the same way, showed that it was quantitatively and qualitatively changing at the level of frequency over the circadian day, and partnered with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories with the Department of Energy to do the full mass spectrometry on this data. And so, for anyone who's interested in how we did things, I'm sure that you. Things. I'm sure that you guys are all familiar with paired N sequencing. So the transcriptome was done with RNA-depleted paired N poly-A RNA sequencing. So I won't go into detail about that because I'm sure you understand. For proteomics, we use at the time a relatively new technique, though it's probably more popular now. But if anyone's not heard of it, it's called TANNA MASTAG MAST SPECTROSCOPY. And in this case, you take an individual sample and you degrade that sample in its Grade that sample in its own tube, and then you bind to each set of peptides that result from that degradation an individual and unique isobaric mass tag for a particular sample. You can then take all of your samples and combine them into one sample and fire them on mass spec. And on that second round of mass spec, that tana mass tag is degraded so that there's a slight mass difference on each individual peptide. So you can tell just how much relative to all the other peptides. Relative to all the other peptides in a particular sample of your peptide interest is in there. Now, when we got the data back in hand, we realized that we had bitten off a little more than we really could chew. And so we had to do some analytics to get to the bottom of this. And so one of the work was done in terms of normalization that was done by Jay's graduate student at the time. It's a paper called Limber. I won't go into the details on that because that was all done in Jay. Because that was all done in Jay's lab. But my lab realized that we had a bit of an analytics problem in that we had to identify oscillations over the course of tens of thousands of genes. Now, this had been initially done. John Hoganish and the late McHughes published a paper way back in maybe 2016 or 2017 called JTK Cycle, maybe that was 2014. And they worked really hard to identify harmonic expressions in data. And that was great. But the problem with what we were doing. But the problem with what we were doing is we have basically an in vitro system. We don't have a living functioning organism. We do, but we have one that's not continually being refreshed and growing. It has reached kind of the end of its growth phase. And so what we anticipated we would see and what we had started to see a lot of in the transcriptomics was damped expressions or expressions that were decreasing in amplitude over time. And JTK was not very good at modeling these damped expressions. And so I reached out to Kristen Bennett. And so I reached out to Kristen Bennett, who's a faculty here at RPI, and she and a graduate student and I worked together to use the mass spring equation and extend that to include the possibility to recognize dampening in these particular oscillations. And when we applied this to our data, we had done a relatively good job. And when we look at the types of oscillations that we saw, we, of course, were able to That we saw. We, of course, were able to pick up harmonic expressions, which is what we expected, but we saw mostly damped expressions, which made sense because neurospora is really starting to slow its growth in these limited chambers that we're growing them in. And so we see a decrease overall in amplitude of oscillation. We were a bit more surprised because we thought this was mostly going to be something that was artifactual, but we actually picked up forced expressions. So these are increasing amplitude changes over time. Changes over time. And when we did that, we started to wonder if perhaps not only are these oscillations that we're finding just part of the data, but is there anything biologically relevant? And this is a bit unrelated to the modeling that we're doing right now, but a separate part of my lab is really interested in the biological basis of all of this. And so when we started to pick through these damped oscillations, we found a great example called PRE-1, which represses glucose usage as cells start to starve. As cells start to starve. In our data set, that's exactly what was happening. The neurospora, as it was growing, is starting to deplete many different types of nutrients. And so this Cree-1 was actually turned on. And in our data set, we found, not surprisingly, that the mRNA of CRI-1 was increasing in amplitude. So we're making more Cree-1. The downstream genes that Cree-1 regulates, like GBN, GNN, and GDN, which are down-regulated when CRE-1 is expressed. Regulated when Cree1 is expressed, they actually were the reverse. They had decreasing amplitude, and GPN, which is upregulated by CRI-1, was increased. And so we think that from this kind of information, instead of just being able to recognize rhythms better, which is great, and we have definitely done a better job in that, but we might be finding some underlying patterns of biological regulation, particularly environmental feed forward mechanisms into the clock, ways that the clock can perhaps time itself. Perhaps time itself in response to its own environment. But that's a story for another day. So we took this information, we actually made a program that's in collaboration with our data center here on campus, and we used the Extended Harmonic Circadian Oscillator application, or ECHO for short, to determine just what was oscillating in our data sets. And so what ECHO does is it gives you a p-value, a probability, that this oscillation. probability that this oscillation is valid and not through random noise. And we took these p-values for both the mRNA and the protein, and we went ahead and we lined them up together. And instead of using Venn diagrams, because they can distort a little bit the overlap, what we did was actually plot the p-values together. And what you can see right off the bat is down here in the lower left-hand corner that you've got a whole host of mRNAs and proteins with very low mRNAs and proteins with very low p-values that correlate together nicely. And you can see that there's in the white space quite a lot of mRNA and protein that both have p-values above 0.05. So we have some correlations that work really well. But what we found was that here in our orange bar, these are lots of mRNAs with very low p-values without coordinated oscillating proteins. So these would be mRNAs that we assume reached That we assume reached oscillatory function at the protein level, but didn't. Not a huge surprise, I guess. You can hand-wave this away in some ways because RNA half-lives are much shorter than protein half-lives. And so you can see how a protein could probably swallow up an oscillatory input. But what we couldn't rationalize away was the fact that there are a striking amount of rhythmic proteins with arrhythmic mRNAs. And so, mRNAs. And so how this all happens was a bit of a surprise to that this happened in the first place was what we predicted, but we didn't actually, to be honest, I didn't think it would be as extensive as it was. We found that 40% of proteins didn't have oscillating mRNAs. And so that was a pretty big number. And of course, we immediately wanted to know where this comes from. So our first guess was to look at degradation of a protein. Oh, I'm sorry. Of a protein. Oh, I'm sorry. Before we get there, we validated this. We actually went through and we looked at some of these oscillatory, non-oscillatory mRNAs and compared them to our oscillatory protein. And we went ahead and took these predicted oscillatory proteins and refused them to luciferase so that we could track them in neurospora itself. And when we compared that, we saw very beautiful oscillations of some of these post-transcriptionally regulated proteins. And we could even extend that. And we could even extend that out to show that the oscillation of this protein xylase reductase led directly to the oscillation inactivity of xylulose reductase activity. And we looked in the pathways for these and saw that these pathways were coordinated. There was a whole bunch of oscillations going on at the post-transcriptional level. So now we knew that this was a valid thing and we really wanted to start trying to figure out where this was coming from. Can I ask really? Can I ask really? Yeah, please do. Just trying to catch up with the terminology. So, when you're tracking a protein, if it's undergone a post-transcriptional modification, is that a different protein or is that the same protein? Do you understand what I'm saying? Yep. So, in our proteomic study, we didn't get at any post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications. I'll talk about, we've started to move in that direction when we have some data on that, but we did not isolate. But we did not isolate out any phosphorylation events. They would have all been in the same gamesh as the proteins that we're looking at. So, do we think those have a role? Absolutely. But we just haven't gone too far down that rabbit hole yet. Basically, the total abundance of proteins oscillating. Yep, yep, correct. So is there a so you are suggesting that the metabolism is kind of enriched for these types? uh for these uh these types of regulate regulated regulated genes yeah so i will show you a slide on that in just a couple slides anything else no no thanks all right so um so we wanted to get after the the source of all this regulation um this uh paper had come out from luck in 2014 just after we published our transcriptome paper and they had used a very limited proteomics data set they found maybe 50 or 60 Data set, they found maybe 50 or 60 rhythmic proteins out of the 300 they were able to detect, and we found on the order of about 2,000 rhythmic proteins. So we had big differences in numbers. But they had predicted, based on oscillations at the mRNA level of E3 ubiquitin lidases, that degradation might be responsible for this post-transcriptional proteomic effect. So we assumed that if they were correct, it would hold true in our data set. So we started off by looking. So we started off by looking at our transcriptome and we looked to see if there was a major peak in Ethiubicon ligases. We did not find anything of that nature. We then went into our proteome which had much fewer Ethiubiconoligases detected. And we did find perhaps a weak rhythm. And for the LUC hypothesis to hold true, there would have to be an anti-phase relationship between the peak of E3B ubiquin and ligases and the peak of proteins that oscillate. Proteins that oscillate at a certain period of day. And what we found was actually that peak, that weak peak that we saw, was right at the same time when we saw most proteins peaking in their oscillation. So that led us to think that perhaps the connection between E3 ubicrinalidases and this post-transcriptional regulation was not the solid footing that we had kind of assumed it would be. And so we then looked at the flip side because Deb Bell Peterson at Texas AM had. Texas AM had showed a beautiful story at a meeting right before we were set to present this that the phosphorylation of RIC2 regulated the phosphorylation of EEF2, elongation factor II, and that when elongation factor II was phosphorylated by RIC2, it inhibited translation, and when it was not, it accelerated translation. And she was able to show that when she made this mutation in RIC2, that she could Mutation in RIC2 that she could actually change an oscillating protein to a non-oscillating protein. And so we hypothesized from our data that the time of day at which RIC2 and EEF2 are phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated, we should see the fastest transition from RNA to protein. And in fact, that's exactly what we saw. We then looked to see if we saw the least phase delay between Phase delay between RNA and protein for our rhythmic correlated proteins. And that's exactly what we saw. It lined up nicely with the time of day when EEF2 is most active. And then last but not least, we asked for our post-transcriptionally regulated proteins. Does the peak time of proteins reaching their zenith in the clock line up with that particular time of day when EEF2 is most active? And in fact, that's exactly what we saw. Exactly what we saw. And so, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, quick question. So, basically, you were saying that the trains run faster, i.e., the ribosomes run faster at some point. So, I don't know what the PP, the protein is doing. Is it because there is more kind of, is it the, yeah, what part of the catalytic, you know, this thing is moving along? Is there more pieces where, you know, the assembly is faster? The assembly is faster because there's more supply of these species, or what's the cause of this? If I remember correctly, the phosphorylation of EEF2 by the phosphorylated RIC2, that phosphorylation slows down the assembly of the elongation complex. Okay. All right. So that left us with the same question that you have already asked. That you have already asked. We realize that there's a lot of interesting post-transcriptional regulation going on, but there's more to stories than just total protein level. And here we're already starting to see how post-transcriptional, oscillating post-transcriptional marks can actually affect output. So the next step in the whole process was to go back and to reanalyze our data. This time, what we did was to isolate. What we did was to isolate phosphorylated peptides using IMAC enrichment. And so, this is just a titanium column that allows us to enrich the phosphorylated fraction away from the non-phosphorylated fraction. And then we fly both of those fractions on the mass spec and we start to ask the questions: what is oscillating in a phosphorylated manner, not just in a total protein manner? And so, we have both the background proteins and phosphorylation. Phosphorylation. We are just starting to analyze that data to understand what is regulated. But what was really exciting for us is that we found not only that about a third of the phosphor proteins are under regulation of the circadian clock, but for the first time in all of the analysis that we've done, were we able to recognize frequency, which is our core circadian protein and is extremely low copy number. But we were not only able to detect it, but we could detect an oscillation in phosphorylation, which is no In phosphorylation, which is known. In fact, Jay's lab before I even got there published a really nice paper, as well as Eliu from a different lab, to show that this phosphorylation is rhythmic and oscillatory. So we have a great set of data now, we think, that we can start asking those questions of how much of this is post-transcriptional versus transcriptional. And how much of this post-transcriptional is perhaps post-translational modifications that are occurring. Modifications that are occurring. So, with all this data in hand, we asked the question that was already asked of me: how much and what is being regulated at the post-transcriptional level? And so what we did was to compare our ontologies from our total proteome versus our circadian proteome. And there's lots of overlaps, but there was one really big thing that stuck out in terms of ontologies, and that was And that was in the rhythmic ontologies, metabolism was heavily enriched and it was not enriched in our total proteome, which is really exciting, but not, I guess, an overwhelming surprise. For a long time, we have hypothesized that, as Bill will tell you, that the clock should be here to help us with our metabolic output so that we can regulate metabolic output with our circadian day. But we were surprised to see just how much was controlled. To see just how much was controlled post-transcriptionally. So, for an example, we mapped all of these post-transcriptionally oscillating proteins to a really important phase in metabolism, and that is the Schoenberg glucose 6-phosphate between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. And what you see here is a map where all the proteins that are oscillating post-transcriptionally are highlighted in either gray or orange. And I'm going to flip to the next slide because we made a movie. Flip to the next slide because we made a movie of this. And as you can see, the glycolysis pathway is peaking at one time of day in orange. And then the next time of day, the pentosphosphate pathway comes up. And so there is not, it's not just random host transcriptional regulation that we're seeing. It seems to be very directed and coordinated so that glycolysis happens at one time of day and pentose phosphate pathway occurs at another time of day. And with all of this, of course, we then start to predict, well, Of course, we then start to predict: well, we should see oscillations in global metabolites if we're seeing such strong regulation in this particular pathway. So we went ahead back to the drawing board again, regathered a whole bunch of samples, and this time, instead of just looking at proteins or transcripts, we moved on to metabolites, analyzing our metabolites by gas chromatography. And then we plugged this into our rhythm detection software and we showed that. Software, and we showed that about 18% of the metabolites that we're able to detect appeared to oscillate with the circadian rhythm. We have very strict thresholds for this, by the way. What we call detected, we have to see in more than 70% of every single one of the 72 samples that we have for each particular metabolite. So these are ones that we are highly confident are present and oscillating based on what we see. There are some other ones that we don't see with as much depth. ones that we don't see with as much depth. So there's probably more to the story that I just cut off because of our strict thresholds. But even only looking at those 45 rhythmic metabolites, when we go ahead and we map them back onto that map I showed you earlier, the dusk phase of the clock here, you can see that we predict glycolysis should be high and pentose phosphate pathway should be low. So you pull out metabolites involved in this pathway and fructose 6-phosphate. Fructose 6-phosphate peaks right at the time of day that we would expect it, whereas antiphase to that ribulose 5-phosphate, which goes through the pentose phosphate pathway, is peaking antiphase to fructose 6-phosphate. So what we predicted in our low-throughput analysis is actually borne out by our metabolic analysis. We predicted pathway somehow. the pentose uh pathway somehow analogous to i don't know much about of the um fermentation is it is you need oxygen for that or i mean so glycolysis needs oxygen right but the other one uh is not or is it what's the difference between the two pathways so uh the anaerobic uh nature of pentose phosphate pathway uh is is predicted to be important but neurospa doesn't ever really grow anaerobically and so how that relates And so, how that relates to neurospira, Jay, you can correct me if I'm wrong because you're much more of a neurospira person than I am. But it wouldn't be an anaerobic pathway in neurospira because neurospora is an obligate aerobe. But there are times of day when it would want to use that particular pathway. So, I think one of the key things here, too, is that the pentose phosphate pathway is what it's the main pathway for generating high NH. Generating high NADPH levels. And glycolysis doesn't do that. Glycolysis doesn't necessarily depend on an oxygenic environment. Respiration does, and that is what helps drive the TCA cycle in a clockwise manner. Yeah, I was just trying to think if there's some kind of a specific evolutionary reason why you would like to do one. Why you would like to do one pathway out of day and the other one and the other one. So, okay. Yeah, I think there definitely is. And I think Jay hinted at it earlier when he said that, you know, neurospira can grow without the clock, but it grows more efficiently with the clock. From my perspective, it's all about making the cell energetically more efficient. And I'll talk about in when I get to the mammalian side, a direct usage of that. Um, a direct usage of that. Yeah, I think glycolysis is making it feeding into the TCA cycle and it's making intermediates for intermediary metabolism. Penose phosphate is, as Bill said, involved in NAD metabolism. So it's energizing the use of those intermediates. So depending on whether you're prepping to grow where you're growing, that sort of feeds into the rhythms we saw in protein biosynthesis versus metabolism. Okay, thank you. And so, to add one last level of complexity to all of this, we also went ahead and we looked at lipids in the clock because we can extract lipids at the same time we extract metabolites. And this is what we know the least about at this point, but we are starting to understand that about 10% of lipids fall under circadian control, and these sphingolipids, glycerol lipids, and Glycerol lipids and glycerol phospholipids. But how this relates to clot control, we don't truly understand yet, and we're just starting to dig into it. What we do take away from all of this is that we can identify oscillations, and we knew that activation and transcription were important in regulation. But our data starts to demonstrate that perhaps translation is really important for the regulation of clock output, which is heavily. Clock output, which is heavily involved in metabolism. And we have to continue to track these higher-level orders of data to understand how this regulation is occurring. And so that's the point where I had started to transition out of Jay's lab and start my own lab. And as we're gathering all this data, I thought, well, this is really exciting. We've not really seen this before. How well does this extend to other organisms? Or is this a fungal? To other organisms, or is this a fungal-specific property? And so the next part of the talk really relates to the mammalian clock. And just as a reminder, Jay also hopefully showed this ahead of time, but the mammalian clock is very similar to the TTFL in Neurospira, which is why we love using Neurospira. BMAL and clock are the same as white collar one and white collar two. They turn on the purrs and cries, which is like frequency. And purrs and cries bind to CK1, come back in, turn off BMO and clock. Back in, turn off, BMO, and clock are degraded and removed from the system, and the system can start over again. We knew that neurospira was a great model because neurospora can grow in a very controlled and organized environment. When you start moving into mammalian cells, you start talking about very complex tissues that are very variable, and we couldn't isolate anything very nicely. Yes, go ahead. Um, so sorry to interrupt, but go ahead. I think, Jay, you said that there. Jay, you said that the clock arose three times independently. Is that yeah? So, are we talking about independent clocks here, or that shows you how little I understand about that? No, that's it's a fantastic question. Um, and it's one that's pretty hotly debated in the field. Um, so when Jay talked about the three independent evolutions, he was talking about cyanobacterial clock, plant clock, and then the fungal and animal lineage. So, the fungal and animal clock. So, the fungal and animal clocks are really tough to distinguish if they arose together, but I would think that the more that we look at these clocks, the more we think the answer is yes. Because in a completely unrelated story to this story that I'm presenting you today, the proteins involved in the clock are called intrinsically disordered proteins or IDPs. These are proteins that exist in a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations. And because they are very flux. Because they are very flexible and constantly changing, they don't need to have exact sequence conservation. And so the conservation that you might look for between the purrs and the cries and frequency doesn't seem to exist. But if you look at the type of protein that they are, they very much are similar. And we're going to publish a paper on that actually. We're sending it out this week. The relationship and the overall electrostatics of these proteins is highly conserved. And so we think that while evolution might not And so we think that while evolution might not have strictly conserved sequence in these, it conserved this overall IDP structure. And so that they are really from that same lineage. They're the same things. They just had lots of opportunity to change a little bit as they got into different organisms. Cool. Okay, thanks. All right. So as I was saying, the big problem with this is that neurosperser is great. You can really control everything. You can really control everything. You get to the big organism, and you got a problem because they're very complex. And the more complexity you have, the more you can assume that you're going to see discrepancies between transcript and protein because you have all these different cells and all these different tissue types. And so what we decided to look at was actually a mammalian macrophage. And macrophages, for those who are not familiar, are the key regulators of inflammation in the immune system. They phagsetize the bad guys that get into your bloodstream. They initiate and resolve inflammation. Initiate and resolve inflammation. They train other cells around them to be prepared for incoming insults. They are part of tumors. They're important for plaque formation. And fortunately for us, they have really beautiful circadian rhythms and behaviors. But specifically for this analysis, a macrophage is a standalone cell, right? It doesn't need to exist in a different set of tissue types. And so when you're looking at one macrophage, you're looking at the whole bench. You're looking at the whole bag, Sheboygan, right? So we needed something that we could isolate in large enough numbers, but it would be an individual cell so that we could make the kind of comparisons that we wanted to do. And so we decided we were going to use mammalia macrophages. And to make things, to be able to get this kind of data, we used a strain of mouse, which was developed by Joe Takashi's lab, a PER2 luciferase mouse. That gave us the ability. That gave us the ability to pull macrophages or to pull monocytes from the bone marrow and differentiate them into macrophages and then enact a serum and shock and star protocol so that we could validate that outside in our very strict and controlled environment, we had perfect oscillations in synchrony of period two before we extracted our transcripts and our proteins and then sent them through our analysis protocol to understand. Analysis protocol to understand exactly what the clock is regulating. And to do this, we use the same approach for the proteomics, TANA mass tag, mass spectrometry. But this time, instead of doing our ribosome-depleted mRNA sequencing, we used ribosome-depleted total RNA sequencing so that we could get more than just the individual polyadenylated transcripts, but also the short mRNAs that are and the long non-coding RNAs that are floating around the cell. So to just To just give an idea of whether or not this worked, it fortunately worked beautifully. We were able to look at all the clock transcripts in the mammalian cells and a whole bunch of clock proteins in the mammalian cells. And we saw oscillations just as we would have predicted we should have seen them based on our PER2 luciferase oscillations. And when we use ECHO to analyze this data, we find beautiful oscillations in the transcripts and the protein levels. We found about 6,000 transcripts, and that's total transcripts. Transcripts, and that's total transcripts, that's not just polyadenylated transcripts, and about 2,000 proteins. And of course, the big question is: how do they compare? So, we had to take those total transcripts and subset them only to look at the mRNA transcripts and then ask how they compared with the proteins. And much to our surprise, instead of more overlap, we found much less overlap. In fact, we only found that 20% of oscillating proteins had mRNAs that were oscillating. mRNAs that were oscillating with a circadian period. And that was a big surprise because we would have expected the opposite. And so that made us wonder exactly where this was coming from. If we would have predicted based on fungi, of course, that we should see translational regulation. So we started there and we looked through our data set. And one of the first things that came up over and over again was an oscillation in tRNAs. And so when we looked at our oscillation, And so, when we looked at our oscillation in tRNAs, the global oscillation of them, they peaked right here at about 20 to 21 hours. And that peak lined up with a peak of proteins that reached their zenith right here, about 22 to 23 hours. And so we thought that perhaps we expect translation again to be important. We actually went back to a phase lag between RNA to protein creation, and we found that when we see And we found that when we see lots of tRNAs, we see a very short lag between RNA to protein. And when we have less tRNA levels, we see a very long lag between RNA to protein. And so that told us that perhaps transcription is playing a role. But since we saw so much more regulation, we went ahead and we looked at degradation again. And here we saw lots of oscillations in ubiquitin ligase components, many more than we saw in neurospora. And when we Neurospira. And when we looked at the peak of these E3 ubiquitin ligase components, it was right at the same time, basically, as our tRNAs, which was antiphase, to our second peak in proteins reaching their zenith over the circadian day. And so we thought perhaps degradation plays a role. But we had even more data that we could gather. And so we dug through some of our short RNAs. And in doing so, we found that SN RNAs were highly enriched in the circadian portion of the macrophage transcriptome. And these are RNAs that. Transcriptome, and these are RNAs that are involved in splicing. And that drove us to look at the major spliceosome components. And we have found that the major spliceosome components are all under the regulation of the circadian clock, particularly it looks like the clock protein directly. And so one of the things that we're looking at now is just how well splicing is regulated by the circadian clock, because we think there's a large component there as well. And so we're still trying to understand how all this regulation works, but we wanted to see. This regulation works, but we wanted to see what this regulation was controlling. And much to our surprise, because we saw so much difference in post-transcriptional regulation between Neurospora and our mammalian macrophages, when we looked at what was being controlled, there was a high similarity. So here, we're looking at the TCA cycle. Over here on your left is the post-transcriptionally regulated proteins in macrophages in the TCA cycle. And down here on your right is something, the movie I showed you earlier, the post-transcription. The movie I showed you earlier, the post-transcriptionally regulated proteins in neurospira. And you can see many of the same steps in the pathway are post-transcriptionally regulated both in macrophages and neurospira, which is just absolutely beautiful to show how much neurospora can actually represent if we model it, our higher level eukaryotic output. Now, the question was asked of what is the purpose of this regulation, particularly the SWIFT. Particularly the switch between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Well, so that actually is a really important role in the immune response. And so being able to switch from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway is something that the cell uses in order to regulate immunity. And so we reached out to a friend of ours, Annie Curtis, at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. And she said that what you can actually do is you can take these. You can actually do is you can take these macrophages, we can put them in something called Seahorse, and you can see changes in basal respiration and ATP-linked OCR to see if what we're predicting would happen would actually happen in a living cell. And she thankfully did that for us and showed us that there were beautiful oscillations that correlated really nicely with what we were seeing in the metabolome. She even took it a step farther, and I'm trying to glaze over a lot of this because there's a lot of cells. Glaze over a lot of this because there's a lot of cell biology involved. But what we know about OCR and vasal respiration in macrophages is actually driven by the fission and fusion of mitochondria. And she went ahead and showed that that fission and fusion of mitochondria oscillated with a circadian time and actually lined up beautifully with our changes in basal respiration. And then, of course, because all this is going on, you are starting to see, you can predict what the behavior. You can predict what the behavior of the cell would be. So, we predicted that these changes in metabolism would lead directly to changes in the behavior of the macrophages in the immune response. And so, we showed that the phagocytosis of these immune cells is circadian regulated, and we could knock down that circadian regulation by adding an inhibitor of basal respiration. And so, with all this, we started just on a very high level without any modeling, just looking at. Just looking at our data to really understand how you can take the basal clock function, add in that post-transcriptional regulation that we know is occurring, link it up to metabolic output and behavior of mitochondria to see how this metabolic output might actually drive that immune response signaling that we see going on. So I know I'm at 40 minutes. At 40 minutes, and I'm not sure I have enough time for my last bit of the story. So, should we go to questions or do you want me to keep going? It can easily be wrapped up here. I would go for it. I mean, how many five minutes or? Yeah, probably five or six minutes left. Sure. Okay. All right. So then with that data in hand, we really wanted to start linking this to a disease phenotype. We've now basically, I call it my canon of data, right? We have a big canon and we start. Right, we have a big cannon and we start want to start firing it at problems, and so one of the problems, or one of the things that came up was with all of this, these dichotomous states of metabolic oscillation, that the generation, just like we predicted in neurospira of NAD and NADPH, also looked like it was tightly timed by the circadian clock. And so that means that many immunological responses are going to be regulated in terms of controlling biology. Of controlling biology. And so we have collaborators here at RPI that are very interested in Alzheimer's and the immune responses function in Alzheimer's disease. And this is important because we know the clock has a role in regulating Alzheimer's disease. In a healthy neuronal cell, there are healthy microglia, which are the macrophages of the brain and healthy astrocytes. And when these healthy clocks are running, the clock control genes time all kinds of rhythmic expression. All kinds of rhythmic expression to synchronize these clocks together, and you get this overall sustained homeostasis. And when this works well, you have a healthy brain. When it starts to fall apart because of the presence of aggregates, the clocks in these individual neurons start to break down, as well as the activation of microglia starts to break down the clock, which actually Jay showed very nicely in macrophages that when you activate macrophages, the clock stops to work very well. Very well. And this happens in astrocytes too. This can actually feed into breaking the clock itself, which leads to a disruption of clock control genes, arrhythmic gene expression, and a loss of homeostasis, which feeds forward. And so this is a very strong feed forward loop in the regulation of Alzheimer's disease between the clock and AD. We also knew that with this, one of the things that we see when we start to break down this feed forward, we start to accelerate the feed forward loop by breaking down the clock in the brain. Forward loop by breaking down the clock in the brain is that the oscillation of amyloid beta, which is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease, goes from a beautiful and healthy rhythm to an ablated rhythm as you age and a near flat amplitude rhythm when you have Alzheimer's disease and you have aging. And so we wondered if the breaking of the clock or the affecting of the clock could have a role in this oscillation of amyloid beta. And we thought. And we thought that this might be involved with microglia and macrophages because we know that chronic inflammation can affect macrophages and microglia, and that can affect the degradation of A-beta. And there's lots of examples of A-beta actually stimulating macrophages and breaking their clocks. And so we asked ourselves: could oscillations of A beta be imparted by this degradation from a healthy By this degradation from a healthy macrophage. And so, what we did to determine this was we took our protocol for isolating macrophages and we asked, do we phagositize A beta with the circadian rhythm, just like we phagositize that general Zymosin particle that I showed you before? And unsurprisingly, because I'm telling you the story, that's exactly what we found. We found a beautiful oscillation in the phagocytosis of A beta. And the difference between this oscillation And the difference between this oscillation of A beta phagocytosis and the oscillation of just a typical zymosin particle is that there's a very distinct peak of phagocytosis of A-beta, which is limited to a couple hours, whereas phagocytosis mostly occurs broadly over the circadian day and is only shut down in a small window. And so we wondered if we could find in our omics data set some understanding of where this might be coming from. And it actually cropped. And it actually cropped up that heparin sulfates were hepron sulfate was important or was heavily controlled by the circadian clock, or at least predicted to be heavily controlled by the circadian clock in our data set. So we went back and looked in vivo to look at whether or not we can see global oscillations in peprin sulfate. And we did see that over circadian time, looking at these maps. Over circadian time, looking at these macrophages, we see oscillations in heparin sulfate. And this was important because heparin sulfate is an important factor in the uptake and regulation of a beta. So if you look in this particular mouse line, if you knock out ETX1, which is an important enzyme in creating hepan sulfate, you actually see a significant decrease in A-beta in the brain. So we went, took all So we went, took all this data, assuming that heparin sulfate we now know is oscillating, and asked if we ablate haprin sulfate oscillations using a heparinase enzyme, can we break this oscillation, circadian oscillation in A-beta uptake? And that is exactly what we saw. When you remove heparin sulfate from the cell surface, you see an ablation in the oscillation of a beta, and that is antiphase to. Antiphase to the peak of heprin sulfate. And so now we can take our model even further with those pro-inflammatory and the anti-inflammatory states. And we can now add on top of that that when you see peaks in levels of heparin sulfate here on the cell surface, it binds and aggregates up this A-beta and prevents it from coming in, where at other times of day, A-beta is easily able to be phagositos into the cell. And so we can continue to fire this cannon of day. Continue to fire this cannon of data to understand how cell regulation could actually affect disease output. So it's a lot of data, a lot of people involved. Obviously, Jay Dunlop, who I believe has signed off now, but he was there since the beginning of the Neurospero project. And we signed Bill on about two years into it to help us to model. And he's going to talk about modeling, I think, tomorrow. We also work with Annie Curtis to understand. Work with Annie Curtis to understand the regulation of mammalian macrophages. And then I have a lab full of amazing students, but particularly Charlene Buell, Rachin Clark, and Megan Jankowski, who are highlighted with red circles, who did the majority of this data analytics. So any questions? Thank you.
