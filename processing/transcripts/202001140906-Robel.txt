Organizing such a fantastic workshop. So, today I'm going to be talking about a little bit of work that we've done sort of in a series of two papers over the last two years with great CASPA collaborators Gerard Row at UW, Helen, who's here, and Mariana, who's here as well. And so, I'm going to be talking a little bit about some of the work that we've done, and then sort of talking about prospects for the future and sort of how we think about the question of noisy climate forcing and how we make predictions in the presence of noisy climate forcing. So, right, so I don't really think I need to belabor this point. Climate forcing of ice sheets is noisy, right? So, whether it's surface mass balance or ocean melting of ice shelves or ocean melting at the terminus, you know, the ocean and the atmosphere, these are turbines. You know, the ocean and the atmosphere, these are turbulent fluids, and this produces what is effectively a sort of stochastic forcing on ice sheets. And the properties of that stochastic forcing are, of course, of interest, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in this talk. But the point here is that we want to make a prediction of the future, right? We call it projections, but essentially we want to make a prediction about the future, about what ice sheets will do in the future, and this is made complicated, or this. Complicated, or this is complicated by the fact that we cannot exactly predict the trajectory of future climate forcing, right? There's all kinds of internal variability within the climate system, and we are never going to be able to predict that exactly. And so this introduces some what's called irreducible uncertainty, right? Some irreducible amount of spread in our projections. And so the goal of this work, of what I'm going to take you through here today, the argument that I'm going to take you through. The argument that I'm going to take you through is to try to understand how this variability is filtered by ice sheet dynamics and how the spread in possible ice sheet state changes as you go through sort of the bifurcation of the marine ice sheet and stability. So the central question here is really how much uncertainty spread does climate variability drive in marine ice sheet projections? And so to start with, I'm going to start with a very simple So, to start with, I'm going to start with a very simple framework. Any of you who've seen me give a talk in the last few years have probably seen this. Very simple schematic, right? We're going to think of this very simplified, sort of zero-dimensional view of marine ice sheet dynamics as a balance of fluxes between snow accumulation, or you can call it surface mass balance, at the surface, which is adding mass to the ice sheet, and then grounding line flux, which is taking. Which is taking mass out of the ice sheet, and then we'll also think about some ocean melting at the grounding line in addition to that. So in this very simplified framework, we can write down a simple one-equation dynamical model for the grounding line migration. So this has a few different components here, which we'll just introduce very quickly. So we have the grounding line position L. So we have the grinding line position L, we have the grinding line ice thickness Hg, which is simply just a diagnostic function of the bed topography, which we give in sort of these simplified cases that I'm going to show. So the bed topography here is function V. And then we have the flux duty accumulation or surface mass balance in. That's P is the accumulation rate. And then the grinding line flux out here, which I've just written. Which I've just written down as a power law function of the grounding line, its thickness. And of course, the question about what beta is here, what the sort of exponent is in this flux formulation depends a lot on what you assume about the grinding line. Of course, this model is not always at steady state, and so there's sort of an assumption that we have to stretch in order to, you know, make this model. You know, make this model seem reasonable. But the point is, the only real assumption that goes into this here is that there is some sort of effective power law relationship between grounding line flux and the piece thickness of the grounding line, which I think is not too much of a stretch from both a theory and what more complicated transient models tell us about grinding line flux. That run with me. I haven't made anyone angry yet. Yes. Yeah. Yes. L is just the distance from some far upstream you can. That's right, yeah. You could say it's from the ice divide. That's typically what we do. But yeah, you can define some catchment or something like that. Okay. Okay. So sort of the traditional story about this sort of system is that, so the flux here is on the y-axis, then the grinding line position, this is L, is on the x-axis, the blue line being the first term PL, the red line being the first L. The first term PL, the red line being the second term, the grinding line flux. And then we can do this sort of graphical stability analysis, which shows us that as we change, let's say, either the accumulation rate or we change something about the grounding line flux, we go through this settlement bifurcation. And actually, I'm not going to talk about this today, but in reality, when we have beds that are not really smooth, as smooth, this is this nice sort of cubic function that Christian. Function that Christian delightfully gave us in his 2007 paper. When the bed topography is more jagged, the bifurcation is actually not a saddle node bifurcation. It looks like something different. And I'm happy to talk with anyone who wants to about sort of what that looks like. That's sort of some ongoing work I'm doing with Sam Pegler. Okay, so the point is now we're going to turn this into a stochastic differential equation. So the way that we do that is we add ocean melt at the grounding line, although you can certainly also At the grounding line, although you can certainly also add it in as some sort of noise term in the accumulation rate as well. But for the point of this argument, for the sort of West Antarctic argument, it's sort of most compelling when it's ocean melt at the grounding line. So we add this term eta. And this is some form of ocean variability, which in its most general sense has some time average eta bar, and then some stochastic variability about that average eta prime. Okay, so we've turned this into a stochastic differential equation. Turn this into a stochastic differential equation, and that means that we can start to use some very nice tools to analyze this kind of system. So, we're going to turn to a stochastic perturbation analysis. This is some very nice sort of theoretical framework that's been developed by John Wetlaufern, his former grad student Usakmun. And so I'm just rewriting the same system here. I'm taking all the deterministic dynamics and I'm putting them into function f, and then I'm taking the noise term and I'm just rewriting it here as. As a noise amplitude, which is prescribed, sigma sub F, and then a V inner noise process in its most general sense. It satisfies the Martingale property and various other things. But the point is, it's basically white noise for the purpose of this initial analysis. Okay, so the first step in this sort of approach is that we expand the system dynamics, so the F in the previous slide. In the previous slide, about the deterministic system trajectory L sub D. So the first part here in the brackets is just omega L, the little L, and little L is simply the perturbations about the deterministic system trajectory. That's this big L D. So what this drops out is basically it drops out sort of two parameters, omega and kappa. And omega and kappa, if you think of the determination. And omega and kappa, if you think of the deterministic system as being some sort of potential well, the omega corresponds to the slope of that potential well right near the deterministic trajectory. So basically how quickly the deterministic dynamics of the system are going to bring it back to the deterministic trajectory if you perturb it with noise. And kappa is the asymmetry inherent in yeah, Christian. I'm sure if you're looking at biifications, then you need another term because Then you need another term because otherwise you're yeah, we're not going to look at this through the bifurcation, we're going to look at it after we've gone through the bifurcation. Yeah. Yeah, so Anna Fismaurice has a very nice illustration of this, but the point is depending on, so in this figure it says that in terms of C or D, but those correspond to omega and kappa and what I just wrote down, basically depending on what those parameters are at any point on your deterministic trajectory. On your deterministic trajectory. So, you know, to Christian's question, if we've already gone through the bifurcation and we're sort of just thinking about sort of relatively small changes in omega and kappa, then omega and kappa correspond to sort of, and different signs for those correspond to these different kinds of potentials, right? So if you think of the deterministic dynamics as sort of the shape of this, and when you're sort of bouncing the system around, what returns you to that potential though? Yeah. So, one thing that's I think I've So one thing that's, I think, often challenging with the stochastic PDE route is you're adding a time scale to the problem, right? And it's not necessarily clear what physical process that captures. So do you have, like, when you add the noise term, quote unquote, right, like what is the time scale that you assume is relevant for that? And does it matter? Because it tends to matter. Yes, so I'm not going to talk about the sort of time scale issue in a ton of detail, but yeah, basically, The time scale, sort of, that we assume, at least in these sort of simplified cases, is just one year. So we're talking about inter-annual variability. But you can actually sort of start with that very simplified framework for thinking about this problem, and then you can extend it by thinking about how the answers that we end up getting through this analysis scale with respect to the time scale of, or the autocorrelation time scale of the noise. I'll talk a little bit about that. Time scale of the noise. I'll talk a little bit about that towards the end. Okay, so to sort of try to quickly get through this, then what we can do is we can expand this deterministic solution in terms of power of the noise amplitude, right? So sigma f, coming back to that, sigma sub f is the noise amplitude that we assumed at the beginning. And if we expand about in terms of powers of that, We expand about in terms of powers of that noise amplitude. We can think about sort of the first-order behavior of the system in terms of just sort of first-order perturbations of the noise amplitude. So from here. Alex? Yes. When you're running these little L's, are these the distribution function or the mean distribution function? No, we're not at the distribution yet. So we're still talking about. So, we're still talking about individual trajectories of the system. Although you're anticipating what I'm about to do on the next slide. So, when we expand in terms of this noise amplitude, what we can do is first make the assumption that we're already on the deterministic, or that we start on the deterministic trajectory. So, this L sub zero goes away, it is zero, there's no sort of initial perturbation away. And then we drop all terms higher than first order in the noise amplitude, right? And this is. Order in the noise amplitude, right? And this is just underlying the assumption that basically noise perturbations here are much smaller than system variations due to the deterministic dynamics, or put another way, sigma f is much smaller than L. So what that allows us to do is it allows us to write sort of a first order expansion of this system or a sort of a first order, sorry, a first order version of the system. We just looked at the first order term. Version of the system, we just looked at the first order terms, which is just the L1 solution, so d L1 dt, which only has non-zero terms in terms of omega. And then the noise term again. And so what this ends up looking like basically is we've just done all of this work to take our nonlinear stochastic differential equation and linearize it in terms of the noise amplitude. That's essentially what. Amplitude. That's essentially what the stochastic perturbation approach is allowing you to do. And so, what this looks like, you might recognize that this is just the Langevin equation. And so, this has gotten us where we want to be, which is then that we can take the Langevin equation and just rewrite it as the Fokker-Planck equation, which has known solutions. So the Fokker-Planck equation now, instead of evolving the individual trajectories of the system, we're evolving the probability distribution of the ice sheet state. In this case, the ice sheet state being encapsulated. In this case, the ice sheet state being encapsulated in the grounding line position L. And so we now have an equation describing the evolution of the PDF. The nice thing is that we have an entire field of statistical mechanics sort of devoted to figuring out solutions to this equation. And so we have known solutions to this problem, which give us basically the leading order moments of the probability distribution. So put another way, we've sort of done all of this footwork. Sort of done all of this footwork so that we can take our stochastic differential equation, our sort of stochastic marine ice sheet system, and we can explicitly derive how the variance of the probability distribution varies as a function of system parameters, and also how the skewness varies as a function of system parameters. The skewness actually comes from the second-order expansion of this, but I won't get into that. Okay, so sort of skipping over all the Okay, so sort of skipping over all the anointed algebra, what we get to at the end is we get to an equation for sigma l squared, the variance of the probability distribution, and this is simply proportional to an exponential function raised to, or an exponential function in terms of this parameter omega. So the parameter omega, which I'll write down here in terms of the system parameters, simply describes the stability of the grounding line. The stability of the grounding line. So, what this is telling us is that the more unstable the grounding line is, right? You're on a retrograde slope, the more unstable the grounding line is, the faster the variance will grow as you sort of move away from the instability, right? After you go through the bifurcation, sort of defines what we call marine ice sheet instability, then variance in the system will grow. Your PDF of ice sheet, possible ice sheet states will grow exponentially as a function of basically how strong the instability. How strong the instability is. So, the more retrograde the slope is, the faster your variance will grow. And it's also proportional to. Why you have large slopes and the cost instability will be that again. Just would you clarify the last statement that the larger the slope, the larger the instability. But how do you quantify the magnitude of Quantify the magnitude of the stability. So, this omega parameter here, which is just the sort of derivative of the right-hand side of the deterministic dynamics with respect to the, it's essentially the linearized stability of that deterministic system. That's what omega is. And in that parameter, the slope enters in, right? Bx, the slope enters in. The x, the slope x percent. So basically, the more strongly, so as long as omega is positive here, variance will parallel. And basically, for all retrograde slopes in this parameter, omega is positive. And then the more retrograde it is, so that basically the larger Bx is, the stronger your growth rate will be in the variance over time. Okay. Okay, and then the other point is to Jenny's earlier question, which is that something that doesn't come out of this standard stochastic perturbation theory, but which you can sort of make an ad hoc argument for, is that the variance actually also goes like tau f, which is the autocorrelation time scale of the forcing. So, in order to do the sketch perturbation theory, we originally had to invoke the marking property, so we sort of weren't allowing. We sort of weren't allowing ourselves to, or permitting ourselves to have any correlation in the noise. And so, this is sort of a slightly sketchy thing to do. But for a relatively small noise perturbation, this sort of argument actually turns out to work pretty well. And the other point that comes out of this is that the skewness or the third moment of your probability distribution can also be derived here. And it 2 goes like this omega parameter, but it is also proportional to this kappa parameter, that is the asymmetry. This kappa parameter that is the asymmetry in sort of your deterministic dynamic potential. And what that is related to is this, and the sign of this kappa term is essentially related to this exponent beta, right? So basically the nonlinearity in your grounding line flux beta determines whether your probability distribution will systematically become skewed towards faster grounding line retreat or less fast grounding line. Retreat or less fast grinding line retreat. And for relatively high values of beta, which is to say for relatively non-linear grounding line flux formulas, you will tend to always skew your probability distribution towards faster grounding line retreats. I can sort of show that here. So that sort of concludes all the sort of finicky mathematical bits, but we can just do this. We can use this very simple. We can just do this. We can use this very simple model to produce, you know, 10,000 ensemble members. And so, two or so, three examples to look at here are the green shading, which is you're on a prograde slope. You just have interannual variability. Your spread doesn't change very much over the course of this simulation. The orange shading is reverse sloping, but a retrograde slope, again, with inter-annual variability. Again, with inter-annual variability, and you get more spread. If you move to intracable forcing variability, then you pretty greatly increase the spread and also the skewness. You can see here that there is sort of starting to get a systematic skew towards more gradual line retrieve. And so that sort of confirms all these other things, and then we can do a systematic comparison between the theory and between these sort of numerically derived values. And what we find is that. Derived values. And what we find is that the theory does a pretty good job. It starts to depart after a while, and that's because of all the linearizations, of course, that we have to do in order to get there. Yeah, Christian. So I see versions of this. I mean, so you get this sort of reaction diffusion equation essentially. I remember seeing this with essentially the dynamical system F of T, L retained in full um I remember Rachel Kruska is a was a colleague of name. Well they're probably good now. To do this for CLS problems, we also get just a recent LPF feedback. And I think they were looking to do something like this, but they're not doing your local tailor expansion. I'm just not sure how far that would have got there. Yeah, well she's now my colleague, so we've been talking about how we can do this in a slightly better way. Anyways, so the point is that the Anyways, so the point is that the ensembles, the numerically generated ensembles, sort of confirm what the theory tells us, which is really that when you're going through the instability, the variance and the skewness of your system increase or grow exponentially, and also that the more persistence there is in your climate variability, the climate forcing variability, the larger the spread you're going to see as well. And the variance goes something like the The variance goes something like the odd, or it's proportional to this odd correlation time. So, anyways, just to sort of move through this really quickly, we sought out to see whether we could confirm this or at least see something similar by doing this in ISSM. So, a few years ago, I started talking to Helen about basically taking ISSM, taking a simulation of thwaits, which we know would become unstable, and then just running it 500 times with randomized stochastic forcing from the Stochastic forcing from the ocean. And so we do exactly this. So, what we're going to look at here is an animation. Here's the Thwaites catchment. Here's the grounding, the initial grounding line position in this yellow line. And then I'm going to show just a subsample or subset of the 500 ensemble members that we ran. The forcing of that subset in terms of the max melt rate at depth in the ocean is shown here. It's going to move upward in time from zero to a thousand years. And then the probability. Years and then the probability distribution for the entire ensemble for its contribution to sea level is going to be moving along at the bottom. Okay, great, it's running. So what you can see here is, right, we're adding basically decadal variability, which we think is somewhat realistic from observations, and some models that indicate that there's all kinds of decadal ocean variability in front of thwaits. And so, what you can see here is that once thwaits really start. Is that once weights really start zipping back through this instability, the probability distribution really spreads out and gets skewed? I'll just run that one more time in case you missed it, because most of the action happens within a few seconds. But yeah, something to keep an eye on here is how these grounding lines initially are very closely packed together as the system is very weakly unstable, but then once you become very unstable, Stable, but then once you become very unstable, the probability distribution just really spreads out. You've got about 10 to 20 centimeters worth of uncertainty in sea level rise just due to variability from one glacier. And yeah, and then we can just write down the statistics for this as well. So this is for four different ensembles each of 500 members. And the orange line is inter-annual ocean variability, the blue line is interdecadal, the yellow line is multi-decadal ocean variability. And then the Variability. And then the pink line is if we just assume that we have uncertain constant but uncertain ocean forcing, right? So basically, just uncertainty in that eta bar parameter in the actual mean ocean forcing itself. And so we essentially sort of confirm what we saw in the theory. I mean, it's obviously a much more complicated system, and there's all kinds of complexity here. But when you're going the fastest through the instability is when you see this fast. The instability is when you see this fastest ramp up in the variance. This also corresponds to a time when your skewness is negative. So that negative skewness corresponds to basically more sea level rise. So you're skewed towards more sea level, higher sea level rise scenarios. Okay, so this looks a lot like if we look at some other studies, papers that have looked at perturbed parameter ensemble. Looked at perturbed parameter ensembles for marine ice sheets. You can see some of this systematic skewness and that increase in variance as you go through the system. Of course, in many of these cases, you get these weird bimodal distributions that come about due to the fact that there's more than one ice stream in an ice sheet. But the point being that this can at least start to explain why these periods when sea level is rising the fastest due to the sort of Is rising the fastest due to sort of the fastest ice sheet melt, particularly to these Antarctic ice sheet simulations, is when you're going to get the fastest growth in your spread, in your ensembles. Okay, just two final points because we are supposed to be giving perspectives on where we think we should be going in the future. The sort of whole point of this is really just a proof of concept to say that we should be doing large ensemble type studies like are done in the climate modeling. Like are done in the climate modeling community, right? These types of ensembles have been sort of a huge boon to trying to understand internal variability within the climate system, but also to doing robust attribution studies, which is something that we haven't really done as much in the climate model, in the ice sheet modeling community. And so with some colleagues, we're starting to think about ways that we can do this. I'm happy to talk to folks about at least what we think are the best ways forward. But we have some. We have some ideas, but would like suggestions about how people think we can design ensembles in the most effective way to capture the most interesting aspects of uncertainty. The other thing, which actually I'm glad Ian put up his little thought bubble on the first day, yesterday, I guess, of how can we start to get around some of these issues? And I think stochastic parameterization is something that we really haven't considered strongly. Considered strongly enough in our field and can potentially help us get past this issue of very small-scale complexity and small-scale behavior. If at the end of the day, what we're interested in is sort of what the sort of overall ice sheet response is, and the ice sheet response is integrating a lot of these small scale processes. Can we effectively or do an effective job at representing? Do an effective job at representing the effect of these small-scale processes, the small-scale complexity, by simply parameterizing some of these processes as stochastic processes. I don't know the answer to that, but I'm curious to hear what other people think. So thank you very much. Okay, so we have a couple minutes for questions. We've had questions embedded within questions. Just a small question on the unsequable simulation of the ESSL. Did you put the internet just on the forcing or also on the other side? Yeah, so the two cases that I was showing were basically the separated two cases, right? So these three are just... Oh, sorry, your question was, did I put any uncertainty on parameters or anything like that? Yeah, on the parameters. No. The only thing that has changed between these simulations is the mass. Between these simulations, is the max melt rate in the ocean forcing. That might change the usual. No, it'll make it, I mean, it'll make it spread larger, for sure. Yeah. So the point of this, and maybe I undersold it, but the point of this is this is a large amount of uncertainty from one parameter and from variability in one parameter. Yeah. So let me play devil's up just for us here. You know, you know, I love stochastic wallets and I think they break, but in a way Balls, and I think they break. But in a way, I think one could argue that what you're seeing here is sort of obvious that that would happen because you have an unstable system behind it, right? So every unstable system would lead to a growth of whatever area in it. It's just the essence of the underlying PE, right? Yes, absolutely. And you quantify that in a nice way, and that's all wonderful, right? But still, I think when you talk about stochastic ensemble simulations as a way forward for analyzing uncertainty, I do wonder whether at some point you need to think about Whether at some point you need to think about stabilizing, like basically adding to your underlying set of equations, at least the possibility that this would stabilize at some point, right? So, like, whether you could add a process-based component to this that says, well, you know, maybe the, you know, like maybe you will have shear margin dynamics, maybe you will have rearrangement of the basal properties, maybe you have all the things. I mean, if we don't know how they work and we don't know what what they're gonna happen, but if you do a fix, it stochastic ensemble. Do a big stochastic ensemble, it might at least be worth to consider that as a possibility, just so that you don't set up your model in the sense that it's entirely unstable, anyway. So that's the only way it can go. Yeah, so I think two answers to your points. Absolutely, it is true. Basically, everything that I just said, if you just remove the word ice sheet from it, it's all been known in the dynamical systems community for many, many years. And so the point here was really just to rewrite this in terms of. Rewrite this in terms of the parameters and the processes that we understand to try to get a sense for when we do look at all these examples of all these great studies, and this is just a small selection that are starting to do ensemble studies. How do we understand what's driving the spread? And we were talking last night about the uncertainty in the projection being as an important scientific result as the mean of the projection, right? Projection, right? And so
