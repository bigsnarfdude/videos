Drop it on the chat or mute yourself. Yeah, welcome, Timu. Okay, thank you very much, Nana. Good afternoon, good evening, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. And first of all, a big thank you, of course, to the organizers for organizing this great event. It's been really very inspiring for me and I've learned a lot. And I'm also very grateful that I have this opportunity to present these recent works with Song Julie, Wolfgang Leerger. Song Julie, Wolfgang Leche, and at least on one slide, I'll also give a brief overview of this work with Rafael Alvaris Garcia and Daniel Kleb. So it's the aim of a longer problem, as we all know, to try to understand what the Swampen distance conjecture of Uguri buffer means, which is the statement that at infinite distance of a quantum gravity, an infinite tower of state should become exponentially light. Should become exponentially light. As we heard yesterday in the very interesting discussion session, this is an exceptional claim, and exceptional claims need exceptional evidence. Luckily, I think for the Swampton distance conjecture, there's plenty of evidence, probably two types of evidence. The first type of evidence is by inspection in string theory, and a particularly clear such type of inspection can be done for the case of complex structure moduli limits. Case of complex structure moduli limits in type 2b on calabiero threefolds. This would be limits in the vector moduli space of the corresponding 4D n equals 2 super gravity theory. And there, in a number of works, the emergence of this tower of light states has been proven, has been shown. The states in question are the three brains wrapping certain vanishing special adausions whose calibratic volume vanishes in the limit. And there's a beautiful And there's a beautiful mathematical story behind the theory of limiting mixed hot structure, which of course has attracted a lot of attention in the literature. The second type of evidence would be bottom-up evidence. And recently, ideas have been put forward to try to connect the distance conjecture to entropy arguments, to black hole arguments, not similarly, but in a parallel vein of what has been done for the weak gravity conjecture. Weak gravity conjecture. The content of this talk, however, is more the question: what is the nature of the light states and the asymptotic physics? And I insist on this question because I think that it's a very important conceptual question. It might help us to answer some of the conceptual questions behind this formed distance conjecture and interpret the asymptotic properties of quantum gravity in this context. So, if one knew the answer to this question, I'm Knew the answer to this question, I'm sure this would shed a lot of light on the interesting emergence proposal. It would maybe tell us much more about the origin behind the weak gravity conjecture, at least in the limit of small coupling. So maybe give the reason why the weak gravity conjecture has to hold. And ideally, of course, could also tell us something about asymptotic cosmology, the focus here being on the word asymptotic, of course. So that's why. So that's why I like to think about this question. And a proposal or conjecture for an answer, a potential answer, is formulated in the emergent string conjecture, which makes explicit this idea that underlies the Swamp and distance conjecture and has always underlined it of the importance of realities. Namely, the statement would be that the parametrically leading tower of states becoming light at infinite distance is either a dual Is either a dual KK tower, in this case we have a decompactification limit, or it's the tower of excitations of an asymptotically weakly coupled fundamental string together with a KK tower. So in particular, the statement is whenever you don't find a weakly coupled fundamental string becoming light, then the tower of states that you get, no matter what complicated they are, should have an interpretation as a KK tower, at least as far as the leading and parametric. At least, as far as the leading and parametrically lightest tower is concerned, that at least is the claim for this claim. We also have a lot of quantitative tests within string theory, admittedly, string or M-theory, mostly in the Kala moduli space. And these tests have been performed in various dimensions with varying amount of supersymmetry, eight supercharges, four supercharges, most recently discussion on zero supercharges. The emergent string conjecture is also related to the interesting distant externic string conjecture, as we learned in Luca Matucci's talk yesterday. The emergent strings would be what they call the W equals one subcase of the EFT string. So for details, I refer you to this paper or to yesterday's talk by Luca. And the goal of this talk is to try to challenge the emergent string conjecture. So the original So, the original idea was that maybe one could find counterexamples by looking into types of constructions which are not of this Keller moduli form where the conjecture seems to be well behaved. So, the first question we could ask is: does the interpretation of the states as KK states or string excitations uphold in more abstract types of moduli spaces? Abstract types of moduli spaces. Most importantly, what about the complex structure moduli space that has been studied so much in detail already? And what about open string moduli, quote unquote? And a second way to possibly challenge the conjecture would be to think, could there be higher dimensional fundamental objects, not just a fundamental string becoming light, but maybe at the parametrically leading scale, something higher dimensional in the sense of a fundamental object, whatever this means. So these would be two questions one could ask. So, these would be two questions one could ask. So, in the main part of this talk, I will be addressing the first question within a particular framework, namely, I'll be studying infinite distance limits in complex structure moduli space of F theory on elliptic K3 surfaces. So on the one hand, this is the complex structural limit now. On the other hand, this also geometrizes, as we know in F-theory, certain, among other things, certain open string infinite distance limits. So a different type of limit that was considered so far. Was considered so far. And as is appropriate for this conference and for this workshop, I hope this analysis comes in two parts: a geometric analysis. I will advertise a refined classification of the infinite distance limits for elliptic K3 surfaces. So this is a purely geometric result. And then, from the Swampland perspective, try to interpret the states which become light and put them into the context of the emergent string conjecture. And indeed, The emergent string conjecture. And indeed, we claim that we find agreement with this interpretation of the states which do not come from strings as Kalusa-Klein states. And the take-home message of this part of the analysis for me are that it's really important to take into account all the towers at the parametrically leading scale in order to read off the asymptotic physics. That probably goes without saying. And second, that indeed effective Kalusa-Klein towers often come in disguise. So towers which may not look like Kalusaki. Not look like Kalusa-Klein towers in the particular formulation that one looks at, might have a dual formulation as Kalusa-Klein states. And we will give another example where this is happening. But before I come to this main theme, let me very briefly address this other potential challenge of the emergence ring projection. Could there be other higher-dimensional fundamental objects becoming light at the leading scale? And in this paper, And in this paper, we claim that, in a certain sense, this is not so. So, we claim that there can be no infinite distance limits in which the scale of a fundamental membrane becomes parametrically leading. In particular, if, say, the KK scale scales to zero in this fashion, one over n mu cubed from mu to infinity, then the scale of the fundamental membrane goes to zero much slower. We have a fundamental membrane. This is of course a delicate issue, what we mean by this. Delicate issue: what we mean by this. We here mean a membrane which, upon circle reduction, reduces to a fundamental string. So, not just to a non-critical string or any other strongly coupled string, but really to a fundamental string under S1 reduction. And we argue that this claim follows already by consistency of the emergent string conjecture under dimensional reduction. Dimensional reduction, of course, is a topic, and consistency under dimensional reduction is a principle that has been applied many times in this warm-land context. Context. And second, we somewhat independently argue that this principle indeed upholds very concretely when we look at infinite distance complex structural moduli degenerations of M-theory compactified to five dimensions. This is the five-dimensional hypermultiple moduli space. And in fact, we heavily rely here on previous results by Bohmachesterner Wiesner, who studied certain 4D emergent string events. So this just as an So, this just as an advertisement, if I may, and I'll be happy, of course, to discuss this later. But now, let's come to the point of this talk. And I will first start with the geometric analysis, namely try to give a classification of infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of elliptic K3 surfaces. And these elliptic K3 surfaces are of Elliptic K3 surfaces are, of course, the spaces that define for us F theory in eight dimensions. And I'm here taking only the purely geometric perspective. So I only look at F theory in eight dimensions without any possible background fluxes, like freezing of singularities and so on, switched on. So the conventional simplest case, if you think. Just to fix notation, a quick reminder of what we need. We will not need much on the elliptic vibrations. All we need is that they can be described by... Is that they can be described by a Weilstas model, which of course we all are familiar with. The Weilstas model is defined in terms of two functions, f and g, which are functions of on the base, or more precisely certain sections on the base of the compactifications. The space is the of the elliptic vibration. This base is the compactification space. The seven brains are points on this base and fill eight dimensions. And the points are characterized by the vanishing of the discriminant delta, which is this combination of f and g. This combination of f and g. And as we all know, from the vanishing orders of f, g, and delta at various points, we can read off the algebra on the seven brains, the Lie algebra. This is the famous Kodaira classification. Again, details are not necessary. The only thing that is necessary is to remember is that this classification stops as soon as we reach vanishing orders 4, 6, and 12. Okay, so we take this most Okay, so we take this most general framework of a Weierschlass model over P1. Every elliptic vibration with section can be written as such a Weierschlass model, so we lose no generality in assuming this. And now we want to study the degenerations in complex structure moduli space at infinite distance. And for simplicity, I'm only looking at one parameter family of degenerations. So there will be one complex parameter which takes values in a disk on which f and g and therefore the elliptic vibration depends. So it is useful, in fact, to So, it is useful, in fact, to view this setup, this family of degenerations as a threefold by itself. Namely, we have here the disk, this blue object in which this parameter takes values. And for every value of the disk, we have a particular K3 surface. The generic member of this family is a smooth K3. So, this would be a Weierstrass. This would have a Weierstrass model with Kudaira-type fibers. If we resolve the fibers, the singularities, then we get a smooth. Fibers and the singularities, then we get a smooth K3. And in the center, we have the degeneration that we are interested in studying. And we are interested in the infinite distance degenerations, the potential infinite distance degenerations. And we know that these can only be one of the following two types. So either it can happen that for u equals zero, the fiber over the elliptic vibration degenerates everywhere, over every point. This would be the co-dimension zero degenerations. dimension zero degenerations for which this discriminant vanishes at u equals zero over every point on the base or we could have non-minimal degenerations where we have at a point on the p1 but for u equals zero for this value of parameter equals zero a singularity of type 4612 or higher indeed everything else is captured by codiva and is known to be at finite distance so let's look at these two cases in turn the first case is a bit The first case is a bit boring. Let me just briefly discuss it. So, we want a degeneration where the fiber over the P1 degenerates everywhere. And in fact, without loss of generality, one can assume that this degeneration is of what's called IN type. This means that f and g do not vanish for u equals zero, but the discriminant vanishes, but it vanishes at u equals zero over every point of the base. Indeed, one can easily argue for this by base change and rescaling. I'll be happy to bring the argument later if you're interested. To bring the argument later if you're interested. Now, this means that the interpretation is very clear. What happens is that the exodilaton in this case goes to I infinity over every point of the base. So G, the string coupling, goes to zero everywhere on the base manifold. This is a recoupling limit. In fact, this is familiar from the famous Sen limit, of course. This is a type of recoupling limit. And this is what one would call. Limit. And this is what one would call an emergent string limit, where the weakly coupled type to B string becomes the important object. We'll come back to this in a second. But here, let me just note that for the simplest case, for instance, where we take n equal to 2, we would have an I2 fiber everywhere. This means a fiber which we can resolve into two P1s which intersect, and they form this type of fibrillation. And in the F-de-Re literature, such type of infinite distance degenerations. Type of infinite distance degenerations with a focus on infinite distance degenerations have been appeared, for example, in this paper by Espermore Morrison. So this would be the case, co-dimension zero degenerations. We expect something like a recoupling limit. Now, the more interesting case for us will be the second class, namely non-minimal degenerations over points, meaning if I take u equals zero, my parameter u equals zero, then over certain points, let's call them Over certain points, let's call them s equals zero on the base, we have vanishing orders Fg delta, which are 4612 or higher. Such degenerations cannot be dealt with directly, but there is a trick, which again has been discussed in physics literature, for example, in this Espino-Borrison paper and many after. What one can do is one can blow up the point where this happens, and I view this point now as a point in this threefold given by the This threefold given by the k3s together with the disk of its parameter space. Now the blow-up is simple. I can do a simple toric blow-up and rescale. I therefore introduce a P1 at this point over which we have this 4612 vibration. And I can iterate this well-known procedure until no non-minimal singularity is left. And the result is that the fiber here at over u equals zero, so the degenerate. Over u equals zero, so the degenerate K3 now degenerates into a union of different surfaces, like shown here. Each of the surface components, YP, is by itself an elliptic vibration, which may be degenerate. So the base has been replaced, the P1 has been replaced by a chain of P1s, and there can be P many of them. P can be an arbitrary value depending on the degree of degeneration. So that's Degeneration. So that's the general procedure. And now the question is: what can happen? What comes out? What are the possible types of chains of such surfaces that we can head at infinite distance? And second, how do we interpret their physics? Because these look pretty bad from a physics point of view. How do we do F-theory on them? So let's first ask the question, what can happen? So this is a longer analysis, and I'm only giving the results. It turns out there are three possible outcomes. There are three possible outcomes. And the outcomes can be characterized already from the point of view of the Weierschlas model by looking at the vanishing orders at this point, which goes beyond 4612. Namely, if all that happens is that the vanishing order of the discriminant is exactly 12, then we get the first class, which we call type 2A. If the vanishing order of the discriminant is bigger than 12, but those of F and G are Of f and g are just four and just six, we get a second class which we call type three. And the most mysterious case, when the vanishing orders are strictly bigger four, six and twelve, then we can either get type two or type three as above or finite distance. So what does this mean? What this means, I am going to tell you now. For now, I just need you to remember there are three possible cases depending on the vanishing orders of F, G, and delta that one can classify. Delta, that one can classify. So let's look at these three different cases in turn to see what the geometry is and then what the physics would be. First case. This is the case where we have a vanishing order 4612. So discriminant exactly 12. It turns out when you do all your blow-ups, you get a chain of surfaces which intersect. So instead of a single K3, we now have this chain of different elliptic fibers. This chain of different elliptic vibrations. The chain has two end components on the left and on the right. These end components are both rational elliptic surfaces, so dp9 surfaces with 12 singular fibers. And the surfaces in the middle are just trivial fibrations, direct product of a torus with a rational curve. We can therefore blow down these middle components, if we like, to a single point. And at the end, what we get is something that always End, what we get is something that always looks like shown here on the right. We have two elliptic vibrations over two p1s, which intersect in a point, and we have 12 brains on the left and on the right. So instead of the original 24 brains on K3, we have now two pairs of 12 brains, one on the first elliptic vibration, one on the second. These are DP9 surfaces. They intersect in a point. And this, of course, to an F-their is something very well known. Course, to an F, there is something very well known. It's the famous stable degeneration of Morrison buffer that describes the dual heterotic string in the large T limit. So this is an old friend that one recovers, nothing earth-shattering. Let's now go to the remaining cases. And these are more interesting. And these were not known in the physics literature. And these are the cases called type 3. This means that the vanishing order of the This means that the vanishing order of the discriminant is bigger than 12, strictly bigger than 12. Again, we will get a chain of surfaces, and we need to deal with the end components of this chain and the middle components. And from there, we can read of the physics then. So the end components can be one of two things. It can either be, again, a dp9, a rational elliptic surface with 12 singular fibers, or it can be a surface where the exodilaton goes to I infinity. goes to I infinity over every point. So in other words, again, we have a degeneration over every point of the surface. And in addition, we can have extra seven brains on specific points, and these can correspond either to A-type singularities, this would be an extra SUN gauge group, or to D-type, this would be an extra SON gauge group. And this is all there can be. And on one, on the N component, there must be precisely two such D-type singularities. So that's just a list. So that's just a list of properties that one can prove to hold. The intermediate components, on the other hand, all have generic I and fibers, and they can have enhancements only of type A. And what this means is that on each such intermediate component, one has a locally weak coupling regime. So a picture says more than thousand words. Let me show everything that I said. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit on one page. That's why I first had to make the words and then show the picture. Make the words and then show the picture. So these are the cases that can occur. I'll say it again. So the K3 becomes a chain of surfaces which intersect. On the middle components, the fiber degenerates everywhere and Gs goes to zero over every point on the middle components. On the end components, either we have something like a DP9 on both sides or we have one DP9 and something where the fiber degenerates everywhere. But then there must be two D-type singularities. These would be O-plane. D-type singularities, these would be O-planes in physics language, or type 3B. We can have two of those guys with the recoupling regimes in the middle. And this is all that can happen, as one can show explicitly. So that, in fact, concludes the classification part. Let me just briefly say how this fits into the math literature. So, of course, it has been known for a long time, or the theory of degenerations of K3 surfaces in general is a classic. In general, is a classic and rich topic in the mathematics literature. And according to a number of theorems, every one-parameter degeneration of general K3 surfaces, not necessarily picklified, every such degeneration is one of three types called Kulikov model type 1, 2, and 3. The type 1 models are the ones at finite distance. So this is where Kodaira's singularities would live. And the infinite distance ones are of type 2 and 3. They are all of the type that we They are all of the type that we have various surfaces that intersect in a complicated way. In type two, the intersections of two surfaces are tori, and in type three, the intersections of two surfaces, if non-zero, are rational curves. This is how the Kulikov models are defined in the mathematics literature. And more was known, namely, in the case type 2, there are precisely two possibilities up to certain birational invariance. Namely, we can either have the situation that looks like a stable degeneration. That looks like a stable degeneration, a la Morrison buffer. This was what we got from resolving the 4612 point. So two DP9s intersecting. Or we can have something that looks like a global recoupling limit, like a SEN limit. So a situation where the fiber degenerates over every point of the base, and we have a recoupling limit. And these are the only two possibilities that can arise of type 2. And indeed, we found them via the directory. By the direct Weierschlass analysis. Now, as far as the type 3 models, a corresponding analysis had not been done. More precisely, we can now look at elliptic K3 surfaces and their Bayost models. That's exactly what the framework that we've been looking at. And what I just told you is essentially classification results. It told us that all the elliptic K3 degenerations of this type 3, so all the other ones, come from Kulikov-Weyerschwatt models. Come from Kulikov-Weiershot's models of this type, either 3A or 3B, precisely the ones. So we have, and we know how to construct them explicitly from the Weierschwatt model, and we know that that's all there can be. And when I say this was not known before in the literature, then I mean this was not known in the literature until this very recent work. Our results are independent. In fact, I must confess, I was not aware of these works when we were starting the project and doing most of the analysis. Starting the project and doing most of the analysis, our results are compatible with them, but use very different techniques. Of course, the mathematicians wouldn't maybe start from the Spierstadt model, and they use very different techniques. But as far as I can see and understand, the results are compatible. Okay, so this was the first part. Classification of infinite distance limits, one of four types, two of which were known, and the other two, 3A and 3B, are new. A and 3B are new. And now let's come to the physics part, the swampland interpretation. In what sense do these infinite distance limits now give rise to an asymptotically masses tower of states? What's the nature of those states once we consider, for example, F-theory on those geometries? Already from the general theorems, we know a large part of the answer because Part of the answer because it's known by general arguments that these Kulikov type 2 and type 3 degenerations have, respectively, two or one transcendental torus whose volume becomes zero in the infinite distance limit. So it's known that in a type 2 degeneration, there must be two tori, which are not holomorphic curves, so transcendental tori whose volume goes to zero. And in the type 3 case, Whose volume goes to zero, and in the type three case, there must be precisely one. This was known on general grounds. And if we now consider M-theory on those bases, for example, we would clearly expect two in the type 2 case and one in the type 3 case towers of asymptotically massless BPS particles by wrapping M2 brains along these vanishing cycles. And in fact, the fact that these are tori means that they can be wrapped arbitrarily many times, so we don't get Arbitrarily many times. So we don't get just a single BPS state, but we get a full tower of states, one for each of the tori. And this reasoning is, of course, completely analogous to the more general arguments for Calabia 3 and Calabia 4 folds that I briefly reviewed on the first slide in these works. In the present case, at least, however, these M2 brains associated with these tori in general form only a subset of the asymptotically massless states. Asymptotically massless states, and in general, only a subset of the leading asymptotically massless states. So one has to be careful to find all the towers at the same scale in order to extract the asymptotic physics. And this is what I'm trying to do now. Let's start with the simplest case. This was the simplest of the four cases was the Skulikov type 2A model, the stable degeneration limit, the famous stable degeneration. So it's a type 2, so there should be two. it's a type two so there should be two tori two tutori that um become mass that become um of zero volume at infinite distance so how do we construct them geometrically we can construct them as follows um we combine one of the of each of the two one cycles in the fiber the a cycle and the b cycle combine it together with the pinching one cycle that pinches at the intersection point of the two intersection point of the two P1s. And this cycle is precisely this green cycle sigma denoted here. Combining these, we get two tori, gamma one and gamma two, and the volume is zero because the cycle sigma pinches to a point. So what would now be the interpretation of the corresponding two state, two towers of states in F theory? Well, an M2 brain wrapping on SA and SB. S A and S B respectively gives rise to a one zero string or zero one string, which now in addition has to be wrapped on this one cycle sigma that pinches at P. So we get two string junctions, a one, zero junction and zero and a zero one junction, which encircles the point P. And this can equivalently be seen as encircling the 12 brains on, say, the left dp9, or equivalently the 12 brains on the right dp9. Indeed, this is possible because these 12 brains, Indeed, this is possible because these 12 brains have an SL to Z monodromy, which precisely multiplies to the identity matrix. So, therefore, we can have precisely two types of string junctions encircling all the brains, a one, zero junction and a zero, one junction. Now, this monography matrix is the same monography matrix as the double loop algebra hat E9, which is a loop extension of the affine algebra hat E8. This is the algebra that one gets. This is the algebra that one gets by combining all the 12 brains on one of the DP9 surfaces into a single algebra. So the picture is that the 4612 enhancement originally placed 12 of these brains on the left and 12 of these brains on the right into one point. This gives rise to the so-called double loop algebra. The blow-up just resolves them artificially in an artificial geometry, but one can still see the origin by realizing that. By realizing that the states that the junction that encircles all these coalescing 12 brains indeed are massless in the sense described. And now what's the interpre, so this gives the geometric picture for the states. And what's now their physical interpretation? We claim that these are precisely the Kalusa-Klein modes of the dual compactification from eight dimensions to 10 dimensions of the dual heterodic string. And this is clear because that's what the stable determination. Clear because that's what the stable degeneration limit does, and one can show this more in more detail by looking in detail at the heterotic dual. But in any case, this loop algebra enhancement is indicative of such a circle decompactification, in this case, two circles. So, this was the first the first model, decompactifications eight to ten. The second are these weak. The second are these recoupling models here. Things are a little bit more complicated. I want to be only very brief. Sorry, Timo, can I have a quick question about the previous slide? Yes. When you say that the dual head, so in that limit, what is the lightest string? Is it a perturbative type 2b string description or a heterotic string description? The heterotic will be the lightest string, but heavier than the KK tower. But heavier than the KK tower, okay. But in terms of string theory, then there would just be normal Kalusa climb modes. So, yeah, in the dual headerotic, these are normal Kalusa Klein modes. Exactly. That's just a volume of the torus of the dual heterotic torus going to infinity. Absolutely. Okay. But just the head of the string is lighter than the 2B string in that limit. So that's, I mean, yes. Yes. Okay. So they are. Exactly. Okay. I just like they had Roddy. Okay, I just the header string in the dual limit will be should should be lighter, but the KK tower is even lighter. That's why it's fine. Yeah, okay, great. Thanks a lot. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So the second type, it's a little bit more complicated. I want to be only brief. So this is this recoupling limit. So let's think for simplicity of the SEN limit where we have an I2 degeneration everywhere. This means GS goes to. means gs goes to zero everywhere and we resolve this i2 into these two p1s and the point is these two p1s intersect in two points but these two points are exchanged this means that the intersection of these two p1s in the fiber is really a double cover of the base which in fact turns out to be a torus and what we can now do is we can combine the shrinking one cycle s a which shrinks at these intersection points with Shrinks at these intersection points with each of the two one cycles of this torus E. So it's maybe not very intuitive. This gives us again two tori, gamma one and gamma two. And the interpretation is again in M theory giving rise to massless BPS states. And but and this is important in addition, one now does get a light string, namely one can also wrap the M2 brain just on the cycle SA, which shrinks to zero. So this also gives a string. So, this also gives a string, which is also light, and in fact, turns out to be at the end of the day in F-theory at the same scale as the PPS states before. So, the interpretation here would be really as an effective eight-dimensional limits where we have a light type IIB string and at the same scale, two light towers of, say, winding strings, which come from just wrapping the string on the strings. Wrapping the string on the one cycles of the type 2B torus, which, however, doesn't undergo a further degeneration. So, this would therefore be an effective theory in eight dimensions. And here it's important to know that there was really this extra type IIB string, which also becomes light. That's what I meant, that one has to take into account all towers at the same parametric scale in order to not misidentify this as a decompactification limit, as otherwise one could have done. Okay, I'll be done very soon. I'll be done very soon. Next, physics of type 3A. This is the new part. It's very similar to the stable degeneration, with the exception that instead of being able to wrap both the SA and the SB cycle over combining it with this pinching sigma, we can only combine one of them, namely the cycle SA. This is because the other cycle, the cycle SB, would not survive the monogramy. Would not survive the monogramies of the brains. One can show this. So, from the type 2B perspective, we have now only a single junction of strings, namely the junction of strings which encircle the brains, say, on the left end component. And this, in fact, leads to an enhancement again from your gauge algebra to an affine algebra. In fact, to the affine algebra, E9 has. the affine algebra um e nine uh um e hat nine minus n for various values of n and we interpret this once more as a decompactification limit from eight dimensions to nine dimensions something that is already clear from the fact that we get an affine algebra but once more the detailed heterotic analysis that we do confirms this explicitly one can map the degenerations of the Weierstrass model directly via certain mirror symmetry into siege modular forms that depend Siegel modular forms that depend on the heterodic complex structure in Kerla moduli, and check that indeed we get a partial decompactifications from eight to nine dimensions. And the reason are precisely these encircling one cycles, these circling junctions, which are this one tower of states that one gets from the Kulikov type 3. More precisely, this is true in type 3A. Let me just say very quickly, since now from each of the end components, Now, from each of the end components to the left and the right, as long as it's a dp9, one gets such an affine algebra. One can determine the full symmetry of these compactifications and classify the possible maximal enhancements. And this, in fact, reproduces the previous results on classification of the rank 17 maximal non-abeling gauge algebras in nine dimensions. I'll be happy to say more. In nine dimensions, I'll be happy to say more if you like, but in the interest of time, and just this very, very last case. This is the fourth case, the model of type 2B. Here we have Gs going to zero on each of the component. We have two O planes on the two end components. So this is a globally recoupling limit. Indeed, we get a massive string from wrapping the M2 brain of the Wrapping the M2 brain of the vanishing one cycle in the fiber. So, this is now a globally well-defined string which goes whose tension goes to zero. So, we get a string limit. But in addition, we get another tower of states, which is localized at the intersections and which is parametrically lighter than the string state. We can think of this as a degeneration of a type 2b limit in the limit where the complex structure modulus of the type 2b torus goes to infinity by itself. Goes to infinity by itself. So, this is a decompactification to a weakly coupled type 2B in 10 dimensions, or maybe dually than type 1. Okay, let me wrap up. We presented a refined classification of the infinite distance complex structure degenerations on elliptic K3 surfaces, and these, in fact, are in one-to-one with the possible infinite distance limits in complex structure moduli space of F degree on K3 with no fluxes. There are four such limits. There are four such limits. They are either decompactification limits or emergent string limits in the sense of just having a weakly coupled string becoming light with no lighter Kalusa-Klein tower. So once more, the message for me at least was that Kalusa-Klein states in a certain frame, in fact, can come in disguise. And particularly here, the M2 brainstrapping the two tori, in some cases, as discussed, should really be interpreted as callous. Interpreted as Kalusa-Klein states, or from the type 2B open string point of view, as string junctions, which lead to affine enhancements as the hallmark of such a decompactification limit. Thank you very much for your attention. Thanks, Timo, for the very nice talk. So we have some time for questions. Lynn? Hi. Hi, Timo. Hi. Nice. Nice. Yeah, I had a question regarding the uplifts. How should I say this? So the affine, the delta junction that you expect from these having these affine algebras, right? They correspond to a particular transcendental torus, if I understand correctly. Exactly. Exactly. And so, okay, right. And I think in the And I think in the dual heterotic picture, right, if you think about the winding and momentum states of the heterotic string, then you expect that there's, in terms of these Narayan lattice, you expect there to be a hyperbolic rank two lattice to sort of decouple if you uplift from 80 to 90. So, in some sense, there should be like a dual kind of junction in this picture that is. In this picture, that is complementary. Right, that would then be them, that would then be the winding strings, right? Because these are the winding strings, and they would be very heavy, of course. Right. So that is a good question. I don't see them here, to be honest. Okay. Okay. So, from this kind of M2 brains or wrapping some cycles, it's not obvious what they should look like? Not now. Not now. In fact, I did think about this, but I think I forgot the answer. So right now, I cannot point you to it, but I will think about this again. But it's absolutely true that this is one of these two possible hyperbolic factors. So in the type 3 case, only one of them appears. In the type 2 case, both of them appear. Right. Yes. Okay. And that would be the interpretation. Yeah. So from just wrapping M2 brains, I cannot see them on a state because one could, yeah. There's a question by Ivano. Ivano, yeah. Yes, hi. Hi, Timo. Thanks for the very nice talk, as well as the reference. So I was curious about the quantitative behavior of the masses of the light states with the distance. Namely, is it important? Do we care that it's always precise? care that it's always a precise exponential or something else i think we do i think we do care but we didn't do this analysis here i think i i would certainly i would certainly care that it's an exponential of course to to to to be in line in the present case since we have the heterotic dual or the type 2b description in both cases it's it's clear that this is this exponential behavior um because that's the behavior for the kk states of the of the two hydro dual hydraulic tours of course and Hadrotic dual hydraulic torus, of course, and it's certainly also the behavior in the recoupling limit. So, there's no question about this. But, of course, you're asking how can you compute this directly from the F3 point of view. And in principle, you can. And they're using these other types of techniques in supergravity, or this mixed hot structure technique would, of course, also be perfectly suitable to do this. So, I view this really as a complementary. Do this. So I view this really as a complementary view in order to make explicit certain aspects. Yeah, but absolutely. So we didn't do this quantitative analysis of the masses here because of the simplicity of the framework. But in other cases, one might want to be more ambitious. I fully agree. Anderson, thanks a lot. Okay. Great. So there is. Great. So there is another question by Paul, but we are a little bit constrained with time. Is it quick? Yeah, I can ask really quick. Hey, okay, so then I had two questions, but then I just asked one. Do you have any idea why, I mean, just from a general perspective, why you can only uplift to the heterotic E8, E8 string and not. 8 string and not say the SO32? The SO32, I think, is then contained in this type 3B limit by duality because this would actually go to a type 1 if you t-dualize again. I think this is where the had rotic, where the type 2B is, excuse me, where the SO32 would be sitting. So it's, yeah, so Yeah, so if I may just, I mean, I know we have a little time, but if I may go here, so we see in these limits, so there's one limit, the one to the left and the one in the middle, where we have DP9s on the very left component. And DP9 always means mutually non-local brains. And this automatically means E8. So that's the E8 string. But the one on the right, there we precisely have only four D-type singularities, two plus two, together with this recoupling behavior. Uh, together with this recoupling behavior, this is where the um uh where I directly go to type one, and then by STLT, this would be the uh regime. So, in that sense, it's it's also covered, I would say. Okay, that actually sort of answers the second question. Okay, good. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay, great. So, we thank Timo. And if there is another question, in fact, in the chat, but I would say that can be replied on the chat or later in the conference dinner. So, I remember you all that. Dinner. So I remember you all that after the last talk, there is one hour in Gathertown for conference dinner. So thanks to Timo Ain. Thank you.
