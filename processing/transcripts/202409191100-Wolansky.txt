It's honest to go to the non-local equation. Well, what you see here is the standard Schrodinger equation. But in this case, the potential V is not prescribed, but it's given by some convolution with a symmetric kernel of the density of the square. Density of the square modulus of the eigenstates corresponding to the same Schrodinger equation. And there are, we can consider the kernel to be either electrostatic or gravitational potential. So we can use either plus or minus the gravitational potential in three. The gravitational potential in 3D. So, this is the classical Schrodinger-Poisson equation. And of course, the case of electrostatic potential is mathematically easier because in that case, you can show that the problem is convex and you have a unique solution for any. Solution for any value of the parameters, but the gravitational case is, as we should see, is harder because and more challenging from a mathematical point of view. So, for many years, I didn't consider this equation because I thought it's not physical. Why would you consider a gravitational interaction if we were studying the equation? But it turns out were studying equation but it turns out that there exists actually if you card consider this type of equation for its approximation for Hartree-Fock theory and there are some many other motivation to study this problem including self-gravitating self-gravitating metals. Gravitanting matters. So it's really worth studying. That's what. So of course, during the years, mathematicians considered generalization of this problem when they replaced p equal to 2 by general p exponent p and replacing the Newtonian potential. A Newtonian potential by risk potential for some alpha between zero to n. So, in order to consider this problem as a variational problem, you look for the energy, this energy functional on some appropriate space. And if there is a minimizer to this problem, then it should satisfy the Then it should satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is this Schödinger, non-local Schrodinger equation. So, so the other way. So, this is a little bit history. The Chokrada question was considered in the 70s by Lieb, Pierre Leon, Merzal, and some others. And more recently, there are monographs by There are monographs by Morrows and Schaffingen on consider the general case of the system. So one interesting aspect of the Schoder-Schöner equation is if you look at for time-dependent Schoder equation, and here the A is the strength of interaction, and as we saw before, if A. And as we saw before, if A is positive, this is the attractive gravitational dynamics. A is negative is the electrostatic one, which is a repulsive force. So we are here considering the case of the gravitational attractive force. That's what, like I said, is more interesting mathematically. And if you put the eigenstates psi together, you put the eigenstate psi to be e to the i lambda t minus i phi we get this steady state before but you can easily see that you can by scaling by scaling the both x and phi we can get rid of these parameters a and lambda and assume both to be equal one how however if you look at the time decoration However, if you look at time-dependent non-linear equation, we preserve the L2 norm because this is the unitary evolution. And so it makes sense to look for solution of this equation. We will prescribe the L2 norm, say, look for a solution of this with the norm of phi, L2 norm of phi equal one. As the normal phi equals one, so you can always scale it by one single parameter. And if we can scale it by a single parameter, this will preserve the L2 norm of phi, and we can get rid of one of these parameters. So we can always make A equal one. But lambda will be dependent on the Will not be equal to one by discounting because there's only one parameter here. There is, however, some exceptional case which we consider here. This is the case where the alpha is equal to n p minus 1 minus 2. In this case, the first two terms here are scaled identically. So we cannot get rid of the, we cannot. cannot get rid of the we cannot put a equal one so in in this special case a is some significant mathematical because we cannot get we cannot make it one by this scaling so it turns out that different a may have different solution here we consider the same equation Same equation with some prescribed potential w. So, w is fixed, w is a prescribed potential. All we assume is that it's confining potential, so its limit at infinity is infinity. Doesn't care how fast it goes to infinity, it can be very slow, but we need it in order to get some compactness for the problem. And then to obtain a solution of this equation under the constraint that phi. under the constraint that phi norm L2 equals one, we need to minimize this energy under the same constraint. Okay, so this will be the energy and we would like to study this for different A. So this was already done by Yin Bin, Lu and Wei some years ago. Some years ago, and they proved actually that there exists some critical strength A, A critical, depending on N, but not depending on W, such that the energy E is bound from below on the sphere of P L to equal one, if we are below the critical A. Critical A and the minimizer exists if the interaction A is strictly below the critical. And in the case if A is equal to the critical, there is a unique positive unconstrained solution of this equation, okay, with W equals zero. And excuse me. And the solution of this and it turns out that the L2 norm of phi bar is precisely the critical A. So this was the result for this law and way for the for the way for the for the special case critical case okay so when i uh thought about this i say why not look for uh because the schnitzer equation have more than one eigenstate so why not look for a system of system like this so so again we have a first guide w potential v and we we look for the first k eigenvalues of this Values of this and the V will be defined by some combination of the eigenstate, the lower eigenstate, the lower K eigenstate of the Schrödinger equation. So this is the and beta, beta i are the probability of occupation of the state. So the sum, they sum to one, they are non-negative, they sum to one. The sum to one and so the prescribing lambda j is part of the problem. So the solution of this problem will be find eigenvalue lambda j and eigenstate cj, which will satisfy this equation under this potential. So this makes sense to look at this. And but the problem is that if you look for a That if you look for, okay, so this is the critical, the exceptional case, alpha equal to n minus two for p, p equals two. This corresponds to the case that we saw before. We have a critical case for a. We expect to have a critical case for a, and this is the system, and this is the definition of the problem now with this alpha equal to. alpha equal to n minus 2 we have this kernel x minus 5 to the power minus 2 okay so well also in this case we can consider energy functional but now we minimize it over k orthogonal frame psi one to psi k if you so that the first result is that indeed if you Is that indeed if you have a minimizer of this on the set of orthogonal frame, then this is a solution for the multistake Schudiger Poisson and lambda one to lambda k are successive eigenvalues starting from the minimal lambda one. minimal lambda one and feature out a eigenstate. So this is quite natural, but the problem with this is that when we minimize over a set of frames, we lose the linear structure. We cannot take linear combination of frame and get the frame, of course. So I started to think about the dual formulation. In the dual formulation, we work the We work the state we consider is not the phi j but the potential itself. So the potential will be the variable. And we look for so in the case of k equal one, this is the standard Schrodinger Poisson. Turns out that the dual problem looks like this. We have, for the case alpha equal to alpha equal to Alpha equals two, alpha equal two, where this is the regular, the alpha equal to correspond to the Newton kernel, the classical Newton kernel. So in this case, the dual problem looks like this. This is the Richer integral and lambda one, what is lambda one? Lambda one is a functional, which is the first eigenvalue of this Schrodinger operator, the potential w minus av. W minus Av. So remember the W we assumed it's got to infinity. It means that this, on our end, this Schadge equation has a completely discrete spectrum. So all eigenvalues are eigenstate span the whole space. But the problem is what is the natural space for V? Turns out that we now can take We now can take the Bapolevi space H1 dot, which is the other function which has the L2 gradient, but does not necessarily L2 themselves, because you can see that the gravitational potential of finite density in Rnn bigger than equal to 3 is not in general in L2, but its gradient is. So this will be the natural space. And this is for the case k equal one. For k equal, for general k the dual formulation takes this form, where we instead of lambda one, we take as a functional the first k eigenvalue of v weighted by this beta. weighted by this beta j. Okay, so this all this is the case for alpha equal to. But what if in the case of alpha general? So in this case, we come back to the definition of the space V and we look for this inner product of alpha alpha over two, which is defined is defined in this way and a is some coefficient but in the case alpha equal to the limit of this turns out to be the regular inner product in h1 and we take this set of functions in a specific zero infinity and we close it with respect to to the norm induced by well that looks normal okay induced by this inner Okay, induced by this inner product and we get the space which we call h dot alpha over two and and then we replace the case alpha alpha equal to with the Dirac formula with this inner product and we consider this functional and And we look for try to attempt to find minimizer for this functionality. You find in where lambda one and lambda up to lambda k are the leading k eigenvalues of the Schrodinger operator. Okay, let me briefly show you why how the duality works. So, first, the connection between the Reach functional and the inner product alpha over two is by duality. And then we defined a functional or the pair of space of L2, phi, and v in the in the papers space h alpha to be dysfunctional. So we have an inner product with the Laplace and plus W phi, that's the L2 inner product. Was w you see that's the L to Eddie product, and then A times this expression. And it turns out that if we take the infrim of this on the all V in C0 infinity, we get the energy corresponding to the Schrodinger Poisson. But if we take it, if we take this H alpha, minimize. Take this H alpha, minimize it on the unit ball in L2, we get this functional. Fortunately, it doesn't work now. Oh, yeah, it does. So we get this functional. And what is this? This we can identify. This is the first eigenvalue of the Schottigal equation minus delta plus W minus A V. Okay, so this will be the case. So in the multi-level case, we can do the same thing and we get. We can do the same thing and we get this functional. Now, if we look at the second term there, the infimum of the sum, okay, we call it G beta alpha. We can prove that G beta alpha is indeed the sum of the lower eigenvalue coefficient beta. Lower eigenvalue coefficient beta j if beta j are all positive and of descending order. So this is the first step. In particular, this functional g is concave on the space h alpha over 2. And under this condition, Under this condition, it's really continuous and the minimum is obtained of this functional HWA is obtained at the eigenfunction phi of the Of the study operator. Okay. If you look for the Euler Lagrange equation, we see that this, we take the subgradient of the quadratic form, we get the function Laplacian, alpha over 2 acting on V. And if we take the supergradient of G, which is a concave function, we precisely get the combination. Precisely get the combination of the eigenstates. So, the Euder Lagrange equation, which is precisely, and if you remember that the Grease potential is the inverse of the functional Laplacian, we get precisely this connection between V, between V and the combination some beta J phi J square. I will the proof is a proof is interesting it's it's actually a generalization of the of the relish reach in the case k equal one it's obvious but for k general it have to be proved but i will i i think i will skip this proof even though it's pretty simple so the main theorem that i obtain is i general is the generalization of this result Is the generalization of this result that I showed before for a single component system? So, first, to prove that this function is bounded from below for any positive A, if we are in the dimension between 3 and 2 plus alpha. In the critical cases, n equals 3 and alpha equals 1, or n equals 4 and alpha equals 2, then these are the critical cases. There exists a critical... Are the critical cases? There exists a critical A independent of W such that this function is bounded from below if A is below critical and is unbounded if A is above critical. And in these cases, the function is also coercive and a minimizer exists. And then also so and this minimum is a solution of the Chokard equation induced by this minimizer W. by this minimizer w by this minimizer v v bound okay so this is the uh this is the the main result how much time is uh left now five minutes ah okay so i can say something about the proof so so how so what's the idea of the proof so we we we The proof. So we use two fundamental results. The first is lip theory and the OM that gives us the connection between the sum of the eigenvalues, ground eigenvalues of the Schrodinger operator, the potential V to the power gamma and this integral of V to the power n over 2 plus gamma, the positive part of V. And the second is the critical Sobolev inequality for functional space, which bound the 2n over n minus alpha norm of v with respect to the norm of the h alpha over 2. So, how we do it? First, we look at the definition of g remember g was. Definition of G. G was the combination of the eigenvalue beta j, lambda j. And we connect it with the, we use the Libtoringer inequality and the Holter inequality, and we obtain a bound from below by this integral, by the norm of The norm of the vector beta in the exponent gamma prime and this integral. The gamma is the given here, and gamma prime is a dual. So we join this together to get this inequality below, and then we use the critical solar inequality to get a lower bound. To get a lower bound, this is the lower line here, which I cannot show now, but so we get bound from below on G in terms of the inner product of V, alpha to inner product in this power, and some constant depending on A, some power of A. So if we add it to the energy functional, we get the lower bound like this. get the lower bound like this. So, and then we see easily the connection with the condition on A for to obtain the bound from below and also the coercivity. So it turns out that in the both in the critical case, either n equals three or n equals four and alpha equals equal four and alpha equal one and two correspondingly we see that the critical the bound from below if a is smaller than uh a distance so you so you see these two cases here somehow it doesn't work now so uh so the case of n equals three we have boundary in terms of the n infinity norm better and L infinity norm of beta and in case of n equals four we have a bound in terms of the l2 norm of beta so if it's a special case for example that all beta are equal to their k all beta equal to one over k so in this case we can see that the critical in the three-dimensional case the critical value is of order of k. Is of order of k so as we expect for k large, we can have a larger critical value which will allow prevent blow up. But if k in n equals 4, this is we have like the square root of k. So this is some application of this result. So this is the publication to appear. Publication to appear in the procedure of our society.
