Thanks very much for the opportunity to work here. The title of this talk is Jackson's Inequality on the United Sphere with Dimension-Free Constant. And this paper is a joint work with Professor Fenzai. Okay. This talk is divided into three parts. In introduction part, I will introduce In the introduction part, I will introduce you some motivations for this work and basic notations used in this paper and then introducing some main results and open problems. Okay, now let's start. A central problem in approximation theory is to characterize the best approximation of a function by polynomials or other classes. Or other classes of simple functions in terms of the smoothness of the function. And this is regarded as a quantitative study in approximation theorem. Jackson's inequality is one form to characterize this relation. It bounds the value of functions best approximation by polynomials in terms of modulus of smoothness. Here, we use modulus of smoothness. We use modulus of smoothness to characterize the smoothness of the function. And this work is originated by Jackson in 1911, where he discussed periodic functions on intervals and the modulus of smoothness was defined where was defined where forward differences for periodic functions in interval. But a main challenge for the unit sphere with d greater or equal to 2 is to define a modulus of smoothness that characterize the smoothness of function. Since multiplication on the higher dimensional sphere is on the higher dimensional sphere is not community. Another motivation for this work is that high dimensional study. Modern problems in approximation theory driven by applications in biology, medicine, and engineering have been formulated in very high dimensions. However, in classical study, they regard the dimension D as a constant. Dimension D as a constant in results and did not pay attention to the influence of dimension in results. Since it would cause a quirk of dimensionality as d goes to Holtz. Our work here partially overcomes the phenomenon quirk of dimensionality and has important applications in neural networks and artificial intelligence. Okay, now first let me introduce some First, let me introduce some basic notations in this work. Let Sd denotes a unit sphere of Euclidean space equipped with the surface lobes equipped with the normalized surface Lebesgue measure. And for P between 1 to infinity, L of C is the Lebesgue LP space on the unit sphere equipped with the standard L of C norm. normal. In the case of P to infinity, how infinity is a space of all continuous functions on the unit sphere equipped with the uniform normal denote by pi n d plus 1, the space of all real spherical polynomials of degree at most n on the unit sphere. As we know that pi n d As we know that pi n t plus 1 is a finite dimensional vector space, with its dimension could be written as here. And the reproducing kernel of the space is given by g n. Here, c k lambda is the gliggen-bohr polynomial of degree k. For p between 1 to infinity and every function. infinity and every function every L T function f we define E n F T as the minimum of all spherical polynomials of degree at most and f minus p norm. And this value is used to describe the best approximation of functions by polynomials. Now let me introduce some basic notations for modulus of smoothness on the for modulus of smoothness on the unit sphere. Let SO D plus 1 be the rotation group in Euclidean space. For each rotation matrix Q, we define the translation operator TQ by that TQ Fx equals to F composed with Qx for every F for every one fraction F. every L1 function F and X in S D. Giving a rotation matrix Q in SO D plus 1, we define the R order difference operator. 32R is defined from the L C space to L C and it's defined as a binomial extension of I minus I and TQ. Here I is an identity operator. Identity operator. By extend this, we could write it at this form. And let all partial D be the set of all rotations, be the subset of rotation group such that it makes the rotation, such that this it makes the rotation on the unit square rotation angle is less or equal to t. Decently introduced. Decently introduced the modulus of smallness defined via rotation group. It's defined as this form. Here, Q taking all the matrix in all partial T. And since as we all know that the geodesic distance of X and QX on the unit sphere could be written as R cosine X dot QX. So this modulus of smooth So this modulus of smoothness is considered as the most natural definition on the sphere by Callassin, Weirs, and Gigamut. However, the supremum over all partial T supremium over this set makes this modulus of smoothness is difficult to compute even for Compute, even for simple functions. This improved both the Jackson's inequality and its inverse inequality, and its matching inverse inequality. These two inequalities build connections of approximation by functions with smoothness of function. Well, Well, the dependence of degree of approximation on the number of dimensions was not taken into consideration in those works. Indeed, the constant CTR, both the constant, goes too exponentially fast as D goes to infinity. In this way, as the dimension D goes too huge, those two inequalities could not inequalities could not, for example, Jackson's inequality could not character, could not reflect the degree of approximation by polynomials. And the inverse Jackson's inverse inequality is the same. They could not reflect the approximation error with the smoothness of function. So this causal cause of dimensionality. In 1964, D.J. Newman and Shapiro proved that for every continuous function on the unit sphere, we have this kind of Jackson's inequality. Here, the constant C is independent of dimension. And the author also reads the question. Also, raised the question that whether a similar estimate with constant independent of the dimension d can be extended to higher order of modulus of smoothness. Note that here, this modulus of smoothness is one order of smoothness, but to higher order of modulus of smoothness, the authors remarked that the technique in this paper does not seem to yield such extension. such extension. In this paper, we extend TJ Newman and S.S. Sachel's work to arbitrary order modulus of smoothness on each L C functions on the initial sphere with P between 1 to infinity. We proved that for P between 1 to infinity and every positive integer R, there is a constant There is a constant CR depending only on R, absolute constant CR depending only on R, such that for every LP function f, this form of Jackson's inequality hold here Cr is absolute and independent of dimension D. So let me introduce our main result. To begin with, To begin with, we first introduce the modulus of smoothness defined in this paper. Given t greater than zero, we define the subset of rotation group O T with a class of all rotation rho is a rotation group taken as this form, rho as the composed of Q inverse, Hames and Q. M zeta and q for some q be the rotation be a rotation matrix and m zeta is of this form. Note that this m theta is a rotation in x1 x2 plane satisfy that m theta g power of m theta equals to mgzeta and we define the modulus half older modulus of smoothness in in this form. Note that this superimposition is taken over all Q or matrix Q in O T. It has the advantage that the difference delta Q R is essentially taken over on unit circle as the class O T consists of two-dimensional rotations on the plane O A. And we have that the modulus of smoothness the modulus of smoothness defined here omega r f t p is less or equal to the omega r star modulus of smoothness defined by decent zip and we note that um yeah decent zips um in decent zips definition the supermium taking over all subset q in all partial t and as we know partial t and as we know that each each rotation matrix or each matrix in rotation group could be written as A1 could be written as sorry be written as Q1 QK and each each QK is a metric could be written as could be written as AK M theta AK inwards and this M theta is it's a matrix defined in the R1 L2 plan that cosine set sensitive science set cosine set one one so the modulus of smoothness defined in our paper is in our paper is close to the modulus of sniff defined by DC but it's it's it's not equivalent it's not dimension free equivalent to the modulus of semotics defined by DC okay oh yeah as oh uh by extensive uh by extent the binomial extension of the by extend the binomial form of delta we could write the modulus of smoothness at this form oh at this form yes our modulus of smoothness is smaller than the modulus of smoothness defined by this um and the modulus of smoothness defined about have the following properties Following properties. Yes, those properties are easy to prove just from the classical study of modulus of smoothness. For the maturity inequality, that's a standard proof. We normally could get that the omega r f less or equal to say as t power r. The integration taken over t to infinity. t to infinity and the inside as same by the classical steps we could open that this and this similar as is independent of dimension d but combine this result with jackson's inequality that with dimension free concept we could that we could take this we could make the integr integration makes the integration interval from t to infinity to t to one yeah and note that the constant here is depend only on s independent of dimension t um now let's let me introduce our main result at p between one to infinity and the positive integer r there exists a constant cr depend only on r are dependent only on R, such that for all LP function f, this kind of Jackson's inequality hold, and it's e-world inequality also hold, both that CR are independent of dimension D. And okay, let me introduce some basic notations for k-functional defined in this paper. And this k-function, this kind of k-functional is functional is we it gets the idea from the paper written by Fen Dai Di Sen and Hen Wei Huang. Okay. First, let F be the R or be the R be the C R function R or it could be it has R derivative. Yeah. On the init sphere. It defines the R order derivative DQR. derivative dqr for the on the f by this form here taking the value at t p0 and define the rth order k function of f by this form here g so if you remember taking the g from all the functions in zr s d C R S D and yes and we have the those results that the modulus of smoothness is a dimension is equivalent to the k functional but and the equivalence is independent of dimension d that is that C R both the Cr and C R power negative is independent of dimension D Okay, now let me introduce some open problems. Yeah, those are open problems we are going to consider later. First, as we all know, that there are many types of modules of smoothness depending on the sphere. One that gets more attention is the model. Get more attention is the modulus of smoothness defined via rotation by order angles. It's defined as this form. Here, the Qijc is rotation by the angle T in the Xi and Xj plane, and it's originated such that the rotation from the vector EI to the vector EJ to be positive. This modulus of smoothness depends. things depend depend on the standard basis stand depend on the choice of standard basis even to e to plus one on the you on yeah depend on the standard basis but uh it doesn't depend on the order of uh of the basis for example yeah if we change the order the modular modulus of smoothness um is smoothness is the same as this. Note that we have the property that this modulus of smoothness is not rotation, is not rotation or environment. And since this modulus of smoothness, it could be reduced to the forward distance, to the forward differential. The to the forward differences in all our angles lived on the two-dimensional circles on the sphere. So, many of its properties could be deduced from the corresponding results for trigonometric functions of one variable. And this modulus of smoothness is closely related to the modulus of smoothness of So, Professor Fen Dai and Zhu Yan believe that it gives the most satisfactory solution of the characterization of the best approximation on the sphere. And this type of modulus of smoothness also be extended to the unit ball of the unit sphere. It also be extended to the unit ball of the unit sphere. unit sphere with with weight function w mu x as z with a weighted function and mu greater than negative one or two and the since analysis on the unit sphere is closely related to analysis on the unit since analysis on the unit ball is closely related to the Closely related to the analysis of the inet sphere. So, this modulus of smoothness, the most of the result of this modulus of smoothness could be extended to the init ball under the weight function. Now, let me introduce another modulus of smoothness on the inner sphere. It's defined via the operator T theta. T theta is of this form. T theta is of this form. Here, S S X orthogonal is a subset on the unit sphere that is orthogonal to X. For example, if this matrix is X on the unit sphere, then S X orthogonal it's this. it's uh it's the subset of unit spheres that is the that is orthogonal to all the to x and this this t set is a multiplier operator of Fourier series in spherical harmonic since the hence hence the proof of result about this modulus of smoothness. about this modulus of smoothness can since we can use methods from harmonic analysis to build proofs about the modulus of about this kind of modulus of smoothness but this modulus of smoothness is more hard to compute and difficult to follow since it's it's quite different from the modulus of smoothness defined defined in the classical sense such such as for like in the in the sense of forward difference so this modulus of smoothness is more difficult to follow actually between those three modulus of smoothness the modulus of smoothness defined where all our angle is the most easiest one to to compute this model The smooth ramps of smoothness is the most easiest one to compute. About the modulus of smoothness defect with those two forms. Complete studies have been built in modern rate dimension or cleaning space. But as dimension goes too hot, such as meanings, as large as Such as mediums, as large as medians, those could suffer from the course of dimensionality and could not could not express, could not describe the approximation error better. So, classical method could not be applicable in solving contemporary numerical problems, such as biology, medicine, neural network. Hence, new approaches are Hence, new approaches are imperative to overcoming these apparent challenges. That's why that analysis on high-dimensional domains has become a hot, rapidly developing error in mathematics. That's all for my talk. I'm sorry, it's a bit fast. If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to ask me. To ask me, okay, thank you very much for your talk. Thank you. Are there any questions, comments, remarks? Question. Could you show Jackson your Jackson inequality is constant five, as I remember? Are you speaking? Sorry. Sorry. Who is speaking? Dmitry Gorbachev. No, no, this D over N, as I remember, not D over 3. You mean, you mean here? Okay, let it be. No, 1.9. No, 1.9 probably. Inequality 1.9. Oh. 1.9. Oh, sorry. It's my problem. I oh, no, this is 1.9. Or Shapiro or Sharpiro inequality. Okay, 1.5. I'm sorry. Could you, first of all, could you give an upper estimate of constant C? Do you know some upper estimate? Oh, yes. Yeah, we could give a sharp estimate of this constant C. No, I mean, for example, can we? For example, can we put here five, for example, instead of C? Oh, I see. I calculate it. Yes. Yeah, we could give a sharp constant here. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Do you know? We could give a sharp constant, but I didn't put that. Yeah, I didn't. Yeah, we could give a sharp constant. Yeah. Further questions? Next question, let me. Could you show your result? Okay. My question: could you give an example of a function which Of function which gives reverse inequality in your result is, of course, less constant C. You mean to see? No, this result, for example, yeah. Could you provide an example of function f which gives reverse inequality? Oh, you mean like I mean, I mean, I would like to know: is it sharp or not? In, of course, some sense. I'm sorry, I didn't prepare this part, but yeah, if you are interested, I will calculate this later. But this modulus of smoothness is kind of difficult to compute. The supremum taking over all Supreme taking over all cube, but I will try to give you an example. Yeah, okay. Are there further questions from the Zoom audience or from the audience here? Okay, I have a question. Oh, yeah, please. If you would consider, I mean, you speak about the curse of dimensionality, which has a rigorous definition. You could watch, for instance, look for instance through the books of Eris Novak and Henrik Boshnikovsky. Henrik Bosniakowski. I am not, I do not actually did not see the reference, but nevertheless, they gave a rigorous definition. What is the curse of the imaginary? Because many people use that in a very sloppy way, say. And my question is: if you define a space, say a Lipschitz space on the sphere using your modulus of continuity, that would mean that you. That would mean that you define a function space saying that the supremum over one over step length times the modulus of continuity is finite, right? That would be a Lipschitz space on the sphere, probably. Sorry. I mean, you could use, say, if R is one, right? Then you could define a Lipschitz. Then you could define a Lipschitz space with the modulus of continuity, saying that collecting all the functions such that the supremum of one over n, say, of n times the modulus of continuity is finite. So if you then approximate such a Lipschitz space by these polynomials, you would get a rate. And this rate is one over dimension of the. Over dimension of the space to the one over t, I guess. This should be the rate. And here you have actually the curse of dimensionality. So this is my first comment. And my second comment is a question. If I would define function spaces as I just proposed, is there a relation to, say, Sobolev spaces on the sphere? Oh, Sobolev spaces. Oh, so there is this. So, so yeah, which you would define about Laplace Beltrami or the series representation via spherical harmonics. Would the Lipschitz space in your approach with this modulus of continuity would it relate somehow to Sobolev spaces? Oh, yeah, I know no problem. I don't know, probably. Are they comparable in a sense? Like on the real line? Okay, maybe I can test it with Fing Di. Some loop space, it has the smoothness properties right. Yes. I mean, my question is, is your modulus of continuity, does it fit to, for instance, Laplace Belt? For instance, Laplace Belchami operator, right? This is, yeah, that we were. I'm not an expert in this, it's just a question to understand that better. Okay, further questions? I mean, we have plenty of time. You did a very quick talk. So, here it's not the case in the Zoom audience. Okay. Okay, so thank you for your talk. Thank all of this morning session again. So, and we will meet again at 3 p.m.
