Here, which is replaced. So I want to talk about this subject, the joint work with Eric LeBron. And as a sequel of a previous paper we wrote without USAWA theory on derived deformation rates. It will be used, of course, here. So we start by notations and results. We count in two parts. Found in two parts, foundations and results, and ideas of truth. So, notations and results. So, it's a bit axiomatic. So, we consider a general reductive group, but of course, we assume many things which are satisfied for GLN, for many many of them. So, uh we take G uh split conni split connected connected inductive group. I believe we simply connected derived group because we don't want to use C groups, even we don't want to use L groups, just G hat. So with a simply connected right group We take a number field, F and G F is the dela group. We take a automorphic homological caspido automorphic representation on G or L F where we take a We take tier prime. Let's say the level is u zero of Dorothy N inside the finite adels, compact propane. So this is some sort of U A Horri at prime dividing n. So P is a prime, which is prime to n and at which pi is Pi is p ordinary. We take some p-added field, k sufficiently big, finite, of course, sufficiently big. So all the valuation ring by a uniformizing parameter as there is. So we first assume that there is a Galois representation. So assume that there exists rho pi from Galois. From the w to G hat for 4 satisfying, so associated to pi in the sense of what I think parameters and satisfying local long lens compatibility. So it's okay for G L N if F is totally real or C N by the work of many people. the work of many native people. So we consider the center and the co-center. So this is the largest speed torus inside, which is central, and the largest torus portion torus. And so if we take the dual group the pulse enter becomes Becomes the center of the dual. This is the dual map. And this is the cosenter of the dual, which is the dual of the center. So this is an isogeny. So the dysisogeny has degree DG of this isogeny. So for instance, for GLN, it's degree N. So we make many assumptions that we that I won't uh write explicitly on any of them and I call them category guarantee type assumptions for the field f and rho pi rho pi bar but actually it should be called strong category guarantee because for instance instead of assuming that the residual representation is irreducible we assume it is enormous as enormous It is enormous, has enormous image. For the P ordinarity, we assume distinguishedness at P, which is a very alkype technology, so there is no kissing blowing up involved. So everything will be very simply pro-representable. So we make these kinds of assumptions: minimality and so on. And among these assumptions, there is one which is Assumptions, there is one which is a bit boring, annoying, because it does not transpose to extensions. So, the vanishing of cohomology, so vanishing S, which tells you that the cohomology of the rotary symmetric space associated to the group G of A S of level, let's say, level U0N with some coefficients corresponding to this is. Corresponding, this is the cohort equal weight of pi when you localize at the maximal ideal associated to pi and p is zero if i is not in the Orange-Wallach interval Q minimal, Q maximal, Q minimal, Q supremum, and you this depends very much on F okay and uh the length as you know is uh the And uh the length, as you know, is uh the Harish Chandra defect. So the difference Qs minus Qm is the Harish Chandra defect which depends on F, uh Harris Chandra defect for the group G of F cancer R. It can be given explicitly for G Ln, but this depends on the field F. So we will need to change the field F, then Need to change the field F, then we will need to assume vanishing for the extensions because it does not follow from this assumption in fortunation. Although all the other assumptions we will make here will be preserved by the timing and ZP extension. So So we consider deformation from Earth. The area, this map I denote by mu. And that's exactly the map introduced by Victor yesterday called Phi. It will play a role here. row here because we will fix we will fix our deformation in the deformation problem so we consider d and d nu so these are functors from the category of artin co-algebras which map to f to the category of sets and we consider the minimal so n minimal p ordinary deformations so n minimal p ordinary deformations Deformations of rho bar, rho pi bar, which is assumed to be minimal and pure. So, and this one means that, so this is d and d nu is the same plus, same plus you impose that mu composed with rho is equal to mu composed with rho power. For instance, you fix the determinant for GRN. So we can introduce, as in Vita's talk, some ring of... So they are pro-representable by pro-Artinian rings R and R nu. And these rings are Nitherbian. Natharbian rings pro-representing these functors. Netherbian pro-representing. Representing D and D. And you can also consider the deformation problem of new compose with rho pi bar. So you can consider the deformation ring for new, so this is for rho bar, rho pi bar. Here it's for new composed with rho pi bar. And this ring, as in beta's top, is a O double bracket class group, so right class group of conductor N P d. class group of conductor N P to the infinity take the P C law and take the complete group ring. So it's a nice L C I locally complete intersection ring and it maps to R and of course it has a specific point which is given by the universal property associated by a unique By considering nu composed with rho pi. So you have such a morphism, let's call it psi pi, given by this deformation, this explicit deformation of nu composed with rho pi one. So there is a kernel which is an ideal, J nu, and R nu is nothing but R divided by J nu R. So we can also consider a point of R given by rho pi, which factors actually through R nu. So we call it phi pi. This this one also is not but phi pi. Defined by phi pi, maybe not so good, but so this is the point given by the existence of rho pi, which is a deformation. So rho pi belongs to D of o and also to d d of others. Okay, so these are the objects for the classical setting, and so for the derived setting we have D simplicial and d simplicial mu. And D simplicial, which are functors from the category of a simplicial Arcanian rings receiving O and mapping to F, to the category of simplicial sets, which I don't recall because it takes forever. And with the conditions Caligari Garity, they are pro-representable by rings, by synthetic rings, so pro-Artemian. rings so pro-Artinian simplicial rings simply shell pro-Artenian rings pro simplicial artinian rings or algebra whose pi zero are the classical ones So the problem in this setting is that these rings are not unique, they are unique up to weak equivalence, because the notion of pro-representability is only that the S, so the you have a notion of homomorphisms between simplicial rings, but you have also a simplicial enriched version of the homes. Of the homes. So this becomes a simplicial set, and the pro-representability means that there is a morphism of functor from this to the functor D, and this is a weak equivalence, but that's not unique. So the ring R is not universal. There exists a weak equivalence. This is the meaning of pro-representability. So here it's a simple algebra. Algebra homomorphism. So that's a little different, it's not universal. Weak equivalence means that if you take all the fundamental groups of these two simple sets, it becomes an isomorphism for all j's. So now we want to study the variation in any ZP extension of these objects, these rings and these derived rings. So we consider a ZP extension. We consider the gathering of the colours. We consider the Gala root, which is of course isomorphic to Zp. We will need to fix a topological generator and we should introduce the Ewasa-1 algebra for this extension. So we start by stating some results about the classical case. So for that, we consider the restriction of rho pi to GFN and as I said the category parity assumptions over F transpose to Fnemas except for category guarantee for F. So category guarantee for F implies category guarantee for Fn, except the vanishing uh cohomology assumption that we have to make. So we have to add to this assumption, we have to add vanishing for all fn's for all n's. So we make these assumptions. We add these assumptions. Oh by the way, for Fn the Harvest Chandra defect for Fn is nothing but L0 times T to the N. Important for us. Okay, so because of our assumptions, we can consider Assumptions: We can consider corresponding deformation rings, and if we want, we can consider also the deformation rings for new composed with rho pi n. So, this is for rho pi n bar and this is for new composed with rho pi n bar. So, this is also a ray. So, this is also a Ray class group, but over Fn, so it's much bigger. And of course, we have a map like this, and there is an ideal, always the same, given by psi pi, same psi pi, and we have that this is the quotient of this by this idea. Be zero. Yeah, yeah, for G L two of totally real, L0 is zero. Yeah, but now if I adjoin some B foods of unity, say like third B rules of unity, I'll get a quadratic imaging field. So how can this formula hold? I'm saying that I don't understand. Okay, so if you look at your formula, L0 at n is equal to L 0 times P n. If L 0 is 0, so I'm saying that L 0 at N is equal to 0 for all n. That's true. You're taking the totally real the totally but i it can be complex because otherwise too maybe you have to simply like yours for GL2 extension of the ZP style expression? Yes. But but at the beginning you were getting that was out to the number field, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, the same number. Ah, yeah. So these are Netherian rings. They are bigger and bigger. And we have restriction maps which map Rfn plus 1 to RFN. To RFN and say, maybe I put a dot, which means empty, nothing, or new, because it's exactly the same. So we can... And these rings carry an action of Galois. So this is compatible. So this is Galois Sn plus 1 over S equivalent. This is the restriction. And so we take the inverse limit. So R. The inverse limit, so R u was our, and also mu, if you like, inverse limit of this R Fn. So they carry, so now we have to be a little careful. There is an action of gamma by algebra automorphisms on these rings continuous, but there is a big difference between E was. There is a big difference between Iwasawa's theory and Hida's theory, namely that in Hida theory you have a gamma, gamma Hida, which maps into R Hida cross. You have a character, so this becomes a gamma H algebra. Here it is not a gamma, so this is not a lambda algebra, this is just a lambda module, okay? R. Lambda module, okay? R. I. Was our dot is a lambda module, compact, compact lambda module, but not a lambda algebra. That's the difference with FIDA theory. But that's important. Hello, there. Thus, we can prove an analog of GDAR control theory, the theorem, which is just an EWASA control, except that, so we make the proposition, because it's not that, right? All the results are by both of us. So if P is larger than DG, the degree of the isogeny we have, then for any N, we have an. Then, for any n, you have a nice design. So, except you have to be a little careful. But here, you need to put the new. Okay, so that's why I introduced the new at the beginning. Here, you cannot remove that. So, you try to descent, so you try to divide by gamma p u d n minus 1 r u was our mu. But as I said, this is not an ideal. That's the difference with FIBA theory. So, if you want to make FIDA theory. So, if you want to make it an ideal, you have to multiply on the left by R USRU, then you divide by an ideal, and then it's isomorphic to RFMU product, we prove. And actually, it's a generalization of the result by Hidar, who treated the case he had F totally real, but that was not necessary. F totally real, G for G L two. G for G are two, and so DG was just two, and mu was the first determinant. But we just follow his proof, it's very similar. So, are we assuming that this CP extension is coming CP extension or any any ZP extension? Yeah, yeah. Well, totally ramified. I mean, I tell split because otherwise, yeah, there is. Because otherwise, yeah, there is a slight discrepancy at the beginning. Yeah, it has to be totally ramified. Sorry, what does totally verbify mean? Sorry? What does totally verbify mean for chip? So the the the first layer is uh has in ramification index P from the beginning. It could be it could start So the next result is a kind of conditional we need weak Leopold conjecture We need weak Leopold conjecture that I will recall and plus vanishing of two new USA new invariants vanishing of two USAR new invariants. So we assume, of course. So we assume, of course, Caribbean derivative plus vanishing and so on. We assume also an assumption that I call totally indecomposable. So weakly conjecture plus mu of x torsion equals mu of x star torsion equals zero. Then if L zero of f is equal to zero and if r e was someone And if R I wasawa nu is Netherian, I forgot to say that it's not clear that R I Wasawa and R I Wasawa Nu are Netherian. They are inverse limits of Netherian rings, but does not imply that these rings are Netherian. So you need to assume that. Then R U as I U is formally smooth. Of course, R will be the dimension of some tangent space, which happens to be finite-dimensional. So, what is Wi-C Leopold? So, weopol the be a finite free bob. Finite free module with geometric action in the sense of laser, a frontal laser of Gf then we clopol this dot H two of galoa F T transfer k over O. Transfer k over O is zero. This is quickly operated. And the Ewasawa modules we consider are x equal the h1 s infinity uh t cancer k over o. So for us t will be in the sequel um g hat with the adjoint action. With the adjoint action, in other words, add oh sorry, g hat prime, so the derived the algebra, which is add 0 rho prime. Sorry? H? F infinity inside H2? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and uh so uh dual and dual and the x star will be h1 of f infinity maybe I write t d this is the take dual so t d so you see at zero rho pi is the Lie algebra so G hat is the Lie algebra over of G hat over O and so it can be written as Z G plus sorry Z G hat plus G prime Prime because we assume V is V greater than Dg and so this is this thing and this one is the tech dual, so T star of one so they are known to be uh lambda of uh finitely generated over lambda, and we are talking about the torsion submodule. Are we talking about the torsion submodule? So we are talking about the new invariants of the torsion submodules. And actually, this theorem is nice, but it's a rather direct generalization of a nice theorem by Burungali and Closel, who treated a special case. So here it's for general groups. General groups. So we have to introduce a general notion of this, but they have this notion just for GL2. Buring a leap proved this for so without Wik Leopold. But of course this is because they they they used a special case where Wikiopold is proven actually by Patrick Allen uh for F totally real. Totally real GL2 and weight 222. So Hilbert of weight 222. In that case, you don't need EPUB. Buy your paper at Duke, 2016. But actually, their proof is rather robust. If you analyze it, you can generalize it. So that's what we did. And we keep, of course, to the assumption because we cannot prove it. So, yeah, so we prove this and we suspect that if L0F is not we suspect Suspect that R E was our view is not even locally competitive is not locally complete intersection. And basically conditionally I will explain that. Under some assumptions we can And there's some assumptions we can prove it is not. Are the salmoning to be non-theory? I would say yes. I would say that this ring should be the third one, yeah. But I don't prove it, so it's just a feeling. There is a criterion in one of one book by Hilar, but it's a very soft. but it's a very some some uh some seminal group should be finite guess what the number r might be yeah i don't remember but it's a tangent space of a yeah i forgot to say that uh r ewasawa is a deformation ring it is the deformation ring of the restriction to f infinity yeah so I guess. So the local comp is saying, this is the local version of this um I in the local version it is not the variant or is it? Oh, I was asking this question. I don't know. No. Yeah? Just I mean it's just a random sort of random, but like you wouldn't get any behavior if you went up like an anticipator of how like this Ethereum is for this Ethereum question. Like if you went up in anticipum with tau, Like if you element's equal with tau, would you possibly get like so you you think it is not uh I don't know I mean uh no I never studied these objects it's just uh that if it's just an if yeah I know for instance the ring S is absolutely not an Ethereum basically we have S. Netherian. Basically, you have S E was aware. You can define it as the limit of the SFN. You have an action on R E was aware. This is absolutely not Netherian, that's for sure. But I don't say this is flat over this ring. From Zoom, I have this board. We used to say it's not LCI. What do you mean by that? So the rubric is derived. So when you say LCI, So when you say L C I, do you mean like in the derived sense or? These are not derived rings for the moment. On the left quarter. So this is not derived also. So this one is derived if you like because this one is locally complete intersection. Yeah, no, the R, was that way? You're not considering that as a reference? I don't understand. So he's asking if this R. So he's asking if this R is the curly R or the No, no, for the moment we are in the classical case. No, this is section, classical, classical case section. Alright. So now we go to the gerived case case. So under again category derivative for F plus vanishing for the FNs, Veneca, or slightly more general case, my student Di Chang Tsai proved that. Prove that DSFN, so D F N D F N S and the D F N mu S are pro-representable by poetine and syntaxial rings. So we have We have R uh Snow or a dot. So the problem is to define an action and they are maps from Rfn plus one, again by restriction to Rfn. They are not unique. RSL, they are not unique, but they exist. And you can define something. Well, maybe it's better to call it polling. You can take an inverse unit and we can define this pro-Artinian ring. Again, it's a pro-Artinian ring. This is already a pro-Artinian ring, so it's a double-projective unit. The problem is that it's not easy to define the Galois. That it's not easy to define the Galois action here because these rings are not unique. Okay, so we found a way out by using another description of these rings, which is a theorem of Galaxy-Husslen-Kadesh plus HM Psi. Namely, you can choose, because this is defined up to weak equivalent, this is weakly equivalent to a ring that you can define by using. But you can define by using Taylor-Weil systems. So, this is a derived transfer product. This is a classical deformation ring associated, constructed by patching using a Taylor-Wise system. But so, what you do is to choose Taylor Wise systems over FL, which are above Taylor-Wise systems. Above telewise systems over F. So you prove that there exists a TerraWire system, admissible TerraWire system, don't have time over F where all the primes in these sets are totally decomposed in Fn and such that if you take those primes above those here, this is an admissible. Here, this is an admissible televised set over Sn. Then you take the argument, you take the patching argument, and this object carries naturally a gamma action. So, this is our choice of this ring. Okay, if you put a new, you have to put a new everywhere. You can do that. So, we define the the deformation ring. The deformation radio, like this, and this one carries an action of gamma. It's a level. So we have an action of gamma on this, if you choose these rings, this carries an action of gamma. And so, unfortunately, we didn't succeed in establishing the analogue of the desant. RE was our new. R e was our mu divided by R e was our mu gamma P to the N minus 1. R equals our mu maps to R L s mu. We cannot prove this is a weak equivalence. So if you go to the higher homotopy groups, all the homotopy groups, we don't prove the descent for the homotopy groups. The homotopy groups of this R ewas are 1. Of course, except the pi 0. Pi 0 of R e 1, I forgot to say that R 0 of R e 1 nu is R e 1 nu. So of course the base hunt works for this one by the theorem I stated before. But for the higher ones, pi j we don't know if the base ant works. On the other hand, we will prove something about the pi one. Something about the pi one. We will say something about the pi one as lambda module using so we will say something about this this this is a so this is this uh R I was our Inu module and a lambda module or maybe I'll yeah. Or maybe module and a lambda module. But these two structures are completely different, as I said, because this is not a lambda algebra. But it's true. So we will say something about this lambda module by using actually a tool that we introduced in the previous paper, which is so-called the Galaxy's Veneger Homo Morphism. That's the name we get to this homomorphism. This homomorphism. So the result is the following. What's the role of description of this drag and so this? Well, you want a simplicial ring. So this is classical, this is classical. If you take a tensor product, it's a classical ring. But this one is a simplicial ring. The definition is that you replace this ring by a so-called cofibrant replacement. My question is: I mean, you just defined this derivative of mentioning as just inverse elevator. But what's the advantage of having? Yeah, but inverse limit of things which were not unique. So now what I told you is that what we choose is this one. Then we have a nice projective system plus gamma action. Can I ask another question about this quotient? Do you mean to take some kind of portion? Or do you really mean like form a level-wise ideal? His question was, is this tensor product a homotopy? Oh, sorry, the dissenter. In the dissent statement. So there's this like descent theorem or control theorem, right? Where you push in it by. So, I mean. By so, I mean, are you trying to common-opic quotient or just like a kind of simplicial quotient? Simplicial. It was a simplicial quotient for the rings, but here, yeah, okay, here, here what I mean is that we don't know the following result, pi j of r inverse r modulo just gamma p to the n minus 1 pi j. Minus one pi j is pi j or is related, closely related to pi j R s n. So this is what I would like to have and that's we don't know. So here it's just a quotient. This is just a here it's a lambda module, okay. So this makes sense, but that we don't know. So the second theorem, this conditional. So we have everything that we said here. So I state the theorem, then I have to explain the notions. We will relate the Taiwan of Arii Wasawa to a cellular group and the Group and the co-kernel will be a tedge of a revitch group. And so which I deduct like this. So the theorem too is that if this is a control lambda module, then then I want R d was a one or R to our O is a lambda module of long L0. So, what is pi 1 R e wasawa O? This is just the inverse limit of pi 1 R F N which is which is Which is a module of the classical deformation ring RFM, which is the pi zero. So this acts here. So we take the quotient by the universal homomorphism given by rho pi nu. So phi pi nu, phi pi n is the homomorphism from Rfn to Po given by the Foucault given by the existence of rho pi n. Universal homomorphism given by the existence of this representation. We take the limit of n and we call this pi 1 r equal to. So if this is big, of course pi 1 r easel is still bigger. So you see that if l0 is not 0, this pi 1 is not 0. And implies that implies that the pi one R E wasa one nu is not zero and it implies that the classical R E wasa one nu cannot be locally intersection because otherwise it would be autopically discrete. So that's the negative result we have. But we need an assumption about the control of SHA. The only result about control of SHA that I know is due to Greenberg in the case of Is due to Greenberg in the case of elliptic curves and there are some assumptions, but so it's it's a natural assumption, but uh it's not uh far from being proved. It's proven only in some cases for elliptic curves all number fields, assuming that page 5-bit group is finite. So the bottom line So, I have to explain a little bit the notations of the power. Yeah, okay, so this was part one. So in the ideas of proof, I will explain the notations. So ideas of proof. So there are theorem one and theorem two. So in both So, in both groups, the key ingredient is semi-roots. So, here well, here we will need to study T. Will need to study T or T dual. So T is the adjoint rho pi. It's a finite free, so this is the derived D algebra with adjoint action. And T D is the tele dual. So we will need to study these self groups over various with various modules as coefficients. So A can be So A can be can be F, can be O, can be O, so something we call A M, which is a O modulo pi to the M. But we view this also as pi to the minus M over O, which means that here it's a ring, here it's a module, but these rings form a projective system, these modules form an inductive system. So we will apply So we will apply a study of SEMR to these cases. So for theorem one, we need only the case F. Enough to study this Selma group. So when I say Selmer, it's the Greenberg Selma group in the ordinary case. So maybe I recall the definition. So the Selmer groups we are considering are only Greenberg Selma groups. So you need a filtration on the modules and at P stable at places dividing P and you need to consider selling of a number field or maybe again the limit, inductive limit possibly, of a G. Concept A is defined as the kernel of the corner G. The cohort of G uh for T, let's say with values in some V not dividing P of H1 L V times array of a H1 n ramified plus for V dividing P, H one of L V T cancel A divided by M V. And what is M V? And what is M V? M V is the image. Maybe it's called H1 ordinary local. H1 ordinary MV. So what is H1 ordinary for us? So let's take T. Because otherwise if you take the dual, the filtration is not the same. So we take uh G hat, divide. So what is the definition of this H0 L V? This is an image of something. Of something into H1 and T. And what is this something? Something is cocycles, so co-cycles which fall in the in a summer. So the filtration we consider here is We consider here is the Borel algebra algebra and the unipotent radical of this Borel. So what is this? This is not of course the derived Borel. That wouldn't be very interesting. This is the intersection of the Borel algebra with G hat 1. So it's a Borel of the Derived B algebra. So this is the filtration. The algebra. So, this is the filtration we consider, and so Mv is the co-cycles which fall in this sub. And when you restrict to inertia, they are trivial modulo unipoton radicals, which means they fall in the unipoton form. And so that's the retron ordinary. Okay, and A can be any of these motor. A can be any of these modules. These are all modules. Sometimes they are rings, sometimes they are not rings. Doesn't matter. So that's the notion of the Greenberg cell group that we consider. And so we consider them over F and over Fn. And so I said that in the first theorem, we needed an assumption called We needed an assumption called total indecomposability. That's an interesting assumption, so maybe I explain this assumption. So if you assume that V divides P by ordinary T, we know that rho pi bar of the local Galois group falls in the orl over F, which can be decomposed as the tallest semi-direct product with the unipotent. Semi-direct product with the unipotent radical. And so, because the orders are relatively prime, the image can also be decomposed as a semi-direct product of the toric part and the unipotent part. And now you take this unipotent part and you l and you view it modulo n square. Which means, well, okay. Which means, well, okay, and so you take I unipotent inside, you take the image inside n hat modulo n hat square and you assume that it is, so as you know, this is an additive group of some dimension, F to VR, and you assume that, so the image should contain, so the image maps contains this image. This image contains a direct sum of FP lines for GL3, that's it. So what is this? It's given by three characters, if you like. And here you have things. So you must have Fp times Fp contained in this part. This is n module n squared. This is n modulo n square, so this you neglect. So this is n modulo n square. So total indecomposability is that these are independently non-zero. And that's an assumption which is also crucial in a Bohr-Galle closer. And if we generalize their assumption, their assumption is just that there is something non-trivial in GL2. Non-trivial, that's all. But if we generalize this way, But if we generalize this way, oh, which way is it? So, in this previous work with Hélique Courmont, we defined a generalization, if you want, of a colour map going from, so if you want, this place the road. So, if you want, this plays the role of a model value group. So, here we take K L to be O to the N or I to the minus M over O. We define a map instead of Kumar, we call it Galaxy's and Gatash to the same group. So, I take F or F n or any N to T. Uh to T dual tensor A M I can say a word about the construction. The Ponti Lagin dual of this is nothing but the homomorphisms from the simplicial ring Rfn to the simplicial Artinian ring AM plus AM placed in degree 1 and square. Placed in degree 1 and square 0. So it's a dual number but placed in degree 1. So the dual of this is that. That's just the formalism of the derived deformation rings. And you have a map which is take the pi 1 between take the pi 1. And so you get the map from home of pi 1 of RFN to the pi 1 of the Rfn to the pi one of this simplific, which is nothing but a n, this a n, see? And actually, this is Rfnginer. And so you re-dualize and you get this map. And our result in the previous paper is that this is surjective. So this is injective. And so you have a co-kernel that we call SHA. SHA of this. And this co-kernel has a nice property that it's finite, that we know. Because of the Caligari gravity assumption, we know that this is finite. Because we have a theorem R equal T and T gives the finiteness as usual because it's a finite O algebra. So it's finite and its cardinality is the same. The cardinality. The cardinality of this sha m is the same as the cardinality of the thermo group of T over Fn of T cancer A n. And the difference is that these are bounded by the following cardinality, cardinality of Selmer Fn T times K over O, which is known to be finite again. Known to be finite again by Caligari-Girauthi. I'm sorry, this was finite, that was obvious. But these things are finite. This thing is finite, that's not obvious. So this means the cardinalities are bounded. So this is our exact sequence. So what we do is we take either inductive limits or projective limits twice over M and over N. And other n. And that's the sequence which creates the objects we need to study. So basically, the objects we are really interested in is to take the double inverse limit. Double inverse limit gives you 0, goes to precisely what we want, namely pi 1 R e wasawa o goes to Goes to the inverse limit for the corestrictions of these things. Sorry, for the restriction map. So, restriction maps. Projective limit is for just a signal. So the core restriction maps. And of course, for the projective system of rings. And so we get something I denote by L, and here something I denote by SHA hat. So this is the limit. So this is the limit over n and m of this sha s n m and so this one is the limit for the core restrictions of the semi-groups over F n coefficient in A n. So we want to study this. We want to study this. We will need to assume that this is well controlled. And if it is well controlled, you see, it implies that this lambda module is torsion. Because all these things are finite. All these things are, even if you go to K over law, so control means that if you divide by gamma P medium minus one sharp, you get up to five, sorry, up to finite kernel and pro kernel. two finite kernel and pro kernel you get shar f n o so t t d t d is just console o these are finite by Caligary gravity and so this will be torsion so if you have this control you get Shahad torsion over lambda now Iwasawa theory will allow Now Iwasawa theory will allow us to study n not directly but essentially and therefore we will prove that n has rank L0 so this will have rank L0 too. But it happens that it's not easy to study directly this lambda module. What you need to do is to study the double inductive limit. Gladialize of course so double inductive limit will be C Limit will be zero, goes to the direct limit of these things, which one too right, maybe. As a marker, such something like pi one r f infinity, just taking the direct limit, and so k over o, goes to semar f infinity. Selmer at infinity T D tensor K over rho. So it's yeah, it's nice. So it's not bad. Now it goes to the direct limit, SHA of F infinity, Td tensor, K over O. And this module is a discrete gamma module for which the For which the control is not hard. So that's exactly what we do. So we consider the dual, the dual of this cell model, cell model of F infinity, G D tensor K over O country again dual. And that one is control. That's not hard at all. Proposition n star over gamma to d n minus 1 n star is the same as dual of semal fn g g cancel k over 4 dual. Wh well when I say this, it's a When I say this, it's up to bounded wrong so bounded corrunc, or bounded wrong, sorry, bounded or rank modules. On the other hand, something I didn't say about our exact sequence under the category guarantee assumptions is that We know the rank or the coronc over O of the modules. So, you know, for instance, let's consider this sequence. Pi 1 R Fn tensor K over O goes to Selma. Fn T D tensor K over O goes to sharp. Same. We know. We know the colon of this module. So this one has corrupt the L0, the L0 of Fn. Coronc equals L0 of Fn, which is P to the N times L0. This also, we prove by Proitates and the Calibri Libraries again, that this has the same colon. Colon equal L0 of Fn equal L0 P to the N. So of course here it's 0, p to the n. So, of course, here it's divisible, but this one may not be divisible, and that's the defect. So, that's the finite part. This is finite between this module of colon L0P to the N and this submodule divisible of colon L0P to the N. So, knowing that, knowing this, we conclude that N stag, so the run over N So the lump over lambda of L star is L0. Now, unfortunately, see, it's not because the rank of the dual of this is L0 that the same happens here. We need to know something about that. And that's the assumption of control of SHA. So if we know that SHA-HAT is controlled, therefore torsion, then Motion, then this thing. Oh, okay. So we know that this one has rank L0 over lambda. Now we use a remark due to Bernadette de Marieux, namely that N, which was defined by this inverse limit exact sequence, is home of N star. of n star lambda over lambda where n star is defined by ponry again dual of direct limits okay this one is defined as pontriagin dual of direct limit this one is defined as projective limit nevertheless they are related there are some assumptions in the parameter but they are satisfied by our ordinarily and maybe distinguishedness condition so we have that so we know that n is also of rank l0 and so Also of rank L0, and so that's where the control occurs. We know that this one has rank L0. If this is portion, then this has rank L0. So we need this assumption, which is a bit maybe it's not true, who knows? But not sure. Yeah, so if it's true, then we conclude that this thing will have long L zero. Will have long L0. I put a log of a lambda equal L0 question mark depends on this control result. Well, control question mark. And so of course, if, as I said, if this is true and L0 is not 0, then pi 1 R E was our or so if L 0 strictly positive and sharp control. And sharp control by one R d was our certainly non-zero. And from this, you deduce by dividing by our ideal g u. So g u is the ideal of S we were to go. This is contained in pi 1 r e was the one u. Therefore, this is not zero and therefore r e was 1 u cannot be L C n. Of course it's very conditional, I agree. So it's just that uh may maybe that Maybe that the result uh of gruing a repository does not work is not is not true if L0 is strictly positive. I mean even if the ring is not a real, which we don't know. Was it clear that the Galois action on early R was independent of any wild system like it showed? Okay. No, but it gives an action and the fact that it exists is already a non-trivial lemma. You have to do a lemma about different TL systems. Barry, go ahead and ask. We can hear you. What? We can hear you if you want to ask your question. Okay, the natural question to ask is what about the higher pi, higher homotopy groups? I mean, if pi 1 looks like it's got rank or co-rank L0, you might imagine that there's an exterior algebra. And that there's an exterior out about that. These vanishing conditions, they tell you that the interval on which the cohomology does not vanish grows to infinity when n grows. And as you know, because of Calgary derivative theorem, this means that the Ii's of RFN. Of Rfn are non-zero for I going to zero up to L0 P to the N. So if n grows to infinity, there could be all of them non-zero, and so you don't see how the exterior algebra would fit in the I mean I mean uh everything is conditional anyway. But uh it would be that all the pi i's are non-zero. By eyes are non-zero. And there is no obstruction to that, of course. Thanks. Beautiful lecture, by the way. But referring to this last point, I mean, pi length and being non-zero doesn't really imply that pi zero is not L C I, right? But you're saying that L C I or it would have the wrong dimension or something like that. I think he was saying that high one being non-zero.
