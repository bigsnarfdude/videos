With Professor Pattenfus. And it's about a numerical approach to describe the alignment of short fibers in fluids, in flows. So before we start with content, I want to outline what I will present today. Basically, we'll have an introduction explaining what the problem is and why we want to do a research about it. Why we want to do a research about it, presenting then the most important quantity we deal with, that is the alignment tensor and where it comes from. Then I'll give an overview of the numerical background, the methods we use, and then introduce the method we applied and its features. We are then at the end. We have a conclusion and then an attachment that hopefully I can use to answer your questions. Answer your questions. So, let's start with the introduction. So, what's the motivation? And we have very often materials that are reinforced with short fibers. What do I mean with short? So short that they are not deformed by the flow. That is the meaning of short. And what is interesting is that, for example, with concrete, in the moment where we use the fiber-reinforced material, once it The material once it hardens, the mechanical properties of this material are strongly influenced by the orientation of these fibers. We have a case of anisotropy, and the anisotropy and the degree of anisotropy is determined by the way the injection modeling process is done. So, we want a model to be able to describe this orientation. Now, the effect is that there are different models to describe that. And the great question is, what model may be the best one? What model may be the best one? And indeed, there is no open source tool to do simulation. And, for example, in the institute of Professor Papen, which is the one I worked in, there is a strong theoretical background. And there were many models that we consider possible and be better than the one used today, but we had no mean to test them. So this is the idea of creating also a tool, an open source method to try different anzets for realignment. For realignment. So, here you see an example of steel fiber and force concrete, and indeed that is very often used. So, first of all, let's explain what the alignment tensor is about. So, the basic problem is, well, the theory for the alignment of short fibers comes basically from the theory for liquid crystals. And we start, we use a statistical approach, which means. We use a statistical approach, which means liquid crystals, for example, we describe them as elongated particles and give them and describe them through a vector, a macroscopic director. This macroscopic director has the problem that it is on a mesoscopic scale. It can't hence be dealt with with the usual continuum mechanical models since it's in a scale that is smaller. So the problem is how can we get a model describing as a vector Model describing as a vector the particle to an upgraded scale? The answer is a statistical approach, and we will see that this applies also to fibers where we have problem and we describe the orientation of these fibers in the fluid through a probability distribution function. This probability distribution function depends from the microdirector n, hence n from the place, so x and t, the macroscopical quantities. The macroscopical quantities. And since it depends also from this mesoscopic quantity n, we can do an expansion of it. The expansion is of a type similar to a Legendre polynomial, where the basics are given by dyadic products of the microdyscopic director. The half means simply that it's traceless because the traceless formulation has certain advantages. So, in this Legendre polynomial, kind of Legendre polynomial, we have constant coefficients. Constant in the sense that Constant in the sense they do not depend from the mesoscopic variable n, but they do depend on the x, so on the place, and on the time. Hence, we can say the more these different coefficients that are tensor of different order deviate from the zero tensor, the more we have anisotropy. We have a measure of anisotropy describing the alignment, but depending on microscopical quantities. Ponyum macroscopical quantities x and t. So, however, we have still the problem that the coefficients are tensor of arbitrary order and very much of them. However, being an expansion of the one we use for the probability distribution function, we can truncate it. We truncate at the second order tensor. Second order tensor are easy to deal with. Also, for a person not working in continuum mechanics, we can describe, we can call them matrices. They are not the same, that we can do as. Hence, we can do a spectral decomposition. And then we have. Decomposition, and then we have the probability distribution function being a function of the direction n, and then of eigenvectors and eigenvalue. Now, this was very much theoretical, and here exactly that I forgot that I outlined the parts, but I excuse myself. Yeah, I want to show it through an example. I think that makes the things very much clearer. Here we have an example, the classical, we have here planar flow, so we are in two dimensions. We have the velocity through. We have the velocity profile for a quad flow, and we have and we computed the corresponding alignment. The corresponding alignment tensor of second order, we divided in eigenvectors and eigenvalues. And you see there are the two eigenvalues to the corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvalues have opposite sign. So what does this mean? What does this orientation mean? Now let's insert. We can insert. Now let's insert, we can insert the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors in the probability distribution function, and we get basically this probability distribution function is on a unit sphere. So we get a probability distribution, for example, in a point x of my continuum mechanical domain, if we are in two dimension, I can then say, once I have the alignment tensor, the probability that the direction taken in a quad flow or being that the particles takes this direction is much higher than this one. Is much higher than this one. Now I showed already an example that was in two-dimensional and two-dimensional are easier to handle, especially if you want to program. I mean, in the sense that you can try faster, you have less computational effort. The question is, is it allowed, is it make it sense to do this assumption that the alignment in a planar flow is really also planar? So it seems to make sense, although we looked at the analytical solution, there is additional couplings that occurs. Additional couplings that occur. However, you see that the three-dimensional assimilation is a result that is very similar to the one to Planner. Basically, the eigenvectors are orthogonal with each other, and we have the third eigenvector that is nearly zero. So the answer is, or it's not an answer, definitely an answer, but we have a reason that enforces, an example, that enforces our assumption that indeed the alignment, the most information about the alignment can be captured for plastic. Alignment can be captured for planar flows in two dimensions. So, in two times two tensors, here we have another example. Here, just show the velocity profile that is a Poiselle flow and the resulting orientation. You see here the length of the vector and the color of the vector is giving how high the probability is that this preferred orientation is taken, the preferred orientation corresponding to the eigenvector to the biggest eigenvalue. And you see that where the gradient of the velocity is zero. Gradient of the velocity is zero, we have a dyzotropic state, and while the stronger the gradient, the stronger the orientation for this model. Now, let's have a look to the different models. As I said, there are really many possible functions describing alignment. The one coming from irreversible thermodynamics, as you see, can be very different from the one that is most spread and commercially used, that is the Folger-Tucker equation. The Folger-Tucker equation that's That has different possibilities to be expressed because it has a closure form, a closure form for the fourth-order tensor. So, expressing a fourth-order tensor, this one, as a function of the second-order tensor. And there are plenty of possibilities. Here for more simulation, we use the quadratic, but the idea is to have a program to test different ones. It could be also possible to have an additional equation of motion coming from mesoscopic theory describing the fourth-order tensor. So, now we go into the new. So now we go into the numerics. Well, we used as classical a classical mix in fluid dynamics. We used FEM for the time, FEM for the space, and we made our life easier by using Phoenix, which is an open source platform for using finite elements. It has the advantage of finite elements, I think, are clear. The concrete problem we looked at, we assumed also the Also, the mesothermal case. So, we have just the equation of the balance of momentum, the balance of mass. Here we have, we consider indeed the Folger-Tucker equation. And this is important, another condition on the alignment time. So, this condition comes from mesoscopic theory. And another condition coming from mesoscopic theory is symmetry. Now, it's interesting to know that apparently. It's interesting to know that apparently the Fonger-Tucker equation is used in commercially available softwares, but does not account for the trace condition. So, what makes this problem numerically more difficult, at least it made me for me more difficult, are the non-linearities and the couplings because the stress tensor of course may depend and the question is how it may depend from alignment and the fact that you have different constraints, the incompressibility constraints and the stress constraints. Possibility constraints and this trace constraint that today seems not to be considered. So, how we took care of them? Well, we used the fractional method, so which means we solved the Navier-Stokes problem with an approach, with a very known approach, the fractional method. We used an increased pressure method. But here you see the modification we did. We have reused the orientation at the node. The orientation at the known time step that we have just computed and insert it in the first equation. We then compute the velocity field corrected for the incompressibility, and with the newly computed velocity field, we compute the new orientation. Here, we used an eye approach, but of course, you can use higher order. However, the question is if it really increases convergence that we will see in a moment. But what I wanted to point out in this equation is that it is not the Folio-Tucker as I presented it before. As I presented it before, because the question of how to ensure that the trace will be one, we modified. Because from mesoscopic theory, you can show that an equivalent formulation is the tensor to be traceless. Of course, you can always transform if you know the trace value from trace one to traceless. And then we modify the Folger-Tuka equation so that it conserves the traceless characteristics, the tracelessness of the Tracelessness of the tensor. This is easily done by subtracting always the trace that is created by some tensorian multiplication. This way, we have the equation of motion, we have modified the most popular equation of motion for the tensor so that it is symmetry conserving and traceness conserving. Hence, we don't need to enforce with an extra step the trace one condition. Now, Condition. Now, I want to show another nice advantage of this full fraction approach we used. We consider different couplings, possible couplings for the stress tensor. Some come from irreversible thermodynamics, some from esotoscopic theory. And in particular, I want to focus on this one and to remember these two four facts, these two coefficients. One is the viscosity, the other one is simply a measure of how I'm waiting for the influence on the stress. For the influence on the stress of alignment and the velocity strategy. Now, for the EFAM analysis, the question is we are having a mixed space. That's clear because we have the pressure field, the velocity field, and the alignment tensor being the unknowns. So, the question is if we know also, we need also a condition of the in-supp type. This actually I have not answered in the course of this research. In the course of this research, but I have not observed spurious modes using a Taylor Hood space. And basically, I could see that in many cases that increasing the spaces accordingly to Taylor Hood, to the Taylor Hood family, you had a higher convergence. However, what is necessary for the well-posedness for sure is that each of the four sub-problems has to be a continuous and coercive. Be continuous and coercive in the sense that we know from FEM analysis. Because then, thanks to the Laxmigram dilemma of SIEA, uniqueness, existence, and convergence follow for each step. I don't want to express too far Luis time on that. I think you all know about it. Here we take an example of a condition or the only condition we get from the FEM analysis, where we consider the bilinear form in the case of the coupling I showed before. Of the coupling I showed before. Basically, use the characteristic of the traceless tensor that here is the small A in comparison to the big A, that is the trace one tensor. Basically, we then make some approximation and we can show cursivity. But the cursivity for the bilinear form has a condition. The condition, basically, this is a simplified version, it's in 2D, but it's interesting because we see that the condition makes physically sense. It means the alignment, the mean. The alignment diminishes the viscosity, and this makes sense because it's what we want. If the particles are aligned, we expect a friction that becomes less between the particles. However, in order for the problem to be well posed, we need this coefficient, the total viscosity to remain positive. Okay, now let's have a look to the convergence in time. So, first we use here with the maximum error norm, and we see the usual boundary for the Boundary for the fraction and method for the Navier-Stokes problem. We see that it's square root in the pressure, linear in the velocity. And what is interesting, regardless of the discretization we use for the alignment equation, equation of motion, we will get, that is in this sense, is the trace-less conserving Foger-Tucker equation, we will have a linear convergence, but not less, which is a good news because we could have expected also a higher error. A higher error, but the convergence remains linear. The second good news about the method is that the convergence rates, irrespective of the coupling we use, are similar. So we see linear and square root. This is a good thing because the science of this algorithm is on the one is to enable us as an institute, but also other theoretical research on this equation of motion so that you can try different answers. So that's the great advantage. We don't need a very high convergence. We don't need a very high convergence. We need something that is fast to compute for some easy cases where we can compare with experimental results using different answers. And so, this part is very important for the aim we had. So, I'm concluding. The disadvantages of the method is that it's bounded by the best incremental pressure correction scheme, which you know in the L2 norm, it means you can have a convergence that is higher than quadratic. Moreover, it's unfit for non-stationary. Moreover, it's unfit for non-stationary solution in the sense that, of course, the depend error depends from time. There are other problems in this case where it's fully stationary, we advise to use a Newton solver or something else. The advantage is it's a fast computation, you get rid of the saddle point structure, you have smaller matrices, and it's robust with respect to competitive changes. Well, now I'm in the question and answer part. I hope the time was fitting. The time was fitting. Unfortunately, today I have a long-planned meeting, online meeting, so I can join the discussion and I hope there will be many questions now. Thanks, Derek. Thank you very much. I'll start the questioning. If anyone would like to get into the act, please just get yourself into the chat box. One thing that I didn't see was how you incorporate the concentration of fibers into the simulation. Of fibers into the simulation. This seemed to be a general formulation that was independent of concentration. Exactly. Actually, that's exactly as you say. Basically, we can may have another equation of motion, or no, another constitutive differential equation describing how the concentration moves. But this is not done by the equation of motion for the alignment. It's just describing. Motion for the alignment. It's just describing the alignment. So it means I have a probability distribution on the unit sphere, like in this point, that is for 1x. It doesn't mean that in this point there has to be a fiber. It can be, but it can be not. And this is described by another function that you can incorporate possibly in the theories, but it's not done by this model. You want just to look how they distribute. Apparently, in the experimental measures, Experimental measures. I mean, that's not. I don't know if Professor Papenfus is here because she was ill yesterday, so probably she is not, but she would have liked. With the experimental comparison, I think they had a high level of homogeneity in the cases they looked at. But actually, this is another question. So, as I said, the probability model to describe that comes from liquid crystal, where in one X you have many microscopic directors. In the case of five. In the case of fibers, you get only probability information whether there is a fiber and how much fibers there are in the different spots. That may be described by another differential equation with its own quantity. If you have a Dehud suspension of fibers, then there is no steady state, they rotate. Actually, there is a steady state because the fibers in the model of Folio 2. In the model of Foyer-Tucker, they stabilize themselves. They start from the model, they start working in Jeffrey equation, and in this sense, the particles rotate and rotate, but then they added a phenomenological, maybe I can show it. Let's see. So basically, the fibers are essentially assumed to be infinite in length. Yeah, exactly. Well, the fibers are assumed to be very short, and the ratio between the length and the radi is a. Is assumed to be infinite. So the radio is much smaller than the length, although the length is short. And actually, in this equation, for example, the Folger-Tucker equation, we have this coefficient here that is a phenomenological one, and this accounts for the stabilization of the system. I found also some analytical solution with which I validated my algorithm. My algorithm, and I find out that basically you can simplify in the case of a planar flow. Sorry, I have to search in the attachment. In the case of planar flow, you can simplify for the right initial condition the equation for the non-diagonal values to a Ricard equation. So basically, you have a steady state coming from hyperbolic functions regarding the this is the behavior of the Lyman tensor. Behavior of that Eyman tensor. I hope I have answered your question. Obviously, a question, I'm probably going to want to follow up.
