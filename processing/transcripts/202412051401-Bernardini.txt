Here at the county from Immass Problem Technique. Thanks also to the organizers for this kind of session. BAMP is a fantastic page and this workshop is really interesting, so very happy to be here. Today I would like to present some recent results obtained in collaboration with Virginia Costanis, Peopola and Virginia Lorenzo Sierra. Concerning the symmetry results for solution to the torsion problem, defined on ringship domains in a random, so dominance having displanetary boundaries, and in particular taking advantage of a conformal splitting technique, we are able to generalize some previous results by my prototype in the planner case. So let me introduce the setting of our problem. Let us assume to be in the n-dimensional space Rn for Space Rn for n greater than equal to 3, and we consider a ring-shaped domain having a smooth boundary at the actually, it is we need it is at least C2, but let us assume it is smooth. So the boundary is made up of two connected boundary components, the inner one, the red one, which we name gamma inner, and the outer one, blue one, gamma outer. Gamma out. We are interested in studying the pairs omega U, where omega is a ring-shaped domain and U is a solution to the following boundary problem. So, labulation of u equal to minus n on the domain vega and u equal to zero on the boundary. Just a small remark, taking advantage of lemma, we are able to obtain that the normal derivative of u is That the normal derivative of u is negative on the boundary. This follows because, taking advantage of Maxim principles, we can see that our solution is positive inside the mean, and so we can use a of gamma. This useful in the following. So, this kind of problems, also imposing some suitable overturning conditions on the boundary of the mega, has been intensively studied over last decades, also as Over last decades, also as a consequence of the wide range of applications in the field of physics. In particular, in the two-dimensional case, this system can be used to model, it has a very natural fundamental interpretation, so it can be used to model the movement of homogeneous incompressible fluid through a cylindrical pipe of cross-section equal to omega. The same system can be used for. The same system can be used also to model the torsion of a solid strip of cross-section equal to omega. But let me start from the very beginning of the story, describing this very famous and seminal paper by Serin from 1971. In particular, studied the previous study boundary level problems, so Laplacian-Fibbert Maiser, important zero-the boundary, and imposes this over-determining condition. Imposes these over-determining conditions. The norm of the gradient of u equal to a certain constant on the boundary. Imposing this over-determining condition, he was able to characterize all the solutions for our problem. In particular, he proved that the only domain which supports such a solution is the ball, and the solution u is rotation symmetric and radically. In particular, up to translations and rescalings, all the solutions have the following forms. All the solutions have the following form. So the domain is a polyfragus one center zero, and the solution is equal to one alpha, one minus the norm of x squared. And we'll be referring in the forum to this kind of solutions as selling solutions. Just a remark, even if the method of moving prints goes back to Alexandro, it was first used in PD theory by Sterin, and his work by Sterin originated. And his work with Seren originated a lot of fundamental results in the field. Let me briefly describe this over the recondition because just to make clear what is its rule. So in its result, SERIN does not impose any geometric conditions on the boundary. So priori, it would be also disconnected. But is this a wettermane condition that This overman condition that forces the boundary of our domain to be connected around and this solution to be rotational symmetric and radially classical. It's then natural to ask if a similar characterization is available for the means having disconnected boundaries. So we would like to weaken a little the these returning conditions in order to cover also the case of solutions defined on Solutions defined on to means having this connected bundle. So, we would like to find which are these Cobetonian conditions that forces our solution to be rotational symmetric and our domain to be a simple analysis. In particular, we look for statements of the following form. So, the first two lines are the previous T-shirt-band value problem plus some. Problem plus some ordering conditions on the inner and the outer boundary, we would like to conclude that our solution is rotationally symmetric. Related to these issues, there is this work by this theorem by Reicher, who in particular considered this problem here, this system here, Laplacian 2 equals to minus 1 inside the domain, u equal to a and normal derivative. u equal to a and normal derivative equal to a certain constant on the inner boundary and u equal to zero and normal derivative equal to a certain constant c2 on the outer boundary. Using a moving plane technique it was and also obviously assuming that the value a is positive and the normal derivative on the inner boundary is non-negative and also that the solution is between zero and a inside the main is it was The main, it was able to obtain the following rich detailed results. In particular, the domain omega is a symphony angles, and the solution is rotationally symmetric and monogramically decreasing. Later, Sirokov refined these results, removing the assumption that U must be between zero and any cycle mean. So we we would like to sell that Would like to say that the method of moving planes has this particular feature: that is, proving radial symmetry provides at once also the monotonicity of the solution in the radial direction. So, if we want to study solutions which are not monotone, we have to use a different method. Okay, what happens in the case when our constant C1 is Constant C1 is less than 0. Obviously, the method of moving planes cannot be applied because this condition here, C1 greater or equal than 0, proves to be crucial for the method of moving plane to work. Actually, there is a counterexample by Cambodia and Shafier, who are able to prove that there exists a non-symmetric solution to our problem, bifurcating from the Problem bifurcating from the rotationally symmetric ones. And these solutions have normal derivative on the boundary equal to a negative constant. Let us see now which are the rotational asymmetric solution for problems defined on ring-shaped means because they act as model solutions to compare with them. So our ring-shaped model solutions. So our ringship model solutions are made up of two parts. The first part is the selling solution we have seen before, minus a certain constant, depending on capital L, the dimension of our problem, times 1 over the number of x to the power n minus 2. This solution is defined on this circular annual domain, namely all the points in Rn have been norm between R1 and R2. Between R1 and R2, and R1 and R2 are the two positive zeros of this function E. Notice that these second-model solutions are parametrized by the parameter capital L which is between zero and their max, and it is called the core radius of our solution. Notice also that capital L corresponds to the radius of the circle where we can find the The maxima of our radio symmetric solution. Here we have a plot of some solutions belonging to this family. When capital L is equal to zero, obviously we go over the seven solution, so having just one maximum points on the on the origin. But as capital L start to increase, we start to have two boundary components. Have two boundary components. The inner boundary components corresponds to the first zero, R1, while the outer boundary component corresponds to the second zero, R2. Obviously, we have more than these solutions, these solutions are between capillaries, between zero and marks. But since our problem has natural translations and rescaling invariance, as we will see later, we can We will see later. We can, after translation and discadings, we can obtain that our solution corresponds to a solution belonging to this family. So, the proof of our results relies on a conformal splitting technique. This method has been introduced by Gustian Metzli in a series of papers in order to prove symmetry of solutions. To prove symmetry of solutions to some of the analytic problems arising in potential theory. The same method proves to be quite useful also in other settings, such as in the setting of general relativity. In particular, we take advantage of the conformal structure associated to the domain we are considering in order to obtain a conformal and then A conformal and then equivalent formulation of our problem, which can be treated via splitting methods. So, the starting point is to set up our cylindrical answers, which will be our starting point of our algorithm. And the cylindrical answer consists of a suitable conformal change of the original metric. And the idea comes from this fact here. The idea comes from this fact here. So the Euclidean metric can be made cylindrical by a division by a square. Let me record some super basic facts already know, but just to make clear what we are doing. When we are in a rn minus minus zero minus the origin, the Ecliptic method can be written as territan squared plus l square gsn minus one, when l is the equivalent distance from the origin. The Euclidean distance from the origin, and just n minus 1 is the metric induced by the M1 on the N minus 1 dimensional sphere. We can divide by R square and obtain these two terms and obviously up to scaling, we obtain that this integral metric is conformally related to the equation by the conformal factor 1 over s square. The heuristic of our approach is the following. We consider a ring-shaped model solution to our problem, u r omega capital R u capital R. We observe that the Ebonian distance from the origin can be written in terms of U R. We'll have a certain function C such that L is equal to C evaluated on U capital L. On U capital L. So the previous conformal change of matrix can be written in terms of U capital L. And the general idea is the following. What happens if we do not consider a ring-shaped model solution to our problem, but a generic solution to our problem? We perform a suitable and analogous conformal change of metrics in terms of u. We study this. There are also few. We study this new metric and we try to understand if the solution is particularly symmetrical. So let me briefly sketch the idea of the conformal reformulation of our problem. We consider a certain region of our dominant omega minus the set of maximum points, and first of all, we have to define the pseudo-redevelopment. We have to define the cellular function C, which is a function going from the original N into real values. C is a function which is defined in terms of the solution U and mimics the behavior of the radial coordinate when considering rotational asymmetric solutions. Once we have constructed the solvent radar function, we can define our bands asymmetric G equal to one Metric g equal to 1 over c squared grn and then we define finally we define the self-defined function phi we define it in such a way that a posteriori in the rotationally symmetric case the norm of the gradient of phi is equal to 1. In our case we can see that phi is equal to the logarithm of the extra function. Notice that these definitions are chosen in such a way that in the In such a way that in the rotational symmetric case, the unsymmetric is equal to the semi-knetric, and the self-daffine function C is equal to an affine function. And in particular, we are looking for conditions on the solution u in such a way that our function phi is affine and then. Is a fine, and then taking advantage of a splitting principle, we can say that the unsatisfying is cylindrical and our region N isometric to have one-half round cylinder. Use proving rotational symmetry rotational rotational symmetry of solutions. Okay. Our our argument is based on a comparison strategy. Is based on a comparison strategy. So we want to compare some of the analytic and geometric properties of our solutions to the corresponding ones for ring-shaped model solutions, which we can compute explicitly. And we want to obtain some sharp and rigid A rebounds that can be used to obtain our classification results. This comparison strategy. Comparison strategy has been used also in other settings, such as to study minimal surfaces or in the setting of general relativity. In particular, for what concerns minimal surfaces, there is this recent work by Estiner and Marin, who considered an over-determined analytic problem on the two-dimensional sphere, and they are able to obtain a classification result for the physical pathogen. For the physical catenoid, as the only embedded minimal surface, a minimum annulus, and also free bounded minimum annulus, was support function as infinitely many maximum points. The steps of our strategy are the followings. We consider a genetic solution to our problem and a certain region of our domain omega minus the set of maximum points. First of all, we have to associate to our We have to associate to our solution U on the region N a certain value of the expected radius. Once we have the expected radius, we can compare our solution on the region N with the green shape model solution having parameter equal to capital F. As I said before, our problem has unnatural translations every scaling new variance. And we're scaling new variance. So if we consider a pair omega u solution for our problem, lambda a certain positive value and C are a certain constant, we can translate and rescale the domain omega and also the solution. We obtain this new pair omega lambda c and u lambda c and this new pair is still a solution for our problem. Notice that Notice that the value of the norm of the gradient of Q will have an important rule in the following. We notice that this value really depends on the choice of the normalization for our solution. So in order to deal with this issue and deal with a meaningful object, we have to consider this this point here, the normalised either suffer she or stress. Normalized at the surface shear stress. So we consider the maximum of the norm of the gradient of u on the intersection between the boundary of our domain and the n over the square root of two times u max. In this way, we obtain a scaling invalid quality. And so two equivalent solutions, if two solutions are related in this way, we call them equivalent solutions. In this way, we call them equivalent solutions. So omega and u and omega lambda c and u lambda c are two equivalent solutions. So in this way, two equivalent solutions predict the same way for the value tau. And so we have obtained a scaling invariant quantity. Moreover, this is a good definition. The definition is to oppose. Good definition, the definition is proposed because this set here, the intersection between the boundary of Omiga and N cannot be empty. We will see later, we can prove it taking advantage of a new island in Hong. So in our comparison argument, we have associated a generic solution to our problem with a suitable ring-shaped model solution to compare with. To compare with it. But as we have seen, ring-shaped model solutions are parameterized by the parameter capital L. So we have to associate, for a generic solution to our problem, a suitable value of the parameter capital L. And so how can we find a good value for the parameter capital L? The rough idea consists of take advantage of studying the slope of the solution on the boundary. On the boundary and taking advantage of the previous notion of normalized upper surface stress. First of all, we have to say that if we consider a generic ring-shaped model solution for our problem and we evaluate the value of the parameter tau on the inner or the outer boundary component, in this case we obtain two functions. So these, the value. So this the value of the of tau for mu r on the inner coband component can be seen as a function of capital L. So we obtain two functions, tau1 and tau2. The first one going from 0 max into the square root of n plus infinity, and the second one from 0 max into the interval 1 square root of n. In the first case, we have a strictly definition. A strictly decreasing function which goes to plus infinity while capital L goes to zero, while in the second case we obtain a strictly increasing function, tau. We are now ready to introduce our very tool of expected produce, which is the following. So we use the previous notion of normalizer surface test to look at the inverse of these two functions. And we distinguish the case when And we distinguish the case when tau is less than square root of n or greater than square root of n. In order to take advantage of this new notion of expected values, we have to verify that it is well posed and it provides a positive value, non-negative value for the parameter capital L. This is the context of the next theorem, which also provides a characteristic. Provides a characterization for certain type solutions in terms of the value of tau. In particular, we consider a solution to our problem, a certain region of our domain omega minus the set of maximum points, we are able to prove that the tau, the normalized upper star for shear stress, associated to u on the region n, is greater or equal than 1. So if we come back, now we can say that. Now we can say that the if tau is literally equal than one, we can say that the notion of expected values is well defined because it lies on the range of definition of the inverse of tau one or the inverse of tau two. And as I said, we if tau tau is equal to one, our solution up to translation and rescalings is equivalent to a selling solution. Equivalent to a selling solution. The proof of this result relies on Maximum principle and a suitable formula. I will skip the details because they are not so interesting. Notice that serving solution has the least possible value for the normalizable self-esteem among all the solutions to our problem. And moreover, from now on, we can say that the algorithm reaches to every couple and you associate. And you associate a value of the expected products, it will have different. So we can start our compiling part. Okay, as we have seen before, our problem is scaling and translation invariant. So there are a lot of equivalent solutions. And to have a meaningful comparison, we have to select one solution to compare with among all the equivalent ones. With among all the equivalent ones. And to do that, we have to normalize our solution and the domain in a suitable way. In particular, given a genetic solution to our problem and a certain connected component of our omega minus the set of maximum points and capital L, the expected values we have. Well, we can rescale our solution and the domain in such a way that the maximum of u is equal to the maximum. Of u is equal to the maximum of the ring-shaped solution associated by means of capital L. And this point can be computed in terms of capital L. This means that we have to consider an equivalent pair, omega, lambda c and u lambda c such that lambda is equal to the square root of u r max over u max and c is equal to zero. In this way, we can obtain some sharp. We can obtain some sharp and rigid abliori bounds, which can be used to obtain our classification result. So let me spend a few minutes to describe how we can construct our cellular ideal function. We cannot do it before because we didn't have all the necessary tools. So let us assume to be that our region n is such that the maximum The maximum on the boundary of omega of the norm of the gradient of Q squared over 2u max is not equal to 1. We can define the following function, capital F from the implicit function theorem, you can say that x is two functions, smooth functions, C mounts and C plus, such that with a relation hold, we can define the Dipsavier. We can define a Deep Savior function taking advantage of these C minus MC plus in the following way. Okay, Dipsy-Rador function is a function such that when we consider ring-shaped model solutions, C is equal to the norm of X. And roughly speaking, the epsilon function. Speaking, the epsilon function is a tool to compare the level set of our solution to the level set of a ring-shaped model solution. Okay, we are ready to introduce our first main theorem, which is the following dichotomy theorem from now on. By problem one, we mean the previously shaped vandal problem. We consider a solution to this problem, and we assume that the domain omega is a Assume that the domain omega is a ring-shaped domain, assume also that the norm of the gradient of u is constant on either the inner or the outer boundary component, then we have only two possibilities. Either our solution is equivalent to a ring-shaped model solution, or our solution is such that the set of maximum points as H n minus 1 measure equal to different. So, notice that. So notice that we require that the norm of gradient of U is constant only on one of the two inner two of the two boundary components. So this is a partially well-determined entity problem. We can rephrase the previous theorem in the following way, more clear. The set of maximum points of our solution as Hn minus 1 measure greater than zero and the normal derivative of our The normal derivative of our solution is constant on the boundary, if and only if our solution is equivalent to a ringshape model solution. After translation in this case, it is equivalent to a ringshape model solution. Before going more into details of this result, let me recall some facts which would be useful. First of all, if U is a solution to what If u is a solution to our problem, then u is a reality function. Then, we are interested in the set of maximum points of our solutions. So, they are critical points. And for what concern critical points, the SDH has obtained a very interesting result. In particular, it proved that the set of critical points of re-analytic functions have a certified structure. So we have a disjoint union of strata, the start of dimension zero, the start of dimension one, up to dimension n minus one. What follows, we will refer to the strata of dimension n minus one to the top stratum. And each strata, each stratum is made up of a finite union of e-dimensional analytic sub-manifolds. So the stratum of dimension zero is made up of a finite union of points. But the one-dimensional stratum is made up of a finite number of curves and so on. When we consider not all the critical points but only the maximum points, we can obtain, for any question, obtained the following result. If the solution is such that the ashen does not vanish on the closure of the top stratum, then Top stratum, then the top stratum is made up of a finite number of analytic hypersurfaces, which are also closed. So if the set of maximum points has Hn minus some measure positive, then top strata is not empty. From the previous results, we know that it's made up of this joint union of strata. And we observe that the top stratum, as we have seen before, the top stratum is made up of a planet union of cores. So we can have a lot of possible configurations for the top stratum. A closer look shows us that there are only three possibilities. The first possibility is when the top stratum does not contain the inner boundary. So, on this region, at the boundary of this region, that is on sigma, our solution u is equal to 2u max. Taking advantage of maximum principle, we can say that u is constant on the light blue region. But by analyticity, it follows that our solution is constant on the whole omega, which is a contradiction. So, we cannot have this possibility, so we cannot have Cannot have that top stratum is made up of closed either surfaces which do not contain the inner bundle. The second case is when we have two closed hypersurfaces, one containing the other. Also, this case is not possible. We can argue, as in the case before, the only possible scenario is the third one. So when we have So, when we have only a single smooth closed outer surface, dividing our domain into two parts. The closure of the outer part contains the outer boundary, while the closure of the inner domain contains the inner boundary component. This is the so-called No Island lemma, which is based on Maxim principles and general. Principles and the analyticity of our solution. So we have said set of maximum points is made up of finite number of points, finite number of curves and so on up to dimension n minus 1 and when we are dimension n minus 1 this is only a single smooth closed hypersurface. So this is important for our argument because from now from now on we can assume that when a surface We can assume that when the set of maximum points has Hn minus 1 measure positive, then the Dobstrap divides our domain into two parts in this way. And so if the normal derivative of our solution is constant on the outer boundary component, we can consider the outer part of our domain, omega out. And we consider Out, and we consider as inner boundary component the top starting signal. So we have the following over-the-turn problem: Laplace equal to minus n inside the domain omega outer, u equal to u max and normal derivative equal to zero on the top stratum, and also by assumption, u equal to zero and normal derivative equal to certain constant situation on the outer. C2 on the outer boundary. We can take advantage of the previous results by the zero hub and we can conclude that our solution is a portion of Rickshaft on the solution. We can conclude by analyticity. If we assume that the normal derivative is constant on the inner boundary, we can argue in the same way by taking the function v equal to u max minus u. Okay. In our argument. Okay, in our arguments, this guided estimates proved to be quite useful. In what follows, for sake of simplicity, we will denote by W the norm of the gradient of U squared and W capital R the convolution between the norm of the gradient of U capital R squared and the observed radial function C. Under the same assumption as before, so we consider a solution. We consider a solution to our problem and a certain connective component of our domain. Obviously, we consider the expected products associated with our solution on the region n, we are able to prove that the w is less or equal than wf inside the domain omega. And if the equality is achieved in a certain point, P inside the domain N, inside the region M, our solution is equivalent to a lean shape mode solution. Is equivalent to a link shape mode distribution. Notice that the both estimates are sharp and rigid. So if equality is achieved in a certain point, then it is achieved in every point. And the norm of this symmetric two tensor branches. Because from this, we can obtain radius symmetry of solution. Notice that these symmetric two tensor, the choice of this symmetric potential comes from the control. Tensor comes from the conformal setting, and in particular, it corresponds to the Schengen of our pseudo-affine function. The proof of this result is the following, the idea. We have to consider this function, capital G, which is the difference between W and W capital L times a suitable function. We can observe that this function satisfies the following elliptic. The following elliptic inequality on the region n. But in order to apply a maximum principle, we have to study the behavior of our function g on the boundary of our. We observe that the boundary of n is made up of two parts: intersection between the closure of n and the boundary of our domino, and intersection between the A section between the project of n and the set of maximum points for our solution. For what concerns the first part, by construction, we have that w is less or equal than wf, so capital G is less or equal than zero on the intersection between the boundary of omega and n bar. Vorte depart is the second one, because when we approach the set of maximum points, the Epsilon radio function C goes to the Radio function C goes to zero, goes to capital L. So the denominator goes to zero. We can take advantage of a reverse relativity inequality to prove that when approaching the sort of maximum point, our function capital G goes to zero. So we are done, we can apply maximum principle, and so we obtain that our function capital G is less than equal to zero, because probably our gradient. Our gradient estimates. Okay, the previous gradient estimates can be used to prove some mean curvature bounds, some bounds for the mean curvature of the components of our boundary components of our domain. As before, let us assume the same assumption as before. Recall that one and a two are two positive zeros of the function fl when we have. function F L when we have defined leading ship model solutions in the points where in the points of the section between the boundary of omega and and bar where we the maximum of the gradient of view is reached such points the the mean curvature can be estimated in this way so distinguish between ecclesio and tau is between the case when tau is less than square root of n, the case when tau is better than square root of n. We can obtain the same analogous mean curvature bounds for the Dobstratum, now depending on capital L, and notice that the mean curvature is always conducted with respect to the serial unit normal to our domain. The proof of the incorrect The proof of the mean curvature bounds is based on evaluating the expansion of our function w and w because in this case everything is analytic so we don't have any problem. So we consider this half line gamma s so starting from the point P and pointing pointing towards the Towards the interior of our dominion capital N, we evaluated the Tirole expansion of W on gamma S and the Tirole expansion of W capital F on gamma S. We compare these two expansions, taking advantage of the fact that when we are on the boundary of our domain, WP is equal to W capital F P and we use the previous calculator. And we use the previous gravitational estimates. We can obtain this estimate for the mean curvature, and we can conclude because in the case when tau is less than square root of n, then the accelerated function on p is equal to f2, while when we are in the case when tau is greater than the square root of n, then the circular function is equal to 1. So we are done. We can argue in the same way. Can are in the same way pull the bounds on the mean curvature of the toxin. It is our second main theorem. Consider a solution to our problem. We assume that the set of maximum points as h n minus 1 measure greater than 0. We have to require these two technical conditions on the normalizer per start of shear stress of our solution. Of our solution on the inner and the outer boundary component. So, for the inner boundary component, we assume that tau is little or square root of n, while when we are in the outer component, we have to assume that tau is less than square root of n. We compute the expected values with respect to the inner and the outer boundary component, so outer and inner, and we are able to prove that. And we are able to prove that L outer is better or equal than L inner. They are both greater than zero. Moreover, we are also able to prove that when we have equality, we have equality if and only if our solution is equivalent to having a shape model solution. Okay, the idea of the proof of this result is the following. So from the previous result we know that the top stratum is made up of a single smooth closer surface. A single smooth closed episode, dividing our domain into two regions. From the previous estimates for the mean curvature, we can obtain these bounds for the mean curvature on the top stratum. We observe that the function which to every L associate this point here is not increasing, and from this, it follows that L in is less or equal than L outer. The rigid part of our result Part of our result is that it can be proven in the following way. This side from here to here is obvious, this other side from year to year. So assume that the equality holds, we know that the mean curvature is equal to n minus 1 over l, so the top stratum is equal to Is equal to n minus 1 sphere of radius m. Taking advantage of the Cauchy-Koveler-Skaya theorem and the analysis of Q, we can conclude that our solution is equivalent to the Turing-Shape Monique solution. Taking advantage of the previous gradient estimates, we are also able to obtain some area bounds, so for the area. So, for the area of the intersection between the boundary of our domain and the crossover of n, and the area of the intersection between the set of maximum points and the cross of n. Actually, we compute separately the bounds for the area of sigma n and the area of gamma n. We put we compute separately these points. Put separately these points, we put together and we obtain these inequalities here. The interesting part is that if equality holds, then still we have symmetry of our solution. In those kind of problems, the three dream statement is the following. So, Laplace and u equal to minus n in omega, u equal to 0 on the boundary, and we impose that the normal derivative on the inner boundary. Derivative on the inner boundary is equal to a certain constant, C1, and the normal derivative on the outer boundary is equal to another constant, C2, different constants. We would like to conclude that our solution is rotation symmetrics similar to the selling problem. Actually, this is not true. In the two-dimensional case, this has been proved that there exists infinitely many solutions to the previous system, which are not rotational symmetric. This, in the case, any. This in the case n equal to 2, we are working in the case n reader, required n3. Actually, the proof of this result, which is based on a binification argument, does not rely so much on the dimension of our problem. So it's reasonable to assume that in our case, we get such kind of exotic solutions. The question is: does exist other kinds of exotic solutions to our problem? Yes.
