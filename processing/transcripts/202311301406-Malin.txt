So first, co uh Carner Nalan will tell us about table embedding catbooks. A pattern that slightly differs from the one on scandal, which also comes good with catbooks and comatic one of PP3. Yeah, I just didn't want to like. Yeah, yeah, just a bit we expect to hear that all. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for the invitation and thanks for the introduction. So I want to start by talking about stable embedding calculus. So this is the Calculus. So this is the calculus of functors which go from the opposite category there. The opposite category of manifolds to the category of spectra. And as you would expect in embedding calculus, I have a tower which takes f and it approximates it successively by its. It successively by its Taylor approximations. And there are layers. And these layers have classifications kind of in terms of these total homotopy fiber cubes, just as in the classical unstable case. What is stable calculus? What is stable calculus really trying to understand? Well, really, the goal of stable calculus is to understand the homotopy type stably of embeddings from one manifold to another. There has been some approaches to this in the literature. For example, Um there's a paper of Arone, Lambrecht's, and Volich. There's a paper of Cranich and Cooper's. And there is, of course, a paper by Weiss. And these primarily study what you might call homological embedding calculus, which is embedding calculus of functors which look like Which look like this smashed with some homology theory, like say integral homology or rational homology. Or you might make a slight change to what I actually am studying, and I might replace this with this embeddings bar into n. This is This is defined to be the homotopy fiber from embeddings into emergence. So, to make this homotopy fiber, you have to make some choices. You might have to start with an embedded. Start with an embedding from M to N and make these choices which are not canonical. And this has certain nice convergence properties in the sense that it might converge in a similar range as classical unstable embedding calculus. But it's at the cost of kind of taking this non-canonical choice of an embedding. And so I really am going to focus on this sigma plus. On this sigma plus infinity of embeddings into n. And so it doesn't enjoy all of the same nice convergence properties, but these are issues that one can have techniques to get around. And so what are some things we can say about this? So, a nice observation is that as Is that as soon as I stabilize, I can say something about the E1 page of the stable embedding calculus spectral sequence. So for instance, if I am studying sigma plus infinity of embeddings into M, I can evaluate that at M, and I can ask what do the layers of the tower look like in this case. So in this case, So in this case, di of f, it's a functor of both n and m, and this depends, in the m variable, it depends only on the homotopy type of m. And in the n variable, it depends on the proper tangential homotopy type of M of N. So we see just even at the very first page. Very first page, we have a better understanding than in an unstable case. And in fact, we see that stability kind of erases a lot of information. So the proof idea of this, let's examine, say, the second part. You understand the statement? Can you depends on composition depends on proper tangential? Yeah, yeah. So if I change M to a homotopy equivalent manifold of the same dimension, then the homotopy type of this does not change. And if I change N to a proper tangential homotopy equivalent manifold, meaning there's a proper homotopy equivalence which pulls back the tangent bundle, then Tangent bundle, then the homotopy type of the layer still does not change. Okay. Yeah, thank you, thank you. So the first is pretty straightforward, and so let me focus on the second, this tangential homotopian variance. The proof of the second, well, it really comes down to the fact that these layers dif at, yeah. At this layer DIF, it depends primarily on this total homotopy fiber. It's this total homotopy fiber of a square, and this square S, this square S is built out of the stabilizations of cubes of configuration spaces. In particular, these are actually framed configuration spaces. So my configurations have a choice of frame. So the first thing you can do is you can show that sigma plus infinity of such a cube depends only. On the tangential homotopy type proper. And then you can use the classification of the fibers to deduce that the entire layer only depends on that. And this analysis of the stabilized configuration spaces. Stabilize configuration spaces. It's done by a couple of people in the kind of without the cube condition. And maybe in this generality, it's done by Newtson first. And I guess what I have to add to this is that indeed. Newtson. Every time, every time. You've invented calculus, don't you? It's always great when you give a talk and everyone starts laughing at you. It's done by Newtson using factorization homology. Newton did not know about factorization homology as far as I know, though he, I guess he did invent calculus. Right. So we understand these projections between configuration spaces and you actually show that with the Spaces, and you actually show that with the framings, they only depend on the tangential proper homotopy type. And so we get this kind of weird theorem, which is that embedding calculus, which studies embeddings, only depends on homotopy theoretic details on the first page. Okay. I can I'll just say that I mean if if you have a map which uh displays uh chromatometer, then uh the c the corresponding map is uh going to be equivalent. Okay, spotting map is uh going to be equivalence. Or you can say that whenever these two things are uh of the same amount of type, of whatever, stable amount of type, right? So what exactly do you mean? So I mean that these layers are functorial in two ways. They're functorial with respect to homotopy equivalences of M and they're functorial with respect to tangential proper homotopy equivalences of M. Uh uh map sense is category, c category of manifolds, right? Uh no, any any map. So I have a notion of a proper map, I can define a proper homotopy equivalence, and I can ask that it pulls back the tangent. Okay, okay. And so this tells you that if embedding calculus is going to get you something good stably, it's going to have to do a lot past the first page because it doesn't even see anything past the homotopy types. Okay. Okay, so that's like a cute theorem. I'd like to have good theorems. So what is the interaction between stable homotopy theory and geometry? Well, for me, this is best illustrated in a Tia duality. So a Tia duality states that if M is a framed N manifold, framed n manifold, then sigma plus infinity of m is equivalent to a suspension of the dual of the one point of activation. Here, this is the Spaniard-Whitehead dual. And if I didn't have a frame manifold, I'd have to twist it by the TOM complex of the normal bundle. And so what I really am after is a version of this for stable embedding calculations. Version of this for stable embedding calculus. And so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to restrict to studying framed manifolds. So this means that I need to introduce EM. This is the moduli space of disks in the frames and manifold. And then this thing is a module over the little disk operad. It's a right module over the little disk operad because I can use the framing of M to insert disks into my moduli space. Really, this is a sequence of moduli spaces, one for every finite set I. And similarly, I can define Em plus. E m plus. And this is equal to the moduli space of disks in the one-point compactification of my frames manifold N. And this is also a module over EN. Okay, but here, really, it needs to be a module over EN with a disjoint base point, because this is in the pointed setting. And the And as far as the topology of this goes, basically disks are allowed to go to infinity, and as soon as one goes to infinity, then you're at the base point. So this framing, when we insert this framing condition, it slightly changes the relation to calculus. So these right module mapping spaces, or this is the right module. Or, this is the right module, yeah, right module mapping space over the E n operad from E M to another manifold E n. This is it's approximating, it's equal to T infinity of the framed embeddings from end to end. And this is, I guess, a somewhat standard trick. You reduce Standard trick, you reduce your embedding calculus to the framed case, and you kind of get rid of any tangent information, but you still have the same convergence-like conditions when it comes to codimension. So, I want a tia duality, and so you might try to write something. like this. Sigma plus infinity of E m is that in some way equivalent to sigma infinity of E m plus dualized with some suspension? Well this really doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons. The first thing is that this is a module and this is a co-module. And so an equivalence doesn't make sense because these are So an equivalence doesn't make sense because these are living in different categories. Kind of a more egregious thing is that the homotopy type of this thing is not equal to this at the level of symmetric sequences. And that's because this is configuration spaces. And this is like configuration spaces where I've kind of added a point at infinity, but I haven't resolved the non-compactness. But I haven't resolved the non-compactness, which comes from configurations lying closer and closer together. And so this kind of hasn't even reduced us to normal attitude. So it turns out that you can resolve both of these in one fell swoop. So, in his thesis, Michael Ching showed that there's a functor which goes from the category of operads and spectra to the category of operads and spectra. And it lifts the so-called derived The so-called derived indecomposables. So I take a suspension, I take the operad indecomposables, and then I dualize to get a symmetric sequence. And this lift is called the causal dual of the operator O. In particular, it's a contravariant functor. And so there's a theorem, which is due to Shingen Salvatore, that the EN operad is Kazul self-dual in spectra. This is kind of a capstone on. This is kind of a capstone on a long history of Kazool duality. Related results are by Jones and Getzler and Presset and Lurie and Ayala Francis. And this is kind of one of the strongest results you could ask for. And it's that the operat sigma plus infinity EN in spectra is equivalent to a shift of its causal dual. And so this theorem tells you what should I actually This theorem tells you what I should actually be looking for. I should be looking for a theorem which relates my module EM to something over the causal dual of EM. Okay. Okay. Um so So it turns out that there's a notion of causual duality for modules over an operator, and it takes a right module to a module over its causual dual. And so we can say there is a compatible equivalence from the module of disks in a framed manifold M to a shift. To a shift of its causal dual, where I've taken the one-point compactification of M and considered disks of M. And so this is what you could call a tia duality in stable embedding calculus. And we should look at some applications of this. So one application. There's going to be an equivalence. I take this mapping spectrum of write modules over the stable EN operator. So can you say again what what the subscript at the uh yeah yeah so this is this is um This is a type of kind of operatic suspension. So there's something in the land of operats and spectra called the sphere operat. I denote that by SN. And this thing is when I smash with the sphere operat, and then I take a level-wise n-fold suspension. If you kind of play with the dimensions that a TIA duality tells you should be, you'll find kind of I need this shift in there, and it turns out, well, you know, it's the. It turns out, well, you know, you can kind of put that all into the operat kind of format. Okay, so what this tells me is I can write down something which is related to stable framed embedding calculus. Here, these manifolds are of the same dimension, and that's something that you can kind of always do by taking tubular neighborhoods. And it tells me that this approach. And it tells me that this approximation to stable framed embeddings has like an involution, but I can kind of flip things around. So it tells me that to any map of the map, the map is a very Tells me that to any map of these modules EM to EN, even if it's not necessarily coming from a map of manifolds m to n, I can kind of do a Pontriag and Tom construction to it, and this is actually an equivalence. And the proof of this is relatively straightforward given this theorem. The only kind of idea you need is that Kazoole duality on the level of modules is actually an equivalent on finite. Actually, an equivalent on finite. Oh, yes, yes, surely, yeah, yeah. M and M need to be tame. Yes, but yes. So this, this tame means, let's just say they have the homotopy framed. Oh, yes, these are framed and they also need to be tame. Yeah, yeah. So a theorem like this should also be true in the non-framed case. It's just we. Non-framed case, it's just I haven't gotten to it. The issue is that Kazul duality is really only super well developed for reduced operats, which is the EN operat is, but the framed EN operat has more to it. But yeah. So this is like a pawn dragon tom construction in embedding calculus, okay? I guess I have like seven minutes and I'll try to get to good with the calculus. And there is no hope that I get to chromatic. And there is no hope that I get to chromatic homotopy theory, which is probably a joy to many in the audience. Okay. So we have this kind of on-treg and ton map. Now I want to say, how do we relate this to Goodwill Effectives? So there's a wonderful program put forward by Aron and Ching, which says that if I have functors from pointed spaces to pointed spaces to spectra, then I can take the derivatives, I can land in symmetric sequences. But there's actually more structure to this. There's the structure of a right module over the spectral Lie operad. Now the spectral Lie operad is simply defined as the causal dual of the commutative operad, and so we already see the kind of necessary relation to causal duality come up. So, well, the first thing we say is that there is some assignment to Lie modules, but what does this get us? Modules, but what does this get us? What this gets us is that there's an embedding calculus type tower. There's an event calculus type tower, which is simply: I take the right module maps over the spectral Lie operad from the derivatives of the Of the stable representable functor. And then I map that to the derivatives of my functor f. And this is called the fake Goodbilly tower of f at x. I as you've truncated the left and space of what? The I is I've truncated the derivatives. So it's a module in like a pointed category. And so I, so it's the exact same thing as in embedding calculus. If you're familiar with this like write module description of embedding calculus. Okay, and so then, so this is something we can form, and whatever own change Something we can form, and what Arun Ching shows is that this fake tower, it differs from the Goodwilly Tower by the norm data of the symmetric group action on. on on these derivatives. So if my first i derivatives are free, sorry, if my first i derivatives are like finite sigma i spectra, then this fake tower actually agrees with the real tower. In particular, the real tower has a description in terms of something which looks like embedding calculus. In particular, this happens to be a total of the total In particular, this happens when f is the representable functor, sigma infinity, maps out of x. And so something I show is that if I take the map from the Li operad to the shift of the en operad and I restrict along this. So I take my manifold module, I shift it down, and I restrict it to the Lie operat. This is actually equal to the derivatives of this representable functor. But there's one difference. I need to take the one-point compactification of M. And so, what this implies is that there is a comparison of Goodwillie Towers TI of the stable frame embeddings to the Gibley Tower Evaluated at M plus. Okay? So this is like differentiating the fact that if I have an open embedding, I can one point compactify it and then just forget that everything is a manifold and I simply have a map of spaces. And so you get a map of the associated spectral sequences as well. So that's probably a good time to stop. Right, right. So the only thing I know about chromatic homotopy theory is that norms of finite symmetry group actions vanish. Okay, that's like classically Goodwillie calculus. Basically, Goodwilly calculus of functor spectra to spectra splits completely because these norm data always vanish. When you move to functors from spaces to spectra, an idea of Aron and Ching is that in the appropriate either VN local or Kn local, where this is like Marava K-theory or the kind of telescopic land, then Land, then this norm data also vanishes, and you should basically get an equivalence between write modules of the Lie op rat and like analytic functors. And so that is like the basic thing you can say. And to talk more, it would probably take too long. Can you have some explicit things? Do you have some explicit things in mind where you can use this comparison level spectral sequence and do something on the power? So here's one thing I wanted to do. One thing I wanted to do is say I have a compact framed manifold M and a compact framed manifold N. Let's say I just have some map of modules between them. You might ask if that implies that, or you might ask, is any map of modules? Or you might ask, is any map of modules between compact things invertible? That's, to my knowledge, not known. One thing you can do is you can use this self-duality kind of ponchogen construction to get a map going in the opposite direction stably. And so one thing I wanted to show was that you can kind of, you might be able to destabilize this map and use it to show that my original map was actually invertible. So one idea I had. So, one idea I had, which I haven't quite worked out yet, is that if I map to the stable Ghibli Tower, there's convergence results there. And if I got the connectivities and dimensions right, I might be able to use this to, I guess, what's, I'm forgetting the word, but it's when you go from stable information to unstable information. So that's like one thing you could try to use it for. Do we have time for one more question? Do we have any concrete description of like the induced map on the layers of the two towers? Is that easier? Yeah, probably on the l uh well I mean you obtained this map in a somewhat roundabout way going through this Kazoo duality. So after the fact is there some explanation where does this map come from? Well I mean so I think on the on the so so so the the point is you So, the point is, you explicitly compute this as a certain causal dual of a commutative thing, and then use the self-duality to compute this restriction. And all of this stuff, what it's doing is it's lifting classical observations, which is that basically the causal dual of like EM plus, it's what it's doing is it's like it's taking a one-point compactification of the configuration space. So, I think on the layer, In the configuration space. So I think on the layers, what it's going to look like is it's going to be induced by classical kind of equivalences and a tia duality, and should be straightforward there. And then kind of the miracle is that it actually you can lift that to maps of modules. Yeah, so we're just continuing about Lynn here.
