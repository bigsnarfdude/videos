Where we replace normal by commensurated. It's the same statement. If you have a hyperbolic commensurated subgroup of a hyperbolic group, then the same restrictions hold. So what's commensurated? Basically, it says that if you look at the conjugate of H by any element in the ambient group G, then it's not exactly. Then it's not exactly equal, but up to finite index, it is equal to the subgroup that you started off with. Okay. So, and the next slide is the reason I'm giving this slide talk because otherwise I spend endless amounts of time talking about commensuration. So, what are commensurated subgroups and what are examples? I mean, is there a theory beyond normal subgroups? And indeed, there is. So, the first and then the Is. So the first, and this is kind of the guiding example, an example that goes back quite a while. So here, the big group G is SL2, except that the entries are from Z adjoined 1 by P instead of Z and the subgroup H is SL2Z. Then G is generated by H and the diagonal matrix P1 by P. 1 by P. So, oops, right. And so it's and it's a check to see that the diagonal matrix P1 by P commensurates SL2Z. Therefore, the whole group, I mean, it's also not hard to check that if two elements commensurate a subgroup, then their product also commensurates. So you have a full-fledged group on this right side. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is kind of an archetypal example. It's an example of something that could be called an elliptic commensuration. We'll come to that later. And there's another major, I mean this is a theorem of Marvulis, which basically characterizes number theoretic properties in terms of commensurations. So if you have a lattice in a semi-simple Lie group, let's say a lattice in a simple Lie group, then In the simple V group, then it is arithmetic, which basically means that it looks like SLNZ. It's arithmetic if and only if the commensurator is dense. So there's a topological characterization of number theoretic properties. Okay, the normalizer is always very different. I mean, the normalizer of any irreducible lattice is just something that contains the lattice as a subfinite index. So commensurations are, it's a much larger class. It's a much larger class. But the real reason why we are interested is that it connects the discrete world of geometric group theory that we all know and love with the theory of locally compact groups, particularly TDLC groups. So here's the basic example. So you take a totally disconnected locally compact group and take something, take a subgroup K, which is Subgroup K, which is compact and open. So if you take a conjugate of this compact open by any element in your ambient group, it's also going to be compact-open. So the intersection of compact-open subgroup groups, compact-open subgroups is compact-open. That's forced to be a finite index. So, I mean, otherwise you have infinitely many open sets covering. So, this is a motivating example, and that's where you have this connection between. And that's where you have this connection between TDLC groups and geometric group theory. And I'll say more about that connection in a while. More generally, and this is more relevant to us, you take a subgroup G of the whole big group of this TDLC group L such that G is dense in L and just intersect G with this compact robot. So J take G intersect K, that's your subgroup H and G is dense. Your subgroup H and G is dense in L. So then this commensuration property goes to this, goes down to this dense subgroup and G commensurates H. So what would be, I mean given this, it's now relatively easy to construct commensurate subgroups. What do you do? You take any totally disconnected, locally compact group you like, take some finitely generated group, typically a free group, embed it such that it's dense in your big group, intersecting. In your big group, intersect it with your compact open, and you have a pair of groups, a group and a subgroup, such that the big group commensurates your subgroup. Okay? And this particular construction is universal in the following sense. So suppose you have, I mean, so we gave these examples of dense subgroups of TDLC groups and the subgroup which you And the subgroup which you get by intersecting it with compact open. There is a general construction, kind of general nonsense construction, which basically says that all commensurated pairs come this way. How do you do it? And if it's a general nonsense construction, pretty sure that you won't really get much information out of it. But anyway, here it is. So suppose you have a, so this is going the other way. So suppose you have a commensurated subgroup H of Subgroup H of an ambient group G. You look at the set of cosets. So this G mod H, because there's a particularly a geometric group theory conference, G mod H is not thought of as a Schreier graph. It's just the collection of cosets as a set. And if you have a set, you certainly have an action on it. I mean, so you look at the quotient on the right, and you act on the quotient on the right, and act on the left. The right and act on the left. So there is an action there. And then you impose, so G embeds as a set of symmetries, the symmetric group on the set G mod H. And then you look at the topology of pointwise convergence. So you equip with the discrete topology, take the topology of pointwise convergence, take the closure of G in that topology. That guy is this, this is what's called the Schlichting completion of G. It turns out that G is dense in G. Turns out that G is dense in G mod H by definition because we've taken the completion. And the closure of H, the one you started off with, turns out to be compact, compact open because it's a T D L C. I mean, the pointwise convergence on sets is. So you have, I mean, so this basically tells you that H bar, disclosure, is a compact open sitting inside this T D L C group, which will take location G1 mod H. G by construction is dense. By construction is dense in G mod mod H and its intersection with the compact open is H. So this is this totally disconnected locally compact groups and compact opens in them. This is a universal setup where you can go to from any commensurated pair. Alright, as I said, this is general nonsense, so we'll have to go back to our example and see what these things give. And this is really where it came from, and it's connected to this. From and it's connected to this Margulis theorem there above. So start off, again, go back to this example H, SL2Z, sitting inside G, SL to Z at 1, adjoin 1 by P. Then the Schlichten completion is basically SL2, but now Q completed with respect to the P i completion. So it's S L to Q P and the closure of H is the integer P additance. The integer P ns. So SL2ZP. And SL2Z turns out to be dense in H bar, and SL2Z adjoined 1 by P is dense in SL2QP. So this is a particular example, and we can come on. Alright, so I think this is purpose served. Okay, so now what about putting back some geometry in the situation? Back some geometry in the situation. I mean, here the entire geometry of H is completely lost. And here, there is a certain graph that one can manufacture in the case that you have a commensurate subgroup. So basically, you look at either H bar in the Schlichting completion or H in G and just electrify the cosets of H or the cosets of H bar, depending on what your random group is. On what your random group is. And you get something which is quasi-isometric to a graph. And essentially, you identify all the edges which, so the vertices are basically cosets h bar of h bar. And all the edges that go between the same pair of vertices, you identify to a single edge. And there you have a graph. That graph has the name, it's called the Kaylee-Habels graph. So basically, it's a more general construction. More general construction, you can as soon as you have a TDLC group, you can construct this. Okay. Can I say what electrify means? Oh, electrify means cone off or essentially put edges between all pairs of group elements. So here if you have your cosets are cosets of H, right? So essentially, you put all elements of H in your generating set, which means basically all of So, which means basically all of H becomes a diameter one second. Okay. The point, I mean why, why is this connected to commensurations? Turns out that G has a natural bundle structure in the coarse category over the scaly abels graph G. So, where does this come from? So, for example, if you have age, gender, So, for example, if you have H genuinely normal in G, then G mod H is the quotient group Q, and G can be thought of as a bundle over the quotient group Q, where the fibers are genuinely H. And that picture goes through in this commensurated setup also, except that the quotient space is now a space and not a group. So, the quotient space is the scale-abels graph G, and it's got a group structure if and would be if. It's got a group structure if and would be if H is genuinely normal and not commensurated. So, what's this bundle structure? So, let's look at, so what's this, I mean, so let me spell out what this course or metric bundle structure is in general. So, what do you have? You have a map from this graph. Think secretly that E is your Cayley graph of your group. It maps onto G. And what do you demand? What do you demand? The pre-image, your vertices, and your graph downstairs, those are all uniformly quasi-isometric to a fixed abstract metric space, graph, F. And there's a natural map between fibers, well, not a natural map, a coarsely well-defined natural map between fibers, which has this following property. So there exists some constant greater than or equal to one. So if you have two vertical. equal to one so if you have two vertices downstairs you pull with yeah so basically the distance between two vertices is one downstairs then for every point in the in the fiber over the first vertex there is a point in the fiber over the next vertex which is boundedly far away distance less than equal to c and so you have a coarsely well-defined map which takes uh x to y and this i mean so y is you look at all I mean, so y is you look at all points which are within this bound distance c naught, you send your x to any one of those, so that's a coastally well-defined map. So, any such choice, I mean, this is part of the definition of this metric module, is a uniform quasi-example. So, basically, what we are really thinking of, a graph downstairs, over every vertex in the graph, you have a fiber. The fibers are all, instead of being homeomorphic to each other, they are all mostly quasi-isometric to some abstract space. Abstract space. Further, not only is there an abstract quasi-isometry, there are natural maps from the fiber over a point to a fiber over an adjacent point. These are all uniform quasi-isometries. So basically, it's the generalization of a notion of a fiber bundle to the coarse setup. That's it. Where the natural maps are, instead of being homeomorphisms, they are quasi-exomorphic. Okay? So, what do you get, therefore? You have in this Have in this general setup of commensurated subgroups, you have two structures. One, that you have a TDLC group and a compact ropon. That's the total disconnected world. And there is this metric bundle structure, which is something that we are more familiar with from the metric group theory setup. And the idea is to put these two things together on a common footing. And sometimes the group theory from the TDLC side helps you, sometimes this you might. Helps you, sometimes this mitric group theory helps you. Okay, fine. So now let's return to our proof of this theorem where if you have a subgroup H which is commensurated by an ambient group G and both are hyperbolic, so you have restrictions on the almost normal or on the commensurated subject H. That's what we want to prove. So this is the setup now. So H plus So H and this wiggle just means that it's almost normal or that G commensurates H. So both are hyperbolic. Fine. So now we'll summarize and basically say what are the things we can take off the shelf. So the first statement is that the scaly Abel's graph itself is hyperbolic. So basically this was proven by Mosher in the normal subgroup case. Subgroup case. So if you have a normal subgroup that of, I mean hyperbolic normal subgroup of a hyperbolic group, then the quotient has to be hyperbolic. With Pranab, we generalized it to this metric bundle setup. So it forces the K-Lebels graph to be just as a graph, a grommet of anabolic space. And an aside is that in the genuinely commensurated case, where you're not almost, I mean, not virtually. Almost, I mean, not virtually normal, not normal up to finite index. If G generuly commensulates H, then the boundary of this graph cannot be a circle. So what happens is basically that your big group G, it acts on your graph basically by isometries. And that action extends to a continuous action on the boundary and from a very different point of view. Point of view is essentially what's called the Hilbert-Smith conjecture, which was which in this particular case I mentioned one is very classical due to Moncoberry and Zippin. Basically says that you can't have a totally disconnected compact group acting on a circle unless it's fine. So, yeah. Okay, so this is an aside. So G is hyperbolic, is something that we'll need. The quotient Something that we'll need. The quotient graph is hyperbolic, is something that we need. And inside this graph, because it's hyperbolic, you have well-defined quasi-geodesic rays. So look at one such ray. And so a ray here, now it's a geodesic, it's a subspace of a big space. Just restrict your bundle to that. So it's just the same way as you restrict bundles to subspaces. You want to be fancy, look at this inclusion and then pull back the bundle here, this inclusion map, whatever way you like to think of it. Whatever way you like to think of it, you have a restriction of that bundle, and that bundle over this geodesic ray is again one of these coarse metric bundles. And since you're restricting it to a ray, then again, it's not hard to show that that restricted object also necessarily turns out to be hyperbolic. So, basically, the general fact is that you have one of these bundles over Over a core space, look at some quasi-convex subset downstairs, restrict the bundle to that quasi-convex subset. And if your whole thing was hyperbolic to start with, your restricted bundle is still hyperbolic. Okay. Third fact, and I've struggled to give talks without using Ken Thurston Man. Okay, so yeah, so here's the thing. Yeah, so here's the thing. So you look at this fiber. So now you're looking at really this restriction of. You're looking at this restriction. So you look at this restriction and call this restriction E sub R, R for the ray. And so now there's this initial fiber sitting over H, over 0. And that's your initial subgroup H. That's the one you do the normalization, fix the fiber. Do the normalization, fix the fiber over the base point to be H. And so now you have an inclusion of this fiber H, quasi-isometric to the fiber over 0, into this restricted bundle E sub R. That has a gammon-thluster map, which means basically the inclusion of this hyperbolic subspace H or F naught into your ambient hyperbolic space E sub R. That has a continuous extension from the boundary of H to the boundary of. Of H to the boundary of this coarse bundle over a ray. So that means it has this continuous extension from H union this boundary to the bundle over array union boundary of ER. Now this gadget here is going to play a key role, the boundary of this bundle over a geodesic ray. The theorem about which says that this boundary of any such coarse bundle, I think he calls them stacks of spaces. I think he calls them stacks of spaces. So ER, I would call them, of course, bubble, which refers to that as a stack of spaces. Anyway, the boundary of any such stack of spaces is a dendrite. Yes? You know if the idea of a stack here is similar to an algebraic stack? No, it has nothing to do with an algebraic stack. Absolutely nothing to do with the memory. An algebraic stack is more an orbital, because it has nothing to do with it. These are the only algebraic stacks I know of. Okay, so yeah, so this boundary of this guy is a dendrite. So now we have this bunch of things. So you have a map from the boundary of your subgroup now to a dendrite. And so what you do is you pick a point in the dendrite, which is a dendrite is a topological tree. So basically any pair of points has a Each pair of points has a unique topological arc connecting them. So you have lots of cut points. It's basically a one-dimensional, topologically one-dimensional gadget. So pick a cut point, and now you look at its pre-image. So since it's a cut point, it disconnects your dendrite. So its pre-image disconnects your boundary. That's the object that we wanted to look at. That's the object that we wanted to look at. So you look at, so this is just some collection of points. It's a pre-image of a point by a continuous map. So it's a closed subset. And this closed subset disconnects your boundary. That's something that we want to, that's the object that we want to look at. We want really look at just this set. We look at its weak hull, which means just take any pair of points in this disconnecting set L sub P, join them by G S X. Join that by JSX in your subgroup H. So now you look at that weak hull, and this gadget is going to play two roles in the proof, ostensibly contradictory roles. So we want to study this peak hull of this disconnecting set here. So now what about the proof of that statement? So first, we are this Grushko decomposition, free product decomposition along finite groups. Along finite groups, you pass to components of H which are one-ended. So assume for the rest of the proof that H itself is a one-ended hyperbolic group. So then the first thing is that this weak hull has polynomial growth. Why is that the case? And I won't give a full proof, but it's really the, I'll tell you what the idea is. What's happening is that, let me just draw something. Is that let me just draw something? So what's happening is something like this. So you have h, so you have a stack here, and this goes up to infinity. And what you have is some bunch of points here. Let's draw. And this stuff is And this stuff gets flowed forward using this metric bundle structure and it goes all the way. So, essentially, and finally, you have all these four points being collapsed to a single point. So, what this should remind you of is the way horror cycles or horror balls behave in hyperbolic space. So, this gadget, I mean, if you just look at this float forward thing, it turns out to be a genuinely hyperbolic space with bounded Hyperbolic space with bounded growth, and this gadget behaves like a forest sphere. And horror spheres in general hyperbolic spaces have polynomial growth. And the proof essentially boils down to making this intuition precise. So the first statement is that it has polynomial growth. Second, if the subgroup H does not split. H does not split over a two-ended subgroup, or does not does not have, I mean, if it has trivial JSJ decomposition, it does not split over Z, then the Hull has to have exponential growth. And this is essentially, I mean it uses, I think Alex has already defined LLC in his talk, and so I don't have to define what it is. I don't have to define what it is. So it really uses the fact that the boundary of a hyperbolic group, in this case H, is LLC, a slight strengthening of it. And well, I won't go into that, but it's essentially the fact that if the subgroup page does not actually split, so there are no real local cut points, then any set which separates the boundary has to, after doing some minimality. Doing some minimality arguments, it has to admit, because of this LLC property, it admits an embedded cantisect. And so once it admits an embedded cantisect, and you have control on how you embed it, you can make a lip sheet embedding of a cantiset. So that means that if you look at its hull inside your space, that's going to have exponential growth. So you can think of the cantoset as having positive Hull-stock dimension, but you don't like hull-stop dimension, just look at the hull and that has growth. I mean, you just look at the Hull and the Hask, which is which is something like epaule lambda n. Alright, so you have these two opposing things. One, you've established in general that the Hull has polynomial growth. And if your subgroup did not split over Z, it would be forced to have exponential growth. So the only place we can sneak through is basically say that H therefore must split over Z. So that means H. So that means H has, so we cannot assume that H has a non-trivial, has a trivial JSA decomposition. In other words, it must split over some bunch of Z's. And now we go back to Bauditch's way of arranging JSJ decompositions for hyperbolic groups. So you assemble all that stuff together. So Baudit's JSJ is a little different from the way Rip Sensila defined JSJs. It's basically Define JSJs, it's basically the same thing. You can go between them, except in terms of terminology. Essentially, I think when you have a surface group in Baudita's thing, that has a trivial J. It sounds a little weird. It's got lots of splittings over Z, but it's just something that you have to put in as a vertex. Otherwise, there's ambiguity and you want to rule out that ambiguity, and that's the only public does it. So, and then it's not hard to see that commensurations by elements, by anything, actually. By elements, by anything, actually preserves the JSJ. Basically, it preserves the components and therefore it has to preserve the pairs of points along which you cut your group in order to get to your JSJ. So, but if you have a commensuration which preserves a virtual cyclic, so you have that means you have a cyclic group which is commensurated. Now, how do you commensurate a cyclic group? Either you have a bump-slot solita or you have a Z plus Z. That's pretty restrictive. That's pretty restrictive. And neither of those groups can really occur in a hyperbolic group. And your original big group, G, is hyperbolic. So that means basically that there is no such thing. So therefore, the commensuration cannot possess. So that means the JSJ splitting has to be trivial. JSJ trivial, which means basically the one-ended rule that you started off with is virtually SOS. Okay? So essentially, so what's the update? So, essentially, so what's the upshot? Let me just summarize briefly. So, what did we start off with? We had this commensurate subgroup H of a big group G, both of them hyperbolic. We passed to a geometric structure where G was now thought of as a bundle over a graph. The graph is basically the cosette space, but it's the scale-ables graph. And then And then what earlier work forced was that the portion space was hyperbolic. We looked at a ray there, restricted this bundle to that ray, we got a hyperbolic space out of it, and then that particular bundle over array necessarily has boundary or limit set, a dendrite. Use that dendrite and picked some cut point there, pulled that cut point back. We had a disconnecting set in your A disconnecting set in your subgroup H, took the convex hull or the weak hull of that closed set, and then two things. One, that hull has to have polynomial growth for general reasons. Two, if it does not split over a Z, then it has to have exponential growth. Therefore, it has to split over a Z. So then you use the JSJ machinery to assemble all the splittings of a Z together. And if you have a non-trivial splitting in out descents, Then you must have a Z plus Z, or generally a Bond slag solita. Can't have that in a hyperbolic group. Therefore, the JSDA is trivial. Therefore, you have a surface group. So one-ended. So what really goes is the core of this proof is that if you have a one-ended hyperbolic group, which is commensurated by a larger hyperbolic group, everything of infinite index and infinite, then the subgroup has to be a surface group. So that's this. Okay. Okay, so what's the upshot? It basically means that hyperbolic commensurations, whatever they mean, whatever, any reasonable definition of a hyperbolic commensuration is interesting only in two cases where the subgroup that you're concerned with is either a surface group or a free group, and then you allow free products of these. So that's the upshot of this. So this was the research part of the So, this was the research part of the talk, and you can think of it as motivation. And now I'll change into more of a survey. This is what motivated, yeah, so there's a personal motivation why one is interested in infinite hierarchies, and this is the point at which the research part of it essentially stops. Oh, so before we go further, are there really examples? Are there really examples? Or, I mean, are essentially all commensurated groups, just these normal subgroups that we already know? I mean, are there really new examples? The answer is that, yeah, they are there and somewhat bit finicky to construct, but in a certain sense, they are genetic. Genetic in the sense that over and above normal subgroups, they are bound. And this is a construction. Bound. And this is a construction due to Min. What she does is basically she takes this surface group. So here now I have changed notation. Your surface group is A and you take a subgroup of that which has finite index in it. What's the idea? You want to, so basically you want an H in N extension, right? So B has two inclusions into A. Twist one of the inclusions by a large power of a pseudoanosof. With one mild caveat, you want to make sure, so if you have a pseudoanosof, you have stable and unstable laminations. What you want to make sure is now you not only have stable and unstable laminations for the subgroup B, but you also have these finitely many translates by coset representatives of B in A. So you have. In A. So you have a bunch of laminations. I mean, you have a stable and unstable for B, and then there translates, there's finitely many translates by cosines. What you want is that all those laminations are distinct. That's all. Which means basically that they don't have a leaf in common. But if you have two laminations which have a leaf in common, they have to agree. So basically, you just want them to be distinct. So that's the condition that Min uses. And once you have And once you have that, then you basically have your bass set tree. And then you use the way LEAP first. I mean, we've been talking about convex co-compact groups. And I think the first paper, which this was pre-convex co-compact, but it turned out to be convex co-compact, is essentially called a hyperbolic hyperbolic group. So the normal subgroup. So, the normal subgroup is a surface group, the quotient group is a free group on two generators, and I think basically leave the crucial lemma there is this thing called three out of four stretch. Basically, you proceed along three out of these four directions, and any geodesic segment in your surface group stretches along at least three directions. So, that's what you need to feed in, and then apply Bestwina-Feinskip combination theorem. Of the in-script combination theorem, and it basically tells you that the resulting object that you get is hyperbolic. So, this was Min's example, and she really reworked Li's theorem there. And so, there are these examples, and this leads us to this question. Fine, so what are all possible hyperbolic directions? So, essentially, if you have a general normal subgroup of a, I mean, if you have Subgroup of a, I mean, if you have a surface group which is normal in some ambient group, let's say three-manifold group, then the resulting object is hyperbolic if and only if you have, I mean, you can ask, you can define hyperbolicity in two different ways. Either you demand that the universal cover is hyperbolic or gromma-hyperbolic, or that's a geometric definition, or you can ask for a dynamical definition where there are two laminars. Definition where there are two lamination, one gets stretched and one gets contracted. And so that's lamination-theoretic contraction-expansion definition, or you have equivalently a geometric definition of those two via this astrina-fein combination theorem. Those are equivalent descriptions. So, here, what are we going to do? So, here, essentially, one thing that you already have, and this is a reasonable definition, is that you look at the Is that you look at this axis in your Cayley-Abels graph, or look at some direction in your Cayley-Abels graph, because it's commensurated, you have a genuine Cayley-Abels graph, and you have an axis in that guy which is preserved by G. Restrict your bundle to that axis, and you demand hyperbolic. So basically, that's a geometric definition you can push through in this context also. Why? Because you have a bundle, and it makes sense to ask whether the bundle is hyperbolic or not. The total space of the bundle is hyperbolic. Or not? The total space of the button is hyperbolic or not. So what are we asking? We are really asking for elements of the commensurator. So in this particular case, what is an example of a hydraulic element? It's basically this element which, so a commensuration is something that maps one finite index subgroup to possibly, to a possibly different finite index subgroup. So what are those two finite index subgroups here? It's the image, the two images of B. The image, the two images of B into A. And then that's A commensuration, but it's not well defined because you have to say which element goes to which element. So you just said this subgroup goes to that subject. That's well defined up to the outer automorphism group of B, the subgroup. So basically, that's what allowed Nin to basically twist by 5 powers of a silver. Take any inclusion you like, and then take any isomorphism you like, twist it by a You like twisted wire osylax. Okay, so these are going to give you now axes, and you're really now asking what are these elements in this commencement. A question which has a fairly straightforward negative answer is that there are things beyond. So what you could do is basically look at just hyperbolic automorphisms of subgroups. But there are something that's that's small. Out there, there's something that's that's small. So, Minz actually examples are, she also proves that the examples she constructs are not things that you can get out of autofocus. Okay, so this leads us to the study of this commensurator group itself. This group is pretty nasty. So, firstly, it's not finitely generated. This is relatively recent theorem of Artondi and Pogopolsky. And Pogobolsky. It's also not residually finite. This is an even more recent theorem by Burabi and Studenman. Essentially, it contains a non-trivial quotient of the first non-residually finite group that, well, at least I came across. This Bombslag solid R2,3. So that's it's not residually finite. But we can still hope to understand these commensuration directions. This seems to be. This seems to be of the flavor of some very abstract group theory. So, can we reinstate some geometry into the problem? At this stage, we go back to something that was already in existence when I was a grad student. So, this is really an ancient theorem. So, Dennis Sullivan, late 80s, early 90s. 90s. Inspired by basically his work in complex dynamics, he looked at an analogous construction via what we now call the Sullivan Dictionary, and Dennis did not call it that. Essentially, transfer the technology from complex dynamics into this surface group or Riemann surfaces world. And so the space that one is The space that one is looking at, and this is kind of a standard construction, which is why one imagines that Tennis came across it. If you have just some map from a finite sheeted cover to a finite sheeted cover, it's not a well-defined map in any sense. The other things called correspondences, but how can you really convert this ill-defined map into a genuine map between spaces? Well, you make the space more complicated. And so, this is what's called the solenoid. And so this is what's called a solenoid. So this is, Sullivan called it solenoid with the space. I think there's some other terminology called matchbox manifolds. Anyway, whatever they are. So what's a solenoid? So a solenoid basically is, so for us, it's a topological object. So you take a genus II surface, closed genus II surface, assemble all its finite covers together via the usual partial order. I mean, something Partial order. I mean, if something sits above something, if it's a finite index up above the one below, and now you have all these finite sheeted covers assembled along this partial order, take the inverse limit. So that's basically, so that's the solenoid. Described this way, it does not look as if it has much structure. But you can put a hyperbolic structure on this. So what do you do? You uniformize your base surface. So you have your some. So, you have your some Fouxian group, any Fouxian group you like, uniformizing your base surface. And now you look at its profinite completion, which means instead of putting the stuff in the topology, you put the stuff in the group theory, you look at maps of the fundamental group to finite groups, assemble them the same way, and look at the completion. So, that's some topological group, it's a compact topological group, homomorphic to a cantoset. And you look at hyperbolic plane. At the hyperbolic plane, do what's fancily called the Borel construction. Take the hyperbolic plane, you take hat to be the profinite completion of this fundamental group. So everything looks like H here. So H is equal to pi 1s. And this black hole board is the hyperbolic plane. H hat is the profinite completion. So you look at the trivial bundle now, trivial principal bundle of the hyperbolic plane with the profinite completion, quotient out by Quotient out by the H action, where H acts by isometries on the first factor and by group multiplication on the second factor. So basically you now have a more geometric, something more handleable model of the quotient object. So this solenoid, it turns out to be a principal bundle, it's not entirely S, but it's a principal bundle over S, but fibers are these, the profile activity. As these profinal completion of the fundamental group. And then this commensurator turns out to be: there's a theorem of Auden from maybe 2005, around that time, which basically says that the solenoid now has a genuine mapping class group. So I'll say what this PLP means in a moment. But you can basically look at homeomorphisms up to homotopy or isotopy. And that map. And that mapping class group turns out to be the same thing as this commensurator. So, this commensurator group, regarded as this weird object, which maps from finite index subgroups to finite index subgroups, can be all assembled together to give you the mapping class group of a single object. That single object happens to be the solenide. So what's this BLP? You don't look at all homeomorphisms. You have this. I mean, a typical leaf. This is a, if you want, oh, I think that's another name for this. That's another name for this. It's also called a laminated or foliated space, which means basically it's got a foliate, I mean, it's got a foliate, it's got a decomposition into sheets, each of which looks like the hyperbolic plane. And since G hat or H hat is a group, you can look at the leaf through the identity. That makes sense. And that leaf is called the base leaf. So you don't look at all possible homeomorphisms, but you look at homeomorphisms which preserve this base leaf. Which preserve the space leaf. So, what Otten's theorem is, is it says that you look at the mapping class group which preserves the space leaf, and that's exactly equal to this kinetic vector. Fine? So, that's a group. It's a fundamental, I mean it's the mapping class group of some object which is not too far from a surface group. And what about spaces? And what about spaces this thing acts on? And so, the ordinary mapping class group acts on usual criteria space. Usual Tichula space, usual finite-dimensional Tichula space. And so, what's the type puller theory for the solenoid? This is really where Dennis had started playing his game. So, what's the type puller space of this solenoid? And it's basically, I mean, if you can think of it this way, you can go the way, again, I think Beltrami coefficients were defined and used by that. It's very Spencer, was it? Simply? Somebody quadrang differentials. Okay. All right. Yeah, so essentially you look at either quadratic differentials or electronic coefficients on the unit disk. And you're not looking at everything, you're looking at things which are almost invariant under this group H. What does almost invariant mean? It means that you look at the supremum of this quadratic differential. This quadratic differential and its translates by h belonging to finite index subgroups, and then you look at its supremum as n tends to infinity, that supremum should be 0. So this h n basically is finite index circumstance. Essentially, you have this little bit of leeway on every leaf, it's invariant, but you want to pass to a conclusion, therefore. Yes. Yes, yes. What does that mean? Oh, as n tends to infinity. As n tends to infinity. As n tends to infinity, you are limp subject. From n on is the smallest. That's limp sub is what I mean. Yes. I'm a bit confused. So curly, the space of all small vision is the same. Is the same as the solenoid? Now you're looking at what is the complex collection of complex structures on the solenoid. That can be parametrized by these differentials. Just as what's the type Mula space. So now I understand what is mean. Okay, okay, okay. So that so the type Mula space is that okay, and the unit disc is any attachment disk uh yeah? Anything, okay. Yeah. No, it's it's the disc is not the type pillar disc. Disc is your standard hyperbolic disc. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So basically the sheets are really now portions of d by finite index of USA. Okay, so this is basically due to Viswas Nagan Sulligun did it in the 90s, then Dragomer Seric picked up on it and pushed it. Maybe I picked up on it and pushed this theory further. Again, I find this definition very hard to work with of tightening the space. So let's see what we can do with that. So there are certain analytical subtleties, and I'm afraid the answer that I give is not much. Okay, so let's see what are what correspond to quadratic differentials or Belchrami differentials, depending on your case, for just usual finite, I mean, finite covers of surfaces. So, what would they be? So, it's basically a, so you fix, say, you start off by fixing a complex structure on your solenoid. And then you look at leafwise quadratic differentials, which means things that you are going to push your complex structure along. Structure along. That's the infinitesimal change in complex structure. That's supposed to be the tangent space at a point. Okay, so what would correspond to, say if you fix your genus, then you have a genuine quadratic differential there. That's going to parameterize all of your type genuses. But here, you're allowed a little bit of change, which means you're allowed to not be invariant under. Not be invariant under just your original group, you're allowing yourself to be invariant under a finite index of group, which means secretly you pass to some finite cover of your base surface and then demand that on the tangent space to one of those, you have this quadratic differential, which is something you're pushing along. So, if you want to assemble all that together for all these finite sheeted covers, what you require is that this quadratic differential, Is that this quadratic differential, which has the solenoid, has two directions? There's the horizontal direction, which is like the surface, the base surface, and there's a transverse vertical direction, which is like this cantoset. So if you demand that in this transverse direction, the quadratic differential is fixed, then what you're really doing is you're cutting your cantoset up into finitely many compact guys. So essentially you're really doing passing to some finite sheeted cover of your base surface and demanding that you have a productive potential one. That you have a quadratic differential one. So, this is just some gadget which essentially allows you to assemble all these quadratic differentials together. So, a transverse, so these quadratic differentials are called transversely locally constant. I'll call it T L C now on. Alright. So, this is the space of all T L C, I mean, so this is basically the union of the type Miller spaces, in some sense. We'll get to that. In some sense. We'll get to that. So, what can you do now? You look at a surface covering another surface, finite to one. The Teichmiller space of the surface downstairs lifts, I mean there's a map going the other way, the parametrization space of the complex structures downstairs, certainly pull back to complex structures upstairs, gives you an embedding of the tichemula space of the surface downstairs into the tichemular space of the surface upstairs. Into the titanial space of the surface upstairs. So there's a natural way. So basically, this poset of finite index subgroups gives you a collection of Teichmüller spaces now ordered by inclusion. So the union of the lifts of the Teichmüller spaces for all finite unbranched coverings, now that gives you a map into the space. So essentially, this is real. The so the essentially, this is really this dense object that we've defined upstairs. So, basically, what you're doing is you're looking at finite-dimensional triangular spaces ordered by inclusion, and you're looking at a direct limit in the algebraic sense. You're not doing anything analytical here, you're not passing to any closure. Just take the union of all these, via this inclusion. That gives you something which turns out to be dense in the full type of space of the solenoid, which means basically all. Which means basically all, if you're looking at all possible complex analytic structures on the solenoid, then these TLC differentials are dense there. And so that's, this is, so basically what you're saying is that the right type Muller space should not just be this union of Teichmüller spaces, but some reasonable analytical completion of this union. But so far, in just taking the union, you're really doing finite-dimensional Teichmuller theory over all finite dimensions. All finite dimensions. But that's not the Teichmüller space of the solenoid, you have to complete it. Okay, so that was done by Sarek. So he shows that the Teichmüller metric on the completion is something that you can get from this union of finite dimensional Teichmüller spaces. So basically, you can look at quasi-conformal maps on this at any finite level, and then you look at so. You look at so the QC maps, the best QC map gives you the type Mula distance. And then, as you pass to this union, because the inclusion of one type Mula space downstairs into a type Mular space upstairs is an isometric embedding distances, don't distort under finite cheated covers. So, you can pass to a conclusion. So, there are two ways. Either you look at finite-dimensional spaces and you have an inclusion of one subspace into another subspace as an isometric inclusion, you pass through Inclusion, you pass through the completion of all these spaces, you get a metric there. That's some abstract way of defining a metric on the completion. That turns out to be the same thing that you would get by looking at QC distortion between a complex structure and a full solenoid, which means basically what am I trying to say? You can pass to this infinite cover and then complete, which means you can complete at the level of spaces and then look at complex structures. Structures, or you can take the Teichmüller space of all these finite shielded covers, assemble them together, and then complete. And what Sarik's theorem basically says is that these two ways of doing things coincide. Okay, however, and this is the bad news, we've gone into this transcendental world of analysis here. The set of points where of this stylus. Of this type of space of the solenoid, where you have a genuine typeesic connecting it to the base point, doesn't exist. Generic point does not have such a type mula geodesic connecting it to a base point. So these are, so basically this is telling you that the analytical story about the type of space of the solenoid is a little something which you have to be a little careful about. Okay. Fine. Fine. So, what does it have to do with hierarchies? And this is where it comes. So, basically, what was, I mean, what's the base case for a hierarchically hyperbolic space? So, you have mapping class groups or type class spaces. And now you have really taken a direct limit and then you have completed. So, where's the problem? The problem is, as we said, it's really in this analytical completion. This analytical completion, but you can assemble all these things together all the way before passing to the completion. So the initial test case is this dense subspace of the union of the type Puller spaces at finite level. These were given, they have a nice analytical description in terms of transverse locally constant quadratic differentials. So, this is this finite union of finite-dimensional type velocities. So, this is the group-theoretic direct limit, and it's not so bad. I mean, the maps are, yeah, let me pretend to some erudition I don't have. These are hieromorphisms from one trim to the other. Okay. Yeah, so basically, you can look at this union, and then it's basically HHS is including all the way. All the way. But this is just the group theory portion of the algebraic part of it. And now, here's the kind of questions that we would like to answer. What is the analog of the curve complex in this context? So essentially, what's the problem? What's really the problem in trying to address this? Basically, how do you get a combinatorial version of this direct limit of spaces? How do you get a hierarchical structure there? So, what's the problem? So, what's the problem? So, Teichmiller space includes into Teichmiller spaces as an isometric including. That's fine. Curve complexes don't. And this work of Castro and Saul from a while back. And what Castra tells me is that, told me in his office is that it's not just that they couldn't do it, it's a fact of life. The intrusion of curve complex into curve complex is terrible. Which is which is something that you can reasonably easily check. Reasonably easily checked. You have two curves intersecting each other widely, as widely as you like. You pass to some separability Q-serve or whatever you like. Pass to some finite shielded cover. Those curves have lifts which are disjoint. So things which are arbitrarily far away downstairs after some finite shielded cover, they become distance one apart. That's a terrible thing to happen. So basically, just one. So anyway, so what's the analogue here? What's the kind of answer that we would like? So we'd like more. So what's the analog of the curve complex upstairs? I'll give a tentative answer that is given by a bunch of people. What's the analog of Plarit's theorem? Basically, first you want a combinatorial thing, and then you want the boundary to be all possible ending laminations. So it turns out that we have a reasonably It turns out that we have a reasonably clear description of what the boundary ought to be. Though the internal combinatorial structure is not clear, the boundary is clear. So we know what it should be at infinity. What is it inside? Something I think this group of people is probably best equipped to answer. And yeah, more generally, suppose you have such a direct limit of AG just. Is there a way of, I mean, so basically, this is violating one of the This is violating one of the basic axioms of interfaces, which we experience. It's a finite level, so but if you have an infinite hierarchy, let's say well-ordered, as a starting point, so something including into something else, something and further, what happens? Where does it become bad? It's basically the quasi-isometric constants. Those could become arbitrarily bad as you compose infinitely many of them. That's really where the analytical problem and the The analytical problem and the estimation problem for direct limit of AGIS is that's that's where it surfaces in this setup. And really, what kind of answer, I have to give any kind of answer really, put in enough conditions to say that it exists. So what about the boundary? So the boundary is something that we have a nice description of again. So this was again old work with Biswas and Na, which basically Viswa Sedna, which basically says, I mean, there are various ways you can see this. The boundary of this direct limit is the direct limit of the boundaries, which is basically the direct limit of spheres, which is a sphere of infinite dimensions. But again, you need to complete that. So this is basically the TLC laminations on this. And the boundary, and this is again something that Sarik did. So every time you have to take this union, do the algebraic gadget, and then pass to a completion. So Sarik pulled. And then pass to a completion. So Sarik proved that it's the completion of all of these DLC laminations, is the boundary of the full dracomber space of the solenoid. And I think essentially it's contained there that the ending lamination space, which is basically the boundary of this whole thing. So basically you know this is the whole boundary of the type in the space, but inside that there is supposed to be an ending lamination space. Well, you look at TLC ending laminations, pass to the completion of that space actually. After the completion of that space, I should get the ending lamination space, which should be the boundary of all hydraulic variations inside this infinite-dimensional type of space. So, this is the sense in which I mean that we know what the boundary should be. And a partial answer about what should be inside has been given by Bob Benner and Sarit, where they basically do kind of a marking complex, but it's only Marking complex, but it's only in the punctured surface case. So they go back to Hatcher and Thurston's definition of a marking complex and they give an infinite presentation, which is missing in the closed case. So what are the vertices? And this is the kind of answer. This is one case where we really know, have an answer and a good one. So you start with the base point, which is the fairy triangulation on the right-hand plane, and you switch from one triangulation to another by whitehead moves. Another by white-head moves, except that the white-head moves are now supported on finite index circles. So basically, you have this quadrilateral, you take one diagonal, switch it to the other, that's the white-head move. But you do it equivariantly, but equivariantly with respect to some finite index circle. So those are the white-head moves. And if you want to throw away all this commentary structure, you can go back to the metric control structure, but then there is no elements inside. You can still look at all possible ending laminations for all possible. Possible ending laminations for all possible hyperbolic boundaries, and then there's this amorphous space for all dendrite laminations that you get from this purely geometric setup. So then the same question becomes what's the intersection between this and the boundary of the dendrite space. It's the same question phrased from a different point of view. Okay, thank you very much and I can Uh well, a little over here, so why don't we uh give ourselves five minutes and then come back for the last question? Yeah, okay, well I'm not sure one quick question. So, for the translation part, so not all translations are accessible, right? Do you want something to say like accessible by finite software? That's right. That's right, that's right. So that's why you have a starting point, which is the fairy triangle. And then you want to move by these white-type modes. Whatever you can get, that component is your triangle. But you cannot destroy the functional host. It's an infinitely generated group, I think. But it's not the right one. Also, in which sense is that a partial answer? Like, do you not show it's at the bottom, in this sense? Oh, this is yeah. Well, no, no, no. It's not really a. I don't think you show that it's hyperbolic. So it's, but you have, it captures all the hyperbolic dimensions. That's as much as we can say. So basically, along this complex, you can proceed. That's very what is partial. Yeah, that's why it's a partial answer. Also, even in this particular case, it's a partial answer. Plus, there's another reason why it's a partial answer. It's basically the standard. Basically, the standard commensuration that one thinks of in the case of a punctured surface is essentially you look at SL2C and you commensurate by this P001 by D diagonal matrix. But their solve run is supposed to keep the parabolic fixed, can't change things. Which means those guys that we started off with, those P001 by means those adipatic guys are excluded from temperature. So that's another reason why it's a partial answer. One last question. Partial answer. One last question. You said we have a description of the boundary, but not the insight. But the description of the boundary is not a topological description, just what the points should be, right? Like, do we discuss this? No, but the thing is, I mean, no, it's a topological description, right? I mean, you have a, it's an S infinity is the 10 subset. You have a completion. You have a topology on it. Inside that, you have partially, I mean, this PLC and your maximations. And you can complete. Mathematics. And you can complete that. Yeah, it's a description. I'm not saying that. See, the point is if you take limits of all possible rational numbers, it's okay. It's a good description. Let's think one more time. Why don't we start this actually quite soon? So So that's the training code. So like all those guys. So I don't think it's like anything that we have. That's why there's one final chance for like a million dollars. I mean, it's just like a little bit of a message.
