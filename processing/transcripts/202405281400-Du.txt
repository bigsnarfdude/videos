So today I'll uh each one doesn't turn page. If you just want to click on the screen quickly. So uh and now to do that. Yeah, yeah. So talking about a super invader, so uh we cannot forget about We cannot forget about this guy, Australian Cantonese. They were introduced to Australia from Hawaii in 1935 with the hope to control can beetles in the sugar cane fields in northern Queensland. But they ended up a pest causing lots of trouble and without Without controlling the kind beetles. So, these are graphs from the internet showing how they spread in Australia. So, they were introduced in 1935, by 1940, they are still only concentrated here, but then 1960, 75, 80, and not long ago. Not long ago. So, the main reason is that they don't, well, the supposed predators of these cantoes, they do not evolve to handle their poison. So if they, like a water dog, they even leak on the cantose, they would die from the poison. So there's still no control. Control. And there are already some research, important and interesting research. And the biological ones, they concentrate more on their evolution, how they evolve to make innovation faster, for example. And these And these work in 2006 showed, so the ones at the front have longer legs and move faster than the ones behind. So if we look at these, so the ones near the invasion front move faster, they have longer legs. And also, And also they found even more kind of habits helped them to invade. So there are seven habits listed in this paper. And also they observed that these cantoons, they can invade even cold climate areas with lower speed, but they can still invade. And there are also And there are also already some interesting mathematical work modeling on these using reaction diffusion equations. And these models are they incorporate the trait in their dispersal strategy or in the early threshold. So this last one. Yeah, I just looked for some recent ones. I'm sure I would have. I'm sure I would have missed many others. But anyway, so this indicates that there are biological work on the cantodes and also there are recent mathematical work. So what I did, well, it was actually there the story, the story, this was not designed to understand the tank. On to understand the tank holes. And this is a model very closely related to one I worked recently or in the last decades where the delta was zero. So I'll mention this in more detail just a little later. Just now today, the model I'm going to talk about is this one. So there's a delta between zero and one, we assume is a constant. Assume is constant. And that's so we assume u is the density of some invading population. And this, in one dimension, this changing interval is the population range. And this growth function, we will concentrate on just the three kinds of standard nonlinear energies, monostable, bi-stable, and combustion type. And combustion type. So they all share these properties. And this one is why we say delta is between zero and one. So it's normalized that f1 equals zero and fu is negative for u greater than one. And these are the usual assumptions on the initial function. On the initial function, and we will talk about classical solutions. And as I said, in this problem one, we think of it as a model describing the spreading of some species with population density U and population range, these changing interval with the time. Now, this free boundary condition, so this we So, these we have this set of three or four equations. They can be derived from this biological assumption. That is to say, the population changes this range boundary in a way to keep the density at the boundary, just this preferred level, supposed is good for it, for its growth or survival. So, we assume it's aware. So we assume it's aware the growth function f is a positive, that's why delta is less than one. And for if f is a biostable or of combustion type, and these are usually referred to in biological terms as representing strong or weak adding effect. We assume delta is chosen to. Delta is chosen to avoid such negative effects. And some closely related models. And so this one is the one with the Stefan condition. And that can be derived from this assumption that the species make some sacrifice in order to expand their population range. And if K units of population is lost, Population is lost or sacrificed per space tar, per space unit, and per time unit near the edge of the spread front. Then these parameters, the mu, the positive content mu, should be d over k. So d is the diffusion coefficient. So with this assumption, and we derive that. So this is a zero. And in the previous one, the new one. The previous one, the new one, you say this is delta, and this parameter in the position for mu is d over delta. And this, now coming back to this one, this condition actually was proposed to me by Chris Corsnder from the University of Miami. And that was more than 10 years ago. So, more than 10 years ago, at a conference in Taiwan, I think it's around 2011, and we were trying to see how we can find a reasonable biological assumption to derive this condition. And this preferred population density assumption was one of the candidates. It turned out that it should end up with these kind of conditions instead of these zero conditions. Instead of this zero condition. And therefore, so we didn't follow that for quite a while until recently. So we looked at that. And rather surprisingly, so this change of condition from zero to delta with mu equal that indicates that the population would invade successfully all the time, no matter if. All the time, no matter if you use monostable FU, bar-stable FU, or combustion FU. With the bar stable FU, I need to explain a bit more because it's more complicated. So now let's first say what's the relationship between these closely related earlier models. So this one uses stable condition. The other one, of course, is the The other one, of course, is the classical model started from the Fisher and KPP work of 1937. So this is the model where you don't introduce a free boundary, just using the Cauchy problem. It's easier to handle relatively. And for this, no, okay. Now, in all these three models, In all these three models, we will focus on just these three types of non-linearity. And the function Fu would look like these for monostable, and these for bistable, and these for combustion. Now, the basic feature of the Cauchy problem is well known. We know the level set spread to infinity. Infinity with a finite symptomatic spreading speed. And this speed can be obtained by looking at tremendous wave solutions. So in monostable case, the spread speed is the minimal wave speed. For bus stable and combustion cases, this spread speed is the unique speed for traveling wave. And these results are now. And these results are now well known, for example, through the work of Aarons and Weinberger. So this classical work of 1978. Now for the free boundary model 2, and it can be derived with a biological assumption of some sacrifice. And the story is similar. Still, you have these spreading speed determined by looking at the terminal wave solutions. The terminal wave solutions, but this time, whether it's a monostable, bustable, or combustion type, there's always one unique speed. So even for monostable case, it's not a continuum of speed. This unique speed determines the spread speed when the species spread successfully. So we will say in a moment that actually for the monostable case, even for the monostable. Mono-stable case, even for the mono-stable stable case, for the free boundary model, there's a possibility of vanishing, not spreading successfully. And also, we know the relationship between the free boundary model and the classical model one, which one classical model two. So, if mu goes to infinity, then the solution of the free boundary. Of the free boundary model converge to the solution of the classical model. So we can say the Cauchy problem three is the limiting problem of the free boundary problem with Stefan boundary condition. So the density at the boundary is zero. But now let's look at the new model one, and we know. And we know for the monostable case, so we know it's well posed, and the solution always spreads successfully in the sense that the population range converts to the entire R1 when t goes to infinity, and the density function converts to one locally uniformly. Moreover, we can still looking for terminal wave solutions, we call it a semi-wave because this ODE is certified over this. Is certified over this half line, and we can show it has a unique solution pair, a unique speed C star, and a unique wave profile Q star. Moreover, because we know spreading always happens with this new free boundary condition for the monostable case, and we can further show that so the wave speed and the profile. speed and the profile, so these Q star and C star determine the long-term behavior of the solution completely. So you look at HT, the range boundary, the right boundary, and it converts to C star T plus some constant, or this difference converts to constant. The rubber gift converts to C star. The C star comes from here. Here. And the density function is determined completely by this wave profile function q star that way. And moreover, we can also say the relationship between the new model and the classical model three. So when delta goes to zero, the preferred population density number of delta goes to zero, and the solution of the further boundary model. Further boundary model converts to the density converts to the density of the classical model of fluid. So, therefore, in this case, so the classical model is still the limiting problem if delta goes to zero. So, if the preferred density is zero, then the species just would move out. Out even with delta zero, and that's the case in the limit you get in the classical model. If we compare with the two, the free boundary model, with the with the steven boundary condition, and with the three, the classical model, and we can see for two, there's a spread and vanishing dichotomy. So you could have. So, you could have these vanishing case. The population range converts to a finite interval, sorry, converts to the entire real line and the density function converts to one, which represents spreading successfully or vanishing. The population rate converts to a finite interval. And furthermore, we know this length cannot be greater than this one, and the density function converts to zero. The density function converges to zero. Moreover, we can show so these both can happen. So, if you parametrize the initial function that way, you can get a critical number sigma star. So that, so sigma less than or equal to sigma star gives you vanishing, sigma greater than sigma star, the parameter here, gives you spreading. Spread. But for the classical model, as I mentioned, we always have a successful spread. And this is determined by the minimal wave speed C0 and the wave profile, corresponding wave profile function. But there's another story about this logic shift, but today I'll just skip that story. Okay, now if we just look at the monos. Now, if we just look at the monolustable case, this new free boundary problem is not really interesting. It gives you the same kind of dynamical behavior as the classical model. And it's when I looked at this combustion case and a bustable case, I found something very interesting to me. So, for the combustion case, actually, we can consider more general situation. I'll call it a weak alley. So, with some c.0 between 0 and 1, Between zero and one, see that zero can be zero. If we have this F set for that, we see F is a weak alley. And composing top of F is just a special kind of weak alley. If you see the zero is a greater than zero and F is identically zero here, then we have this combustion non-linearity. And this can be more general. And we can show the result we predict. The result we proved for monostable F continues to hold if F is weak alley, provided the preferred density is in this range between theta 0 and 1. So avoid this weak ally effect. Now, if we compare it with the two and three, the related models, two stiffened boundary conditions. Stefan boundary condition density zero at the boundary. Three is the classical model. For both two and three, for this combustion case, it's known that there's a trichotomy. The long-part dynamics has three possibilities, spreading successfully, vanishing, and there's a transition case. For both two and three, we have these. And moreover, And moreover, we can show both these three cases can happen for the combustion case if you parametrize your initial function that way. So that's a clear classification. So these results for two was proved in my joint work with Benjamin Low from Shanghai. And for the for three is from my joint work with My joint work with Professor Martano here. Now, for the biased double case, that's the more interesting case. Well, that's a difficult case, actually. We haven't figured out this one completely yet. So we're still working on it. And for the basketball case to be more specific, we require F to have these properties and these integral is greater than zero. integral is greater than zero. So we have this C dash dot, we can see that one, having f integral zero here in this interval. And we can prove rigorously that if the density, preferred density at the front, is between sigma star and one, then again, the long-term dynamics of the model is the same as with the F model stable. It's always invading successfully. But for delta in this range, as long as it is greater than this, that's where this F is a positive. We believe the same holds. But in this case, we cannot prove it completely yet. Also, for this range, they are stationary solutions for the Solutions for the free boundary problem one. What are stable free solutions? Well, we can find all of them. If delta is in this range, including theta star, there's no stationary solution. If delta is in this range, we have for any delta in this range, the solution v of this initial value problem is periodic and its maximum is delta. And its maximum is delta. And then, if the minimal period of this ray is L, then we can list all the stationary solutions. So these are all the stationary solutions for one. So if you choose your initial density function here, x0 just the j l, j any positive integer, then the free boundary will not move under the density function. And the density function does not change. So, this would be a solution for O T to problem one. And similarly, for this one, these are rather easy to say if you have this periodic solution. Basically, if this is your initial population range, and that's your initial density function, then Density function, then this doesn't move. Of course, you could use this as your initial population density. This is your initial population rate. And then it again does not change. And then, so there are infinitely many such choices, but countably many. So they are all listed here. There are no other stationary solutions. Now, the conjecture is that if you avoid this stationary solution, then your solution would still give you the spreading behavior, as in for the monostable case. And I have a PhD student trying to numerically simulate this problem, and she tried even to start with this station solution. Stationary solution, but of course, numerically, you cannot just input this exact station solution. And her calculation is just this. You start from a station solution, but it still moves. And for a large time, you can say that the density function gives you a clear wave profile. And that's H T. It can now be listen. Boundary condition. Boundary condition density delta. This population constraint can explain constraint depends. You can say if you choose the initial initial population range here, then it will shrink initial. But so eventually it will grow like a linear function. function. If we compare with two and three, well, for positive f, we always have a trichotomy. And also we know the trichotomy each case can happen if you, for example, choose your in the parametrize your initial density function. Now, also the final remark. Well, biologically, I find it interesting. Biologically, you'll find it interesting. So, if the species chose to choose the strategy to expand just a strategy at the very front, have the preferred population density there. And then, no matter what kind of F you choose, it would succeed all the time. And this would be the strategy to generate a super invader. Generate a superinvider. So, would lose to such a strategy? We don't know, but I'm interested to talk to the biologist to see if you look in that direction whether this indeed is the case. But I don't know, but definitely it's worth to talk to them. I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Okay. So could you explain once again the meaning of delta, preferred population density? Only at the boundary of the boundary. But if there is no, the f doesn't particularly make u close to delta. And you assume that at the boundary for some That at the boundary, for some reasons, uh, delta is pretty far. Yes, could you explain answering why uh such assumption makes yes, just uh, yeah, well, we don't know existing well accepted principle for the movement, so this is just a one for perhaps many reasonable assumptions. We assume that the ones at the front, so we can say what's behind. So they can say what's behind and what's ahead of that. And then they make the judgment to expand or retreat in order to just keep the density at the front. We cannot control what's behind. So you can just move. What we can do is just move forward or backward to keep the density at the front. Just with this, it's not very specific. You know, delta has a lot, rather big range, as long as it's in the range where f is a positive. So this should be okay. So we assume just the ones near the front, just try to, you know, move outward or backward to keep, as in the front only, a good basis. A good density for that for their survival. And then this will result in the entire population spreading successfully. Okay, we're trying to discuss it today. Are there any questions from the online audience?
