Thank you very much for the introduction. And I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to give a talk here. So I'm supposed to talk about cluster categories and singularity categories. So at least I have two sections, namely cluster category, which is a triangulated category defined for finite-dimensional algebras. And I will talk. Algebras, and I will talk about it in the first part. And the second part, I will talk about singularity categories, which is yeah, with singularity category, which arises from a commutative rings. And in the final part, I would like to discuss some common structures arising in these two kinds of categories. Okay, so let me start with the first part. And yeah, I think it is about today. And uh, yeah, I think it is about today, and this will be about tomorrow. Okay, so first part is about finite dimension algebras. So, I will fix a base field K, which I assume to be perfect. Because I will be using bi module implicit. I will be using bi module implicitly, so it's useful to assume these things. And I will denote by A a finite-dimensional K algebra. And most of my talk will be about these triangulated categories. So let me recall some basic notions about triangulated categories. So let's T be a k linear On finite triangulated category and we recall that the cell functor for t is an auto equivalence Which are denoted by Î½ such that we have a nice duality, namely om in xy is in dual to om of y and nu x. And it's dual should be here functorially for all. X Y and T yes and we say also say that for integer D we say D is D collabial if the D suspension functor, which I will denote by. Functor, which I will denote by bracket D, is the cell functor. This cell functor is uniquely determined by this property. So yeah, I would call it the cell functor. So example. So for finite For finite dimensional algebras, you'll be interested in the derived category. So, let A be a finite dimensional algebra and assume that this A has finite global dimension. Then we consider the derived tensor product is the injective co-generator on. Generator on the boundary-derived category of A. Then this is the self-functor on this category. Yeah, and this is traditionally called the Nakayama functa, so that's because I use this notation, new or the cell functa. Functor. Okay. The second example, and let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension B. Then, yeah, for such categories, we will look at this category of derived category of coherent shifts over X. And yeah. X and yeah, if we insert a canonical bundle bit and shift by its dimension, then it's the self-functor. Yeah, and this is the reason why, yeah, yeah, why this is such category is called declubia. Yeah, okay. And one more little And one more little notation I will use will be the following: namely, I will denote by mu D the composite of the cell functor and the minus D's suspension. So yeah, in this second example, it is just tensoring with the canonical bundle and yeah, new D, something like that. Okay. So I would like to talk about cluster categories. And yeah, let me start the yeah, state the definition of the cluster category in the most fundamental example or most fundamental case. Namely, the definition due to one mashline, Nickelodeon Todorov. So I will start from a quiver queue, which is which assumed to be finite and acyclic. And as the finite dimensional algebra, I will consider its will consider its path algebra of this quiver q and then and we take a integer d then it's then the d cluster category okay Of the cube is defined as the orbit category of the bounded direct category of this path algebra modulo this z functor shifted by t. Yeah, nothing too fast. Yeah, I find many people looking. So, yeah, I find many people looking at that direction. Okay, but thank you. Yes, thank you. And this is defined, yeah. It doesn't need any, yeah, let's say just assume that C is an additive category and the functor F. And the functor F is an automorphism. Then its orbit category module F is yeah, we want to identify the objects under the action of F. So what we do is not yeah, not to, yeah, yeah, yeah, the Yeah, yeah, the lesson of category theory is to modify the morphisms. So we keep the object the same and modify the morphism space as whole as link. Yeah. Yeah, in this way. Yeah, in this way. And it has a natural composition. And for example, Yoneta Lemma says that we can actually identify this objects under the orbit. Thank you. So yes, so what's nice about this category is that the following they run. So assume for simplicity that let That this integer d is at least two, and also d equals one is okay for Q thinking. So this uh and I will denote this uh orbit category by C D of K Q. Yes, D cluster category of this algebra K Q. The category of this algebra and this. And the first result is due to killer and the C DQ of KQ is a triangulated category and also D collab Y. And the second, yes. Before going to the second part, yes. So, what is most difficult part is that this fact is triangulated, and the orbit category of a triangulated category is not in general triangulated. And this triangulated part requires strongly that this category is hereditary. And yeah, so this is quite difficult. And d cola VL is somehow reasonable because we are dividing by nu d and this should be ident, yeah, yeah, at least quite similar to the identity functor. And yeah, this part is somehow reasonable. Okay, and the second nice property of this cluster category is that, okay, we have the We have the object. Yeah, this part is due to Vermash like Neklaita Todorov. And if we have an object KQ here, object in the derived category, so it maps naturally projects to the cluster category. And this free module, I view it as an object in the cluster category is a decluster to a A decluster dirty object, which I will explain in a moment. Okay. So the definition that the yama and so that in the triangulated setting, I will command so that give a triangulate. So let be the triangulated category and the integer at least one. Then an object X and D is called decluster girling if If the following equation holds, namely the additive, sorry, I will like to denote it by T additive closure of T equals the following subcategory formed by the object in T such that there's no homomorphism to or from T between this. This region strictly between zero and d. And this in a triangulated setting, it is equivalent to asking that this equation holds for this t and t interchanged. No, no, we don't need this. We don't need Calabia property for this. Because yeah, somehow this condition plus T being generator. T being generator or cogenerator implies the other plus the yeah and in a triangulated setting everything is a generator yeah in the sense that well zero is the projective enough projective in the x triangulated setting yeah kind of like that okay so yeah so yeah yeah Yeah, yeah. So, this D, yeah, so this cluster category is a D collabial triangulated category ended with a D cluster theodic. And that's the very nice property of this cluster category. And the original motivation for the cluster category is the categorification of cluster algebra. And yeah, and for that, it was the essential property. It was the essential property was a two-class computing object in a two-color VR triangulated category is important in categorification of cluster algebras. Yeah, yeah, and so yeah, the equation. Yeah. And so yeah, D equals two is quite special, yes. Okay. Let me give an example of this cluster category. And I heard in the morning that we shouldn't give too much A3 examples, but let me write it. A3. Okay, but okay, so and yeah, we should start from the V of KQ. So recall that the arsenal on the right hand quaver of the derived category of type A3 is, yeah, looks like this. Let's say, yeah. And so And so, what about C1 of KQ? Is the bounded derived category modulo nu1 and nu1 is just the Auslander Leigen translation. So we just identify the yeah, the orbits of the Yeah, the orbits of the yeah, under the Arsenal Delhi translation, and the resulting category just look like this. Yeah, this is the equivalent of the one cluster category. So, what about two cluster category? So, we should divide by mu two, which is Uh which is uh tau tau and minus one, I think. Yes. So from this description, we find that the fundamental domain is consisting of the one module category and one more row. So we can take, for example, here. Yeah, that's the C2. Yeah, that's the seed too. Yeah, in general, we see that the C D of KQ is the orbit category by minus of D minus one and composed with tau. So it consists of D module categories is sorry, D minus one module categories and shifted by one up to D minus one and another project, another line, another row or column or whatever. Yeah. And yes, so Yeah, so being hereditary is somehow very special case where we can explicitly understand the structure of this category. Okay, so the next question, next somewhat naive question is that what about non-hereditary case? And yeah, the answer is: yes, it is possible, but we need to. Technology, yeah, we have to use DG categories, differential graded algebras in an explicit way. Yes, we somehow have used DJ categories in implicitly to prove that this is actually triangulated, but in order to. In order to construct the cluster category for no hereditary case, we really need these kind of technologies. Okay. So the texture, yeah, will be like this. For a finite dimensional algebra A. We want to construct something C D of A, which is the D cluster category of A, which we want to be a declubial triangulated category and built with a decluster tutoring object. And for this, we somehow do a categorical operation called the Calabi L completion. The Calabria compilation, we get something, some DG algebra, pi d plus one of A, certain DG algebra with a collabio property. And we do some construction to get the cluster category, and yeah, for and to do this, To do this, I will present the explain the construction here. So starting from something collabial DJ algebra. And I will construct some category CPI, which is actually a decalabial triangle category with a D cluster 2. Yes, so I will like to explain this quantity. Explain this construction and due to clear annual and its generalization by Dingangu based on the work of Kerala.  Yes, those uh those say that R A is the cluster tilt. Yes, so yeah, yeah, there will be a functor from D D of A to C D A and the image of A with D R D cluster, I think. Yes. This is calculated. So how profitable is calculators? So I will start with some notion. So let P be a BG algebra. It's differential graded algebra. We say B is. We say B is smooth. Yeah, B is perfect as a bimodal. So I should explain more about it. Yeah. So remark. So this DE thing is the enveloping algebra. And in this way, we can do biomodule as a module over example open algebra. And so, what is this power? PAR is one algebra for DG algebra. C, we can define certain derived category of C. Yes, for DG algebra, one can define the derived category of C. So that it generalized the derived category of module over C for usual algebras. Yeah, yeah, which yeah, so analogy is that module category over C for ordinary. Yeah, let's see. Yeah, let's see. And this perfect derived category is the smallest triangulated subcategory containing C and closed under the amounts. Yeah, 60. Yeah. And in the ordinary case, it corresponds to the perfect error category. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the bounded homotopy category of finitely generated project is modulus over A. And so I explained what power of enveloping B is. And what it means is that, yeah, V has something like a finite global dimension.  This will be fine. Let me define what this collabial DG algebra means. So a definition. Yes, due to yeah, Winston and Vernon, you know, maybe. So that yes, a DG algebra we B is N colour B L it is smooth and as and if there is an isomorphism between this this scary looking thing and B. thing and be in the derived category of pi modules. And a little remark for expert is that more precisely, this should be defined in terms of calabia structures. This means a lift in calabia structure to be defined as a class in the negative cyclic homology of B who is a class in canonical image to the offshore tomology. Canonical image to the host homology gives this isomorphism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Robial structure. Okay. So so what is this? It's, yeah, I should explain this. So this well, this thing is, well. Is what is called the inverse realizing by module. Yeah, and the role of this is that this tensoring this by module gives a Yeah, it's called it Sita is yeah, simple. Yeah, it's yeah, is this yeah not exactly the cell functor, but something similar to the cell functor, the inverse of the cell functor. Yeah, so this means that the inverse cell functors. means that the impossible functor shifted by n equals identity, which means that this is somehow n Colabia. Okay. And you made a comment once again about the seismorphism. So you say your collaborative structure is a morphism, but it will not work share. Not really. Calabia structure is an element in this vector space. And there's a canonical map to this space to this space. And a negative cyclic homology. And also denote it as H minus or something like that. And yes, so there's a map to here. So this element here gives a map here. And actually, this space is H H H well H H N of V is the homology. So this is the minus n homology of this thing. And yeah, actually, this is bioformal computation. It is the home space in the derived category of bimodule from this one to this one.  So this space is isomorphic to the morphism space from here to here. So yeah, this is Yeah, it's the same. So I should give examples of these well collaboras. Yes. And as this definition suggests, that it's not so easy to give examples, but there actually is a very nice example by Bernard Georg. And it's correction by Bet Jung. So let A be a smooth PG algebra. For example, the finite dimensional algebra or finite verbal dimension. Then it's deformed collabor deformed and collaborative conflation. N calabia conflation is n calabio, yeah, precisely has a canonical left calabio structure. So I will explain this deformed collabial completion in examples from now on. No. So So, what it is, so let me be an example, but it's somehow too general to say an example. So, let me put like this. So, let A be a finite dimensional algebra of finite global dimension. So, this is a, and we view it as a smooth TG algebra and take a bimodule. Bimodule projective resolution of this industrializing biomodule for A bi module. So this is a complex of AE module. So we can take its projective resolution as a complex and let pi n plus. pi n plus sorry pi um yeah sorry this should be n minus one shift of it and let pi n a to be the tensor algebra over a of this bimodule theta so namely b a theta tensor algebra which is as a complex it is the direct sum of It is the direct sum of these maps, these complexes with multiplication given by tensor, concatenation of tensor products. Then, yeah, so this is called the non-deformed in the middle of the. You say non-deformed in Calabia completion. So yes, it's a DG algebra, even if A is an ordinary algebra, because this theta is complex in general. So this, yeah, pi and A is a DG algebra. And the theorem says that this is actually in colour B of D G algebra. So, I would like to explain an example of actually deformed colour completion. So, here deformation means somehow adding a differential to a DG algebra. Yeah, we don't do anything over. Do anything over for underlying algebra, but we somehow part the differential. Yes. So it is given explicitly by as a Ginsburg DG algebra. So let QW be a quiver with potential. So Q is the quiver and W is the potential. So more precisely, W is the sum of cycles, K-linear combination of cycles. Cycles, k-linear combination of cycles in Q or more precisely, it is in the it's an element of the path algebra module or the commutator subgroup and more separately it is the zeros or the homology of k2 yeah yeah. And yeah. So, for example, Q can be this three cycle river, and W is a length three cycle A B C. And dividing this by this commutator subgroup means that we can we are somehow looking this element up to cyclic permutation. So it's a base point base point free cycle. Base point, base point free cycle. Yeah, right one. And define the Ginzbook DG algebra, which is denoted by Q gamma of Qw as the DG path algebra. As a matter of fact, Yes, so how is q theoda defined? And it has the q theoda is a quiver obtained by which has the same vertex set as q and the arrows are compound. Yes, arrows consist of the arrows of q and its dual and also the dual of the vertex. The vertex. And so, for example, from this example, this q theta should be well. So, this dual arrow corresponds to adding the arrow in the opposite direction of degree minus one. So, remember that this should be the DG path algebra. So, yeah, this arrow should have a cohomology. Yeah, this arrow should have a cohomological rating, and this arrows deal to the vertices are obtained like this. It is of degree two, degree minus two. Yes, and yeah, with suitable differentials. Then this gamma of QW is a three collaborator and has a left three collaborator. Okay, now I have defined. So, what I wanted to do is to construct a cluster category from these collateral VG algebras. So, yeah. So, for the setting, yeah, so what we wanted to do is to construct from. yeah uh construct from finite dimensional algebra yeah like this and we are explaining as a more general case we are explaining this part and i would like to finally explain this part yeah yeah so the setting of this construction is as follows so let pi is a b plus one D plus one collabial DG algebra satisfying the following namely the positive cohomology of pi is zero which is equivalent to that pi is a circling object. In the perfect zero category of pi. And also h0 pi should be finite dimensional over the base field V of X and the construction due to clear annual clear annual is as follows let C be the perfect derived category modulo the finite dimensional derived category where dB of pi is the consists of DG module which have finite dimensional total homology and vice versa And by smoothness, yes, we can see that it is the thick subcategory of the perfect error of category. And so this failure quotient makes sense. And the theorem due to a new is that, yeah, we have that this cluster category is D cluster. This cluster category is D collabio, and we have an object pi in the perfect derived category, so we can quotient it to its cluster category, and it gives a decluster dirting object. And yes, so as for this part, we can specialize this results to the case where pi is the collaborative completion of a finite dimensional algebra. And suppose that A is okay. That is a finite dimension algebra, which is so called near definite. So new definite is some finiteness condition, which implies that the global dimension of A is at most B and it is satisfied. And it is satisfied its global dimension is strictly smaller than d. And it is somehow more or less the reformulation of these two conditions on its Calabier composition. So that by B plus one of A, the B plus one Calabier composition of A is as in the setting. Yeah. And then the theorem due to, let's see, yes, it's not exactly written, but for example, it flows from Keller's paper that we have a natural functor from AA. Yeah, we have a natural functor from, yeah, sorry. From, yeah, sorry. There's a morphism from A to its Clavier completion. And the theorem is that if we take the derived pensive product of induction along this. Of induction along this functor. If the functor from the derived category, it's perfect derived category and induces a fully faithful functor on its cluster category and from the orbit category. From the orbit category to the cluster category. Yes. So, yeah, and ah, yes, I haven't explicitly defined. Haven't explicitly defined what the cluster category of A is, but yeah, okay. So it will be, but and then and define the D cluster category of A of A is the C of the D plus one collabial completion of A. Yeah, sorry, or yeah. Or, yeah, I should place more emphasis on it. So, this is the D-cluster category, and yeah, it is denoted by C DOK, and because of this definition, it is. Because of this definition, it is decolabia triangulated category, and because of this functor, it has A as a cluster tilting object. And yes, I think it is just time. And yeah, thank you very much. I have to stop here. So, how explicitly algebra was the function that we are A three is one zero relation. Zero relation, so right. So, what is then the cluster category? This case it is equivalent to the cluster category of type A3 because this is derived equivalent to the A3 with no relations. So, if two algebras are derived equivalents in cluster categories as well. Yes, yes. Because, yes, this is some, yeah, depends only on the derived category. Yes. Can I ask a question about completions? It's perfectly possible we have a quiver with. Possible you have a quiver with potential that is Jacobi algebra is infinite, but when you complete that Jacobi algebra, you get something which is finite-dimensional. Yeah, so if you take a quiver with potential and its Jacobi algebra can be infinite, but its completed Jacobi algebra can be finite dimensional. Yeah, it happens almost generically. Yeah, yeah. Is it possible to define the cluster category? To define the cluster category with a cluster tilting object in that situation? But what happens if only the completed version is finite? Easy answer is I don't know, but maybe it's I don't know, but maybe we can define some cluster category for the completed Jacobia, completed Ginsberg algebra or complete version of the cluster category. And you can do something with that. You can work with the sort of compact with the algebra. Yes, yes. And then
