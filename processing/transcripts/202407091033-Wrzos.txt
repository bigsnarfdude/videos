Yeah, so good. Okay, so I'm starting. Yes, so I'm supposed to say something about formation of blood vessels. So I will talk about my PhD project, which is about formation of blood vessels at the early stage, and I will focus mostly on the experiments and segmentation I did, and I will try to give some insights into what is important in formation. Important in formation of blood business. So let me start with the experimental setup. So maybe small notes I should make here. So first of all, I'm not an experimentalist, so the experiments are done with collaboration of bioengineers. So one of them is my supervisor, co-supervisor of my PhD, Katash Naroyek. But still, I'm working with the data, so it's important to introduce the system. Okay, so we have Okay, so we have small bit, small bit. We are talking about size of scale of micrometers. So we have a small bit here called that we can do. So they are the main part that is building blood vessels. So it's not the yeah, so this is one of the core parts of the blood vessels. And they are stayed with the fluorescent protein, so you can see. And proteins, so we can see them at the confocal microscope. And we put it into the well, so here's the well, and it's full of hydrogel. So this is the, it plays the role of the extracellular matrix, so the surrounding of the blood vessels. We add their fibroblasts, so this is another type of cells. They are producing virus substances, secreting virus substances, also some growth factors. And also we have nutrients at the top of the Nutrients at the top of the system. So they are providing an element for the cells. And yeah, so the size of maybe one thing, size of the piece is 300 micrometers, something like this. And the most important part is the VGA, so the vascular and detailed growth factor. And this is the protein that is inducing the growth of blood vessels. And yeah, so this is the experimental setup. And here are the And here are the pictures from the so we are collecting the images for 14 days and we are taking pictures each day. And here is the picture from the first day. So this is this bit coated with endothelial cells. After a few days it starts to grow, producing sprouts and bifurcation and so on. So some sprouts are some initial segments going from the beach and also bifurcation. So this is the one of the most important Is that one of the most important events that is building the topology of the network location? And also, we observe some anastomos. So, after 14 days, something like this start to grow. This is an artificial environment for the cells. It starts to grow, and also we can observe the elastomoles. So, reconnecting of two branches. Yeah? And here's the evolution for 14 days. Here's the evolution for 14 days, how it looks like. So we are taking a series of such experiments, and we are interested to work with the growth dynamics and how it evolves in time. Yeah, and we can vary the VGF concentration from 0 nanograms per millimeter to 50 nanograms. And the question is, because we're interested in how we can control the growth of the blood vessels, so from the point of view of bioengineering, if you want From the point of view of bioengineering, if you want to create larger tissue, for example skin or some organ, we need to embed the vasculature so it will not die due to necrosis or lack of oxygen or nutrients. So this is somehow important. What is affecting the growth of the network? So here as you see as we change this PGF concentration, we have very poorly developed networks and as we Networks. And as we increase the BGF concentration, they become larger and larger. We have more bifurcations, larger network, longer network, and so on. And this is what we are interested in. So, work on this. I developed some tool in Python, so to do the segmentation of these pictures. And first of all, we are working with the stacks of images. So, what you can see here is the 13 stacks. The 13th stacks, 13 stacks, so starting from bottom, from 0 up to 12, so several stacks. And what we are doing, we are assuming that it's a very flat, so the resolution in z direction is very small, so that we can do projection, so we can flatten the image. So we are somehow losing this third dimension, but we assume that it's very flat. So there will be notes such that they can go one over another, but that this is the these are the anastomosis. These are the anastomosis. This is, of course, some kind of simplification. Here I like to explain what I mean by this projection. So we look column-wise. So the picture is the array of integers. And we are looking column-wise. So let's imagine that we have three slices. And we look what is the maximum value at this column. In this case, it will be 7. Then we look at the second column. In this case, 0, 1, 5, it will be 5. Then we go through the whole picture. And we go through the whole picture, and we end up with something specific. So, basically, this is the flat image. Yeah, and with this, we can flow image, like projected, and we can apply a whole pipeline to the image. So, the segmentation pipeline. So, first of all, we are doing some blurring, removing noise, doing some other thresholding, so we can recognize what is the cell, what is the background, and then. And then also filling some holes that will be present in the structure. Then doing the sculptorization, so the morphological operation that will fill our structure. And finally, finding where is the bit, bit located, this initial plastic ball, let's say. And finally, I'm creating a graph. So I have all node hole connectivity, and where are the branches, where are the junctions, and so on. And based on this, I can measure. And so on. And based on this, I can measure various things like area of the network, total length, I don't know, what else? Number of segments, number of primary branches, and so on. Also, I can measure bifurcation angles. So various metrics that will characterize our systems as it grows. So, for example, in this case, we have one centimeter of a network, of maybe a functional network that is able to sustain the flow. Yeah, so which is nice. Yeah, so which is which is nice, I think. Maybe one thing, one comment is that something like this should be one cell. So they are very elongated, but very very thin. Or maybe two, so able to form the lumen. Yeah, so let's move to the results from this analysis. Yeah, so we take a look at various concentrations of VGS. So for each series, we have multiple experiments and we averaged And we averaged over this series for each day. So we can take a look at the evolution of this parameter for area, this total length, and lambda. Lambda is area divided by length. So this is some kind of characteristic width. As you can see, there is much, huge difference as we increase VGF concentration. So brighter the curve, higher the VGF concentration. So we have three times increase in area. In area, or in volume, maybe, I should say. Also, yeah, the same for length. And also, you can observe that the width of the cells is around 60 to 24 micrometers, which is, I think, valid value for endothereal cells. Another thing is that we can fit the sigmoid, in this case, for total length. And we can measure the separation levels, so how big they will grow. Will grow and saturation. So we see that we cannot increase infinitely BGF. So at some point it stops and it will not grow infinitely. So this is maybe some growth important from the point of view of planning the experiment. Also we can take a look at the growth speed. So it's increasing also with VGF concentration. And also the offset. So by offset means how early we have some first sprouts appearing here at our system. At our Tau SS, so this is the offset, so it is lower for a higher concentration of VGF. So, earlier we can observe that some sprouts are good. So, I think it is nice from the point of view of bioengineering, so we know how the VGF will affect the global hands. Yeah, so now let's move from this global parameters to histogram. So, here I will take a look at segment-light distributions. So, for example, Distributions. So, for example, this is the bifurcation length. We're having segments that bifurcated, so how they distribute. So, as you can see, it's exponential decay. So, like a Poisson process, which suggests that they're bifurcating randomly. So, this is like a particle decay. So, it follows the exponential decay. So, I'm looking at these two pictures, which suggests that it is the stochastic process of the That it is the stochastic process of the bifurcation. So, we do not observe very large segments, and they usually bifurcate with some characteristic length, which I think is similar to the Bar model, which is probably an annihilated random wall, so doesn't have some probability of bifurcating with space. And also, we take a look at the bifurcation angle. So, this is Hanser was talking about this. Cancer was talking about is that for the Laplacian growth, so in the deep growth in an external field, we observe that these information angles are distributed around the value of 72 degrees, which is 2Ï€ by 5. I mean, of course, there is some deviation from it, but as we can see, it is especially for large values close to 72 degrees. Which is also somehow suggesting that um they are following the gradient of B to F. The gradient of B to F. Yeah, so this was, let's say, the established part. And now I would like to talk about something a bit different, more complex. So that we have multiple matrices. I mean, multiple bits in a system instead of a single bit. We are moving to the system then that uh when we can have multiple bits. So you can vary the spacing between them and take a look how it will change the connectivity of the system, uh do they they can feel each other or yeah. They can feel each other or basically answer these questions. And I think this is closer to some real applications of large networks, much larger, much larger. So here you can see the regular grid, and we can vary the spacing between grids. Here is 1000 micrometers, and also we can do the segmentation and take a look at this evolution of these parameters, and so on. And before that, I would like to make some insights into segmentation. So first, I applied So, at first, I applied this tool, segmentation tool I used for this single bit. It was working. I was not very satisfied with this because there were some loose elements, sometimes it got disconnected. So, I developed a different approach. So, instead of this average thresholding, I use some adaptive thresholding. So, we have sliding window which is going through the system. It's computing the value of the threshold for Value of the threshold for small elements. This is the first thing. Then we are applying some morphological operations. So here, closing is that dilation followed by corrosion. Then opening, so this is reverse thing. So the first step, all these small dots will connect. Then we try to remove some loose elements. Again, we are filling holes that we are left with. And then also removing some elements by connected components. Yeah, so here is the comparison of these two methods. This is this old one and the new one with this adaptive thresholding. I was more satisfied with the second one. We can still play with the parameters of this. And yeah, I think at the end this one will be the one I will use. Also, I was playing a bit with the machine learning. So I developed, I think it's the well-established thing. So this is unit architecture used for medical image segmentation. Used for medical image segmentations. So basically, how it works, we need some ground-true data. So I thought that it may be, I didn't have the ground-true data, because we need to manually do the segmentation. So I used this classical algorithm I developed as the ground-true, so as the reference point, and also I was comparing the prediction from the algorithm. And this is the test data for the single wind systems. The yellow one is the overlap of the prediction. The yellow one is the overlap of the predictions with the ground truth. So it was working pretty well, even though I didn't have one label data. And then I was curious if I'm able to apply it to this matrix of bits. And somehow I was able to also do some predictions. I mean, it still requires some work, but I think it will be the way to go. Yeah? Okay, and the thing, now we are going back to these classical segmentations. So this is. Classical segmentations. So, this is for this various spacing, so it can vary from 400 micrometers to 1050. And as you can see, it's as expected. So, this is the area. Larger the spacing, they have more space to occupy. So, the area is larger. Also, the number of primary branches is the number of sprouts initially going from the weeds. It's not changed, I mean, so they are not somehow feeling each other, so they produce the same number of sprouts. The same number of sprouts. Something wrong with this 400 micrometers, but I think it's some experimental thing that requires some investigation. And also, we take a look at the connectivity. So, how many connections we have between bits. So, here we are taking a look at the bits that have eight neighbors. And what I did is the coronoid oscillation for them. And I'm looking at the intersection of this. Volume division with the network, and I'm counting how many intersections I have. Again, I think as expected, if they are closer, then we have more connected networks, so maybe it will be better in transport, transporting some hoods. And as we lower the the spacing, we get less advanced connections until we drop the one hundred five hundred micrometers that we have no connections, so these are like disconnected bits. Something like disconnected bits. Yeah. And maybe the final thing I would like to talk about is what are the applications of this. So one possible application is that it can be used for drug testing. So if you want to create a vasculature, we can add, first of all, this is the control group. So we have just these beads taken in. This is day four, day six. We see that it's grown, regularly grown. It grown, regularly grown, it's enlarged, networks is as expected. But then we have another system when we add tumor cells, the plume system, so they are also mixed into phytocell. And we take a look what will happen as we add the cytostatic giant that will kill the cells. So, as we see, it did not grow at all. So, it also, they also. All right, they also a bit rounded. So, this is something we can measure how the system will respond to the drugs. And this is, I think, something nice that such powerful possible to test these drugs. It is also important from the point of view of like tumor angiogenesis. So, as tumor are able to create musculature, also create subsubstances to create musculature to feed. Fast bledger to feed themselves. So there are different strategies how to prevent this to happen. And again, the segmentation, but this is something we want to investigate. Okay, and with this, I would like to thank my supervisor, Kyotos Emczek, and also Kratos NagariÄ‡, who is my co-supervisor, and probably also with Maca Kishitsky, who is also taking part in this in this. Uh taking part in this. That's part of it. The time evolution of this data uh regulation. Did you take a look, for example, the percolation? Like, because they are at first disconnected, and when is the moment of when the matrix kind of gets connected? I don't know. In theory, it transfers some probably so where each bit is connected, yes, that's what you mean. Uh uh good to to to like measure this. Uh right now I don't measure it this one. I mean only we are taking One, I mean, only we are taking measurement of the connectivity, so how many connections do we have? But probably we should add some, I should add some feature that we can track that these two bits, these two segments belong to this piece and then there is some path that is joined. So I think it's possible to do, but it's still in progress. Two quick questions. First was uh what about the boundary condition on your VGF? Um Your PGF and concentration? Do you just put it everywhere in FOMI and then touch it? Or do you just ensure that the boundary is constant that you have? As I understand it, it is added, just added to the medium with some constant concentration. And I think that's all. Yes, so it's we are not ensuring that it will provide some constant inflow of UGF. Any other question? Yeah, the question. I feel like when you comment on your variation of density of these and what you observe, you say that as expected because the closer. So did you try to rescale your data by trying to identify, for example, if you scale by the density, everything collapses and happen. Can you find some normalized curve of your I'm thinking it's possible. I mean I mean, in this case, yeah, it's not, for sure, it's not normalized, so in this case, they can occupy more space, so that's why they are larger. But maybe there is some factor that will normalize the data system. But I'm not sure yet how to do it. What is the medium exactly for the culture? How is it made? Is there a texture in the medium on the sensor? What doesn't the texture in this case? Some sort of mechanical prepaper of the gel. When you do surface growth, like I don't say you say some jets, generally there is some sort of uh roughness and the sense following the roughness. Yes? Terminal run in hydrogen also? Terminal run in hydrozole, but but I'm not sure if still what is their texture in this in this case. It's not uniform, it's not smooth. And not only it's not smooth, I'll be sure, but when cells start to develop inside it, they pull on the medium and they generate some kind of relief. I can imagine that they can do some kind of fractures inside the gel, so like they are going. So, like they are going through the medium, creating small fractures. And yeah, I think this is one of the mechanics how they communicate, so that they can feel each other through this deformation of the medium. Maybe this is one of the explanations how they can recognize. You have only a total cell culture medium, no, in the experiments. And that one has the rheological properties of water. So I'm not sure it really is a hydrogel what you put in the experiment. Hydrogen shell, what you put in the experiments because you don't do them. But normally, to keep the cells alive, there's something called the cell called your media, and this one has exactly like biological properties of water. So I don't think there's much structure of it. It's a liquid. The one I talked about is even this is a kind of gel. Well how do you keep cells alive? I think this is a good discussion for uh discussion at the end of this discussion. So you okay?
