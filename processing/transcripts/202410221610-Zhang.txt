Today my topic is about the 3D sharp geometric volume fluid method for simulating evaporation and the battery solidification problems. So from the title you see that the seems that the two problems are very different. One is evaporation, the other is a battery solidification. But for me they are very similar because for evaporation or battery solidification and they are the They are the fixed challenge process that they are not mainly driven by temperature, but also driven by the solute concentration. So they are very similar. Although one is liquid gas problem and the other is a solid liquid problem. So I will introduce how to construct a sharp geometric volume fluid method in handling these two problems. Okay, so this is about. Okay, so this is the background. We know that evaporation is very ubiquitous in nature and the industrial production. For instance, the very interesting phenomena of the teeth, of wine, and the spray cooling. Also, we looked at a very important problem in the laser impact on tin droppies in the EUV. Okay, so they also the main problem in this scenario is the evaporation of the tin. Is the evaporation of the tin droplets in a very short time? Okay, for the battery surrification is widely encountered in the metallurgy. For instance, the dentistic growth. So this is the very beautiful pictures from some publications. Okay, we know that in the material sense, most of the maybe most of the studies focus on the experiments. Studies focus on the experiments, but actually, because of the liquid matter, for instance, the cooper or the other liquid metals, they are opaque. So it's very difficult to measure them in experiments using the camera-based techniques to capture the structures of the dangerated growth. So it's very difficult for experimental study. study and also owing to this weaklies it's very difficult to reveal the mechanics governing the solidification actually so for for for me I'm a for for me a safety guy so I think that it's we were benefit beneficial from benefit from developing accurate and sharp remote methods to modeling the battery certification. I emphasize that we use the I emphasize that we use the sharp method. It differs in some maybe commercial software, they prefer the diffusive methods to model such phase change problems owing to the good performance in numerical stability. But we think that maybe a sharp method will be more accurate. Okay, so Okay, so firstly we will see about the evaporation problems and then we will tend to the solidification and I will show that the two problems are very similar in governing equations and the numerical schemes. Okay, so we know that without phase change, in compressible flow, the mass equation, the momentum equation, the energy equation, and the interface, the propagation of the interface, Propagation of the inface, they are very well known for everyone. But if there is in the presence of phase change, it means that the liquid becomes the gas, the vapor or the vapor becomes the liquid. So they have some distinction, there are some distinguished behaviors compared to the problems without face change. The first one is that the mass flux, there are mass flux across the interface. Flux, there are mass flux across the interface. It means that, okay, because the liquid transitions to the vapor or the vapor transition to liquid. So it means that the velocity, the damage of the velocity is no longer zero. So the velocity is no longer damaged free. Even for an incompressible flow, it depends on the mass flux. So m dot is the mass flux. Is the mass flux. Okay, because we know that the volume of fluid equation comes from the mass equation. So it means that, okay, the propagation of the volume fraction is also purely advection equation, but it has a source term. This source term also comes from the flu mass flux, okay? Uh, flux mass flux. Okay, so this is the first distinct distinction compared to the problem without phase challenge. The second one is the temperature and the concentration is no longer continuous. It means that flux, flux of the temperature and the concentration is no longer continuous across the interface. There is a sharp jump, a jump across the interface because the hate, partly of the head is. Partly of the heat is absorbed by the phase change progress. So it means that the gradient of the temperature or the temperature flux is discontinuous across the interface. And also, it's the same problem for the soluous concentration. So we must admit that also the allerge equation and the concentration equation are also. Also, are still the convection and the diffusion equations. But at the interface, there are sharp jump conditions for the two scalars. So the main difficulty to solve the two equations is how to impose this jump conditions at interface. If you want to use a sharp interface method, it means that you have to impose it sharply at interface without smaring it to the neighboring. It to the neighboring in grades to maintain the physics. So, this is the second problem for solving the temperature and the concentration equations with this challenge. And the third one is that not only to solve the two equations, a long travel was of common convection and diffusion equations. Diffusion equations, but the two scalars, the temperature and the concentration, are strongly coupled at the interface. It means that the two, you see that this is the jump conditions of the heat flux, this is the jump conditions of the flux of the concentration. The two, they work together to determine the mass flux. It means that the jump conditions between the of the temperature and the concentration, they are a lot in tip. Concentration, they are a lot independent. It means that you can't solve the temperature field and solve the concentration field in separate equations. They are coupled together through the mass flux. So this is the coupling between the jump conditions and also you will see that the t tau t gamma, it means that the it means that t gamma is the interfacial. T gamma is the interfacial temperature and the interfacial concentration. They are also coupled together at interface through the saturated pressure of the evaporation. So it means that not only the two scalars are covered, are strongly covered at the interface. So it means if you want to solve the momentum, solve the flow equation, you should you should you should notice that there is a jump over mass flux at interface and if you want to solve the temperature and the concentration equation it means that there are also jump conditions for the truth scalars at interface and the two scalars are also strongly coupled at interface through the truth correlations. So the problem for solving the face challenge problem the difficulties to solve the face challenge Difficulties to solve the face jump problems are the difficulty to impose these interfacial jump conditions. So if okay, so sorry, this is phase challenge is not without. So if this in the presence of phase challenge, the mass equation, the allergy concentration equations are different from those. are different from those for the flow fields without phase change. For the mass equation, you see that the divergence of the velocity is non-zero. And for the allerge and concentration equations, there are jump conditions and the two are coupled at the interface. So and also for the volume of fluid equation, there is also a source term. So our goal. Our goal, our target is to solve these equations, which are coupled together at the interface. Okay, so we know that there are two strategies to solve the problem. One is the diffusive method. The second is the sharp method. For the diffusive method, we know that the advantage is that it's very stable and it's very easily implemented because you don't need to impose the jumping conditions at interface, but you just conditions at interface but you just transfer transfer the jump conditions for the flux into source terms into the into the governing equations and also because you you smell the the the source term and you you smell the jump conditions at the interface into the neighboring grades so that uh so that the the new the numerical stability can be well preserved but uh also uh you you Also, you have to decline the physics because in physics there are very strong jump conditions at the interface, but you smell it artificially. Okay. So this is the difference between the diffusive method and the jump interface method. For the diffusive interface method, you see that we transfer the jump conditions into the source term, into the governing equations of the temperature. So it's unable to capture. So it's unable to capture the jump conditions very sharply, but it smells into the laboring grids. But for a sharp interface condition, if this equation condition is very easy to just maintain the interface at the saturated temperature, but actually for our problem, it's more complicated than this condition. But if you can impose this condition at interface, that means that you can able to capture the jump conditions sharply. The jump conditions sharply. You notice that it's a lot like a solid liquid carbon problem because for liquid gas problem, the interface is deforming and moving with the fluid. So it means that you have to impose the sharp jump conditions at the interface every time step. Okay, so this is the difference between the two strategies. And for us, we will. And for us, we prefer to use the second strategy, to use a sharp interface method. We find that we implement the R code in an open source library of Business. Maybe someone knows that. It's very popular in Visual Servo. Okay, but what I introduced today is our own work based on this library. So to first one, the first problem is to solve. The first problem is to solve the mass flux calculation. It means that you have to calculate the flux at the liquid side and the height flux at the vapor side from the interface. The two are different because there's a jump condition between the two. So I mean that if this is liquid, if this is the vapor, so in a liquid gas, in a liquid phase, we can construct an interpolation scheme only use the only use the values of the temperature at the interface at the liquid phase T1, T2 and T gamma. So using the three temperature values you can construct a second order accurate interpolation scheme to obtain this one. And likewise you can also construct an interpolation scheme to estimate the lambda temperature. the lambda temper lambda t of vapor in the in the vapor field field so we obtain these two to flux in a very sharp manner to estimate the m dot okay the second one is how to to solve the temperature temperature equation by by imposing the interface in the jump conditions of the temperature okay so Of the temperature. Okay, so for the diffusing method, you see that they always put the jump condition as the source term in the left-hand side of the equation. But this one is absorbed by the interface as a latent heat source. But drawback is simple, but unphysical. But with the present sharp method, okay, we have to solve the convective term in a very sharp manner and also. In a very sharp manner, and also to solve the diffusive term in a sharp manner. For us, for the present method, for the convective term, we didn't use the Villow scheme or some other schemes to give the sharpness of the numerical schemes. But we calculated the convective of the temperature using a geometric scheme in consistent with the transportation of the warm-fluid. With the transportation of the warm-fluid mass equations. It means that when we transport the interface by using a geometric scheme, at the same time, we also calculate the transport of the allerge corresponding to the temperature convective term. So we find that to keep the consistence between the two, we will get more Get more stable results and the unexpected parasite currents are greatly decreased. So, this is why we choose to update the convective term using the geometric scheme. And the last is how to discrete the diffusion and term. Previously, they always used the valid diffusion. they always use the valid difference method to maintain the surface of the phallic of the viscous term by employing the temperature at the interface as the boundary conditions. But we think that the fallite volume method has good performance in conservation. So we use the fallite volume method to conserve the allergy. It means that in such It means that in such a mixed grid, partly belong to the upper phase, partly belong to the nuclear phase. So after we construct the interface using a geometric volume-friendly method, we put it as a embedded boundary embedded and embedded boundary, and we calculate a flux in this face, S-phase, S phase, and also across the interface. Look at one. phase. Looked at when we discrete the, when we estimate the flux at the part phase covered by the liquid, we just use the values of the temperature in the liquid phase. So preventing the calculation of the flux contaminated from the vapor phase. So we also use this strategy to keep the sharply keep the sharpness of the newcomer method okay so by using by by using this above mentioned sharp sharp sharp sharp sharp method we can update the temperature in a sharp in a sharp manner okay so for the solution of the concentration equation it's very similar it means that for the convective term of the concentration we also use the geometric Concentration. We also use the geometric scheme as temperature. And for the phallic, for the diffusion term, we also use the phallate volume method. But right now, the problem is that we see that the jump conditions for the concentration is if because the mass flux is calculated from the jump condition of the temperature. So this is already low. But for this condition, we find that it's more or less like... Is more or less like a robin boundary condition. So, the problem is that how to construct an interpolation scheme to solve the y gamma using the robin boundary condition. We don't load the gradient, we don't load the y gamma. The strategy that we employ the previous mentioned interpolation scheme to estimate partial y partial m from the y gamma. So, in this From the y gamma. So in this equation, the only unknown variable is the y gamma. So we can calculate the y gamma from the m dot. So this is also maintained the sharpness of the interface. Okay. So in summary, we designed a sharp, sharp, sharp scale, sharp method to solve the The temperature equation and the concentration equation by imposing the jump conditions. It has the advantage of the conservative lease and the sharp interface representation and the combined with the embedded boundary method to impose sharp jump conditions. The strategy we change the diffusive volume fluid method into such a sharp volume of fluid method. And also, we see that if you use method and also we see that if you use if you use the the blue line if you use a diffusive method you see that okay you you can also get a reasonable result but it's only first order but if you use a sharp interface method you it has you you obtain the second second accuracy accurate order okay so this is the overall steps i will not repeat here so we will see the Here. So we will see the tests. The first one is the sucking problem: it means that the liquid is superheated, and the liquid is going to evaporate only to the superheat. And so the part of the liquid becomes the vapor. And the vapor pushes the interface from left to right. And we compile the interface position with the analytic solution. And also we compile the temperature. temperature distribution line along the along the x position. We found that okay with fine grid we find great with refined grades we find that our results align with the theoretical predictions. And also we find that the previous sharp method always Uh uh the waist face to the uh numerical instability owing to the very sharp jump at interface. And you see that the velocity field across the interface were also late. This is only to the parasite currents appeared at interface. If you if you use a lot very good uh sharp interface method, but in our method we can suppress the oscillations uh so it's not accurate, it's not only accurate but also. Is not only accurate but also stable. Okay, the second problem is the evaporation of the water troplet. It means that if we put a water troplet in the aisle, the water troplet will evaporate owing to the temperature and owing to the humidity in the air. So you will see that during the evaporation, the interface absorbs the heat that decreases the absorption temperature until The droplet temperature until the droplet temperature reaches the wet back temperature. So it means that the wet back temperature depends on the humidity of the in the air. We find that if we give humidity of the air, we find that our computed wet back temperature can fit well with the analytic solutions. And also, we find that okay, this is the Temperature inside the droplet, how it evolves with the time. We find okay, it finally converges to the bulk temperature. Okay, so this is the evaporation of the water droplet. And also the last very challenging problem we are interested in is the latent flow droplet. It means that if the plate or the pore is very hot, but the droplet impact onto impact onto the plate or pull, the hot plate or pore will make the droplet to evaporate or film boiling. So the droplet will not contact with the plate or pore because there are very thin film, evaporation film between the droplet and the pore to separate. To separate the droplet and the pore. So, this problem is very hard to simulate because you have to capture the very same film between the two in numerical simulations. So, it requires very good numerical methods for evaporation modeling. So, you see that the same film. The thin film between the drop and the pull are very, very thin. Okay, so, but all our methods can actually accurately capture such thin film. You see that this is the drop-lead to impact into the onto the firstly on the flat plate. You see that have interactions between the two, but keep in mind that they are not touched. They are not touched. There is a very simple between the two. And you will see that this is the height of the radius of the droplet. We compare it with the experiments. And this is the height of the droplet. We also find that we have the converging solutions with refined mesh. So this is a comparison with the experimental results. Also, we also compare our results. Compare our results. We also simulate a droplet impacting onto a hot pore. So it's more challenging than the flat plate because the droplet and the pore both deform. So you see that the shape of the droplet and pull, the solid line is our map results and the dashed line is from the Dash line is from the theoretical model. Found the two results compared agree very well with each other. And also, we extend our numerical simulations, our numerical methods to the multi-component evaporation or dissolution problems. It means that, for instance, we also simulate carbon dioxide bubble dissolves in the water. Bubble dissolves in the water. You see that during the rising of the bubble, the carbon dioxide will dissolve in the water. But in nature, the oxide and the nitrogen will enter to the bubble because they are also dissolved in the water. So it means that at last the bubble will uh the the bubble will only composed of the uh oxidized and the nitrogen and nitrogen so you mean you see that after after some some time and the initially uh fully uh carbon dioxide uh will disappear it the the the component will will decrease from uh 100 percent to zero because it will fully dissolve in the water but uh the detroit and the oxygen diesel and the oxidized gas will enter the bubble from the water so it becomes a fully air bubble so it means that you have to treat the different components for evaporation or dissolution very well in email simulations okay okay so next we will we will introduce the solidification problems actually they are very similar with the evaporate evaporation problems before the evaporation problems because you have to solve the temperature equations and the evaporation of the concentration problems the equations but we dropped the convective term here for simplification because we we think that this term is a lot very difficult to handle. But actually in simulations we we considered the convective term okay and so the problem is all also the jump conditions at interface. The jump conditions at interface means that the propagation of the interface and V gamma depends not only on the temperature jump at the interface but also on the jump of the concentration at the interface. And also the T gamma and the Y gamma means that temperature at interface and the concentration identifies, they are strongly coupled at interface, at the interface via this Gibbs-Thomason equation. So it means that, okay. equation. So it means that, okay, you have to impose the jump conditions very sharply at the interface and also you have to couple the two scalars at the interface. So it also, the difficulty also lies in how to impose sharp jump conditions and also how to couple the solution of the temperature and the concentration at the interface. So this is very similar with the previous evaporation problems. So actually we also use the sharp interface method to the mean the two-fluid model. The mean the two-fluid model, we solve the two domains separately by using an embedded boundary method. That is, even if the grid is a mixed grid composing of the liquid and the solid, but we decompose the two into two parts and we calculate the flux in the corresponding grid field. in the corresponding grid faces and the under the underface so this is the strategy okay but the problem uh nice in a lot of a lot of the the other problem is actually the other problem the other problem is that we know that as we as we state stated that the vtau not only depends on the jump position of the tau but also depends on the uh why So it means that you can compute the rate the V gamma from the T gamma and the gradient of the T gamma. Then using the V gamma to update the Y gamma by solving this boundary condition. And you can also estimate the V gamma from this equation and then update the T gamma and from this boundary condition. So there are two strategies. So there are two strategies, but the file, but ultimately you have to make them reach the steady state. But they are very different, but the two strategies are very different because for this one, if you load V gamma, it means that this is a jump condition of the gradient. This is very difficult to solve in maximizations. in in my simulations but this but for but but if you if you load the v gamma to solve this equation it's only it's it's only a robin type boundary condition so the solution of the two jump conditions are very different so actually so it means that if you load the velocity to update the concentration and using the weakamp and then to update the temperature and then back to the velocity so the other strategy is to to reverse is to reverse the solution of the temperature and the concentration. The two means that you have to solve two types of boundary condition problems. So you have to design very different interpolation schemes to solve the boundary jump conditions. So which which one to choose? It depends on the on on it it it actually it depends on the diffusion. On the diffusion of your scalar. It means that if your concentration diffuses very fast, so you have to solve the concentration equation first because it requires very small time step compared to that of the temperature. So, which strategy you select depends on the Select depends on the diffusion coefficient of the two scalars. Okay. Okay, so we also design different schemes to impose the different jump conditions. One is the robin type condition, the other is the gradient jump condition. So they are very different. I will not detail them here. Okay, so we will see the results. The first one is the 2D unstable solidification. It means that if there is a clean it of the clean it of the uh of the of the uh of uh there is a crystal clean it it will solidifies or into a temperature and we find that if the there is anotropic capillary effect coefficient it will become a force fold uh density you see so this is a this is a film you will see that our results this is our name results That all results, this is almost results. You will find that it goes from a solute circle shape to a force-fold crystal. And this is the 2D unstable battery solidification. That means that the growth of the solidification are governed by both the temperature and the solutes concentration. You find that you see that there are very unstable structures. There are very unstable structures at the branch of the arm. So, this is the typical feature of the battery solidification. It will be more challenging for numerical simulations because these small structures are very apt to be numerical instability. But our results compare well with the previous numerical results. And this is the boundary layer of the temperature, boundary layer of the Layer of the temperature, boundary layer of the concentration field, you see that the solid boundary layer is much much thinner than the temperature field. So it means that you have to solve the concentration field first and then using the concentration field to update the temperature field accordingly. Okay, so this is 3D results of the battery solidification. Okay, so this is the battery solidification of angloy. It means that if this is a solid If this is a solid and this is a liquid, if you give some cooling at the bottom of the solid, it will growth owing to the solidification of the liquid. If the cooling velocity is very low, it keeps a planar growth. But if the cooling velocity is very fast, it becomes unstable in physics. So it will become a cellular growth. A cellular growth or a density trigger growth. So if you control the holding velocity, you will obtain different or distinguished patterns of the tangent structures. You will see that, okay, if we using a very low cooling velocity, you see that the interface velocity approaches the Is the theoretic prediction? It maintains at the plylar growth. But if you further increase the cooling velocity, you will obtain the senular growth. And the most dangerous wavelength agree very well with the analytic predictions. This is the wavelength value versus. versus the cooling velocity. Okay, so if you use you if you further increase the promote the cooling velocity, okay, the structure will have been more unstable, that it will have become statentic growth to secondary arm of structures. Okay, so this is a numerical results. Okay, so you will see this. So you will see that the red one is the bubble, the gas bubble, and the yellow one is the growing density structures. You see that the density growth will interact with the bubble. So this is a very complex liquid gas and solid problems. And so this is this is a simple the growth of the dendrite will capture the bubble at the liquid. Okay. liquid okay so we should also uh simulate the freezing chocolate you mean that uh you put a water chocolate at the at the interface it will freeze and we can simulate a very interesting and singularity singular tip at the at the tip of the circuit compare well with the below with the requirements and also this is the interaction between the dendrit and the bubble if you impose different bubble if you impose different uh cantart angles zero uh forty five and uh uh ninety and uh one hundred and si thirty thirty five okay and we also can simulate the s field this is i sphere uh that uh melt in the uh forced convection so you will see that okay so this is the initially a sphere uh ice it will melt in Ice, it will melt in the warm water. In the presence of temperature and the soil and the salt, it means that it's not a pure water, it's more like sea water. So the melting of the velocity of the ice field depends on the temperature and the surgery in the water. So you will see that it decreases. Okay, so this is the conclusion. Thank you for your attention.
