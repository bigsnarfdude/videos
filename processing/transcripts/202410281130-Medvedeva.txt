And yes, as Kinadia mentioned, I'm a PhD student in the University of Manchester, and I'm going to talk about the recent bit of the research I've done in collaboration with my supervisors Anastasia and Rafael. And here is the outline of my talk. I'm going to provide a little bit of a context for my problem, formulate. Formulate it and then provide some simple example of the method I'm going to use. Then I will show you the matrix minimum equation and discuss in the end the possible approaches for a solution of this matrix. So, sorry, starting from the motivation, there are several, there are many well-known There are many well-known canonical scattering problems, as, for example, scattering by a half-plane, finite strip, or scattering of a waveguide moved by a finite screen in a waveguide. So these canonical problems are formulated on the continuous medium, but in my research, I am interested in their discrete. Discrete counterparts, which are instead formulated on a discrete lattice, square lattice in my case. So instead of the continuous half-plane, we have a discrete half-plane, discrete strip, and discrete waveguide. So there are several points of view on this discrete lattice I'm talking about. The first one would be just to consider it as a discrete. It is a discretized version of the continuous acoustic problems. So we can see that the discretized Laplace operator here in the limit just tends to the usual Laplace operator here. So we can think about our problems on the lattice as a simply discretized version of the acoustic problems in the continuous medium. And the other point of view would be to View would be to think of our lattice as a mass spring system, which consists of the small masses connected together with the elastic links. So the equation of motion for such a system, where our masses can only oscillate in the anti-plane direction, the equation of motion in the time harmonic. The time harmonic case leads to the very same discrete Helm Golds equation as if we simply discretize our continuous Helm Golds equation. And yeah, this model is widely used to describe some wave propagation in, for example, solid mechanics and some other phenomena, and to describe the properties of some. Describe the properties of some materials with the well periodic properties, such as acoustic metamaterials, for example, and many, many more. So, this model is widely used. And this is, well, these two points of view is roughly why we are interested into these discrete versions of my problem. So, in my research, I'm using the Rinachoff method to which this whole To which this whole conference is devoted. And I'm sure everybody's familiar with the continuous Winnerhof. And the main difference with the discrete Winerhof technique is that instead of using the continuous discrete Fourier transform, apply... So we know that in the continuous case, we're going to apply the continuous Fourier transform to our equation and somehow receive the winner. Receive the Winhof equation in the end. Here, to my discrete Hankel's equation, obviously, I'm going to use the discrete Fourier transform, which is where my functions u plus and u minus are analytic outside of the unit circle and inside of the unit circle. Whereas in the continuous case, we have the areas of analyticity in the upper and lower half plane of the complex planes. Plane of the complex plane Z. So, and well, then the same, the very similar procedure to the continuous case is going to be followed. So, here is an example of the scale of in-Hoff equation. We just need to follow the very classic steps, factorize the kernel K, split the force intern. Split the forcing term and applying the Liouville's theorem together with the conditions at infinity, we can obtain the solution. So, as an example of the scalar discrete Winhof equation solution, we can refer to Sharman beta here. So, now I will formulate my problem, which is the scattering of the waveguide mode. Of the waveguide mode by a transversal screen inside the waveguide. So we're going to solve the discrete angles equation here for some total field, which also satisfies the boundary conditions. In this case, it's going to be directly boundary conditions for the screen and the waveguide walls. So the incident field is represented. Is represented as just a single waveguide mode. And we are going to look for the scattered field here. Yes, it's important to notice that due to the fact that our waveguide is discrete, the number of existing modes, unlike the continuous case, is finite. So yeah, we know that we have a dispersion relation. That we have a dispersion relation, and the limiting absorption principle guarantees that our scattered field decays at infinity. So, this problem is motivated by its continuous counterpart, as always, and a very similar very similar geometry has been considered in the Geometry has been considered in this paper by Baris Erbos and David Abrahams. So this paper is about scattering of sound waves by an infinite grating, but it's demonstrated that such a problem can be reduced to a problem of scattering of some wave, but can be reduced to a waveguide. Can be reduced to a waveguides problem formulation where we have some periodic boundary conditions on the waveguide walls. So my case is slightly simpler, but the structure of the equations are going to be the same. So normally when we derive the orbiter-Hof equation, we're going to take the Fourier transform alongside the defect or. Effect or alongside the geometry, the scatter, let's say. And here we can truly do it since we are limited in space in the vertical direction. So the only way we can take the Fourier transform is in the direction which is perpendicular to our strip. And well, obviously, there is some natural excess of symmetry. Excess of symmetry alongside the defect. So we can, depending on the boundary conditions, we can say that our scattered field is symmetric or anti-symmetric for some Neumann or Diracle boundary conditions. And this motivates the use of sine and cosine transforms here in the direction perpendicular to the screen where sine and where sine and well these transforms they automatically satisfy the boundary conditions at the gaps and the screen itself well since my problem is discrete i need to introduce some analogs of sine and cosine transforms which i will call odd and even discrete transforms which are just basically a difference and a sum of Of positive and negative powers of x, where x is a complex variable. So, yes, and the index transforms for my odd and even transforms are defined as follows. So, now on an example of a simple problem of scattering by a half-plane in this. By a half plane. In this case, I'm going to just outline the way I'm going to derive my Winne-Hoff equation by the use of my odd and even transforms. So this is a well-known problem. We have an infinite space and a semi-infinite screen by which the incident wave, which is just a plane wave, is scattered. Frame wave is cutted, and we're going to solve our discrete Hankel's equation with some boundary conditions, directly boundary conditions on the half-plane. And find this cutted field. So we know that the field is symmetric with respect to m equals zero, therefore due to the boundary conditions. Due to the boundary conditions here, and then we what we're going to do is to apply the odd discrete transform to the values of n less than zero and the even transform to the values to the positive values of n, which will lead us to the system of two difference equations. One is homogeneous, one is non-homogeneous. Homogeneous one is non-homogeneous, where this term on the right is motivated by the boundary conditions on the half-plane. And functions phi and psi are defined as the sum of the different and the difference of our partial Fourier transform. So the next step would be to find an additive for our this different sequence. Our difference equations, which can be done in a very standard way. So the answers for function Ïˆ is expressed as follows. So we just have the general solution, which decays at infinity, motivated by the radiation condition. And for the function psi, we have the answers in terms of general solution and the particular solution. And the particular solution, which appears from the non-homogeneous term on the right. So these functions B and C are our unknowns and what we want to do is to find those B and C, such B and C that will satisfy these two equations at the same time. At the same time. So, from our system of two different equations, we will just pick two or n equals one and n equals zero, two coupled equations. Basically, these are just the two equations at the edge of our scatterer. If we express unknown functions in terms of the C and B, in terms of the unknowns psi and phi, at Psi and phi at n equals zero and n equals one. We can just substitute our answers into this pair of equations and then after some simple algebra derive a scalar Winner equation as we expected, which has a very similar result as the classic approach when we apply the discrete Fourier transform alongside the scatterer for some. For some two unknown functions L minus L plus. And then in a standard way, we need to factorize the kernel. The kernel is very similar to what Sharma derived for the classic approach. So we know how to factorize this kernel explicitly. We know how to split the term on the right. term on the right, the forcing term, and therefore we can derive the solution for phi and psi phi 1 psi 0, which we can substitute back to our answers and therefore derive the full solution for our system, get back to the physical field by the use of the inverse transform and find the solution. So these are just the wave fields for the scattered field. The scattered field and the total wave field, which satisfies both. I've checked, it satisfies both the Hangul's equation and the boundary conditions. So yes, now once we verify that by the use of my odd and even discrete transforms actually is legit, then it can. For the known problem, we can derive the solution easily. Let's get back to the waveguide problem. So, now in a very similar way, now instead of the upper half plane and lower half plane in the physical space, we have basically three sets of nodes, which is above my scatterer. Perpendicular to my scatterer and below my scatterer. And as before, we have a system of difference equations where one is homogeneous, one is non-homogeneous. But now instead of the answers for two regions, we need three regions, as I mentioned before, above, pimpedicular and below. PINPGQ and below. So here we have six unknown functions in our answers, but we can use the boundary conditions on the walls to eliminate two of them, b1 and a2, for example. And therefore, we are left with four unknown coefficients, which in a similar way Way can be expressed in terms of the values of our phi and psi on the edge of the scatterer. And we can basically pick two pairs of equations on each edges. And after modifying our system, we can derive a matrix winner-Hof equation where the kernel is expressed like this, and this is exactly the next. The nice structure of the kernel that David mentioned before, where the kernel squared is equal to the identical identity matrix. And the nice thing about this problem is that matrix M, each entry can be expressed in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials and of the order L1, L2. Order L1, L2, L0, where L1, L2, L0 are the lengths correspondingly of the gaps below and above of our screen and the length of the screen itself. So for this case of the symmetric waveguide, well, symmetric defect in the waveguide where the gate, the gap above and below. The gap above and below the lengths of the gap above and below of the screen are equal. This four by four matrix equation can be reduced to the two by two matrix equation. And yeah, I forgot to mention it's important to notice that since we can easily express our entries in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Chebyshev polynomials, the matrix is meromorphic, which is, as I will show you later, very convenient. So, okay, now I'm going to discuss the possible approaches to the solution of this problem. And, well, naturally, since all the entries are meromorphic, I'm going to refer to David's talk. And, well, it's natural to use the pool removal technique. The pole removal technique. So, on an example of the two by two matrix, we can just write it as the system of two coupled scalar equations, where these functions k1 and k0 are just the ratio of two polynomials, where for the polynomials we know exactly the roots as just the roots of the Chebyshev polynomials. So now we can just use. So now we can just use the poll removal for splitting all of those terms, just exactly as David described. So I'm not gonna go into the details here. But the main difference from the problem, from the example that David provided is that instead of the infinite system of the linear equations, we will get the finite system. We will get the finite system since due to the discrete nature of the problem, we only have a finite number of modes existing in the waveguide. So basically, we can express our unknown functions u plus naught u plus 1 in terms of the finite number of unknown coefficients, which are the values of. Which are the values of our unknown function q plus naught, for example, into at the roots of the polynomials, at the poles of the functions k1 and k0. And so basically we can easily find all these coefficients by solving the uh By solving the finite system of linear equations, so we don't really have to think about convergence or anything else that David talked about. So that makes it relatively easy to obtain the solution for our, well, discrete waveguide. The other way to think about it would be to think about the special case. To think about the special case. So, from the continuous analog, we know that. For the scattering by for the case when the length of the gap in the waveguide is equal to the length of the barrier, we can get the form of our kernel matrix, which Which again, as Dave mentioned, allows the factorization, commutative factorization. So we would expect that in a special case when the length of our barrier is equal to the double of the size of the gap above and below, we can rewrite our matrix kernel in a way that That will allow the community factorization. So basically, we want to represent this matrix in a form where here we have the identity matrix, and on the right, we have the matrix where the characteristic polynomial is of a degree less or equal than two. And the third approach I'd like to mention is the use of the boundary algebraic equation systems. Equation systems, which is just an analog of the well-known BEM method. But instead of only discretizing the surface of the scatterer, we discretize the whole space, but our space is already discrete, so it's natural to use this method as well. So the first thing we would need to do is to obtain the expression for the tailored green. For the tailored Green's function, which satisfies the Hangel's equation with the forcing on the right, where delta is the chronicle delta, which is only non-zero when we are at the location of the point source M0 N node. And it also needs to satisfy the boundary conditions on the waveguide walls. So, the way to obtain the expression for the For the Green's function in this case, is we're going to take our discrete Fourier transform, obtain some functional equations with the boundary conditions, and just as before for the street problem, we're going to obtain two the answers for the spaces above and below our. Point source, and then by taking the three equations from the system for n0 minus 1, n naught, and n0 plus 1, we can eliminate all of these unknowns plus the use of the boundary condition. We can find these unknown functions a1, b1, a2, b2, and by the use of the inverse transform, get back to the Back to the grains function. So further, yeah, this is just an example of the excitation of a waveguide by a point source somewhere close to the upper wall. So we can see that as I'm increasing the frequency, I can see more modes excited, classic result, what we expected. And yeah, the next step would be just to use the Would be just to use the discrete analog of the second Green's identity with my unknown scattered field and the Green's function, which allows us to obtain the solution in terms of the several coefficients, which can be a finite number of coefficients, which can be found by found by which can be found from solving the n by n system of equations where this n corresponds to the length of the scatterer in the waveguide. So, yeah, here's just an example of the wave field. So to conclude my talk we We formulated the problem of scattering of a waveguide mode by a transversal defect in the waveguide as a matrix-win-hof equation, where the kernel only includes Meromorphic functions as its entries, and those Meromorphic functions have a finite number of poles. And we described several approaches that can Several approaches that can be used in this case. So, first of all, boundary algebraic equation methods, which is fairly simple, matrix factorization for a special case of the symmetric waveguide, and the pole removal methods that we are all now familiar with. So, the main interest of this discrete problem would be the fact that in the continuous case, the four by four matrix Case the 4x4 matrix hasn't really been solved, and the well, the solution of such a matrix case hasn't been discussed. But in my case, since I only have Meromorphic functions in the matrix, I can simply apply the pole removal method and find the solution of a 4x4 matrix. So that is an analog of the continuous problem that has not been solved. The continuous problem that has not been solved. And yes, another thing that would be interesting to look at is to see if we observe some phenomenon that occurs in the continuous case, which is, for example, the unusual transmission of the wave when our scatterer is wide enough. So it would be interesting to see if the same occurs in the discord case. Case. And this is it. Thank you for your attention.
