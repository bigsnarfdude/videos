I'm going to try to explain you the relationship between the vascular network and the origin of humans. So I'm going to give a little bit of background. If you think of the origin of humans, you think of selection, of evolution. So then you are likely to think about Africa and that the humans evolved in the biotope. And if you are a fan of the eastern part of the Rift Valley, you will assume that humans evolved You will assume that humans evolved east of the rift valley because it was a savannah and the humans had to stand up. That's called the east side story. And that's not anymore fashionable because people discovered Khominin's west side of the rift valley, where it's more like forest instead of Savannah. And so indeed the humans appeared more in the forest west side of the rift valley. So this is West Alex story. This is West Eyes story. The origin probably of this dispute is that the bones dissolve in forests. They are not preserved because there's more acid in the soil. Okay, but now there are a bunch of people, actual scientists, not crooks, who say that there is an inside story. The origin of humans has nothing to do with the biotope. It comes from the inside. There is a motor inside the body that Inside the body that causes a progress, and the main argument is that the biotopes play no role whatsoever in morphodynamics. Embryos develop in the world, in the sphere, in water, there is no gravity, they are protected from everything. So there must be something inside the mechanics of development that causes humans. Now, if you think of embryos, these are humans' embryos, and you see that some. And you see that something happens very quickly that forms a little larva of vertebrate, the simplest vertebrates, which already has head, limbs, heart, etc. Then they grow and rather early by maybe one and a half months you already recognize a human. So it's very rapid to form a human, a very, very small one, but then it's good. Small one, but then it will grow a lot. So we are going to be interested in what happens in these early stages that beats the buck up of a human. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to work on human embryos, so we have to work on chicken embryos. But luckily enough, chicken embryos are the closest to humans because they share a common stage which is called the blastodisc. The reference configuration. Disk. The reference configuration is a disk. Bugs are BPEGs. Mice are bugged. Now, what about blood flow? We all know, physicists, that blood flow is required for growth because diffusion is not strong enough to provide oxygen, nutrients, etc. But there exist gigantic animals. There exist gigantic animals. So in fact, the origin. So, in fact, the origin of animals is the heart. Because if it were not for the heart, you would be two millimeters big. So, the origin of, so this is the heart of a blue whale. You can see it inside, 400 pounds. But blue whales, they start just like us at the 100 microns size. And so, even the blue whale goes through this stage where you are very, very small, and you have already. You are very, very small, and you have already bits. So, blood flow plays a role in changing size. Now, if you look at the vasculature of an early chicken embryo or a human, first of all, you see that the head is very big, okay? The head is very big, and inside the head, parts of the head are bigger than others. Okay, now if you think that Now if you think that it's blood flow that provides bigness, then probably some discrepancy in blood flow may be related to this factor. So blood flow plays a role in gradients of sizes, not only between species, but inside the elderly. It changes proportions. But the head is not simply bigger, it's also flexed. Is also flexed, and what the paleanthropologists say is that the rule for making a human is that as the head dilates, it rocks forward, it flexes. And this is going to be our problem. So we try to explain brain dilation and flexure, the partition and sequence of sizes inside the brain, the relationship with blood flow, and whether or not And whether all this causes a developmental constraint. And if you have all that, then you would call it this is the origin of it. So first of all, how are animals made, vertebrates? It's very easy. You have a plate. It cleaves following a crack pattern. The early pattern of subdivision is a crack pattern. And crack patterns, crack patterns, they tend Crack patterns, they tend in a spherical object to generate rings and rays. This is the shell of the egg, but solids, plants, animals, they tend to have a pattern of cleavage at right angles in rings, like tree rings, and sectors like fruit wedges. Now, what about the rings? When you look at the embryos at early stage, the disk, you have a sequence of rings which Of rings which correspond to the future tissues, and the embryo forms by contraction of the rings. For people who have never seen the formation of an embryo, this is a dorsal view, this is a ventral view, this is a lateral view, and this is a frontal view. So the embryo is a formation of an embryo, it's a mechanism of fold that folds exactly along the lines of the rings. Rings. And so the principle of embryogenesis: if you have a rings, the forces in the rings are in rings because the embryo is in rings. And when you fold the structure in rings, you get a structure in tubes. It's a unique mechanism. And the folds are locked at the boundaries of elastic contrast. So we prove all this in a long series of pillars. Now you look at the ventral side. Now you look at the ventral side, and the ventral side, okay, you have this fold over here. This ventral side generates the heart. So the heart forms by contraction of the ring, which is the head of the head. And as it continues to fold, it starts to move and to do whatever it has to do, and it becomes a heart. So you can show that all that is driven by actin. By actin. The rings and arrays are seeded by actin. So the mechanism for making an animal is we have rings and arrays, and everything which is a ring or array is a pulling little line. So well, so now we have the embryos. These are controls at slightly increasing stages. Indeed, the head rocks as it dilutes. So it's a visual impression. So it's a visual impression. So you plot the flexion angle and the diameter of the biggest vesicle. And you see that, yes, the angle increases and the brain dilutes. And there is a correlation. With nevertheless a little anomaly. There is a little anomaly. What is this little anomaly? It's that the eye hectoderm functions the head up to the point that it invaginates. The point that it invaginates, and much like a brawl evolve for kids, it invaginates and that makes a piston effect on the head. Piston effect. And that causes a twitch in the flexure and dilation of the head. So you have this inversion of the eye, which causes a twitch in the head. Except for this twitch, Except for this twitch, the flexion, the dilation would be proportional to flexion. You also see it in formation. For people who have never seen the formation of the nose, this is the formation of the nose. And this is a formation, I guess maybe a few people here have never seen the formation of the ear. So this is the formation of the ear. So you have similar twitches for other organs. So these are observations, controls. Now we do experiments. We decrease. You decrease the heart flux, so you cause bradycardia or bleeding, and then what you see is that the head anterogrades rotation and the brain shrink. Then you do the opposite, you do brachycardiac, you increase the heart flux, and you see you have a forward rotation and the brain dilates. So it's better in time-lapse. This is a time-lapse here. This is a time-lapse. Brain shrinks. Gaps, brain shrinks, rotates in the whole experiment. So, this is you concatenate the images. Okay, you see what happens when you go forward, and you see what happens when you go backwards. So, in both direction, ray dilation, dilation, and flexion are correlated. So, why? Or you can also induce nose formation by electric shock. You induce the nose formation, and you see that it's accompanied by a little twitch. It's accompanied by a little twitch, just like for the app. So, why is it so? I just spoken about the rings. Now you have the rays, and when you fold in a tube, the rays, the rays are advected and become rings over the tube. So, the structure of an embryo is a tube with transverse rings, longitudinal twins. Longitudinal rings, the sensory organs, and one more ring, one more ring, which is a frontal ring, which is both transverse and longitudinal. So, you have a structure in rings and rays. It's projected on a tube with colours, belts of cells. So, during nervous, you see that the lines which are radial correspond to kinks. Correspond to kinks in the tube. So typically, these kinks become the eye area and the boundaries become the circles, the transverse rings, which are ovid. These rings, they are made of actin and they hinder the development. So you have little kinks which form there. And typically, the main wedge in the embryo is the nasogenic groove that you have here. Genium groove that you have here. You can unfold your face and put it flat, and this is a souvenir of your bloodstream. So, I don't know if I discovered this rings, I'm not sure, but in the embryo you see very well these beautiful rings, so you can slice the head. This is seen across the embryo, you can slice it, you see that there are rings and they carry actin. So, voila, the tube, it's a tube, not quite a tube, it's a tube with rings. Quite a tube, it's a tube with wings. So, what happens when you balloon a tube with wings? That's the model. So, you make a finite simulation. If there is a single brain vesicle, it doesn't flex. It's like inflicting a birthday party balloon. If there are several vesicles separated by rings, they curl forward. Why is it so? It's because the brain is a hybrid of... The brain is a hybrid object. It's a stick of balloons. So if you take a stick, it flexes, but it doesn't balloon. If you take a balloon, it balloons, but it doesn't flex. But if you take a stick of balloons, each balloon pushes the other, and so you have a compressive stress, so it buckles. So you have angle as a function of time, dimeter as a function of time, angle as a function of time. As a function of time, angle as a function of diameter, there exists an internal correlation between flexure and diameter. It's inside the structure, the texture of the element. But this is not quite correct because the self-organized gradient gives you a front vesicle which is the biggest. You have a free end, a clamped end, you are pumping it. Naturally, you have a self-organized, bigger vesicle. Organize bigger vesicle, which is at the free end. The ring front vesicle is not the biggest. The biggest is this one. That one. Okay? So you go back to your heart and you see that this is formation of the heart. And you go with a little scalpel and you cut here. Okay? You cut here. And you see that you do two half. You see that you do two half-hearts with an atria and a ventricle, and the aortas are exactly at the incision point of the wedge. So this wedge that we have here, it goes inside to the aortas and then to the heart, in the early end. So now we have to look very carefully because this is the main moment of the talk. We are going to see the exact moment when blood percolates at the aortas open. So now you have to look exactly here. Back. Have you seen the blood opening? Everybody has seen the opening? No. No? Oh, over there. Okay? La Levie. Oh, this is one view. This is a wider view. The hard. Wider view, the heart beats, beats, it beats the pressure, it opens the aorta. Okay? Seen from above, it's going to be here. The aorta opens. Okay? The aorta is here. Opening of the aorta. This is another embryo. The aorta opens here. All of a sudden the header accelerates. So we go back to this movie that we've seen. You go back to this movie that we've seen earlier on. Tasha, tachy, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, opening, and it starts to curl and rotate. And you see the aortas are just below the palette. This is going to be the palette here. Even in this movie, you could have seen it. It's over here. Tession. Par the auta opens here. Cut or not cut? What do you mean by cutting? The fault. You said you cut the fault and then it has to be here with two half. Ah, that is the previous slide. So this is a normal physiological field. So now this is a double view, dorsal and ventral. Okay, voila, the aorta is open. You have to see the moment when the aorta is open. I play it again. Let's show. Paf, the aorta is open. Oh, it's very complex. Let's take two images and you decide their work. What do we have to do? Side there, what do we have to see? Here. Here we have the two-hour day. Ah, okay, well, we don't see much. Okay, so we take this movie and we take two plates at one hour distance and we concatenate them. Now, this is what it gives. So, you see that the brain, the brain expands, the head flexes and the aorta. The head flexes and the aortas here open. Okay? Everybody sees that? Sure, you are. Brain dilates, aortas open, head flexes. So you can measure the brain expansion rate as a function of time at the moment of opening of the aortas. There is a twitch of contraction, and the dilation speed triples. So if you want to carry the whole message, Carry the whole message, the heart triples the developmental speed of the adult. This is the opening of the aorta, which is thin because the aortas are black because the lumen does not diffuse light. So, this is why the aortas appear black. So, if you just with image j plot the quantity of black in the area of the aorta, you see the moment of opening, and this is the flexure of the embryo. And you see that the displacement field, there is a greater. Displacement field, there is a gradient, so there is a contraction. So the dilation of the head is accompanied by a contraction of the. So you arrive at this situation, you have the beating heart, a few hours later, the heart beats and it's pumping blood exactly under the midbrain vesicle. You could have seen it here, for example. This is formation of the eye in the aorta here. This is day four embryo. Doesn't run. That's right. So, voila, this is the loop, the initial loop. The two aortic tracts are the top arms of the cross that we saw initially, and the veins are the two bottom arms of the cross of the heart. These are in vivo images of the flow. So, the blood pressure is not uniform inside the tube. Ah, no. Yes, the blood pressure is not uniform. The blood pressure. The lumen pressure, the cephalic pressure, is uniform. The tube, they communicate. So if you have one vesicle which is very big, you cannot explain it by an increase in pressure in the cephalic fluid, because the pressure in the cephalic fluid is the same for all the vesicles. You have to find something specific not to the bulk, but to the shell of the vesicle to explain the bigger vesicle. To explain a bigger vesicle. And what is the cause of this bigger vesicle is that the flux of blood inside the shell reduces the tensile stress of the shell. So the shell has only capillaries, they cannot fight pressure. The vessels have muscle cells, they can't fight the pressure. They can't fight the pressure. So this dilates when you put pressure inside. This constricts when you put pressure inside. So the result is that if you add properly the correct pattern of blood pressure in the shell, not in the bulk, then you recover a small cellular ball, a big midbrain. The first vesicle is big because it's the first one. This one is big because it has the aortas. This one is small. It has the aortas. This one is small because it is squeezed by all the others. And this one is somewhat in between because it's in one, which is big because it's the first one, and the other which is big because it has the aorta. Now, how do you justify that the tension is relieved in the shell, but increased in the aorta? It's and there is a moment where I meet with people who do transition between loops and lines or trees. Lines or trees. This is the actin. There is a differentiation at the boundary between capillaries and vessels. This is actin staining. This is a contractile cells, vessel cells. So when you see vessels, they are contractile. When you see capillaries, they are not contractile. They cannot fight the pressure they are putting inside them. So there is a rocking chair effect. If I pump blood into the head, the head. Head, the head flexes down and paints. And this is the origin. This is a corporate microscopy. This is a kind of image you can show that as soon as vessels are formed, they are contracted. This is reference to previous talks. This is muscle cells in lung ducts. For people who have shown the lung images, don't forget that you have muscle cells which are active muscle. Now, in presence of heartbeat, you see. Now, in presence of Hardbee, you still have an allometry, but it's a dual allometry. There is a direct effect of vesicles which push against each other, and there is an indirect effect of blood flow, which dilates the vesicles, constricts the lines. So, well, the origin of humans is wired inside the texture by wires that the group used. To the bottom left, you have fish, which have very Left, you have fish which have very small grains which are tubular, and to the top right, you have animals which are gigantic brains which are curved forward. And what is the fundamental principle at the origin of humans is the competition between surface tension, dilation, and line tension. You have belts, you have linear features. Features on a surface. And this duality, this duality, originates fundamentally in cell division. Cell division also, you have dilation, but you have to split the cells. You have a ring of actin which constricts. So I finished on that. The mechanism of cell division has been upscaled collectively in organisms. Inorganism, since they make rings and they make surfaces. So you could as well, I almost finished. Where was it? What up? I describe this as, but this could be an epithelium which is dilating and which has a cortical basement membrane. It's a flexion of a cortex. It's just a change in scale that gives you the formation of the head. Just a change in scale. Of the head, just the changes. Well, talks about the attention. So, any questions from the two? Yes. Thank you. Very nice. So, I would like to connect.
