For the last talk of this morning, we welcome Chiara Cameron. We talked about sprint vibration and this my space and it is a very interesting workshop. So today I'm going to talk about my work in progress with InopreScare and With Elo Braque, Alexa Gross, Elra Pertusi, Julia Saka, and Sasha Viktorova. A work in progress, which I hope is almost finished. Right, so the aim is more or less described by the title, and it is to show that some vibrations, which are called previbrations, are irreducible symplastic varieties in the sense that Claudio discussed yesterday in his talk. I will make this. I will make this more precise, obviously. So, first part of the talk will be explaining one digressions and why in fact this is related to the topic of the workshop and K-3 symmetries of K-3 surfaces appear into the game. So, is the writing big enough? Can you hear me back also at the back? Is everything fine? Okay. So, pre-recitation. Although we will speak most of the time about singular varieties, let me start one second from smooth but irreducible amorphic symplectic manifolds. So they are known to be one of the possible analogs in higher dimensions of Cape Wish surfaces, and they are the analog for which global turbines here are the fault. Global toralithium holes, and you can use lattice theoretical techniques. But one very interesting family of K-free surfaces are elliptic K-free surfaces, so that have an elliptic vibration. And a natural question that people ask themselves almost immediately is what kind of vibrations you can have on an irreducible or more pixel-dactic manifold. Because nowadays, the classical theorem by Masushika. By Masu Shitla, which I don't want to recall in full generality, but which gives you information about hydration, but it turned out to be quite rigid. So if X is irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifold, so let me call this a compact carrier simply connected and the H20 is spanned by a holomorphic symplectic form. And you have a vibration. The vibration F max over base vibration, then well your base has to be projective even if X is not with terminal singularities In fact, chomologically, it looks like Pn, and then Wong, so this second part is Wong, prove that if B is moved, then B is PM. This is conjectured to be always the case, even without the assumption that B is moved, but we know it on the dimensional form. And third thing. And third thing is that smooth fibers of F are abelian varieties. So again, they are projective. Uh sorry, I have a quick question. When you say uh F D vibration, do you mean like any, you know, flat multiple? Yeah, connect with a connected fibers to jets over the base. Fibers that active over the base. Proper all fibers are Lagrangian plots, so even singular ones with respect to the symplectic form. That's why we call that Lagrange joint fibrillation. It's called the Lagrange joint fibration. And now you want to try to construct examples. And of course, there is a very easy one. Anyone can think of, a natural one, so to say. Start with an elliptic paper surface. Surface take the Hilbert scheme of amphoids of this elliptic equipper surface to obtain a natural Lagrandon vibration on it. Let's look into maybe a less trivial example, which are supported for multi-integral systems. Why do these fibers have to be protected? It's a result, so I mean, it's proven. I mean, it's proven. It comes from an argument of Woisen and the proposition of Terpan. Let me skip the details of the otherwise I won't ever get to the deformation formula. Okay. Let's consider what they are called the Himokai integral systems. Systems. So let's take a caliphate surface and D the primitive curve but you cannot do do without that, but we keep we have technicalities. Primitive curve of G. Primitive terrible genus J segmentable one on S Now you can consider the moduli space of shifts, H-stable shifts, on S. So this has been defined already by Claude and his Tolk or especially some five vector which is of the kind sorry. Sorry, are you ready? Made the wrong notation. I want the genus of D to be H, otherwise, I will remember H for the rest of the two. So one minus H inside here. So these are pure sheaves of dimension one, so they are torsional with the surface, and they are supported on your curve. Here, found a bit, you can consider a map to the linear system of your curve given by taking the support of your shear. That's a Lagrange of figuration. And so, this is another Lagrange figure. What are the spibers? So, let's take a smooth curve. So, if So if P' is moved inside your inner system, the fiber over it will be nothing else but the Jacobian of the curve. So smooth fibers are Jacobian varieties of the curves in the linear system. And in fact, this is the compactification of the relative Jacobian variant. Of the relative Jacobian variety that you can construct. So, in fact, this, let's call it Ju. So, this is the opposite size of smooth course in T. And if we can do it a backward Backward, yes. Let's put a prime here to be consistent with my notational data. D not smooth, but integral. So you have a relative Jacobian over here. Fibers for integral codes will be what they call compactified Jacobians. Okay, and the compactification is with modular space. So this shows that there is a syntactic form. This is irreducible magic. Symplectic form. This is irreducible matrix symplectic number. For choices of age, otherwise, it's still an irreducible symplectic value. Okay, let me mention, since we are here, that you have a rational section of this vibration, which is well defined over this section. So here we have S given by taking an integral curve and sending it to the push forward the equation of its structure shift. So you take V prime. So you take d prime and send it to d prime. So this is a rational section. Rational section for the old vibration. Okay, so that's the first example which has been studied by Boville, Mukai, and by so on a lot. And then people started to look for other examples. And that's another example is given by pre-privation. That's what I'm going to construct now. So I'm going to go to the next step. Pure fagrations are first been studied in paper about Tikomiro, Barpachevich Tikomiro and Averello Sacaferetti. So all the construction I'm going to describe now is due to that. It's some examples, but in fact it's already been studied. So suppose that now instead of any smooth K-free surface, we consider a K-free surface with a non-symplectic evolution. Non-symplatic evolution. Two elementary capital surfaces, as already appeared in the depths. So now let S p k phase move I in a over phase of Super Act if you would We are going to assume, for the rest of the talk, that S is generic in the family, which means that your involution acts trigger the velocity. This surfaces have been classified by work of Nicole. Nicole, and we've already seen this, so I can go very quickly back to this. It is classified by a tripod of invariants, R, A, Delta, where R is direct of the invariant lattice, A is the length of its discriminant, and delta is the variety of the discriminant. And not only these, but R A delta. In fact, we know that the fixed locus is either emptied, well, when you have an empty distribution, that's the case step at zero, or it's the disjoint unit of 12. Well, it's the disjoint unit of two elliptic curves then equal to zero, if not mistaken. Otherwise, it's a curve of zero, disjoint union with some rational curves with genus of plus zero equal to 11 minus r plus eight over two and a Two and k number of rational curves, so this is rational equal to r minus a over 2. So in particular, you know also what is the geometry of the quotient. Now consider t to be the smooth quotient rest by the evolution, then When he is either Ericus in the first case or rational in all other cases. So this is ta ta j okay, so this is the self tip I try to use. Yes. We now want to choose a linear series on the portion surface. Let's see the primitive curve on T of genus G. Now I want to use G that way. Sorry, I think I missed the definition of pi to work for compact. R A delta. So this is R is rank of H2S with a divided sub lattice. A it's the length of its T is the length of its discriminant group and delta is either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of the quadratic form of the discriminant group. Okay? Okay. So now let's see. Now let's see the terms and look at this let's see the primitive curve of genus G of D okay so we may consider Let's call F the double cover from S to T, which is almost always ramified about the America scales. So let's call B the branch. Okay? And let D be the pullback of C inside the Picard group of S. Inside the Picard group of gas. We get by restriction of this double colour, a double colour of curves. Ramified here two endpoints with F also in the loophole scale. To be zero in the lookup case. So it's either a tale or a be file. Okay, to such a double cover to have associated trim variety. So consider the trim variety of D over C. This is defined as a fixed locus minus delta star. Minus delta star inside is Jacobian of P. So you have a I is also denotes the restriction of your involution to the current K. And minus is just a view of shifts. So there's a substitute which may not be connected. When it is not connected, you take the identity a component of the identity. Okay? So this is an obedient. So, this is an abelian volatility. And in fact, you can also make the relative construction. Okay, so if we go back here, you know, I do it here. So, over that Q, so you can do it relatively over the set of integral curves. That's for now. We get a relative prime variety over this locus. Okay? But this looks like a quasi-projective or an open set, but it's a Lagrangian fabrication in that. So, the question is: can we compactify it and get something which is irreducible symptomatic possible? Which is irreducible symplatic, possibly. So that's the question which was asked in Markocevich Tikomiro and Abrello Saka. And the answer is yes. The thing is, this comes from the evolution of the Cape Very surface. And let me go back one second behind here. I still have the blackboard. Okay. So, when we have our involution, since we chose it to be generic, we get by pullback, we have this involution, a non-symplatic evolution of these modularized spaces or sheaves. So, the non-symptotic involution is there. The question is whether we can find the global equivalent minus one, the dual of the Jacobian variety. That's what they could do. Variety. That's what they will do with their construction. So let me erase here because the genus of T varies in the family type. Yes, but we will get those, yeah. For now I'm just considering smooth burdens. Or integral burdens, so they are different. So they are but let's stick to smooth curves of genus small. Okay? Yes, of course. If there are singularities or if the curves become reducible, the genus will change. Okay. So the thing is, consider minus one, which takes f and b. And V H S to the X1 F O S minus Turns out that this evolution is restricted on the fabia gives you the dual facts which are prover being by Los Accaster minus one is not Minus one is non-symplectic and commutes with our i upper star. The second is that this is biregular if and only if as a polarization you choose D. You choose D, which is bad because this is the prototype of a non-visionary polarization. It's the wall. So, in this case, or visual choice, MVD of S is singular. So, you have sort of a duality between using a birational evolution or using a bird smooth modular space. A smooth moduli space, or with a birregular one on a singular moduli space. In fact, there are birational maps between these moduli spaces, so both will work for what we will do today. If you want to go deeper and compute the singularities, that's the choice you need to do. If you want to control the singularities of the spring fibrillations, that you get. Okay, so now definition. The trim so let's first define P bar so I call it P bar let P bar be the fixed focus of minus I star on the modular space of shifts. Okay, again there is the issue of the connect might be the issue of the connected components. Of the connected component, take the connected component which contains directional section over there. Okay? So that's sorry, not P Tilda, but P bar. This may be non-normal, so the prefix is the normalization of the bar. We don't answer the question whether these are directly normal or not, even if we delete the data. So, P, to be precise, I should put a V and an H here because the construction depends from these two data, but I want to avoid having notation here. So, P is actually vibrations. Okay. So, now the question we want to answer. So these are the Lagrangian vibrations, these are Lagrangian vibrations. How? Well, if you take a fixed shift for minus area of a star, well, its support has to be preserved. So it has to be an inviot curve inside this linear series. Inside this linear series, sorry. So the vibration or So, this vibration of the week of system actually restricts to give a vibration of the pullback of the linear series C inside D. This is the locus of invariant curves. Okay, so this is just a restriction of the Jacobian provision over here. So, the question. So, the question I want to ask is a symplectic variety, a primitive symplectic variety, an irreducible symplectic variety. So, let me say what it is known, which cases have already been studied in the literature before Study with the literature before stating our results. So now I can raise here. So the first example appeared was due to, as I said, to Michael Czech and T. Polero. They studied a specific choice of K-free surface, uh, which is so that's architecture which is they study a K-free surface which is a double colour for the third dimension, yeah, which is a The dimension is two this is uh the dimension is uh two H minus G a genus, so it's two genus of D minus genus of C. Okay, because that's the dimension of the free variety that you obtain and it's uh isotagrange, so The iso-Lagrangian, so the dimension of the fabrication is the copy. Okay, yes. Because you know that it is not normal, because you don't know if it's normal. We don't know how to prove it yet. Expect that to be okay, as I was saying, take it one specific example of non-cyclastic evolution, which is the cover evolution of a K-free surface covering a deep path of degree two. That's of degree two, so this is at the track A take one, this is case A take one. Luckily, inequality triangles was already in the mere slide, so not that we have to be precise, but we put ourselves on the line R equal to A as a maximum at 11, because all the cases which were studied up till now are on this line. Okay, yeah. So this, if this is, let's say that it levels here, otherwise. So this is Markuchevich. What they prove, together with also work on the net, is that what you obtain in this case is a irreducible symplatic arbift of dimension 4. I didn't define arbifolds, but finite symplatic quotient of an irreducible Symplatic portion of an irreducible holomorphic symplatic tangible sample or olive. You have a very example where we study the Eureka scale. Sorry, I forgot. It's not for a curse. It's just for B's choice. The anti-canonical linear series. Okay, so it's one surface, one linear series on it. But take that the ambiguous. That's the Enricus case. So that's lattice zero, as I already recalled. That would be the star here. So that's almost alphabetic. Here they let C be primitive, any primitive curve of Euricus. And what they prove is that, so the formation equivalent to k. formation equivalent to K3 G minus 1 if C is hyperliptic and well they didn't state like this because the definition was not there yet but they show that P is an irreducible sympletic variety otherwise and there exists no sympletic resolution if otherwise. If otherwise, finally, there is some result by Matteini, which is who treated two cases. Let me go quick, 771 and 991. He obtains, so here you have an irreducible synthetic curve because of dimension 6, and here you get a singular. And here you get a singularity. In both cases, the choice is again the anti-canonical linear system. So we got something more here and here. So these are Martinis. And finally, there is a recent word by Steward Penshan, again in the case 771. In the case 771, but with minus we cannot and that is known to be symplectic variety, but we cannot say anything more for now. Maybe we can get to primitive symplectic variety. I should check for what they prove, but it's not known to be simply connected. They cannot compute the fundamental loops yet. So it's again here. And now you see my point, I hope. There are 72 if I come to. Open. There are 72, if I counted correctly, different families to elevate resurfaces, and you have infinitely many choices for the linear CSC. There are analogies between the proofs in these papers, and you don't want to go case by case in all the rest of the triangle. So, our idea was to give up the geometry of your special example and try to. Try to give it a material for which, under assumptions over C and D, you obtain automatically that this is one of these type of varieties. Just by generalizing their proof. Of course, this comes with a price. You lose geometry, you have to assume some have got some positivity assumptions on your linear series. Okay? Okay, so now I can say that our results while I raise, maybe I should make a comment. So one shine example is really special in the sense that the gathering of series is not even primitive. So, we hope to drop the primitivity assumption. I will state the results of primitive just to be in the safe sites, but I hope we will drop it. So, that's main results. So, first, so this is let me write once since many people. So, that's G P S V probably. ESP, probably. So preposition one. So if D is your primitive, D is a symplectic valid, which means, as Cloud already called Because normal, and you have the symptomatic form of the regular part, which extends holomorphically to all resolutions, which extends Holomorphically to add resolution of singularity. Not necessarily in a syncretic way, of course. Well, most of the times, not in a syncretic way. So that's the first result, which is all big generality. And second theorem is that if D and C And C are both very helpful, respectively on S and T where T is also a primitive symplectic variety, meaning we already know that it is a symplectic variety, plus we follow that H1 of X is zero and And uh for the minute I h two is one h0 of the sphere, so it's omega to spin is back by omega. Okay, that's what you need for primitive symptomatic variety, and you have to pay very apple. And you have to pay very happens for it. And here we get to the strongest of these notions. So this is an irreducible symplectic variety, which means symplectic plus For all, that we say G is that is already taken, so let's take G, let's call it Y map from G from Y to P, which is finite, and quarter is italic for dimension one you have. You have that, well, of course, the symplectic form pulls back. Okay? So you found the span of the powers of your symplectic form here. But you can have more in principle, as we saw yesterday. And in fact, you require that is exactly the sum of possible. Of possible is not a good choice for an index here, sorry, let's use Q. Otherwise, it's not possible to present. So, there is only the one that you start probably to be precise. Okay, so that's what we want to find. So that's what we wanted for an irreducible synthetic value. Let me make a comment. From here, the standard that you have an analogous of irreducible anorphic synthetic manifold, what you'd want is a required simple connectiveness. That turned out to be tough, and that's the reason for this condition. I've been told that probably now there is work going on to replace this by fundamental algebraic group trivial by, but this is not analyzed yet. So, okay. Okay, so I should put some conditions. It's not finished, but I answer your question. So if it's not some conditions, it's answer a lot. So A. First we work the D and C very often as before. Second, let me try to use the same order I used here, otherwise. Here, otherwise C square is different from 4, or intersection of C with the bridge. For now, I'm sorry, I didn't say, but Jonica's case is dealt in Alberto Sacafer, so suppose that we are in the ramified case. Okay? So this is different from 4. For a condition Recondition is that this intersection is, anyways, greater than two, and that till now and not totally enough. You will be unfortunate if the other two is to go to the other blackboard. So till now, they've gotten too bad, right? I can And now we have to pay the price for simple connectedness. So it requires C to B. So the linear serial C has to be two connected. Yeah. P square positive, and we need three connectedness. Fp squared is less than or equal to zero, so the other part of the triangle. And finally, now I would really want to stop it, stop. I hope that the final version will stop here. Okay? So we have a proof, yes, but it's still being written now. So to be safe, I left this one, but shouldn't be in the paper. So, the two dimension of this orbit is of course, so of gamma it c such that gamma is tendered to be in a point with multiplicity at least free piece per dimension inside seeking. Dimension inside C, so this dimension inside C is greater probably positive. As I said, hopefully this remark for E to be erased. So these are the results. You see that to get a new You see that to get a reducible sympathetic variety, if you give up geopetty, you need to pay price and how. So let me make a comment. Which of these examples satisfy our assumptions? Thus is what? It's 7, 7, 1, 5, 1, 8. This is the only example among the known ones which satisfy all the assumptions, but already tells you that it's not empty. And even if the assumptions are not satisfied, the proof is really the one of a particular secretive. So the theorem is not optimal, but it's meant to give you a criterion for a high positivity. So in minimal cases, you can probably use our proof anyways, but it's not even if your linear series does it, it satisfies all these conditions. Yeah, if you remember the last question. Conditions. Yeah, if you remember the last condition, it remains only one thing satisfying what they are. No, no, there are also, so I could satisfy that. But Abelosacafret is different because it's a tal, it's the talcase, so it doesn't really compare even if it's the same. The one which fails everything is so on shadow. This is false. Well, the activities first, also, first of all, but this is false. But this is false by both the error of characterization. This is false as well. And this fails as well. So it's really somehow the limit case. Okay, so in the last eight minutes, I want to give a very brief sketch of the proof that would give an idea where these assumptions come from. So I did here. I came here. So the first part is programmed, it is a symptomic variety, but that's easy. It's just it is the fixed element of a syntactic evolution because the minus your pi star is syntactic. So for proposition one Just observe that T is the fixed locus or each fixed locus, depending on the cases of a symplectic evolution, a symplectic irreducible morphic symplectic manifold, or either an irreducible symptomic variety depending on which polarization you choose. Which polarization to choose. So it has a so pure has a symplectic form, which is nothing else but a restriction of its symplectic form. Now you need to prove that it extends holographically to all resolutions, but you do embedded resolution of singularities. Dependent resolution of singularities. This sympathetic form extends holomorphically here, and this restriction is the holomorphic extension of the sympathetic form. That's a proof. From this, as a consequence, you deduce that P has trivial canonical bundle and it has canonical singularity. Now the key tool to prove the rest of the fiery and fierce, well now the key observation, let's say, it's the following proposition, which I'm not sure it's really stated like this, but I'm not sure it's really stated like this, but it's used by Pergor and Pageta to show that modular spaces, in primitive case, or irreducible sympathetic varieties, is that if so if you have X syntactic variety The two following things gold, you have a rational dominant map to X. So this is rational dominant from that irreducible morphic synthetic manifold and the regular morcus of the Of your symplectic varieties is simply connected, then X is with. So that's what we want to use, showing constructing such a dominant map and proving simple connectedness of the smooth locus of our prevention. That's what we do. And let me observe that. And let me observe that sorry. It's useless to write here, sorry. I write it here. So if only one alt, so you still get, but I write it here. One implies XPC. Okay. So I skipped the return. So I skipped the detail of the construction of the rational dominant map, but just to have a one. What we prove, if there exists a rational dominant map from the inverse scheme of H minus G points of our K3 surface onto our prefabrication. If B and C are very important respective T or I didn't push the theorem but the alternative assumption is d very unknown and it's a locus irreducible of your air-free surface. So R equal to A. So, are equal to it. Both will work to give you the rational domain. So, second part. So, under this assumption, we get primitive symplatic parameters as I tell theoretically. Okay, I want to prove this. I don't have the time now to tell you what is the matter, unfortunately, because they got I won do want to give an idea of how to address Of how to address the last part: simple connectedness. So, how to prove that this is equal to one? Okay, we apply the same strategy of Albanosa Cathored and we apply a theorem of my lab by Leibniz. I won't state it in full generality, just apply it to our case. So that's So that again u prime be an atmos of curves in gamma such that the pullback of gamma is irreducible and thus integral, okay? Because this happens to be irrelevant. So apply life musterer tells us that we have an exit sequence. I will tell you what everything is in a second. That's pi one of p over the prime. U prime and then by one of U prime. So we have this exact sequence of fundamental groups. Biz I will define it later. B is the power tabulation restricted or this of the circuit. Okay? Now first thing that we do is to prove that this is simply connected. Okay, so first proposition let's call it A because one, two, three. Because one will be already taken. So, five words is one. If, well, about all the list of five assumptions that I had, what I need is to connect it as one. So, if D equals, so either C is too connected with B square positive, or C frequency. Or see if we connect it with p-squared lesser or zero and if it was I think P holds so C square different for four or C why because in this case you show that this is You show that this is C. In fact, you try in C, which is simply connected, minus two components. These are curves which are reducible inside C. So these are reducible curves. The fields are curves which are Which are irreducible, but they are totally tangent to the branch, and their pullback is reducible. Under these assumptions, we can prove that both Los A as co-dimensional greater or equal to two, so they are negligible from the point of view of fundamental group. This is simply connected, and so our U prime is simply connected. So I can put So, I can put one here. Sorry, I'm going over time. Maybe I have two more minutes just to fill. That's the good thing over here in the last week of this session. And okay, so that's the first week that we prove. And now, under this assumption. That's really a few words I have to say. So this implies, in Leichmann's theorem, that this is the commutator of pi 1 of f with pi 1 of u where f is the smooth fiber. So it's the So it's the free variety over the smooth curves. Okay? So F is free of D0 over C zero or D zero C zero smooth and the U is the sublockless or smooth curves. It's the open set. The open set possible. So the last two assumptions that we use are to ensure, so how do you study now this? So you need to describe this complementary complement. You prime minus u. Yes. And what you we want is that this is the discriminant, so singular curves in our linear scale C, union, sort of relative discriminant of C with P, union sum field, so this is codemash of greater or equal than two. So the assumptions that we use is to prescribe this. Is to prescribe these. So, but these are the only two four-dimensional components which we need to study to describe the fundamental group. We need loops around these four-dimensional work components to obtain our fundamental group. Okay, so this is delta C. Okay, let me see. Delta C is so the value let's we are. So the very, let me write like this factor. So the very general element in ΔC will be gamma in C with only one node outside B and the very general element here will be a smooth. Will be a smooth gamma C with which is standard 100 to B in one point with exactly multiplicity 2. So these are the only two dimensional work components that we want. With this we can use Picard lab shed transformation. Transformation and the monodromy, so I had the study of the fundamental group of the Jacobic of the modular space of shears to prove that in fact this is all of chi one out and as a consequence this is simply the max okay and well this answer I want to release The assumption I want to erase implies that we need to take one more component where the general element will have multiplicity free in this unique tangent support. But we are tired to dealing with that case. We need to calculate the casp, so it's taking more than a week. Okay, thank you. Sorry for going over time.
