About T-collicular helper cells, although my lab is usually interested in B-cell responses, and for quite a number of years, we've been studying the response to a parasite, and that's the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. And more specifically, we've been interested in the response against the sporozoid stage of this parasite, which is shown here, this banana-shaped parasite. That's the stage that's injected into the skin of humans. The skin of humans. And then from the skin, the parasite moves to the liver where it infects hepatocytes and establishes the infection, and then ultimately causes disease when blood stage parasites develop from these infected liver cells and infect blood cells in cycles. So we were interested in understanding initially the antibody response against the major surface protein of the parasite. Protein of the parasite at the sprozoid stage, which is called circumsprozoid protein. And this is a protein that's essential for the development of the parasite in the mammalian host, but also in the mosquito. And it's also the prime target of the leading malaria vaccine. It's called RTSS. It comes in an adjuvant that's called ASO1. And this malaria vaccine has recently been recommended for. Be recommended for implementation in children at risk in endemic areas. Although, actually, in a phase three trial, it showed overall limited efficacy and short-lived protection. But because it's the best that is available, no other vaccine ever made it through a phase three trial. This is still a success. Nevertheless, we thought it should be possible to actually improve this vaccine, maybe, which was initially developed. Maybe, which was initially developed starting from the 1980s. And so we have been studying initially antibody responses to this. So, this is just a scheme of the protein has an N-terminus, a central, a repeat domain that links to the N-terminus through something that we call the N-terminal junction. And then there's a C-terminus which is linked to the surface of the parasite through a GPI anchor. And the RTSS vaccine was. The RTSS vaccine was designed to include part of the central repeat domain, which includes the B-cell epitopes that are shown here in blue. These are repeating for amino acid motifs that have been known again since the 1980s to be the target of protective antibodies when the hybridoma technology was developed. This was also shown at monoclonal level. And then also it was known that the C terminus contains all of the T cell apical. Contains all of the T cell epitomes, or the vast majority. And so it was just designed to include this part of the CSP protein, and then this part was fused, genetically fused to hepatitis B surface antigen to make this more immunogenic and induce the formation of virus-like particles. So, on the antibody side, when we thought how can we improve this vaccine, maybe we decided to make sure that We decided to make sure that we focus the antibody response on actually the most potent epitopes in this protein. And so we revisited this question of is it just the repeating motifs here in blue or maybe other epitopes. And we also wanted to understand whether there are non-protective epitopes in this protein and then to avoid antibody responses against these epitopes with the vaccine design. And of course, we know that if we want to improve. course we know that if we want to improve the quality and importantly also the durability of the response we need to provide strong T cell health and the question was are the T cell epitopes in the C terminals really the best ones that are available and what exactly are they and so on the antibody side many people in the field over the last maybe four or five years have studied antibodies that are potent and have come to the conclusion And have come to the conclusion, starting also with the work from Bob Cedar's lab, Antonio Lenza Veckia's lab, and our lab, Ian Wilson's lab, that protective antibodies target the central repeat and also the N-terminal junction here. And so this should probably be included in vaccine design, the junction here. But what about then the other parts of the protein? So the N-terminus is something that is still unclear to the whole field, I would say. To the whole field, I would say, because no one really found protective antibodies against the N-terminus, and it's also overall very non-immunogenic. So we don't really detect responses against the N-terminus, and maybe because the N-terminus is cleaved here. So we're actually focusing everything on the rest of the protein, which is the C-terminus. And so when we looked at antibodies against the C-terminus, what we have described previously. What we have described previously based on one example is that these antibodies can bind to the C-terminus very strongly with high affinity. But when we try to see whether they can bind to live parasites, so sporozoids, and here I'm showing you flow cytometry data with all of these monoclonal antibodies here that we obtained from humans, you see that they cannot bind to life sporozoids, even at a very high concentration compared to control. Compared to a control antibody that targets the central repeat domain. And this lack of ability to bind the parasite is also reflected by the inability to inhibit the parasite in an in vitro assay. And so it seems that this domain is actually not really accessible to antibodies on the surface of the sprozoids. But nevertheless, we know that the C-terminus induces very strong antibody responses. Antibody responses when just the protein is injected. So, recombinant for length CSP induces the strongest responses, antibody response against the C-termers, stronger than the responses against the repeat domain, which contains the protective epitopes. So, this is an undesired response. And the idea is: how can we get rid of this response knowing that the C-terminus contains all the T-cell epitopes? So, we looked at So, we looked at what the antibodies bind against the C-terminus, and we see when we look at the panel of almost 50 monoclonals that only two of these antibodies actually bind peptides in this region, and the others all target conformational epitopes. So, that suggests that when we include just the peptide as a T-cell epitope in the vaccine, we should avoid these strong B-cell responses, humoral immunity. B cell responses, humoral immunity against the C terminals, and the non-protective epitopes. And so, I guess I'm just pointing this out here. So, this is a project that then we went on to address what are the T cell epitopes in this C terminal domain and can we use them maybe later on in vaccine design? And so, this project was initially started by Ilka Wahl and the last. By Ilka Wahl in the lab, a PhD student and then postdoc. And she then obtained help from Anna Obratsova, who joined a little later. And so, what Ilke obtained were blood samples from malaria-naive donors who were injected with a large number of 900,000 live radiation attenuated sporozoids three times here, day zero, seven, and 20. Day 0, 7, and 28. So very short scheme here. And then we obtained blood samples before the first immunization and then always at day seven after each of these exposures. And so we then wanted to study these blood samples with a platform that we developed in the lab many years back, actually, for antibodies and now used also for T cell. T cell for the analysis of T cells that is based on indexed single-cell fact sorting of cells in the 384 well plates. And then we amplify, in this case, the TCR alpha beta genes by our TPCR using a bar-coded primer matrix. And then we perform Illumina sequencing. And because we have the full-length amplicons available, we can directly clone these amplicons into expression vectors and then generate. And then generate monoclonal T cell lines, which we can then test for functional analysis in vitro for binding and target epitopes. And then we can also link this back to the cell phenotype because we record the cell phenotype of every single cell. And so initially, Ilka analyzed the samples by flow cytometry and tried to identify circulating T folikia. Circulating T. folukeala helper cells because these should be the cells that help these cells, of course, in the germal center reaction. And you can identify these cells in blood based on the marker 60R5, which is the marker that allows them to enter germal centers. And then we focused our analysis on these cells that had on top a very activated phenotype with high expression of PD-1 and ICOS. And so if we track the cells over these immunizations, Cells over these immunizations, we saw that the frequency of the circulating T. follicular hypercells increased with time, and importantly, the frequency of these activated T follicular helper cells. And these were then the cells that Ilka single cell sorted and then performed gene sequencing on more than 3,000 cells from these five individuals that we looked at. That we looked at. And then she analyzed the paired TCR-ALF and TCR-beta genes. And then you can, of course, check the clones over time and look at clone expansion, which you see also increased over time. And you see some clonal overlap between time points after the first immunization and the second immunization, which is quite strong, most likely the strongest because these immunizations were only seven days apart. And then the overlap. Card. And then the overlap is not as strong with the third time point because that immunization is then only at day 28. And you see it's a very polyclonal response, most likely because this parasite has 5,000 genes. It's a really complex unicellular organism. And so these clones probably target any antigen in this parasite. So when we try to understand that, So, when we tried to understand which cells to focus on, Ilka performed, of course, a repertoire analysis and looked at the gene usage in the donors over the different time points. And then she tried to select cells for expression cloning of tissue results based on increased usage over time. And I'm highlighting here some of these in red. If this proceeds, Seeds. I don't know what's happening here. Is this not ah, here we go? So you see, some of these genes are enriched in usage over time. And together with this clonal expansion data, Ilka then selected over 240 TCRs for expression cloning, cloned these intra retroviruses, and then transduced the jerked cells to express these. To express these TCRs on the surface. And she also immortalized B cells from the same donors so that she had a pool of antigen-presenting cells. And then she could read out the activation of the T cells in co-cultures with the B cells that had been pulsed with peptides containing our CSP sequences. And then she could read out activation of these T cells by L2 secretion in the ELISA. Secretion in ELISA and also by flow cytometry. And so, when she then wanted to test her TCRs for reactivity against our CSP, she designed peptide pools that covered the N-terminus and the junction also the central repeat domain, which is one pool here of peptides and another pool covering the C-terminus. And then she used these peptides to stimulate. To stimulate all the T cell lyes that she had generated. And this is the data here. You see activation by the different pools in the different donors, and you see the number of TCRs that she expressed and tested. And what becomes very obvious is that in every single donor, she found a number of TCRs that showed reactivity to the C-terminal peptide pool in line with the literature. And only in one dose. Literature, and only in one donor could she identify TCRs that recognized this pool here covering the N-termal region. So, this is here enumerated. So, you see that in a single donor, up to 35% of the TCRs that we basically randomly cloned by just gene usage and clonal expansion recognized our target CSP. Although, this parasite is so highly complex and has these five types. Is so highly complex and has these 5,000 genes. So this shows the immunodominance of this protein and specifically of the C-termins in this protein. So then the question was which individual peptides would these TCRs really recognize? And so Ilke tested all the reactive TCRs for binding or activation by individual peptides. And you see here that the And you see here that the vast majority of the TCRs actually were activated by peptides that covered only 22 amino acids, amino acid 311 to 333, in the C-terminal domain. Some were very specific for a single peptide, others showed sort of cross-binding to two peptides or even more. And we found only very rare TCROs, one against this peptide in this. One against this peptide in the C-terminal linker, so also in the C-terminus, but closer to the repeat region, and a few in just one donor that recognized a peptide in the N-terminal junction. And so we can compile this data, and then you see here the immunodominate epitope, these 22 amino acids, where we see TCRs in every donor against this region. The linker TCR were only found in one individual. were only found in one individual and the same for the TCRs against the end terminal junction upstream of the central repeat. So 94% of all the TCRs that recognized our target actually recognized these 22 amino acids showing a strong immunodominance. When we then looked at the time points, when did we identify these TCRs? We saw that they were identified mostly or Were identified mostly or cloned from cells that we isolated after the second, or more so even after the third immunization. So they came kind of late, and that's not absolute late, but relatively late compared to some other clones that dominated the earlier time points. And you can see here how the frequency of reactive clones increased at donor level. When we then linked this data to the cell phenotype data, we saw that. The cell phenotype data, we saw that the vast majority of these TCRs actually showed a TFH1 phenotype, some a mixed phenotype, TFH1 and TFH2. And that is shown here. So you have a single clone where some cells have a TFH1 phenotype and other cells from the same clone have a TFH2 phenotype. And that's examples from two donors, and we also see TFH single. TFH single clones here. So this suggests that the response is actually so TFH1 is linked with less potent B-server help, and that is something we're trying to observe. Now, when we then went deeper into the gene usage and the epitope specificity, we saw that the TCRs that recognize these 22 amino acids in the C-term. 22 amino acids and the C terminals here in these donors, there were some similarities between donors. So, for example, donor 3 and 4 showed similar gene usage and donor 2 and 5. And 2 and 5 specifically used at very high frequency TRBV20-1 here in the TCRs that were specific for this peptide and not in the other TCRs. And when we look at the TCRs. TCRs against the junction, we saw that there is an association with this TRBBD, TRBD30 in this individual. And so when this similarity, we saw this similarity, Anna had a deeper look into the similarity at the TCR level. And then you can see that we find highly similar TCRs, convergent TCRs in different individuals here. Different individuals here. And these are showing some examples. The list is longer. And so that raised the question, of course, how this links to HLA haplotypes. And we had the HLA sequenced. And so we could link this HLA data then to the function data. And this is how we did this. This is how we did this. So, we initially used blocking antibodies against the HLADR, DQ or DP, in our co-culture system to try to understand which locus here was presenting these peptides. And so what you see is that TCRs in all donors here could be blocked by the anti-DR antibody. So, this was the vast, vast majority, and only two TCRs. And only two TCRRs were reacting to this DQ blocking antibody or the anti-DP blocking antibody. So that the vast majority of peptides were actually presented in this context and the TCRs recognized their peptides on HLADRs. And this again, we can enumerate. So here the vast majority, again, of these sequences. Again, of these C-term TCRs recognize the peptide in the context of DR, and then there are only a few that recognize this in the Q, all of the N-termal TCRs here and some of the others. So we wondered, could this high usage in this DLR, HLA-DR context be associated with difference in the TCR generation probability? Generation probability, and this is something Anna looked at using Olga. And that indeed the TCRs that recognize this specific epitope here, the 311 to 333, also had a higher generation probability compared to the total repertoire that we observed, suggesting that this is also linked to HLA. And so, given that we saw these similarities and groups of donors that reacted Of donors that reacted in TCR gene usage and the convergent TCRs, we thought we could maybe run an experiment to test which HLA that really is because we had the HLA haplotype data as well. So what we did, or Ilke did, is she set up the co-culture system where she stimulated the T cells with the autologous B cells from the same donor, or she used B cells from the other donors. B cells from the other donors, and then try to see whether she could activate her TCRs. And so, if we just focus on this part of the graph here, you see that, for example, donor 2 and 5, it didn't matter whether the TCRs from donor 2 were activated by B cells from donor 2 or by B cells from donor 5. So, you could completely exchange these, and it was also true vice versa here. Vice versa here, suggesting that the only shared allele that we could find is this one, that this peptide was presented in the context of this allele in these two donors. And this is different for donor three and four, where we could also swap the B cells without any problem. And these donors actually share these two alleles here, suggesting that again the peptide is presented on one of these two. And then different was done. And then different was donor one. Actually, we could use B cells from donor two or three to activate TCRs from donor one, but the other way didn't work. So none of the TCRs from donor two or three could be activated by B cells from donor one. So again, this suggested to us that this donor must be using an allele for presentation that is not used by the others. And whereas the items are used. And whereas the donor two and three prefer different alleles, and this is summarized here. So we can link this TCR data and the convergent TCRs actually to HLA alleles here through this assay. We don't get down exactly to every single allele with this, but we're getting quite close. And so the last aspect I want to mention is that the target epitope of these TCR Target epitope of these TCRs is shown here, and it's actually quite polymorphic. So, this is an alignment of all of around thousand CSP sequences from parasites that have been isolated all over the world. And you see that there are some positions where they're really quite different. So, this shows you here the strain of the immunizing parasite strain that was used. A parasite strain that was used in the vaccine. And then you see that this is actually a quite unusual strain because many of the isolets actually look a little different here in this sequence. And so we used peptides from these different isolets here in the cell spinylation assay and tested whether the TCRs could actually cross-react to these peptides here with these variability and these positions. And these positions. And so, what you see in these graphs is that actually none of the TCRs recognized the 7G8 or K1 peptide here in any of the donors, and only very few TCRs could cross-react to the DG2 peptide. So, when we had a look at what exactly these TCRs recognized, we observed that these were all TCRs that recognized That recognized the last peptide covering amino acid 390 into 333, where, of course, there is just one amino acid mismatch compared to the immunizing strain. And so these TCRs were only isolated in three or found in three donors that cross-reacted. And these three donors were the only ones that had TCR specific to this peptide, whereas the others covered mostly the more upstream region. Mostly the more upstream region here. So, of course, they couldn't cross-react basically. So, the question then was, how do these TCRs recognize this? And because in this donor here, you see, we had a lot of TCRs that were quite similar, and would they all cross-react? And this is actually not the case. So, although these TCRs. So, although these TCRs are overall very similar and they're identified in the same individual, for example, these differences in their CDRs are sufficient to not allow the recognition of the DD2 here peptide with this one mismatch. So they're highly sensitive to these polymorphisms, suggesting that the T cells would not be activated if they were. Activated if they were seeing a peptide that came from any of these other parasite strains. And so, to just summarize this, so we see that repeated sporozoid immunization induces strong and highly polyclonal CTFH responses against our target, the CSP. The response is dominated by TH1 cells, but we also find clones with a shared TH1, TH2 phenotype. The vast majority The vast majority of these TCRs recognized only this single epitope, basically, covering these 22 amino acids in the C terminus. This is actually an epitope that has been known. It was just never defined at monoclonal level. And this is presented in the context of HLADR. Then we see convergent TCRs that recognize peptides in the context of shared HLADR alleles, but individuals actually. But individuals actually show preferences for certain peptide MHC combinations. And most TCRs do not tolerate natural polymorphisms in the target sequence. So what does that mean for vaccine design? We believe if we would include just this peptide in the vaccine, we would of course avoid the induction of antibody responses, which mostly recognize confirmation epipytopes in the C-true. Formation of epitopes in the C-terminals, and thereby we would avoid the production of inefficient humoral immunity against the C-terminals. But the drawback of this, the C-terminal epitope, is that it's highly strain-specific. So if we immunize with a certain strain, then any parasite in the field, probably that the people would be exposed to would be unable to boost. Would be unable to boost the CTFH response because the TCRs would not be able to recognize this. And so, based on these understandings, we're now working on vaccine design, but this is going too far. So, I'd just like to acknowledge the people who were involved in the work. I mentioned Ilka Wahl and Anna Ratsova already, and they had help from Yulia Buhan, Rebecca Hunstauver, two former master students in the lab.
