Okay, so today I'm going to talk about this inverse problem for hyperbolic equations. This is already a very large subject that, you know, it's very hard to cover everything in one lecture. So today I'm going to focus on the theme of this geometric optic solution method. And especially I want to explain this idea and also explain how this method, explain some recent advances of this method in the application. Advances of this method in application to the one is in the geometric setting, and the other one is for the non-linear problem. So that's roughly speaking my plan. All right. Okay. Oh, all right. So, uh, okay, well there's a lag. Not sure if I pressed the ro okay, so the uh all right, so I will start with the Alright, so I will start with the typical inverse problem for the equations for the wave equation. There are many variants of this problem, but I want to start with the model that we can work with. So basically we consider NG, this is a Riemannian manifold with boundary, and I consider u the solution of this initial boundary value problem. So here we have a dt squared minus Laplace G U. So this Laplace G is the Laplace Beltrami operator. Beltrami operator. And in a local corner, you can write it down in the following way. So, in particular, if you have an Euclidean metric, then this is the standard Laplacian. But because we are interested, we cover the coefficients for this Hubberball equation. So, now you can see the G would appear in this coefficient of the second-order operator, differential operator. And so now we have basically a wave operator. So, the equation is a wave equation on the manifold. And then we impose zero initial. We impose zero initial condition, but we have a boundary, so this dn is the boundary, and we put some boundary condition. And this f is, you can imagine that this f is the source that we can control from the boundary, and then we find this u. So one typical setup for this problem is that you vary the source F, and then you find the solution U, and then you measure this U on the boundary. So in this case, you can measure U on the You can measure u on the, in this case, you define this, in this case, we consider the so-called hyperbolic detail map. What we measure is the normal derivative of u at the boundary. So, therefore, we have this map from the source on the boundary to the solution, you know, the normal derivative of the solution on the boundary. And then the question is, or the inverse problem is how is it possible to recover this metric G from this map lambda? If you vary all the sources on the boundary, and then can you recover and make all the measurements, can you recover? Make all the measurements, can you recover this metric G? And here you can see that G is the coefficient in the equation. So, this is a typical problem. I think this one was studied by Rakesh and Symes in 1987. But there are many variants of this problem. So, here you can consider low-order perturbations to the wave equation, first-order term, zero-order term. And also, you can consider non-linear term in the equation. And even for the measurement here, this is the hyperbolic detail map. This is the hyperbolic detail map, but you can also consider other types of measurement. I will show you in the next slide. But the general idea is that you make measurements of the wave somewhere and you want to recover things typically inside of the domain. So now let me show you some concrete examples for this problem. Okay. So now this type of problem appears in many Now, this type of problem appears in many applications. Okay, so these are three examples. Now, the first one here is actually corresponding to the setup I just mentioned. Now, this is an experiment in rock science. So, now you have a specimen of a rock here. You want to know the properties of this rock by making this measurement. So, here you have this transducer that can send this elastic waves to. Can send this elastic waves to the inside this rock, and then you make measurements on the boundary. Okay, so now this is the this actually corresponds to the problem that I mentioned. Now, the U is actually displacement, and the normal divergent U in this setting is actually the traction or the projection of the string. So, it has a physical meaning for the setup. Now, actually, this setup here is for the nonlinear problem, because here we have two sources, and then I'll say something about this later. And then I will say something about this later. But just to say that this problem you can consider both linear and non-linear. So now here we want to know the property of this rock. Now another popular setup for this problem is inward scattering. I think many of you are familiar with this setup. This is when you, suppose this is the Euclidean domain, but you have a scatter here, either an obstacle or a media. And then you want to probe this medium by sending instant wave. Wave and then this wave when they hit the scatterer, then the wave will scatter, and then you make measurements of the wave here on the receiver. And then from that, you hope to find this medium. And so this one here is well known in the seismology. So basically, here the setup is that you want to, the goal is to know the structure of an underground structure by making Underground structure by making this seismic waves and then you make the measure, you take the measurements on the surface of the ground. So here they have this truck, they have this truck that can hit the ground to send the elastic wave. And then when the wave gets reflected, then you make the measurement here. So from that data, you want to image the underground structure, especially for finding oil, for example. And there's actually a similar setup for this problem to image. Settle for this problem to image the ocean, but you use the ultrasound wave, for example. Okay, so but now this one you the you only take measurements on the surface. You can think well this is sort of a partial data problem. All right, so now there are many other examples. I forgot to say that you know this one, if you consider elastic system, then you would work with the system in the slides in the example here. So, here I think you use scalar function, but you can do system as well. Okay, this is a bit slow. Okay, now the next one. All right, so now how do we solve this problem, right? Now, one way to solve Sashimur's problem, roughly speaking, is by this boundary control method due to Belishov and Kurlov, 1992. Kurliff, 1992. But actually, this method relies on the result of a Tataru of a unique continuation result in 1995. So this method appeared before this theoretical result. So I will not say too much about this method. But typically, so for this result of balance occurring, you will need this metric G to be independent of T. But then a Tata result actually is valid for metrics that depend analytically in T, and then this result has to be extended by asking to metrics that are real analytic in T. That are real analytic in T. Okay, so there's, but there's a, usually, you need analyticity in one of the variables. But then there's a recent work by Alexa Kees, Fizz Mohaimani, and Aksanen. They extended these results to this Lorentz metrics with certain curvature conditions. In particular, they can solve this problem for small metric perturbations of the Minkowski metric. But this metric can be time-dependent, not necessarily analytic in T. So that's a more recent work. That's a more recent work. So, this is a very powerful method, and there are a lot of work in this direction. So, but the one that I want to discuss today is actually this another method called the geometric optic solution. So, this is a very, it's another, it's an old idea, even for solving the forward problem. But so, I want to explain this idea and mainly focus on the recent advances on the, you know, geometry for the geometric setting. For the geometric setting and for nonlinear problems. So I will focus on this method. Okay. All right. So now for this approach, okay, so this geometric option solution method is very intuitive. And actually there are many ways to construct this kind of geometric optic solution. So here I will consider a very intuitive construction. Hopefully because this is wave propagation, I want to see how. Because this is wave propagation, we want to see how this wave propagates and then how do we extract this information from that. So, we will start with the determination of the potentials. This is the simplest setting. So, we consider a Q, which is a compact supported smooth function supported in a ball of radius R. And now we look at this wave equation. So, here, Laplace is a standard Laplacian. The metric is flat. And then now we have a Q, the potential function. Q, the potential function, so we solve this wave equation. And our goal is to find this Q. Instead of the metric, we want to find this Q. So what we do is we want to send in a wave. Okay, so here we want to use a plane wave. So this is, we take a omega, which is a unit, you know, normal vector. So this is a unit direction. And then we consider this delta function delta t minus x delta omega, defined in the distribution sense like that. But basically, this is a distribution. A distribution which is singular only on this t equal to x dot omega. So it's a plane. It's a hyperplane. And now you can think, well, this is a plane wave, and then we, for t is less than minus r, this is a plane wave, and then we let this wave propagate and see what happens if it hit the potential. So therefore, we want to first find this solution u. So now, okay. Now, okay. Now first thing is that it's a very simple calculation that the delta t minus x delta omega satisfy the free wave equation. Okay, so if there is no q, it satisfies this equation. And then you plug in the delta to the equation with the q, then you get this right-hand side, which is q times the delta function. So now the idea of this construction of this progressing wave is to make to find Make a to find some perturbation of this delta so that you can remove the singularity of the right-hand side. Okay, so we gradually remove the singularity, and eventually this term becomes smooth, and then we can solve it by standard regular theory for hyperbolic equation. So, therefore, to remove the singularity, the next thing we can try this term here. So, we add a term A1 times H of T. A1 times h of t minus x dot omega. Here, h is basically the heavy sign function. So, this is equal to 1 when t is bigger than x dot omega, and 0 when t is less than x dot omega. So you can see that h prime, if you know distribution theory, so h prime is actually delta, so it's become a bit smoother. Now, if you try this onsas, and then you can see that this, okay, so first h satisfies through wave equation. H satisfies through wave equation, you plug in, you get the right-hand side becomes the following. You know, you have two terms. One comes with the delta, the other one comes with h. And now we want to remove the top-order singularity, so we want to remove the delta term, and then to do that you can set this to be zero, and therefore you get an equation for this a1. A1 is a function that we want to find, and then you get this equation here. And now you can actually easily solve this equation greater than a1 dot omega. You could do that. Greater than a1 dot omega, you could do that, you can solve this equation and get this following formula. So I'll say this in a minute, but actually, this is an actual transform of this potential of this minus q over 2. Okay, so we'll talk about this later. But let's first continue this construction to see, you know, to find this progressing way. Okay, so all right, so now you continue this procedure. Okay, now you want to remove the um Now we want to remove the delta term. Now we want to reduce the singularity in this H term. So to do that, we will add a term to this answer. So we have delta and that is A1H, and then we add A2, and here we have a T minus X dot omega plus. So this is actually defined as a so-called homogeneous. Defined as a so-called homogeneous distribution. So you can see that this kind of distribution just becomes smoother and smoother near the singular support, which is actually zero. And so then if you do the same thing, you can find that this A2 should, you know, if you want to remove the singularity, you should, you know, this A2 will satisfy this equation. And now you can, because we already know A1, you can do this again to find A2. So therefore we can continue this construction to find this. To find this approximate solution, which is the basic progressing wave. So, okay, so now you continue this for U2, then the right-hand side will become this distribution, which is smoother. So now you continue this process, you get this U is delta plus all these terms here, and then this term, the remainder term, will become Cn minus 2. So now you can use a broad type lemma for Spoton summation. Broad type lemma for aspoton summation, sum of all these terms. And then what we get is actually we get a distribution here plus a term, error term, which is completely smooth. So we removed all the singularity. Send in a plane wave with this delta singularity, but then you can find the solution in this expansion plus a smooth error term. So now once we have a smooth error term, then you can solve this away by standard regulatory theory, right? Standard regularity theory, right? So now, the important thing here is that for this first two terms here, actually this u, okay, actually we constructed a u, which is a so-called co-normal distribution for this hypersurface of t equals x dot omega. So why is a co-normal distribution? Because this distribution with certain singularities, in particular the singularity for all these distributions, are in the normal direction of the singular support. This is the singular support for you, but it's only U, but it's only, but the distribution is singular, only in the normal direction. So, these are the so-called co-normal distribution. There's a well-developed theory for such distributions. You can find it in, for example, Mender's book. And so, in particular, this can be defined in a covariant variant fashion. And you can also express this type of distribution as an oscillator integral and associate each distribution to a symbol. Symbol. And from, you know, that's a symbol uniquely attached to this solution u. So now in this setting, the geometry is very simple. So you can do a simple Fourier transform to see that this U can be written in this form. This is an oscillator integral with this basically the symbol for this equilibrium distribution. So here you can see that the symbol actually has a See that the symbol actually has an isymptotic expansion in terms of the decay in this powerful rho. And this chi is just to eliminate the singularity at row equal to zero. So again, you know, this will only cause a smooth error term here. So now, therefore, this is the construction. That means, you know, if you send in a plane wave, you get this approximate solution. And then, for solving the inverse problem, what we want to do is. Problem, what we want to do is to, because this is something that we can measure. Now, once we measure this, we can extract info, you know, this, all these AJ's, and then the hope is to find, you know, to solve the inverse problem, find the coefficient of the equation from this Aj. So now, because here we have only a potential, right? So, the thing that we can use is the first term, okay? So, that is a principal symbol of this u minus delta. So, you subtract this delta distribution. This delta, this instant wave that we're sending. Now, if you look at the principal symbol of this u minus delta, then this will be actually the principal symbol is actually the A1 term in this expansion, because this one term corresponds to the delta distribution. If you subtract that, then the first term here will be the A1. Now, if you remember some of the calculations or derivation for this progressive Progressive wave, right? So, this A1 term is actually an X-ray transform for this potential. So, this A1 term, up to scalar factor, is actually the X-ray transform of Q. In particular, from the picture, you can see that suppose Q is compact supporting here. Now, what we get for this A1 is actually the integral of this Q along all these lines in this direction, in this omega direction. Because you can vary this omega. Direction. Okay, because you can vary this omega and vary this, because you can vary this omega, basically you get all these integrals of this Q along these lines. So now this is exactly the X-ray transform used in X-ray CT. Okay, so now if you're, I'm not sure if you're familiar with this, but so in X-ray CT, right, so this is the human body, and then this is an X-ray source, you send this X-ray, and then receive the X-ray here. Then receive the X-ray here, but then you have to move the source and detector up and down, and then rotate the body to get all these integrals. Now, from that, for actually CT, is that from all that integrals, you want to reconstruct the image the body, right? So that means you want to reconstruct this function. So this problem is well studied. So therefore, we just converted, by using this progressing wave, we actually converted the inverse problem for the Actually, we converted the inverse problem for this wave equation to an integral geometry problem to reconstruct Q from this integral, from this IQ. Now, just a few words about this. How do you solve this? So the first question, there are several questions. The first question is, can we determine this Q? That is, if IQ is equal to 0, then is Q is equal to 0, right? So that's the injectivity problem. So now for this actual transferector, there's a very simple argument. Simple argument. So this typically, you know, define in our case, right, so this IF is equal to fx plus s omega. So you integrate your f along this line. But in this parameterization, there is a redundancy, actually, because if you move x along the line, you get the same thing. So now to remove that, you can only consider, you can consider the x, which is on the plane orthogonal to omega. So the x is in here. And then you consider the, you reparameterize this. You reparametrize this rate transform in the following way. So you integrate f along this x plus r omega. Now this r becomes a sine distance from this omega. Perfect. So now from here, you can actually do a simple Fourier transform in this x variable and then use a little trick called Fourier slice theorem to see that if i f is equal to zero, then f must be equal to zero. So that is how you know, how we know that f is How we know that F is to, you know, how to show, you know, we can uniquely determine this potential. So, for this problem, you know, that's the solution. So, but we can actually say more about this because not only we have a injectivity result, we also have the reconstruction formula. So, for this problem, so now in particular, you can Now, in particular, you can look at the transpose of the ray transform defined in the following way, because basically you integrate in omega. And then you consider the so-called normal operator, and they can see that i star i will become this singular integral. And this is actually a, if you look at this, then it's actually equal to minus law plus to the one-half, and this is actually a well-defined suit of different operator for order minus one. And therefore, you can find And therefore, you can find a very simple non-local inversion formula of the following form. So, therefore, you not only have an injectivity result, but you can actually have a reconstruction formula. And from here, you can actually derive some stability results. So, all these things that I just described actually works in the geometry setting. So, then I'll say this a little later, but actually, all this, you know, this normal operator construction and the stability result, injectivity results are greater. Injective results are greater, you know, extended to the geometry setting. So, therefore, that's the purpose here. So, alright. So, now let's move on to the geometry setting. Okay, so the flat case is you can do a very simple calculation. Now, what about the geometric setting? So, now the simplest geometric setting, instead of a remaining metric, you consider a sound speed. For example, in here, let C be a smooth function, always possible. Always positive, and C is equal to, you know, this is sound speed, c is equal to 1 outside this ball. And then you look at this wave equation here, you have a sound speed C squared X times Laplisher, right? So in the beginning I said we can consider a metric G. A lot of things actually work in that case, but I want to work with this sound speed case for the moment. And then you do the same thing. So now you do the same thing. You want to say, okay, I sent in a plane wave. Plane wave. That interacts with the medium and see what happens. So now, then one thing that we immediately notice is that when you send in, because you know, when T is sufficiently far, if you send this wave sufficiently far away from the change of the sound speed, then you can still send in a plane wave. Okay, because outside the C is equal to 1 for X, outside this ball. But when this wave propagates inside the perturbation, The perturbation of the sound speed, then the sound speed will actually perturb the wave front. So, therefore, we can no longer have a plane wave after the wave passes through the perturbation of the sound speed. So, therefore, when we look for the progressive wave expansion, we cannot take the x dot omega in this case because the wave front is disturbed. Okay, so now we're actually getting a distorted plane wave, not plane wave anymore. So, therefore, we have to find this, hopefully, we can find this fun. Find this, hopefully, we can find this phi, and then we can still describe the wavefront after this interaction. Therefore, the solution we look for is of the following form: you know, it's a delta, still the singularity is decreasing, but then you have to take into account this variation, you know, this change of wavefront. Oh, if C is the if C is depends on T, then uh well you mean what was the difficulty for for doing this or You mean what's the difficulty for doing this or? Well, for doing this, well, we can, I mean, if C depends on T, you can still, well, you can still do this, right? You can still try the, well, wait a second. So because if C depends on T, essentially this thing here is associated with the Lorentzian metric, right? So then you can still do this reconstruction, but well, I mean. Well, I mean, even this method, you can still do this, but then the inverse, you know, we don't know if you can solve the inverse problem. Yeah, so this part is fine, but later you'll have trouble. And also, if this depends on T, then the other method, this boundary control method, usually it won't work very well. Alright, so let's see how do we continue from here. Now, okay. Now we can do, you know, we plug in that solution and then do this calculation again and find the singularity on the right-hand side of the wave equation. Now in this time, the highest order singularity is actually delta double prime. Okay, so there's a zero to that, but you know, in front, but that's not very important at this moment. Important at this moment. So, therefore, to eliminate the singularity, we need to actually set this to be zero. And if you set this to be zero, then you get actually an icono equation. This is a non-linear first-order equation. So the gradient of x, norm square is equal to 1 over c square. Okay, so now we know that we can set phi equal to x tonal omega when this x stall omega is less than minus r, so away from the change of the sound speed, we can still take that. The sound speed, we can still take that. But we have to solve this eigenvalue equation. Now, this equation can be solved by the Hampton-Jacobian theory, at least locally, or the method of the characteristics. At least locally, we can solve this equation to get this phi. But for the time being, I will assume that this equation can be solved globally. And later, I will say what happens if you can solve this locally. So now, and then you solve this to get this phi. To get this far. Oh, okay. So now, in particular, there is a geometric description for the solution. So basically, if you think your gradient phi is the C here, you consider Hamiltonian. And then you can look at the Hamiltonian system associated with this Hamiltonian. The important thing is that the projection of this Hamiltonian here, you can think of, we can see its gradient of. Here you can think of what we can see as gradient of phi. Now the projection of this projection of this Becker is the solution is called Becker is a curve. And then the projection of that is actually a geodesic for this metric C minus 2 G0. This conformity to G0. So therefore, you know so therefore by solving this column equation you actually have a you know geometric description for the for the solution. Description for the solution. So, as I said, for now, I assume that our iconology equation can be solved globally. So, now next, once we have this phi and have this geometric description, then we can convert the inverse problem to the following. So because originally we try to determine C, right? So now we can extract this phi. If we can measure the wave after the interaction, then we can actually extract the phi. We can actually extract the phi from the wave. And now the question is: if we know phi, can we recover C? So that's the inverse problem. But actually, in this setting, we are not going to get the Judis Ray transform as in the potential case, but we'll get another geometric data. Because this gradient phi is actually perpendicular to the distorted plane wave, and actually we know that the projection is the geodesic. So this phi actually measures the geodesic distance between these two planes if they are far away from each other. Planes if they're far away from the support of, you know, from the perturbation of the sound speed. So, therefore, now we can reduce this problem to the following: suppose we know the travel time of the wave from the boundary of the domain, then can we recover the sound speed, right? So then we reduce the problem to the geometric problem. Now, this problem is sometimes called the boundary rigidity problem. So now we formed this. Now we formed this problem in a geometric way, is the following. So, suppose M is a boundary domain with a smooth boundary, and you take any two points on the boundary, and then you define the boundary distance in the following way. Basically, you measure, you know, this is the length of a curve for this metric 1 over C squared G0. And then DC is the infinite amount of that. So, this distance. So, now suppose we know all the distance between these boundary points, then can we find this sound speed? Okay, so that's what we Speed. Okay, so that's what we get so far by using this progressive waves. And then for this problem, okay, so now to solve this, there has been a lot of work for this geometric problem. And so first of all, for this problem, you need certain prior conditions for the sound speed to solve it. Because if the sound speed is very large, imagine there's a very large sound speed somewhere in our end. In RN, and then the GDC will actually tend to stay away from that region, and then you will not be able to recover any information from that. So, therefore, one condition that guarantees solvability of the problem is the simplicity. So, we say that this MC is simple if for any given two points on the boundary, there's a unique distance minimizing Judiciary joining the two points, and the boundary is strictly convex. So, now this is the case if the sound speech. Now, this is the case if the sound speed increases with the depth. For example, this is a picture. If the sound speed increases with depth, then the judiciary will, if you send the judiciary from the boundary, then it will go back to the boundary. Okay, so this is the case that satisfy the simplistic. Now, in this case, this problem is solved by, this geometric problem is solved by Mohammedov in the 70s and 8, I think 79, so that under this condition, you can actually unique determine C and actually stabilate from this. Stably from the spounded distance. So, this implies that for that wave equation problem, we can actually determine the sound speed by measuring the waves. Because you reduce the inverse problem for PDE to a geometric inverse problem, and then you solve this problem. All right, so now before I say something about the general setting, where this is not simple, let me just mention that where is the Judiciary Ray tracker. Where is the Judiciary Rate transform that we saw before? So now it will appear, because if you do the reconstruction of the progressing wave in this case, now if you try to find this H term, for example, you will try to find an A0 term by eliminating the next order singularity, which is delta prime, you actually get this sort of transport equation along the geodesics. So now that's where you will get the judiciary transport, or some version. The judiciary transform, or some version of that, you know, this weighted version of the judiciary transform. For example, if you and also if you have a potential in the equation and you want to find that, you will also get a judiciary transform. So therefore, like I said, all this results about the injectivity and micro-local analysis for this judiciary transform also in many cases carry over to the geometric setting. Okay, so therefore I'll just say that. So then what happens if this is not simple? So now if this MC is not simple, right, so the many things can happen because the simple means that for any two points on the boundary, then there's a unique judiciary, this is minimizing judiciary between them. So if it's not simple, then well, the judiciary could be trapped inside, then that means the wave will not come out. And but okay, so there, you know, you have to formulate this problem. We have to formulate this problem well, and also there are a lot of actually, there are a lot of challenges for this type of problem. So, now one way to do this is to look at, you know, we can look at the behavior of judicik, okay, too, because if you only know DC, that's the first, you know, the travel time of this waves. Now, what we can do is we can include more data to this. So, we define this scattering relation. So, for any point x c, you look at the judici that goes, you know, that start from this. That goes, you know, that starts from this point in the direction and then goes outside of the domain. So, here we need to assume at least this wave would go outside of the domain. It's not trapped inside. If it's not trapped, then you can define the scanner relation that goes from x to y eta. And then plus, you know the travel time. All of this can be extracted from the wave propagation. And therefore, you study the following problem. If you know this scattering map plus the scattering relation plus the Scatter relation plus the travel time, can you determine C? Okay, so now in the case when this MC is simple, actually this alpha C is equivalent to the distance. But for non-simple metrics, here we still have to assume there's well it's non-trapping, but it could have caustics, you know, the conjugate points or non-configurous boundary. So in those cases, So, in those cases, no, this is actually the right problem to study. So, in the last 10, 20 years, there has been a lot of work for this problem. And we know many results. For example, in the analytic setting, even you have a little trapping is fine. So we know there's a lot of work in this direction. And so, here I want to just show you one result, one type of result, under this geometric condition, which is called a foliation condition. Which is called a foliation condition. So now this means that you assume that your M is foliated by strictly convex hypersurfaces. So this means that up to a nowhere dense set, you can write your M as a union of all this sigma t, and the sigma t is a family of strictly convex hypersurfaces. So then the first one, the sigma zero, is the boundary. So therefore, you can imagine that it's like an onion, right? So if you think, well, your domain is an onion, then you have a lot of layers. Then have a lot of layers. And the important thing is that all these layers are strictly convex for the sound speed or the metric that you consider. Well, the mean curvature is complex. Because here you need to guarantee that the judiciary, for example, right, so you look at the you want the judiciary to come out of the domain, right? domain right so so that that's the uh this is the uh just the uh i don't mean comments i'm not i'm not uh i'm not so sure about that but yeah so but the the important uh the reason for this strict you know for this convex state as uh convex state assumption is that you know you because you want the judiciary to come in and then come out in in a neighborhood okay for for any near any boundary point it's in a geodesic then it will come in and come out so so because if it does not come out then So because if it does not come out, then, well, because the way that they solve this problem is to look at the local problem first. So if this ray does not come out from the boundary, then you don't have that data. So, all right, so now for this, you know, when do we know that this is satisfied? In the sound speed case, if you know that the sound speed Speed case, if you know that the sound speed increases with the depths, like what I show you in the last slide. So if the sound speed increases with the depths, then this condition is satisfied, because then the GDC will bend over and leave this domain. So now for this setup, this problem was solved by Gutherwoman and Andrew Shvashi for dimension bigger than or equal to 3. And they show that actually see the subspecies. They show that actually C, the subspeed is unique determined by the scattering relation. And like I said, the way that they solve this problem is, it's a very clever idea, is that you solve this problem first near the boundary. For any boundary point, you consider the juristics that goes in and goes out. Then you use that little data, because for that, you actually know the basically you know the in this case you will know the barter, you know, the boundary distance near that point, right? So then from that you can Uh then uh from that you can uh determine the sound speed in the neighborhood of the point. Because you have this foliation condition, you can uh get a global result after that. Uh it's not just to propagate, but you can because you first you determine things near the boundary. Uh so so first you determine things on the on near the boundary, right? And now you know a neighborhood. And then you can continue this argument. It's like a layer stripping type argument, yeah. Yeah, yes. Yeah, that's the so C is so that the actual metric is C minus 2 G0. G0 is a clear metric. So you have a metric and this is the convexity for the metric, not the, yeah. Because I'm not sure if mean curvature, you know, the other convexity would imply that. So if that, yeah. Okay, so and since then, okay, so now in this direction, oh ah. So in this direction, okay, so now we I said something about the sound speed, right? So but actually this is satisfied for Riemannian metrics. You know, if the, yeah, this results holds also for Riemannian metrics, okay, if the satisfies foliation condition. And it's known that the foliation condition is satisfied in certain cases, like in the street complex domains with non-negative sectional curvature, with, you know, With simply connected domains. So there are certain cases that we know that the condition satisfies. And in this generality, actually, the scattering rigidity and judicial rate transjectivity of judicial ray transfer, et cetera, for all these questions is solved by a series of work of Stefan Woman and Vashi and some other people. And there's actually a nice kind of a review book for this geometry inverse problem in 2D by Peter and Salvo Woman, which talks about some of these results. Talk about some of these results. Okay, so I'm running out of time. So now I want to move on to the last part, which is the nonlinear phenomenon. So I talked about the geometric setting. So now for the nonlinear phenomena, wave propagation is, this has been known for a long time. And in particular, we know the non-linear phenomena can be observed. And this is the example in ultrasound imaging. So here you say, you know, you So here you want to use ultrasound, you send in an ultrasound pulse and then you want to image the, for example, the brain, or to find the tumor or something. And now, typically, right, so if you send a sound pulse at frequency, say, Fc, if everything is linear, then you receive the pulse mostly concentrated at the frequency Fc. Okay, so this is the linear phenomenon. Phenomena. But because there are some nonlinearity for this problem, and it's observed that when you do this experiment, you can also see some pulses at frequency 2Fc. So this is also sometimes called harmonic generation. Now, and actually, they can identify this phenomenon in some of the images. So now, that means, you know, because of non-reality, you have a new phenomena for this wave propagation. Even if you send a simple, you know, progressive wave, you should be able to see some new phenomena. Of wave, you should be able to see some new phenomena. And actually, if you remember the picture I showed in the beginning for this rock, you know, for this experiment for rock size, you actually need to send two elastic waves and then look at what's the new phenomenon after the interaction. So that's actually for this nonlinear problem. So now, however, you know, most times, you know, this is not used for solving any problem. And in 2014, Kirila Sansa's woman posted a paper proposing to use this. Paper proposing to use this new phenomenon to solve Inverse problem. And then at that time, they got their eyes on this gravitational wave. So this was predicted by Einstein in 1916, and this was detected by LEGO project in 2015. You can see that this paper was actually before the confirmation of this gravitational wave. So, and now what they want to solve is to basically use. Of is to basically use gravitational wave to probe the structure of outer space. And if I describe what they're trying to do, since it sounds very wild, even today I think it was pretty wild. So, what they want to do is: okay, so suppose this is the Earth, and now we look at the Earth in both space and time, so this will be the world line of Earth. Line of Earth. And they want to send, not just detect the gravitational wave, but they want to manipulate gravitational waves so that they can send these waves to the outer space. And then, because these gravitational waves are governed by the equation, there's a nonlinear interaction of these waves, and they want to manipulate this wave so that they can interact and produce a new signal that can come back to the Earth that we can observe later. So, therefore, what they want to do is to use perturbative. is to use or to perturb the source and then make the interaction so that they come back and use this data to probe the structure, no, the space-time structure outside the Earth. So there's a practical problem, but the way to, you know, at that time or here, I mean even now, it's a very ingenious idea. But yeah, we don't know how to actually do this. Yeah, we don't know how to actually do this. But this is the original problem that I consider, and I'm going to say a few things about it. But actually, this idea has been applied to many other more practical problems. So that's how I think this is one example that the mathematics, even you do this in a very high level, but it can still help other sciences. So, which shows the usefulness of our work. Uh our work. Okay, so now uh let me uh briefly explain the setup of the problem and uh um uh explain the uh the idea. Because here the the new thing is uh okay, you can still construct these progressive waves. Okay, like I said, you know, even in the in the Lorenzian, you know, in this Lorenzian setting, you can still construct these waves. But the important thing is, you know, what happens after the interaction, how this progressive would interact under non-linearity. And by the way, And by the way, so for this problem, if you linearize it, then you actually and then if you linearize, if you want to solve this problem by linearization, we do not know how to solve the linearized problem. So that's one example that this boundary control method, for example, we don't know how it works, but this non-linear problem we can solve. All right, so two minutes. Yeah, so just a few words about. Yeah, so just a few words about the setup because you know the meaningful setup for this problem is Lorentzian geometry. You have to take into both the space and time. So now the simplest Lorentz manifold is actually, okay, so let's consider mg, which is a one plus two dimensional Lorentz manifold. And the g is not a positive definite metric, so there's a signature, so it's minus plus plus plus. And the simplest example is the Minkowski metric. So you have a minus dt square and then dx squared dy square dz square. And then dx squared dy square dz square. Now, because the metric is not positive definite, has a signature, we can divide all the tangent vectors into three kinds. So the time-like, if g theta theta less than zero, and then you have a light-like vector and a space-like vector. So basically, divide all the vectors into three categories. So now the Okay, so now let's consider a So now let's consider a time-like geodesic. So this will be a, you can consider a timeline curve or geodesic. So this is the, okay, so this mu hat here is a time-like geodesic. So now this represents the world line of a freely falling observer. So now what you want to do is, okay, for each point P on this line, you look at all the, so this is basically the light cone from this point P, okay, so the future pointing light cone, and then this. Future pointing like cone. And then this red one here is the backward pointing light cone. And then, so there's some terminologies here. So basically everything inside this, for example, if you look at the P and you look at everything inside the cone, then for any point in the cone, it can be connected to P by either a time-like curve or a light-like curve. So that means you can send a signal to that point. And similarly, if you have a point in this background curve, Have a point in this backward cone, and then from this point, we can send a signal that can be received by this point Q. Okay, so that's the meaning we consider this region. So now for the Lorentzian metric, we cannot, I mean, we don't know how to solve this problem for arbitrary Lorentzian metric, but there is a good family of Lorentz metric that we can consider, which is so-called global hyperbolic metric. So this is basically a sentiment where you avoid the violation of this causality. Of this causality. So you assume that there's no causal path on this M, and also there's some for any P and Q, the set that I just show you is compact. So then the important thing that we consider as a class is that then there's a wave equation or hyperbolic equation on this manifold. They are well posed. So you can solve this wave equation. And also for this kind of manifold, there is a sort of canonical form. You can always reduce the Is reduce the manifold to the product type R times N, and then you have this metric of the following type, where it's a minus beta is a smooth function times the V square, and then this kappa is a smooth family of metrics on this manifold N. So it's not exactly a product manifold because this is not, you know, the metrics are not product type, okay? But the manifold is. Okay, so now the setup of the problem is the following. Yeah, so, okay, so basically, now this is the Okay, so basically now this is the setup. Okay, so we want to, okay, so suppose this is the observer, I know the word line of the observer, and like I said, you know, and then we consider a neighborhood of this observer, this set V. Now you consider a wave equation. Okay, so now we consider a nonlinear wave equation. So this is a wave equation plus a simply quadratic nonlinearity here. And now you have the source F, which is supporting the set V. Basically, you send, you know, this F is the source that you can perturb. A source that you can perturb, but you can control, so it's a support inside of V. And then you solve this wave equation, so wave will propagate in a future-pointing light cone. And then they will interact somewhere and produce a signal that can come back. So you make a measurement of this U on the same set. So you control the source, and then you make the measurement on the same set. So now the universe problem is: if we know this so-called source-to-solution map, can you find this any? Can you find this A? Sorry, can you find the metric G in this red set? Okay, so that's the set where you can send the signal and then receive the response. So that's the inverse problem that corresponds to the gravitational wave problem. But it's a simple wave equation problem. So now the way to solve this problem, there are two steps. So first you have to make the interaction and use the progressive wave to produce this wave. This wave, and then the next one is: if it produces the wave, it will come back to the region that you make measurement. So, now the first thing is that if you can produce the source and make the measurement on the standard V, then you can solve this problem. Okay, so this is called the passive measurement problem. So, see, for any Q here, if you send a live signal back to this region V, and then this is solved by this work by Kirlas-Lassan. Okay, so this is one ingredient in their proof: is that you have to. In their proof, is that you have to make sure this is the geometric part. So, for every point, if you receive the signal, it's fine. So, now this leaves us to the analysis part. What is the interaction? So, now for the interaction, the idea is to consider a non-linear version of this geometrics solution method. So, now in a very simple setting, because I'm running out of time, in a very simple setting, Time in a very simple setting. So basically, you can consider this wave equation with a source F that contains a small parameter, say it's epsilon F1. And now you solve this equation, you solve the wave equation and do an expansion in the powers of epsilon. You get this all as a term. Now you can do a simple calculation to see that the first term is just linear wave. And then you have the second term, which is this Q is a fundamental solution of this free. Solution of this free wave operator. And there's a Q times applied to this AW1W1. And then you have higher order interaction terms. So now the idea is that if we're for solving a linear problem, we just need this W1. This is a progressing wave. But now for solving this non-linear problem, what you have to do is look at all these interactions. Because you see, first this waves would interact. So W1 times W1, that means progressive wave would interact. And then after interaction, there is a propagation. You know, after interaction, there is a propagation part. So the Q will propagate things out. So, therefore, the way to solve this problem is to understand this interaction. What is the new wave that produced after the interaction? So, now to do that, I think I will show you a picture because I think I'm running out of time. So, it's 12.20, right? There's been a lot of work for this, but let me just go to the To go to the this is construction for the linear wave. Okay.
