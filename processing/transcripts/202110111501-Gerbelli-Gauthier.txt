We're happy until Jerily I forgot. Sorry, I apologize. Tell us about the growth of the coherency and towers and industrial. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot for having me, for inviting me, for all being here either in person or from afar. And uh ah, and thanks to the staff at FAMS, who has been very, very, very welcoming. It's been really nice to be here. So here's a photo of what we saw this morning when we walked to the first talk. Yeah, first problem is I don't see. Okay, okay. I'm gonna jump right into the problem because it's a 20-minute talk, but maybe, yeah, so I'll do that. So for me, G will be a unitary group. Will be a unitary group. Define in terms of a number field, a CM extension, E over F. If you're not into CM extensions, F can be Q, E can be Q adjoin I, which are favorite quadratic imaginary field. P is a prime of F. On the other hand, if you imagine that it's Q, this next line is not going to work out, but you can sort of reconcile all that in your mind. Gamma P to the N is going to be a tower of co-compact full-level. Of co-compact full-level congruence subgroups. The co-compact assumption, which will make the locally symmetric spaces compact, is the one for which I need this field to not be q. Okay, so the question that I ask, that I'm sort of thinking about, is it's about the Betty numbers of gamma. So how fast does the ith-Betty number grow as I go up this tower? So as gamma gets sort of, gamma shrinks and the locally symmetric space grows. Locally symmetric space squares. In parentheses, I put that it's a vertical question. So, because I think, I don't know if this is what everyone thinks, but stability is like a horizontal asymptotic phenomenon, and towers of congruence subgroups is a vertical asymptotic phenomenon. So I think about asymptotics of arithmetic groups, but maybe not the same as everyone, as other people. Okay, and here are some facts to sort of wrap your head around this question. So, Gary Pierre Dier, So gamma p to the n, as soon as p is, as n is big enough, is the fundamental group of a space x p to the n. So another way it says x p to the n is this quotient. So g mod k is a symmetric space, and then mod gamma. It's a 2 times a times n minus a fold. So it's a complex a times n minus a fold. There's a notion of volume, and the volume of And the volume of the space xp to the n grows like the index of gamma theta in the group in the sort of first group, gamma 1. And that grows like the norm of the prime theta n to this power of n squared minus 1. So why do I put this in here? Because the volume gives you a sort of first trivial upper bound for how the cohomology will grow. And you can see that by sort of very finely triangulating. By sort of very finely triangulating the thing that's at the base of the tower, and then computing cohomology that way. Sort of, when you take covers, the amount of comology you'll get will grow at most as fast as the volume. Okay, and so the first result telling us that not all comology grows at the rate of the volume is this result of Detroit and Wallach, which gives actually a precise description, which I won't talk about, but for the Description, which I won't talk about, but for the limit of the ratio of hi over the volume, it says that if i is the middle degree of cohomology, so half the dimension of the space, then the limit is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. So every degree of cohomology except the middle grows sublinearly in the ball. So the question is going to be what happens for the other degrees? Can we be more precise than this? Precise than this. Any questions about the question? Again, the theorem I want to talk about is so that the group is as before. Assume that n is odd and that p is large enough. Then a sort of consequence of the results of my thesis is that h a, the eighth bin numbers, grows as fast, grows at most as fast as the normal numbers. grows at most as fast as the normal p to the n to the power n. Just to give you a reminder from the previous slide, when we were comparing the volume, that capital N here was n squared minus one, so sort of substantially slower and sort of quantitatively less. Here's an example to just wrap our heads around or get anchored. If g is u21, then xp to the end is what you call the current modular surface. So it's a complex surface or a real fourfold. So in that case, h2 is the middle. H2 is the middle, the only interesting degree is H1, and the theorem says that H1 grows like the norm of P of the n cubed. That's actually a theorem of Simon Marshall, which served as the inspiration for a lot of my work. Okay, and why am I telling you about this random degree HA? It's because it's the first non-zero degree for which anything happens. So what happens is sort of have H0, and then I have nothing that happens until HA, and then for HA, I can give. Okay, why this happens? This is my slide with the head waving in the big picture. So why this happens? So why is of course a fraught question, but my picture of why this happens. So the phenomenon that drives this is endoscopy. So endoscopy is an instance of Langland's functoriality. Is an instance of landlands functoriality. If that's not sort of a pair of words that really speaks to you a lot, that's okay, you're not alone. Here, what it means is that langlands functorality is a way, you can think of it as a way for cohomology classes to come from smaller groups, sort of to be passed from one group to the other. Specifically, in our cases, these classes in HA, they come from classes in H0. From classes in H0 associated to a much smaller group. In this case, it's just U1. Okay, and here's my big sort of picture. So what we want to study is the thing on the left. Of course, I've drawn it as a surface because I don't know how to draw anything bigger than a surface. We want to study the cohomology here. What endoscopy does is it gives, sort of, it attaches to the cohomology classes that we're interested, two cohomology classes in H0 for a locally simplified For a locally symmetric space, for a locally symmetric space associated to U1, which is not built exactly in the same way as ours, which is why I've called it psi p to the n instead of xp to the n. But it's a similar object. And in this case, it's really just a set of points. And so I have this set of points associated to u1. It's very easy to count how that grows. And then what endoscopy gives me is a The photoscopy gives me is a mechanism by which these classes in U1 get sort of assigned to classes in UA and my SA. And the number, sort of the multiplier at each level also grows with the level. So it's not just the number of sort of class on the right-hand side that grows with the level, but also the multiplier. So you can see sort of here I mean sort of, there's norm of p to the n minus 1 to 1 at the bottom level, and that's sort of fixed at x to 1. Etc., etc. So, yeah, that's the sort of hand-waving picture. I'm about to start talking about automorphic representations, so this is also a good moment to ask questions, if there are any questions. Yeah, yeah. Are these dots on the right? Is that like a dot? It's a class group. It's a class group. It's a sort of u1 of AF, mod U1 of F, mod uh, it's an idyllic double quotient associated. Associated to U1, which is why it's disconnected. Okay. So I understand cohomology in terms of representation theory. And so I've written down here sort of the formula that we use to pass from cohomology to representation. It's called Matsushima's formula. I've written it really only in the case. I've written it really only in the case where I need it right now. It says that the dimension of HA can be sort of computed as the multiplicity of two representations that I've called pi A0 and pi0A. This is not sort of, this notation is meant to be suggestive. And one of them gives sort of classes with Hodge weights 0A and the other one A0. And the other one A0. So pi A0 and pi0a. I'm not going to tell you exactly how one arrives at this equality, but they're the only two unitary irreducible representations of this group that I'm studying. And they have two properties. They have trivial infinitesimal character. You can think of it as you squint, if you squint as something like their vectors being harmonic. And if you restrict the representation to k, you can find in it a copy of the eighth exterior. In it, a copy of the eighth exterior product of G mod k, where here little g and little k are the Li algebras. And so they look like A forms on G mod k. So the vectors and those representations look like A forms on G mod k. So in that sense, Matsushima's formula is a sort of representation theory version, just sort of the representation of cohomology classes by harmonic representatives. Okay, so I have these two representations. Okay? So I have these two representations. Well, p to the n has to come in at some point. So m pi p to the n is the multiplicity of this representation pi in a space, in this space g, l2 of g mod m. If you don't like L2, you're also not alone. Just think of your favorite space of functions. I mean, if you think of smooth functions with compact support, you'll be wrong, but if that makes you more comfortable, it's not. It's not a problem. Okay, now that I've moved to representation theory, let me move to the adult. I'm actually going to replace my symmetric space, my locally symmetric space, xp to the n, by a possibly disconnected version, ga mod gf mod, a compact open subgroup, and then the subgroup at infinity. That's what's going to allow me to work with automorphic representation. It's going to allow me to work with automorphic representations. And I'm going to replace this multiplicity, this mÏ€ p to the n, by the multiplicity of pi in this space sort of similar L2, where I take functions on j mod gf, and I take the functions fixed by a compact open subgroup, kp to the m. And then you can start telling yourself, ugh, ideally double quotients. But let me tell you something. I've been watching talks about stability, which I know nothing about throughout. Which I know nothing about throughout the morning. And you guys do something similar, where, for example, you'll take sort of this Steinberg for all groups at the same time. You just sort of take a big object that contains everything you're interested in and study that. This is the same principle. G of A mod G of F, it's sort of huge, horrible. It's not clear if you're going to call it a space, but it's the thing that has all the information you want. You want. So we do the same thing, you and I. Okay, so what are automorphic representations? Well, this space G of A multi G of F, it has an action of the idyllic points of G, under which it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible piece is what we call automorphic representations. Each of these automorphic representations, you can write as a tensor product, really a tensor product over all localizations. But here I'll just say a tensor product of the Lie group. But here I'll just say a tensor product of the Lie group that I'm interested in times a representation of the, of a representation of the Lie group times a representation of the final. There was a question in chat about F. I don't know what slide it was on. F? Wait, what's the question? What's the question? The question is, what is capital F? Capital F is the G is a group defined over F. So F is sort of the number field over which my group is defined. Field over which my group is defined. And A are the Adels of F. You have follow-ups. So if you think that F is Q, you're in business. The person who asked the question said thank you. Great. Okay, so what we want to count, I've sort of packaged it into a formula. Let me try to explain the formula. So, okay, I forgot to say it earlier. This sort of squiggly equal means that means that both quantities are big O of each other, so they grow at the same rate. So this HAP to the end, it's the sum over all automorphic representation, this multiplicity, m phi, does the representation show up or not? It's not over all automorphic representations, it's about the ones that actually have cohomology, so either this pi is 0, pi is 08, and then you're counting the dimension in the finite part of the kp to the n-phase factors. So this is sort of now the quantity that I want to count. Now, the quantity that I want to count. Okay, and the big sort of theorem that I'm going to use is the endoscopic classification of representations. And so this is sort of a result now maybe Arthur's breakthrough is close to 10 years old with extensions to unitary groups by Mock and Kareta, Menguez, Shin and White. And what it does is it describes these automorphic representations of classical groups. Automorphic representations of classical groups. So it attaches to each of these pies a Galois representation. There's a lot of quotes here because there's a lot of things that are not very precise. But the important thing, which I've tried to highlight in yellow, is that it's not just a Galois representation, it's a representation of a Galois group times a copy of SL2C that does the job of encoding how representations are shared between groups. So that's sort of what I'm going to do. Shared between groups. So that's sort of where I'm going to spend the rest of the few minutes I have talking about. So there's a global version, there's a local version, and what they also show is that if this Galo representation factors through a Levy subgroup of GLN, then the representation pi comes from the corresponding product of unitary groups, of smaller unitary groups. And importantly, the SL2 piece, the yellow piece, is determined locally at any place. Piece is determined locally at any place. So if you know it at one place, you know it at every place. So how do I use this? So this is just a reminder of what we have, these Galois representations. Well, this is at infinity, which is the place that I know the most about, sort of the Lie groups, there's this very beautiful thing that if pi infinity is cohomological, so one of these pi A0s or pi zeroas, the SL2C, it has to contain the Lefscheck SL2C. The Lefscheck's SL2 representation spanned by the expomology classes. So I've done a little piece of a Hodge Deiman below to remind you. But sort of the Lefschecks SL2 is the representation of SL2 that you get by cupping with the Kehler class. And so in the case of this HA, for example, also, yeah, assume A equals 1, it's just for the simplicity of the statement. In this case, what it gives us, so it's starting. Gives us, start in low degree, your left shit SL2 is going to give you a big representation. So what that forces is it forces this yellow SL2 piece of the Galois representation to have a very, very big piece. And so it forces it to be, in this case, a big representation of SL2 tensored with a character of the Galois group, plus a little representation of SL2 tensored with a character of the Galois group. What you should have in mind here is that the Galois group sort of has no space. Group sort of has no space to act somehow. It forces it to have very, very simple Galois representations, and most importantly, it forces the Galois representation to factor through GLN minus 1 times GL1. Okay, and now with a minute left or something, let me recap what I've talked about, give us a sketch of the proof overall. So, cohomology classes. So, cohomology classes correspond to fixed vectors and automorphic representations. A low degree of cohomology via this story with the Lefschetz SL2 is going to force a big SL2 piece in the Gallo representation I infinity. The big SL2 piece in the Gallo representation I infinity will force the whole representation to come from the smaller group. Okay, fourth line, make this precise using this stable trace formula is all the work, but I'm not bothering you with it. And then in the end, With it. And then in the end, what comes out is that you show, for example, that this HA0 is bounded by some contribution coming from U1, and then this contribution, this sort of multiplicative factor, which comes out in step four, out of the fundamental lemma, or a fundamental lemma for congruence subgroups, which is a tool. Which is a tool. And a fundamental lemma is a tool that allows you to compare things at level P to the N with things at level P to the N. Maybe that's sort of a good thing to say. Ah, some questions that I have. Okay, can I extend this to other groups, other degrees, and lower bounds? The question is yes. And I'm thinking about it. It's not so interesting. But the question I want to ask you guys is, I mean, if you want to think about it, you're also welcome to. But the question I want to ask you to ask. The question I want to ask sort of people in this room and online is: can one give a geometric proof? Like, you have classes coming from other groups. They come from other groups via all this spectral hoo-ha. Like, is it possible to realize, yeah, for example, to realize these classes as actual cycles coming from other groups and to count the cycles and to sort of bound the cohomology of the counting the cycles, I would find that very, very satisfying, but it's really not in my toolkit. And I would love it. I would love to. Okay, thank you for your attention. Are there questions in person? Are there questions online? I'm not sure if they've. I can look at the chat now. Try to talk. Try to t try to talk because they said that at least last time they enabled it at the end. Or just type in chat. Yeah, if you have questions you can type them in the chat. That means your time is over. Really? No. I mean, I got a ring at the end of your time. Interesting.
