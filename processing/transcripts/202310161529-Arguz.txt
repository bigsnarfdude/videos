Um here's the thumb of my talk. I'd like to tell you about how to pass from curvas to classify, since I will tell you a little bit about mercy searching for class varieties. Then I will talk about some animatic invariants of such varieties, namely Bokramobotin invariants and CUBO DT invariants. And the main result I would like to communicate today is the correspondence theorem between CUBO DT invariants and low chromogen invariants of health similarities. still have similarities. Okay, so quivas, by definition, a quiva is a finite-oriented curve as already was taught by Jul Kendzler with a set of vertices which are denoted by q0 into a set of arrows between these vertices denoted by q. Once you have the data of a quiver, you can describe a seat associated to it. The seat is given by the data of a lettuce. It is given by the data of the lattice, which I draw by n. It shows C to the number of vertices of the colour. And a skew symmetric form omega on n, which is defined on basis elements. So I choose a basis for n which I denote by Ei. Omega defined on Ei Ej is the number of arrows from i to j minus the number of arrows from j to i. So here is an example of So here is an example of the A2 proba or the one chronicle proba. So here the lattice is D2 because we have two vertices and my skew symmetric from E1, E2 evolved from E1, E2 is one because I just said one arrow. And for simplicity of this talk, I will not distinguish my vertices as frozen or unfrozen, which is analogous to what Joe Cameto was saying. To what Joe Kennetzer was saying about framed and gauged. So, in all of our papers, this distinction plays an important role, but it makes it notationally heavy. So, I will assume everything is a valid vertex along which we can mutate. Normally, you can do mutations along just unfrozen vertices, and these mutations are defined These mutations are defined as follows. If you have a seed, you can mutate along a vertex ek and then you can define any bases in this form by the mutation formula. And then you can look at all possible limitations of your seed, which gives all possible different bases. And then you can describe a cluster variety by saying, okay, for each choice of Okay, for each choice of C or basis of N, you're taking a copy of the torus C star to N, where N is the number of vertices of your kerba, and you're doing all these tori together. So a class of variety, defined by Pokerov as a geometric realization of class algebras of Formins and Lewinsky, are just unions of tori, spexia, or spexia, where and our And our dual lattices, depending on what type of closed subvariety you're talking about. So X-closed subvariety, so union of tori is takes union, and you can describe how you're gluing these tori by explicit birational maps, which too depends on the basis elements you're choosing. And you can glue the dual tori to form an A-plus subarray. An A-cluster variety. So, this is a cognatorial description of cluster varieties. And there's also more geometric way of describing cluster varieties in terms of problems. Due to Gross Second Kiel and their birational geometry of Tulsa varieties people, they describe Tulsa varieties in terms of Tauric varieties. And this gives in particular This gives in particular what we call a local abier compactification of a cluster variety. By definition, this is a local abil pair Xd given by an undimensional smooth projective variety X together with a simple normal prosync divisor D in X, such that these anti-economical. And examples of such pairs, vocalobia pairs, are typically Are typically given as toric varieties together with the toric boundary divisor, which is the divisor fixed under the torus action union of the divisor, the altitude divisor. Or you can look at blow-ups of a toric variety along a union of hypersurfaces and the toric boundary and take T to be the strict transform of your toric boundary inverse. And such xt will also give a Will also give you a local libial pair. There are many more local libial pairs, but if you consider specifically low-ups of torque varieties along harder surfaces, then these play important role in the theory of cluster varieties, the theorem, main theorem of the birational geometry of cluster varieties people is saying you can find a local LDR pair xt such that your x cluster X cluster variety arises as the blow up, as the complement of X minus D of a blow up of a toric variety along harpo surfaces in the toric boundary. And here I don't include all the details, but the toric variety you're blowing up and what you're blowing up is all determined from the data of the quiva. So the quilla was, there was a choice of bases for the quilla. Basis for the equivalent, you're essentially looking at the torque variety, including all the rays, EIs, and then you're blowing up along 1 plus C2 EI squared plus V4. So the data of a clear also geometrically tells you the data of a torque variety interlocus to block, but you can obtain class varieties in terms of blocks. Is there any uniqueness to this by variety? That's a very good question. That's a very good question. No, there is no uniqueness. There can be many local labial complexifications. In general, when we look at the basis E i's, we are looking at a Turic variety whose race contains the EIs. And then we want to have a complete Tauric variety to be able to talk of its local mobility and invariance and so on, which we will see. And there are many different ways of completing it, but at the end it won't change the final result. Sorry about this. I think I lost my slides. I'll forget them again. So if you change the way, if you can, like, if you have two rates, as is A2, for example, you can add one rate to complete it to P2 or to P1 for. To P2 or to P1 plus P1, there's a choice of finding a compactification, but no chromolithin invariants or early invariants I will talk about will not count on this choice. So there is no unique way to obtain a local Libya complexification. There is a conjecture due to Foucault and Control which says that if you have these dual A and X cluster varieties, Varieties. It was expected that the A-cluster variety admits the canonical bases and the bases elements are indexed by tropical points on the X-cluster variety, integral tropical points. So you look at the tropicalization of the X-cluster variety. The integral points here index bases, economical bases. And you can also swap X and A, and that holds true. A and that holds true. In the paper of Krosack and Hill, it was shown that this conjecture is false for arbitrary classidarities, but it should be true in the fi situation, namely if x minus t, the component of t in the previous slide that we talked about, is fi. And it was shown by Goroseki and Kiel Pom-Koltsevich that indeed in this situation, this conjecture Situation this conjecture holds. And furthermore, they provided a version of the info control conjecture, which holds in more general situations, but only necessarily in the affinities. And it is what I try to explain here. So if you look at the A cluster variety with principal coefficients, this is not only a single variety, but your cluster rank family. Variety in the repository family of A-cluster varieties over Specia, the torrents. So this is a family of A-cluster varieties, which are all general fibers, or A-cluster varieties, all deformation equivalent. And then you can look at a partial compactification of this family from the torus to an affine space, so I denote by n plus not z to the q0, but natural numbers to the q0. So you can complexify your So you can complexify your family over an affine base such that the special fiber is a torus and then you can look at the formal completion among the special fiber of your family. And then it is shown in the paper of Porosekin Kyokoncevich that this formal completion, this A-print cluster variety, admits a canonical basis whose visualization of the four-plature. And the proof of this theorem uses a combinatorial gadget called the cluster scattering theorem. I will roughly tell in this slide what a cluster scattering the gram is, before in the next slide I will give you the more general definition of what a scattering theorem is. So to define the closest scattering theorem, I will first tell you what is the initial closest scattering theorem. The initial closer scattering theogram associated to the beta of a quiva or a t is just a union of pairs of this form EI perfused Ti C to EI. EI perf circle dimension one loci in your real vector space associated Real vector space associated to the lattice m, dual lattice mr. So for the a2 equivalent, you have e1 perb e2 perb. And you're attaching functions of the form 1 plus ti z to vi, where t and c z are formal coordinators, and vi were the elements which we defined here. Using the skew symmetric form, these Vi's were defined as the contraction of Ei's with the skew symmetric form we have on the quiver. Okay, so you can define elements which are like parvo series and formal variables TIs with code. TR with coefficients and the group ring Cm concretely. And then you can, out of this initial scattering diagram, you can describe the scattering diagram, the cluster scattering diagram, which is a consistent completion of this initial scattering diagram. So you have these initial laws, then you're adding more so every such EI per which is a Kudimans in one locus. A codoman, one locus is called a wall. So you're adding more walls to your diagram and attaching more functions to it, such that the compositions of all automorphisms determined by these walls is giving you identity in this formal policy restrict with coefficient ti, with coefficients the hooprink of i. So there's a combinatorial way to describe the process of completion. Competition just by studying essentially commutators algebra. So here is the most general definition of a scattering telegram at a vector space, MR. The definition is due to Konstantin Slobermann and later on due to Gross and Siebet, which actually is influenced by ideas of previous work by Fikaya. It says if you look at your lettuce, Look at your lattice N and your dual lattice M. A scattering diagram and the vector space, real vector space associated to M is a union of pairs rho F rho, where rho is a wall, which is just a codimunction one subset in your real vector space. And F rho is a power series of this form, where you have some coefficients, where you have some formal variables t i and Formal variables t, and where you have some formal variables z and z to m, which are where m is an element of your letters. Okay, so this is what a scattering diagram is, and the class of scattering diagram particularly fits into this description of a scattering diagram. And an open question has been: is there any meaning of these coefficients in the class scattering diagram? Do they carry any meaning? Do they carry any animative information? And what we did in our work last year is to show it is true that the coefficients appearing in the classes gathering diagram carry animative information in terms of some local bitter membranes. So we showed that if you take a local real compactification of the X cluster variety, then to every wall rho f rho, the power series. F rho, the Paulin series, takes this particular form where the coefficients appearing are there are some constants, combinatorily calculated constants, k tau, which are just calculated in terms of some lattice indices, and then the coefficients are given by Lochrom-Hawitzin invariants of xt. I will tell you in the next slide more what these Lochrom-Hawitzin invariants are. They are counts of curves which we call the curve. Are counts of curves which we call A1 curves. To count on, you need to fix a curve class beta and subcombinatorial type tau. What's the tau? What's this capital T rho? Capital T rho is you sum over all possible combinatorial types so your A1 curves. You can imagine it in 2D, it is just the tropicalization. It's just the tropicalization, you fix the tropicalization, which fixes the combinatorial type. Which, in particular, like if you look at in the two-dimensional situation, the A vacuums we are counting about, if you look at the locally complexifications of your X-cluster variety, for instance, if you complexify the open variety to a P2 and you block Two points on lines on the canonical, anti-canonical device of P2. Then you get two exceptional curves. Any exceptional curve is particularly an A1 curve because it touches the boundary at only one single point. But there are many other A1 curves. Whenever you blow up, in addition to the exceptional curve, you get the string transform of a ligand P2 which passes through the quadruple. P2, which passes through the quantity law, which gives you also other curves. And in addition, there are other curves created. So there are many A1 curves, and these are the types of curves you're counting. And to count them, what you're doing is you're looking at the so there's only one one particular point. So what you fix is you fix beta, your curve class, and you fix the contact data at this particular curve at this boundary. That is boundary. And you fix the tropicalization, which fixes a little bit more than the contact data. It actually fixes the toric strata where your point intersects the boundary. So this tropicalization is equivalent to the data of the combinatorial graph. In my previous work with Mark Cross, we showed that there is a combinatorial algorithm by considering an antidimparal. By considering in any dimension the grow-up of a toric variety along hyper surfaces and the toric boundary, he proved a combinatorial algorithm to calculate all A workers in Xd in any dimension. So this dimension 2 was the result of the corresponding fantasy, but we generalize this to all dimensions. So you can think of this algorithm as its inputs. Your initial exceptional curves, you observe from your initial block, so you input the data of E1, E2. It outputs all the A1 curves in XT. And the subtlety to prove such an algorithm that in higher dimensions such A1 curves to even count such A1 curves is very challenging because, unlike in dimension two, they can 2, they can have what we call negative contact orders with the boundary. So, in dimension 2, any A marker we have in blow-ups of toric varieties, so I should mention that in Tauric varieties, in only purely Toric varieties, there are no A-bunkers. If you intersect the boundary at one point, for topological reasons, you need to intersect this at more than one point. So, they only start to appear when you Start to appear when you blow up mountorically your toric varieties. So these only happen at mount blocks. And in the two-dimensional situation, such curves are just the images of rational maps, which intersects the boundary with given contact theta, which is always positive. But in higher dimensions, there can be examples where we have what we call negative contact over. What we call negative contact others. Then, even describing such maps is challenging. It's the work of Abramovich, Chan, Ross, and Siebert to describe what we call punctured log maps. So, these are log maps with negative contact orders. So, here I just wanted to illustrate what can happen in higher dimensions. If you look at the blow-up of P2 at two points, the base is the momentum polytope of P2 blown up at two points, which is DP7. Had two points, which is dP7. If you take the product of dp7 with p1, the analog of the momentum point of image is this three-dimensional shape, if you blow up this dp7 times p1 along a p1 contained in the boundary p1 cross p1, so if you blow up along the p1 size there, then you will get a family of exceptional curves here. And similarly to p4, And similarly to P4, there is a family of curves going to the other side. So like if you take the string transform of lines connecting this point to the other side, you get also a family of curves that I draw like C, which intersect the exceptional curve and the other components. And this curve C, generically, does not intersect this dilizer here, this front side. So the intersection So the intersection of C with this divisor is zero. But if you degenerate C so that it breaks into two components falling into the union of these two divisors, you will see this component will intersect this divisor with plus one. So due to topological reasons, you need to have this component, which falls totally into the divisor, to have intersection number which with this divisor corresponding to the this side to be minus. To be minus. So this kind of situations happen in higher dimensions. You can have curves degenerating and parts of the curves falling into the toric boundary and to become curves with negative contact data. And to count such curves is challenging because even the moduli space is not a priori equidimensional, but there is some very But there is some work to do to show if you look at only one construct point, you end up in a locus which is equally dimensional to count such curves. Okay, so in our work, with Mark, we proved an algorithm which counts these curves in any dimension. And using this, there is one more theorem we proved with hearing, which particularly uses this, along with some other... Along with some other things, it says that if you look at the formal completion of the A-tring cluster variety, this family of A-cluster varieties with principal coefficients, then this is a base change of the cross-Siebert-Merrim family of the local Libya complexation of the X-class variety. So what we show is the cross-Siebert-Merrim family, which is a priori defined over the oracle. The oracle extends to a bigger family and under some locus where you can restrict and see the apron cluster variety. So, what we do is we put this construction of neurosync and kiel cluster of the cluster varieties into the context of mirror symmetry. And the proof of this is just based on comparing how the combinatorial construction of GHKK is compares to the cross-seebeled mirror construction. To the core Siebelt mirror construction of local ideal varieties, which uses a numerative geometry. And to do this, we use this numerative geometric mirror construction in terms of our work with Spark. We reduce it to a combinatorial construction and then relate it to the cluster scattering token. And as a corollary, one of the corollaries we obtained is that there is an Here is an administrative meaning of all structured constants appearing in the comical bases, which are in the closest giving to the number. Okay, another question we asked is, are there other types of invariance that we could calculate using scattering diagrams? And the answer is yes. One can also calculate Q or D T invariance from some simple initial data. Ourselves simple initial data. So, similarly to we proved an algorithm with Spark inputting simple exceptional curves as A1 curves and outputting the data of all A1 curves. We did something similar for CUVADT invariance. And a particular corollary we obtained is the CUVADT dog-ramodic correspondence. And in the remaining part of my talk, I will tell you about this correspondence. I will tell you about this correspondence. So, to define QA DT invariants, I need to tell you about representations of equivalence. These invariants are defined purely representation theoretically. So if you have the data of equivalent, if you assign a vector space to each vertex of it, here is an example. I took equivalent with three vertices. I assigned C C squared C. And in addition, And in addition, if you assign a linear map between the vector spaces associated to the vertices, this data gives you what we call a representation of the Couvera. And we will consider quiver representations of a given dimension. Like here, the dimension of a quiver representation is just the dimensions of the vector spaces you're assigning to the vertices. So this is a So this is a particular, this will define if I tell you what the maps are, a particular representation of dimension 1, 2, 1. And there is also a natural notion of morphisms and isomorphisms between given two Cua representations. And so I will look at some space of all Cua representations up to isomorphisms, which will Which will amount to taking some GIT quotient by some GLM group at some point. I want to further restrict this marginalized space. I will just look at particular equivalent representations which satisfy a notion of stability defined due to k. I just wrote it down here. So, what this says is, if you have a curve representation of any given dimension gamma, then Ga, then you can choose a stability parameter theta in Gaumper, and you call your representation theta stable if for any sub-representation v prime, the parent of theta in dimension v prime is smaller than zero, and if it's smaller or equal to zero, you call it semi-stable, theta semi-stable. So, together with this notion of stability, And with the choice of a dimension vector, so we fix gamma, the dimension of a query representation, we fix a stability parameter, and we look at the moduli space of all theta semi-stable query representations of dimension γ. And we're going to define quero dt invariants out of this moduli space. To define them, however, there is some additional There is some additional data we often need. If your equivalent contains some cycles, then to the equivalent you also associate something which we call a potential W. This is a formal linear combination of oriented cycles of your curve. So W is of the form gamma C times C, where C are just oriented cycles, gamma C are coefficients. And then whenever you have an oriented And then whenever you have an oriented cycle like this, say in your enclosure, you can consider the trace function associated to any cycle, which is a function from your moduli space to C, you obtain by taking the composition of all the functions and considering the trace of the composition of all the functions in your cycle. And this trace function defines you the trace of your potential as the sum of gamma C trace of these C trace you associate to any cycle. And so we are looking at the critical locus of this trace function and very nice situations, namely if your moduli space is smooth and if this function is And if this function is what we call north spot, then the equivalent invariants are defined as apologies, the Euler characteristic of the critical locus of the stress function, which is an alternating sum of holomology groups of the critical locus with the local with the constant GC. Local bitter constant GC. And in not so nice situations, then you need to do some technical work to look at sheaf cohomology with some intersection cohomology sheaf due to Joyce, Davison, Meinhert, Komsivich, Soiko Maita. Okay, so this is what is a cool DT invariant. This is early characteristic of the critical locus of Characteristic of the critical locus of the trace function. For computational purposes, we will not really work with honest Cuba DT variants, but we will work with rational Cuba DT variants. The data of all rational Cuba DT invariants is equivalence, gives you the data of all Club D T variants. It's just that when we do wall crossing there are some coefficients appearing. There are some coefficients appearing, so we will just repackage the information of Puerto Dt invariance into rational dt invariance where we have some coefficients in front. And these I denote by omega bar theta. The most significant part of this theory, one of the most significant parts of this theory of QA DT invariance is that depending on your choice of stability parameter, these DT invariant change. Change. So there is a wall and chamber structure. A wall, as mentioned before, is of the form gamma curved, so this is a two-dimensional wall. In a three-dimensional space, there can be other walls intersecting this two-dimensional wall. I just draw their projections in red. And then when you choose theta inside in the interior of such a chamber, your cluo detariance will not change. Invariants will not change, but when you cross your wall, they will change by some particular formula. There is a low-crossing formula telling you how they will change due to Joy Sun and consider so. And what we did in our work with Pyrrhic is to show we can calculate all quilo DT invariants out of the data of some very simple quality invariants. Very simple equivalent invariants. Analogously to what I set in the grammar witness side to what we did with Mark. So there, out of the data of simple exceptional curves, I set how to calculate all A1 curves. And then similar story happens for Couloma Dt variants. There are some simpler Coulo-Dt variants which are called attractive DT variants. So recall I had a skew symmetric form on my letters M. Symmetric form on my letter, and if I look at the quadrunction of this q-symmetric form with my dimension vector, I will get a point in mr. And if I choose my stability parameter, this very particular point, this is called the attractor point, then I define my attractor dt invariance, which is usually denoted by omega gamma star, where star stands for this very particular choice of the This very particular choice of the stability parameter given by the attractive point. And sometimes, if this point ends up lying on a wall, you may need to take a perturbation of it, but it won't change the result. Our theorem, it's peering from two years ago already, is showing that all COVID-19 can be calculated from an initial set of attracted ET invariants using an explicit FO3 formula. Using an explicit flow tree formula. This is a flow tree formula which was conjectured by physicist Piolin et al. And what we did is to conjecture a more general flow tree formula for scattering the graphs and we proved that, which in particular proved that conjectural. So this is a formula saying how to get the data of all invariants you want out of some You want out of some initial simple data using some flaws. And then there's the definition of what is the trivial attractive ET invariant. So for many cluots, the attractive ET invariants are extremely simple. They are mostly trivial. Like Richmond in a paper shows that if you have any acyclic cluva, if you don't have any cycles, they will always... If you don't have any cycles, they will always be trivial, for instance. Because a rubber with potential w has trivial attractive etiquette, if they are all equal to 1 for the choice of dimension vector gamma equals one of the basis elements EI, and if they are all zero for any other choice of your dimension vector. And in our latest paper, we Latest paper, which we put on archive a couple of months ago, we showed that if you have a cover which has trivial attractor DT invariance, if you fix a dimension vector and a stability parameter and look at the rational cover DT invariance, they are equal to one over the divisibility of the dimension vector gamma. So if gamma is some multiple of a primitive vector, As some multiple of a primitive vector, that's what the visibility is. Times sum of a k tau, where k tau satural factors the calculate using some lattice events, times the locromoitan invariance and tau beta demo theta, where these are counts of AY curves of class beta of a particular combinatorial type tau, and this class beta is determined from the data of the dimension vector together with the solid plot. Together with the sublimity form. So we are summing, as we were asking, over all possible combinatorial types. Just to visualize what combinatorial type is, like in the previous, sorry, like in the previous diagram, I had this very initial scattering, cluster scattering diagram. You can imagine these initial walls as encoding tropicalizations of your two initial x-rays. Of your two initial exceptional A markers. If you tropicalize your initial exceptional A bunkers that I drew here, you can get a picture like that. And what you add will correspond to the tropicalization of all other A markers you're getting. And the challenge, Environment mentioned, is to define tropicalization so that the tropicalizations will trace out a codimunction model. A codimun one local MR. And that's happening because in higher dimensions we work with families of curves. So we define an appropriate notion of the tropicalization of lockers based on some basic monoid and those definite one-dimensional families of tropical lockers. And that will be what determines combinatorial time. Okay, so this was our result where you sum over all those Where you sum up all possible combinatorial types, which means you're looking at a fixed wall in your scattering sigma, and you look at all A markers which topically correspond to that wall of plus beta. Then there's this correspondence between Couo-D T invariants and Prochroma-Mittin invariants, which were a priori not connected to very differently defined invariants, one totally represented. One totally representation plurality. And to show this, what we do is use the fact that QADT variants have some wall crossing behavior. It was shown by Bridgeland that there is a stability scattering theorem, and the stability scattering theogram captures the CODT variants. CUVADT variants, how they behave under wall crossing. And in the situation on the CULADT variants, if a quiva has trivial tracts of DT variants, we showed how to relate the stability scattering theorem to the cluster scattering theorem. We showed that if your equivalent has trivial tracts of DT variants, the stability scattering theoretical of present is equivalent to the cluster scattering theoretical per second key consequence. And then And then, once we showed this, we used our previous result relating the cluster scattering diagram to the enemy geometrically the founded scattering diagram of cross-seeboes and the situation of blow-ups of torque varieties, which is including the situation of closer varieties due to mine-solved markers. And putting together all these comparisons proves. Proves this correspondence. In the last few minutes, I would like to tell you an example of this correspondence. We were particularly in our paper on ARCA looking at examples where we could relate the CRUA DT invariance to what we call geometric DT invariants. So these are like DT invariants which corresponds to counts of coherent sheaves on treefolds. Coherent sheaves on tree folds. So, some situations, in some large situations, when you have non-compact colour tree-fold, such as KP2 for instance, which is the total space of the canonical line number on P2. Then there is a procedure to construct a clua into potential such that the derived bonded category of coherent sheaves of Kp2 is going to be. P2 is going to be equivalent to the derived category of representations of your equivalent, Pw. And the CUVA, which is related to this particular example, KP2, is this CUVA that I just drew here with three arrows, which I denote by X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3, and C1, C2, C3. And you can define a potential with can define a potential with some sine sums xi xj z. And then this quiver with this state of the potential is a quiver whose category of representations is equivalent to the category of coherent shifts of k P T. And then to define geometric dt variants, what you fix is the data of me given by R, D, and chi, where R amounts the rank, D the degree, and chi the beta characters. And how the characteristic of sheaves. And here, again, there is the notion of stability. This one we have Gizeka stability, so omega bar VKP2, which I refer to as geometric DT variants, are virtual classes of Gizeka stable coherent sheaves supported on P2 of rank R degree D and other characteristic phi. And for some And for some values of dr between minus one and zero, d over r, it is known that the geometric dt invariance correspond to the CUBA dt invariance of this particular CUBA. And for this particular CUBE, it was shown by Peering and his French collaborators that QW has trivial delete in variants. Has trivial activity invariance. So this is a particular case which we therefore can relate our correspondence to LaCrahombit invariance and we obtain this correspondence. So generally if you look at Xt, the local VR surface compactifying a symplectic fiber of the three-dimensional X cluster variety, so the X. X cluster variety, so the X cluster variety is a whole variety, so there is a vibration structure into test symplectic fibers. And then if you denote by n tau B beta V the locomorphisms of A1 Curricin xt, then as a consequence, we prove that one of the parameters we prove is the Is the dT invariance, the honest geometric dt invariance of Kp2 are given by some coefficients that appear, which are calculated purely in terms of the skew symmetric form omega, which you wrote the formula for, times the Lochromautian invariance of Xd. So this is a different correspondence than the well-known FNOP correspondence. FNOP correspondence between counts of curves and shapes, dt Grammar-Wissen correspondence, because here on one side we have the DT invariance of a non-compact Cala-VR treefold and on the other side we have Bochromorphin invariance of a symplectic faga of that color-BR treefold. And the reason why this makes sense. And the reason why this makes sense will become more clear. And the Tolkov Kirich, who will tell you about thermomorphic ferritory, this passage from 3D to 2D will become more clear also than his talk. I think this is all that I wanted to tell you about. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you so much. Are there any questions? Does your general introduction satisfy some kind of like defense equation or something? Capitalizing it? That's a very good question. Whenever I gave this call, Consilier Talk Considerage also asked me this question. I don't know any type of differential equation that is generating function of either A1 curves or DT invariants. Invariants are satisfying, but it's a very good question. I don't know what that is. So, you have the kind of algorithm to calculate this, right? So, this could be translated into the function? I'll have an algorithm. Maybe. That would be a good direction to investigate, definitely. That's a very good project. About the puncture invariance. So you have this corresponding with the log probably with constructing the V so the cross. You need the puncture invariant, right? So do you have some correspondence between the P invariance and puncture long with them? Yeah, so I should have said punctured. I just said look, but these are A1 curves with possibly negative contact or less. So this correspondence is between punctured propaganda. These are exactly. These are exactly what appear in the gross C-butmannic construction. Because in our Burkfoot mark, what we showed is an Eddie Va mansion, the canonical scattering theogram is equivalent to the combinatorial scattering theogram D construct. So we calculate combinatorially all punctured chromological numerates. These are punctures, so I should have said punctures. Okay. Is there an example for a quiver for which the square potential equals zero? Should equals zero, it's a trivial extractive variant? Yes, there are many examples. So if you take, for instance, an acyclic flua, then you don't have any cycles, then the superpotential will be equal to zero, and bridge shows that any acyclic flua has trivial attraction rings. And there are also some generalizations of this result of bridgings, for some quivas called. For some quillas called, which have something called red to green sequence and stuff like that. Yeah. Ultimately, it feels like it might be more general as well. Yeah, so that's a very good question. So one thing that I did not talk about is the paper that we discussed in our previous work. So here I stated only a correspondence between the T invariance of chromosome and non-chromogenes of cluster varieties under this condition. But we in our In our one previous paper, called Tribus and Curse, we've also made this condition on trivial attractor detinarians. We do prove a correspondence between trivial detingrants and logromovitin invariants of toric varieties. And this is due to the fact that we calculate all, the data of all deting variants from these flower trees, and we can relate these small trees without any condition to tropical curves and relate them. Trotty clippers and relate them to pencil whoppers and toric varieties. So those toric varieties are exactly the toric varieties we blow up to obtain our constellar variety. So if you remote a trivial tractor condition, there will be such a correspondence. But if you want a correspondence directly with cluster varieties, with the blow-up of the toric variety, then there are always some virtual counts and then you need You need some condition on this last. But without a trivial condition, we proved such a correspondence in our previous paper. In general, what does a curve interpretation is how to express the general DT internal attractor DT? Attractor DT plus some kind of curve priority, but also cold DT. If the attractor triple If the structure are trivial, everything is kind of a count of curves, and the dt involves itself is a count of curves. But if the dt involves a non-trivial, the kind of total dt involves will not have a counting. And bringing arguments for why it's impossible. Yeah, for close varieties, that's not possible. If you want to get a direct correspondence between curves and closer varieties, that doesn't work. But we showed a correspondence between counts of curves and torque varieties. Constant curves and torque varieties, and the torque varieties that you blow up to obtain your equivalent and to obtain your closed variety and clarity mirrors.
