For our last talk, we have Archie Sahan talking, and he's going to be speaking about stochastic literature for a production. First of all, thanks to the organizers for organizing this wonderful workshop and for giving me the opportunity to present. So I'm going to talk about something that I worked on recently. It's still a little bit in progress, but most of it is almost done. So what is the branch pumper reduction? So, what is Lagrange Puncher reduction? Well, we'll go into a little bit of detail, but the overall idea is you have some Lagrangian that is symmetric under a Lie group action, and you want to find some reduced equations. And so, Lagrange-Montkurt reduction is known, and we are looking to stochasticize it. Okay, a little bit of disclaimer: this talk will be a little bit of a jump process. Process. So there will be instances where I have to skip over a ton of stuff, but otherwise it'll take too much time. It'll be worth the thing. So here's an outline of my talk. I'll start by talking a little bit about Lagrange-Ponkard reduction in the deterministic context. Then I'll talk about the Hamilton-Ponthiagon principle and the stochastic version of it. Then we'll talk about the written Then we'll talk about the reduction theorem. And finally, if time permits, I will do a little example of a stochastic modification of the Kaluza-Line approach to charge particles. So, to give a flavor of reduction theorems, here's one that's pretty well known. This is the Euler-Ponker reduction theorem. So, you have a Lagrangian that is. So, you have a Lagrangian that is defined on a Lie group, and you assume that the Lagrangian is symmetric under the left action, you can also do with right actions. So, this is pretty much the setup for doing fluid mechanics or rigid body. So, the first two statements is really the Corle-Lagrange equations theorem. So, if you have a variational principle, if you have Hamilton's principle, then well, that's equivalent to. Then, well, that's equivalent to solving Euler Lagrange equations. Okay. Well, because the Lagrangian is symmetric under the Lie group action, you can transport everything to the identity. Right? And then you get a reduced Lagrangian defined on the Lie algebra. And so if you parallel transport tangent vectors to the identity, you get. To the identity, you get curves in the Lie algebra, and these curves in the Lie algebra satisfy the reduced variational principle. However, it only does so under certain constrained variations. So the reduction procedure naturally embeds certain, naturally admits certain constraint variations. Admit certain constraint variations. And if you do these constraint variations, then you can show that you have these Euler-Ponkara equations. And so these equations you might notice are done at the level of the Lie algebra. Okay, I mentioned you could do it for writing variant cases. In that case, you have a minus sign. Right. We want to generalize this. So you have a So, you have a Lagrangian that's defined on the tangent bundle of an arbitrary configuration manifold. You no longer assume that it's a Lie group. And what we want to do is we want to take the quotient by G. But as before, in the previous case, we saw that we have a natural isomorphism, right? We have a natural isomorphism between TG mod G and the Lie algebra. So, we would like. Lie algebra. So we would like to have some sort of an isomorphism in of or some sort of an isomorphic representation of TQ mod G. And this was done by Sendra, Mazdin and Raji. So they show that TQ mod G as a bundle over Q mod G is isomorphic to this Whitney sum, but there is some mechanical interpretation here. So you have first the tangent. So, you have first the tangent bundle, and so you are going to get some equations that are on the tangent bundle. And this, and the equations on the tangent bundle side are something that look like Euler-Lagrange equations with some external force. And then you have this other bundle, which is called the adjoint bundle. And if you, well, the fibers over here are isomorphic to the Lie algebra, and the equations you get. And the equations you get over here look similar to Euler-Poincare reduction. So, Euler-Lagrange reduction or Euler-Lagrange equations, Euler-Poincar√© equations. Quotient out Euler and you get Lagrange-Foncare. Right. So, this, this, at the heart of Lagrange-Fompere reduction is this isomorphism. Okay, but before we jump into that, I need to introduce the Hamilton-Bonthryagin principle. The Hamilton-Pontriagin principle. So, the Hamilton-Pontriagin principle is useful to study one version of stochastic mechanics, which is the perturbative viewpoint. And what you do here is generally in Hamilton's principle, you define your action as something that acts on Q and Q dot. Here, you define your action as some function of Q, V, and P, where the momentum. V and P, where the momentum acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the condition q dot equals v. Okay, and then if you do your variations, you end up finding a system that is pretty much the same as the Euler-LeBrane system, except it naturally embeds the Legion's transform. So, the context in which this was done was Dirac constraints. So, there is a two-part paper. So, there is a two-part paper by Yoshimuri and Marston in 2006, and there they develop a variational perspective of giraffe constraints with Hamilton-Both theorem in this scope. Okay, back to Lagrangian reduction. So, we're going to do Lagrangian reduction from this Hamilton-Pointry argent viewpoint. So, everything starts by assuming a connection on this principal bundle. Connection on this principal bundle. And once you have this, you can define an adjoint bundle. So this is really the bundle Q cross the Lie algebra mod G over Q mod G here. G acts on the Lie algebra by the adjoint action. And then Yoshibur and Marston show that this reduced Poincare bundle decomposes into again two parts. One is a sort of One is a sort of oil Lagrange part or implicit oil Lagrange part and a Poincare part. And one other ingredient we will need here is associated to the connection form, you have a curvature, which is a Lie algebra valued curvature. And this curvature reduces to a joint bundle valued curvature on Q mod G. And here's my first jump. I'm going to skip over. Here's my first jump. I'm going to skip over a lot of geometry and go directly into the statement of the Lagrange-Pointre reduction theorem. So, the first two statements are equivalent because you have, because of the Hamilton-Pointriaging principle. Okay, now you reduce your Lagrangian and then your reduced curves satisfy a certain reduced action principle. A certain reduced action principle, but once again you have to restrict to some constraint variations. And then if you look for your critical points of the action, then it's equivalent to solving two sets of equation. The first set of equation looks morally similar to our Le-Lagrange equations, except up to a covariant derivative and an external force. And then on the vertical side, you have something that looks Side, you have something that looks like Euler-Ponker equations. So you have something that is that are equations of Euler-Lagrange type, and you have something that are equations of Euler-Ponkere type. Okay, let's jump into stochastic Hamilton-Ponthreeagon. So the Hamilton-Ponthryagon approach was developed by Gurabhiya Nuhadi and recently studied by Srikan Takao. Study by Sweetman Takao. So, this is an approach to perturbative stochastic mechanics, and what I mean by that is you have some deterministic system that's perturbed by external knots. This is at least superficially different from evaluating Lacrange on diffusion processes, which were studied by Kunio Yasu and Annabel Akuzero and recently. And so we are going to take up the perturbative approach. Okay, so what do we have here? We have a Lagrangian, which is Lagrangian of the deterministic system. We have what I call our noise Lagrangians, but these are really potential energies because they only depend on Q and then we have some vector fields that are essentially stochasticizing the paths of Q. The paths of Q. So you can think of this as a stochastic contribution to the philosophy. Okay, and we need to do some sort of variations. And so we assume a Riemannian structure. The first two conditions are sort of immediate. You want. I just noticed that, by the way, I have gamma here. This gamma is not the same as the gamma over here. The gamma over here. So these are potentials over here. Gamma is a semi-martingal. Okay, so you want each of them to be a semi-martingal because you may need to integrate against semi-martingals. And you want your variations to be at epsilon equals 0, you want to have the original semi-martingale. The other thing we need is a sort of pathwise smoothness. Smoothness, and if you have pathways smoothness, theorem by Arnada and Thalmayer tells you that the limit is an adaptive process and will additionally impose that it's a semi-martin limit. Okay, these kinds of variations have been done in the literature. The spe the specific paper I'm going to refer to is the one by Arnold and Thalmer, this is the one I'm using. By Arnord and Thalmat, this is the one I'm using. So, if M is geodesically complete, then given some process, tangent bundle process over gamma, you can construct such a variational family. Okay, the other thing you might need to do is consider fixed endpoint variations. So, in that case, we assume some parallel transport and we start with a curve, and additionally, we assume that we are starting at a given. Additionally, we assume that we are starting at a given point, and then we take deterministic loops at A in the tangent bundle and we parallel transport these loops along the semi-market. And then if you do these variations in, then you can show that critical points of the Hamilton Point III in action satisfy some version of Stochar. Satisfy some version of stochastic Euler Lagrange equations. Fair enough. So let me skip a ton of material again and talk about Lagrange-Compare reduction in the stochastic case. Okay, I'm going to assume some constraint on the noise vector fields, some symmetric constraints. And so I'm not only going to assume that they're symmetric under a left action, but their projection on the But their projection on the adjoint bundle are constant sections. Physically, what I'm saying is that there is no torque in the group direction. Or, yeah, doubt is the best way to put it. Okay, and then you have some invariant Lagrangians and invariant smooth functions, you reduce them, and then again skipping a ton of things, you get a stochastic Lagrange-Poincar√© reduction theorem. Poincar√© reduction theorem, where the first two conditions are equivalent by the Hamilton-Point principle. Then you get some reduced functional here and so reduced curves satisfy the critical points of the reduced functional under certain constraint variations. And you get two kinds of systems: a horizontal system and a vertical system. system and a vertical system. So these vertical systems are again of Euler-Poincar√© type and this morally represents the stochastic Euler Lagrange with an additional force. So you have pretty much things that are similar to the deterministic case. So two immediate special cases are if you have Q equals G, then you get Stochastic Euler-Poincar√© equations. So these equations have been studied by Straight. So, these equations have been studied by Sweet and Katao, even previously by Daryl, Home, and others. And if you take G2 with identity, you just get stochastic by Le La Branch. Now, two other interesting cases happen if you control how the noise is put in. So, if I assume that I mentioned that the noise vector fields project down to constant sections of that joint bundle. So, if I assume that these sections are zero. So, if I assume that these sections are zero, then the Lagrange-Poinchar equations are really deterministic. Okay? And the vertical noise case is, well, you take all the noise Lagrangians to be zero and the projections of the noise vector fields on the tangent bundle of Q mod Q to be zero. And in that case, you almost have deterministic. Almost have deterministic Euler Lagrange, oops, but with a stochastic forcing there. So, the way I want you to think about this is the following: imagine you have some rigid body and here is a rotor on top. The horizontal noise case tells you that there is no noise on the rotor. So, whatever noise happens is because of external noise, and so the movement of the system is. And so, the movement of the system is governed by some external noise. The vertical noise case tells you that there is essentially no external noise. Whatever noise is is on the rotor, so it could be like a quality rotor having some sort of noise. And this rotor noise contributes to the stochastic force center. Question: You have when you say Q equals G, do you mean the trigger? Yeah, so it's just Q is the. Just your Q is the G principle one, right? Yeah, so in that case, it's just G means you are real. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why you have all the. Well, why do we say horizontal? Oh, because, well, you know, because there's no vertical. No, because these, all of these coordinates vanish, and these are, these are really things in the Lie algebra. So, so, so, this is really the This is really the adjoint bundle, and this is the Q mod G bundle. So this part vanishes. So your G equals C means your base space is okay. Let me go very quickly over this because I'm running out of time. So, if you're familiar with the Lorentz equation, one Equation, one way to view the Lorentz equation is you take the geodesic flow on R3 cross S1 under a certain metric and you go through Lagrangian reduction. And so this metric is essentially derived from a connection on trivializing connection on the principal bundle. And I won't go much into I won't go much into these details, but you have really you have a metric, you can write down the geodesic flow-Lagrangian. But what happens is, so you have a vertical equations and a horizontal equation. So the vertical equations, if you look at the vertical equations, you get conserved quantities. And what gets conserved is the momentum conjugate to this lambda. This lambda is really to be interpreted as some velocity. As some velocity in the group direction. So you take the momentum conjugate to that velocity and that is conserved. And what that means is you can define the electric charge from there. And so this entire conservation is really tied to charge conservation. And the horizontal LeBronch-Poincar√© equations are, sorry, there would be no Q here, but. Sorry, there would be no Q here, but the horizontal LaBranche-Ponquer equation is just the Lorentz-Force law. Okay, so let's apply this in the stochastic context. And in that case, what you get is you regain your vertical Lagrange-Poincarr equations. This is actually a consequence of the fact that S1 is an oval group. So you still get your charge conservation equation. The horizontal Lagrange-Poincar√© equations has some extra additional force. Has some extra additional force to it. But one thing you might notice is that if I take these v's to be 0, I am only left with del gamma del x. And then if I take gamma to be the electric potential, this morally looks like a particle in a magnetic field with a stochastically varying electric field. Alright, so here's some of my main references, and I'll conclude my talk here. Document questions. Is there any kind of parallel theory where you do Hamiltonian instead of Hamiltonian? Oh yes, there is. So it's standing the point that you're doing Lagrangian instead of Hamiltonian, or which is the. Which is so, in some sense, the Hamiltonian theory is very well developed. And the Lagrangian theory is not that well developed. So the standard reference, so this was done much earlier by Bismarck. And then the more modern reference that does it in sort of the entire geometric mechanics language is by Shonandra, Lazaro Kamiya and Johan Pablo of Dega. Just because I'm used to seeing reduction in Hamiltonian myself. Right, yeah, so they also do reduction. They do the entire symplectic reduction and everything. So the paper is called Reduction, Reconstruction, and Skew Symmetric Decomposition of Symmetric STE, something like that. I'd like to thank the rest of the speakers of the day because this is the last one, so let's take them. I guess it's time to eat one of you right now. Not for 50 months. Not for 50. You can wait outside. Outside, yeah. Look, I'm looking at our talk. Yeah, I haven't sounded. Yeah, I think that's where I can't feel it. Oh, yes, we are.
