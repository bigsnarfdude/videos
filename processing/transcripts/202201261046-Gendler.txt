gravity conjecture. I'd of course like to first thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak here. And I even feel like I can pretend that I'm in Banff because there's about a foot of snow out here in Ithaca. All right, so today I'll be telling you about this upcoming work with my collaborators Ben Heidenreich, Liam McAllister, Jakob Moritz, and Tom Rudelius. Okay, so just to summarize what this talk is about in two sentences, Is about in two sentences. I'll first describe a framework for reconstructing the Kayler moduli spaces of Calabia threefolds using a topological invariant called Gopa-Kumarvafa invariance. And then I'll use this reconstruction to verify the weak gravity conjecture in a large ensemble of geometries. So that's the two-sentence summary, but let me now give you a roadmap of where we're going. I'll first remind you. I'll first remind you of the weak gravity conjecture, but specifically I'll translate it into a statement about geometry. Then, as promised, I'll show you how to reconstruct the Kehler moduli space using Gopak-Kumar-Goff invariance. And finally, I'll use this reconstruction to test the weak gravity conjecture. All right, so just to set notation, let me state the weak gravity conjecture. So consider a gravitational theory containing a U1 gauge field. Then in order to Gauge field. Then, in order to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, the conjecture says that there should exist a particle whose charge-to-mass ratio is larger than or equal to the charge-to-mass ratio of an extremal black hole in that theory. Okay, so that's kind of the original weak gravity conjecture. But in this talk, I'm going to be focusing on a slightly stronger formulation of the conjecture known as the tower weak gravity conjecture, which says that in Conjecture, which says that instead of just a single particle satisfying this bound, there should exist an infinite number of particles that satisfy this bound in each direction in charge space. So this is hard to check in general, but we can make progress testing this version of the conjecture in certain regions of the charge space using BPS states. So just to go into a bit more detail about that, let's look at this sort of cartoon. Look at this sort of cartoon example where we have two U1 gauge fields so that particles in the theory can have charges Q1 or Q2 under those different gauge fields. And here I'm going to be plotting the charge to mass ratio in each direction. So first of all, there's a region in this parameter space known as the black hole region where black holes can exist. So black holes that live on the interior of this region are sub-extremal black holes. Are sub-extremal black holes and black holes that live on the boundary on this gray border here are exactly extremal. And of course, black holes can't exist anywhere outside this region because if they did, they would be super extremal. So that's the black hole region. But in this parameter space, we can also plot the BPS bound. So the BPS bound just says that every particle in the theory has a lower bound on its map. Has a lower bound on its mass coming from the BPS threshold. And the important point about this picture is that they don't agree everywhere. So the BPS bound and the externality bound don't agree everywhere, but there's this interesting region where they overlap. And it's in that region that we can make progress testing the weak gravity conjecture because we know that if the conjecture is to be satisfied there, it has to be satisfied with BPS particles. So this is kind of going to be So, this is kind of going to be a main character. And you can see that in the charge space, this overlapping region defines a cone. And I'm going to give this cone a name because it's, like I said, going to be the main character in our talk today. I'll call it K tilde. All right. And the tower weak gravity conjecture implies that for every charge direction inside K tilde, there should exist an infinite number of holomorphic curves hosted. Of holomorphic curves hosting single particle states with charges proportional to Q. So, all I mean by this is that for every ray inside of this cone K tilde, there should be an infinite tower of BPS states. So that's what we're going to check. So the required ingredients for studying this are, first of all, we have to know what the single particle states are, i.e. what are the BPS states in the theory. And second of all, we have to know We have to know what this cone is. What is K tilde? So, the bulk of this talk is going to be about obtaining these two ingredients in a particular setting. Oh, is there a question? Yeah. Hi, Naomi. This is Alexander. Just for simple clarification for me, I mean, like you say along each ray, but I mean, if it's really weak gravity, then you know, each ray going. Know each ray going outside the Lilla region, then you shouldn't you only have the states outside the Lilla region in outside of it in the white on the white upper right part, so to speak, outside the Lilla or pink region. Because I mean charge bigger than Mars or charge bigger than the charge of an extremal black hole. I'm not sure I understand the question. You're saying, shouldn't there only be states in a particular region of Charleston? In a particular region of charts, no, no, no. What I mean is, shouldn't they? If you look at these rays you were talking about, that are coming from the origin and they are filling out this, they're crossing the pink region. Right. To the upper right. But no, the tower of gravity, shouldn't you only, should this not only contain or apply to states which are sitting in the white outside the no, in this cone K tilde, but outside the red line? In the white line. And the white, yeah. So, so I've done something a little bit sneaky in this picture, which is that this cone I'm drawing here, I'm imagining that it's a cone in the charge space, whereas this is the charge to mass space. Yeah, exactly. This is why this is why I was confused. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, that is a little confusing, right? So, I'm just saying that, um, right. So, so the states that lie in this region are, of course, in the charge to mass space only going to lie on this pink line, because yes, states, but in States, but in if you just look at the charge lattice, they'll fill out an entire cone. Oh, I see. So the cone is to, then I'm supposed to read the access just as charge access. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Then I'm fine. Okay. Thank you. That's an important point. So K tilde is a cone in the charge space, not the charged mass space. Yeah, this is because of the overlay. This is why I was confused. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's an important clarification. Anything else before I go on? Else before I go on? All right, so we're going to be focused on these two ingredients and we're going to get our hands on them in a particular setting. So let's describe that setting first of all. So consider M-theory compactified on a Calabia threefold, and I'll call this threefold X. This compactification gives rise to a five-dimensional effective theory, which has the nice feature that Which has the nice feature that the polynomial prepotential is exact. So the prepotential is written here. It's a cubic polynomial where these coefficients are the kappa ijk are the triple intersection numbers of the collabi al, and the t sub i are the Kaylor parameters. Now, what are the BPS states in this theory? Well, they're M2 brains wrapped on holomorphic curves. And so it's these states that we're going to verify satisfy the weak graph. To verify, satisfy the weak gravity conjecture. All right, so again, the BPS states are M2 brains wrapped on holomorphic curves, and these saturate the BPS bound. So just to remind you, the BPS bound is this inequality here, and BPS states have masses which are precisely equal to Z, which is the central charge of the theory. Like I alluded to earlier, BPS states come in cones in the charge space. Cones in the charge space. And roughly speaking, they're counted by Gopak-Kumar-Waffa invariance. So let's look at an example of how this might play out. So here I'm plotting for you in purple the cone in the charge space where BPS states might live. So the BPS cone or the Maury cone, as I'll call it for the rest of this talk. And at each site in this charge lattice, we can go ahead and count the number of BPS states, or rather, we can calculate the Gopu Kumorvaf. We can calculate the Gopakumar-Waffa invariant at that charge site. So that might look something like this. And in fact, these are not just made-up numbers. These Gopa-Kumarvaffin variants were calculated really for an explicit collabio. And maybe you're wondering how did I come to plot these numbers on the screen? Well, there's a well-known algorithm for computing Gopa-Kumarvafa invariance by Hassono-Clem Thiessen. Invariants by Hasono, Clem, Thiessen, and Yao. But my friends here at Cornell have made significant computational progress in computing the genus zero Gopu-Kumarwafa invariance for Calabiao threefolds in the Kreuser-Skarka database. And so luckily for me, I can simply use the software CY tools to come to know the Gopa-Kumar-Waffa invariants. But I'll just say that this is not a talk about computing Gopa-Kumar-Wafa invariants, although, you know, I'm sure there. Out, you know, I'm sure there will be many of those. For the rest of this talk, we'll just take the Gopu Kumarbafen variants as given to us. Is there another question? Is there a hand? No? Okay. If so, please go ahead. But all right. So we'll take the Gopu-Kumar-Baffin variants as just given to us. Sorry, Naoi. That's one question. Question: Sorry, Neil. Just one question: talking about the genus zero version, which is a combination of some various spins, right? Yeah, the refinement of the statement, or you're just talking about some combination of different spin states. No, I'm really just talking about the genus zero GV invariance, which is why I made sure to include the qualifier that the BPS states are roughly counted by the. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you. All right. Great. So, there's two features I want to point your eye to in this collection of GV invariants. The first is that we have rays like this one, which I've shaded in purple, which has a non-zero GV invariant along on every single site in this ray. So this kind of ray hosts an infinite tower of BPS states. So that's the first feature. The second kind of ray that you might have is something like this red one, which has only a Like this red one, which has only a finite number of states. So you can see along this ray over here, there's a six at charge site zero, one, but forever after that, it's always just zero. So this ray hosts only a finite number of states. And verifying the tower weak gravity conjecture in this context amounts to verifying that all the rays with a finite number of states, like this one in red, lie outside of the cone k tilde. Of the cone k tilde. So that's what we want to check. All right, so that's the BPS states. And now I'm going to turn to getting our hands on this cone K tilde. But before I do that, any questions or clarifications so far? All right, great. So K tilde. Again, we want to find the cone where spherically symmetric BPS black holes can exist. Can exist. And recently, Aliem Heidenreich and Rudelius proved that this is contained in the cone K tilde, which I'll now define for you. And at this point, I have to apologize because in order to define the cone K tilde for you, I first have to define another cone. This project is kind of like the study of various cones, the extended Kaler cone. So the extended Kaler cone is the union of all Kaler, of Kaler cones of all collaborations. All of Kayler cones of all collab Yaus, which are birationally equivalent to your original collab Yao X. And by birationally equivalent, I just mean isomorphic, except for along curves. And that's a lot of words, but the picture that I want you to have in mind is simply that if, for example, you had three collabials, x, x prime, and x double prime, which are all birationally equivalent, then the extended Kaler cone is simply the union of all three of their cone. simply the union of all three of their Kaler cones. All right, so finally we're ready to define K tilde. So K tilde is the cone that you get by applying the so-called dual coordinate map to the extended Kayler cone K. So what does this mean? It just means that we multiply the Kayler parameters or contract them using the triple intersection numbers in each Kayler cone. In each Kaler cone. So we just go Kaler cone by Kaler cone and multiply the Kaler parameters using the triple intersection numbers of that collabial. And when we do this, we get a cone, which is K tilde. That's the cone that we need in order to verify the weak gravity conjecture. And so the upshot of this slide is that what we really need is to find the extended Kaler cone. In a sense, once we've got the concept, Kayler cone. In a sense, once we have found the extended Kaler cone, getting k tilde is trivial because it just involves applying this map where we find the dual coordinates. So what we really need is to find the extended Kaler cone. And now I'll show you how we can do that. All right, so now we come to calculating the extended Kayler cone using GB invariance, and that's really what I mean when I say reconstructing the Kayler moduli space. Reconstructing the Kayler moduli space. So, the main point that I want to get across is that given only the Gopu-Kumur-Waffa invariance of a collabial X, we can reconstruct the extended Kaler cone. And I think this is really cool because what this means is that given the data for a single collabial, we can obtain information about a whole class of collabials. How does this work? Well, roughly, the Gopuka-Marvafa invariants. Roughly, the Gopu-Kamarvafa invariants tell us about which curves can be shrunk in the collabiatu without inducing an infinite number of massless states. So that's kind of a vague statement, but I'm now going to describe to you precisely how this works. And then after I'm done describing it abstractly, we'll apply this machinery to our example from earlier. All right, so to obtain the extended Kaler cone, let's the extended Kaler cone, let's first of all compactify our five-dimensional theory on a circle to obtain a four-dimensional theory in type IIa string theory. So in this effective theory, the prepotential takes the following form. So again, there's this polynomial piece, which depends on the triple intersection numbers as well as the Kayler parameters. But now, of course, in type 2a, the pre-potential receives instanton corrections. So we also have this infinite. So we also have this infinite sum of non-perturbative corrections to the pre-potential. And I just want to walk you through what this sum means. So we're summing over all curve classes in the Maury cone of X or the BPS cone. And then we have here this N0 is the genus zero Gopuk-Kumarwaffa invariant of the curve class C. And then we have this function, which is a trilogarithm whose argument Trilogarithm whose argument is e to the 2πi times the curve class dotted with the Kayla parameters. So this exponent here is really just the volume of a particular curve. All right. And now let's further suppose that there's a ray in the Maury cone, which has only a single curve class with a non-vanishing GV invariant. And I'll call this single curve class, this special curve class, C0. So just to give you a more concrete. So, just to give you a more concrete picture, if you remember our example from earlier that I flashed up a few slides ago, we had this ray in the Mori cone, which had all zeros except for at the site 0,1, which had a GV invariant of six. So in this example, this curve class here, 0,1, would be our special curve C0. Now let's change the Kaylor parameter, which is given by the volume. Which is given by the volume of that special curve C0, so that formally it becomes negative. So we'll take the volume of C0 and send it to minus the volume of C0. And by doing this, the picture you should have in mind is that we're entering the Kayler cone of a new Kalabi-Yau X prime, which is birationally equivalent to X. And this is up to one little subtlety, which I'll get back to in a couple of slides, but for For now, this is the picture that you should have in mind. All right, so now let's see exactly why that is. On the next slide, I'm going to derive this fact, to do a derivation. This is the only sort of like set of equations I'm going to have in this slide, but I think it's really important to do and also very informative. So I want to go through it carefully. All right, so again, let's start with the prepotential in type 2A. This is exactly the same prepotential. This is exactly the same pre-potential I wrote down a couple slides ago. We have the polynomial piece and this infinite sum of instanton corrections. The only thing I've done here is that I've separated out this one term, which is the term corresponding to our special curve C0. So that's all I've done here. I've just rewritten the pre-potential. And now remember, I said we want to take the volume of the curve C0 to minus itself. So in other words, we want to take the curve class C0 dotted with the Kayla parameters. dotted with the Kayla parameters to minus that. So that's all I'm going to do in this next line. I'm going to replace every time I see c0 dot t with minus c0 dot t. And when I do that, I get something like this. And importantly, the only real change that happens here is that this term gets an argument that flips sign. And it's really important here that there was only that one curve that was special. That was special, or there was only that one ray that had only a finite number of states, because it means that we can make this substitution without doing any bad thing to the rest of this sum. So in other words, all of the volumes in the rest of this sum stay positive. So we're making this one curve volume negative, but the rest stays positive. And now we can use this polylogarithm identity. Polylogarithm identity, which roughly speaking says that the trilogarithm of e to the minus something is the trilogarithm e to the plus something plus a polynomial piece. And crucially, this polynomial piece has this cubic term. And so what we're going to do now is just substitute this expression into the above line here and see what we get. So when we do that, we end up with an expression that looks almost exactly like the first. Almost exactly like the first line that we started with, except for this one change, which is that the triple intersection numbers here have shifted. And they've shifted because of the inclusion of this cubic term in the trilogarithm identity. So what happened? We took the volume of a curve to minus itself, and we ended up with the pre-potential for a new collabio, x prime. collabi yu X prime and this new collabi yu has triple intersection numbers given by kappa prime ABC. Any questions about this? All right. So what have we learned? Let's recap. We've learned that an isolated generator of the Maury cone with a finite number of non-vanishing GV invariants can be flopped to obtain a new collabial. And now to return to And now, to return to this subtlety, which I promised you a few slides ago, if a divisor also shrinks when we shrink a curve, then we're sort of not allowed to go through that boundary, right? Because we've reached the boundary of the moduli space. And the upshot is that by performing all of the available flops to uncover all the collabi yows, which are birationally equivalent to the original collabiya, we can determine the extended calycone. We can determine the extended calypcone. And so now let's apply this machinery in our concrete two-dimensional example from earlier. All right, so here's the example I showed you before. This is a Calabiao threefold X. It has H11 equals to 2. And again, I'm just showing you the Gopa-Kumaravafa invariance here in the Moricone. And And for visual clarity, I'm going to put a dot everywhere I see a Gopu Kumarwafa invariant that's not zero. So that's all I'm doing here. I'm just putting black dots in the places where the GV invariants are not zero. And like I said before, there's this one special curve sitting at the site 0, 1, which can be flopped. So this curve, we're allowed to take the curve class C to minus C. All right, so now we're going to do. All right, so now we're going to do that. So taking c to minus c gives rise to a new collabiow x prime, which is birationally equivalent to x. And when you take the volume of c to zero, the point is that only a finite number of states becomes massless. And the number of states that becomes massless is equal to the Gopu-Kumar-Baffa invariant of C. All right, so now let's really do this flop. So let's take this curve at zero, So let's take this curve at 0,1 and send it to minus itself. And you can see that what happens when you do this is you end up with this pink cone here, which is the Maury cone of our new collabial X prime. So we have the Maury cone of X in blue and the Mauricone of X prime in red or pink. And there's this overlapping region, which is another cone. And it's a really important cone. So I'm also going to give it a name. Cone, so I'm also going to give it a name. We call it the infinity cone. And we call it the infinity cone because every ray inside of this cone hosts an infinite number of BPS particles. So you can see why the infinity cone will be relevant for checking the weak gravity conjecture. All right, so here's just that picture. Again, I made it a little smaller. So we have the Moory cone of X in blue. We have the Moory cone of X prime in red, and we have this. X prime in red, and we have this overlapping region, the infinity cone. And now I'm simply going to take the literal cone duals of all three of these cones. So for example, when I take the cone dual of the first quadrant, I get back the first quadrant, and so on. So the dual of the Maury cone of X becomes on this side the Kayler cone of X, the first quadrant. The Maury cone of X prime becomes the Kayler cone of X prime, this pink region on the right. And as And as promised, the dual of the infinity cone in purple becomes the union of the two Kayler cones of x and x prime, i.e., the extended Kayler cone. So the upshot is that the infinity cone is the dual of the extended Kayler cone. All right. So finally, we've obtained the extended Kayler cone, and we're ready to check the weak gravity conjecture in this example. So again, Example. So again, here we have the extended Kayler cone of X. And in order to obtain the cone k tilde, we have to apply this dual coordinate map. So remember, that just means taking the Kayler parameters and contracting them with the triple intersection numbers inside each Kayler cone. And when we do that, we end up with this cone in yellow, K tilde. And the important point is that K tilde is contained in the infinity cone. Is contained in the infinity cone. And so, what this means is that every ray in k tilde has an infinite number of BPS states. And so, the tower weak gravity conjecture is satisfied in this example. All right, so that was just one example, but you can see now that there's kind of an algorithm to check the tower-weak gravity conjecture in any given collabio. So, what is this algorithm? First, we compute the Gopukum-Murvaffa invariance. Then, Invariance. Then we determine the extended Kaler cone by performing all possible flops. Next, we apply the dual coordinate map to the extended Kayler cone in order to obtain this cone K tilde. And finally, we ask, is every site in K tilde populated by a non-vanishing Gopakum or Waffen invariant? And if yes, then the tower weak gravity conjecture is satisfied. And we perform these steps in over a thousand collabiats. Steps in over a thousand collabyows in the Kreuser-Skarka database, so constructed as hypersurfaces in torque varieties, and we found that the tower-weak gravity conjecture was always satisfied. All right, so that's kind of the punchline of this talk. And now I'll give my conclusions, and I have two slides left, so I have the conclusions, and then I'll discuss some food for thought, a few sort of mysteries or curious findings. Mysteries or curious findings that we found that will hopefully foster some discussion. So, to conclude, what did we do? We used the genus zero Gopu-Kumarvafa invariance in order to reconstruct the Kayler moduli space of Calabia threefolds. And with the full Kehler moduli space in hand, so the extended Kayler cone and the collection of BPS states, we verified the tower weak gravity conjecture in a large ensemble of examples. Large ensemble of examples. All right, so as promised, some food for thought, so some curious things. First of all, all of the examples that we checked appeared to satisfy the weak gravity conjecture with genus zero Gobukumoravoffin variants. And a question is why? You know, it could have been that we checked all these examples and we found that sometimes the genus zero GV invariants weren't enough and that you needed to calculate higher genus Gopukum or. Calculate higher genus Gopu-Morfoffen invariants in order to see that the weak gravity conjecture was satisfied. Another thing that I completely swept under the rug this entire time is that all of the examples that we checked actually satisfied the stronger lattice weak gravity conjecture. So instead of just having an infinite tower everywhere you were supposed to, we actually found that every site was populated. Another thing is, what about the infinite towers outside of K tilde? So, you know, in order for the tower-weak gravity conjecture to be satisfied, we needed to see that every ray inside of K tilde hosted an infinite tower of BPS states. But in general, we found that K tilde was strictly contained in the infinity cone, so that their rays inside of K tilde, all the rays inside. K tilde, all the rays inside K tilde have an infinite tower of states, but also there are rays outside of K tilde that have an infinite tower of states. And a question is: why? You know, do they do anything important? For example, are there other kinds of black holes that need these infinite towers of states outside of K tilde in order to be able to decay? Something like that. I don't know. And finally, and this is just sort of a little advertisement: is that I didn't have. Is that I didn't have time to tell you that now that we have this machinery to reconstruct the Kaler moduli space using Gopakumaravafin variants, there's a lot of really interesting features of the moduli space that we can uncover. And there's going to be an example of this kind of sort of more exotic behavior that's going to appear in work coming out hopefully this month with Mankey Kim, Liam, Jakob, and Mike Stillman. All right. All right, so with that, I will say thank you. Thank you so much for the great talk. Fantastic. Before I give the mic to other people who ask questions, I have an immediate question myself, namely, this has maybe the smell of modular properties. Often these kinds of things are satisfied. Satisfied by transformation properties of modular forms. So, in cases where a submodular space, say, has a modular symmetry, like for elliptic Lavier also, these kind of things, can you maybe make use of properties of your Jacobi forms or these kind of things? So I'm not sure this will precisely answer your question, but I will say that this work I was teasing at the end there is precisely about using the reconstruction. Precisely about using the reconstruction of the moduli space in this way to uncover some modular properties of superpotentials in that case. So, yeah, we're definitely finding that it works the other way around too, but that would be interesting to think about more. Okay, so sorry for sneaking in one question. So next one is Kum Run. Thank you. Thanks, Naomi. Very nice talk. So I just want to make sure I understand. You phrased your discussion in the context of weak gravity conjecture, but The context of weak gravity conjecture, but couldn't you have said all of what you said without using weak gravity? Namely, couldn't you have said this in the context of just checking the Bittenstein-Hawking formula for the BPS black holes? Namely, the directions that you found, which were zero, if it weren't zero, they would be disagreeing with the BPS predictions of the supergravity. So what you call the infinity cone was what the supergravity predicts to be the massive black holes. And indeed, the full tower should be occupied. And indeed, the full tower should be occupied at least when you get to sufficiently large charge. Again, that's almost from the Beckenstein-Hawking formula. So, almost everything you said seems to be phrasable in the language of just the usual Bittenstein-Hawking thing without using discussion about the weak gravity. Am I missing something? So let me see if I understand what you're saying. So it is the case that in the directions that only have a finite number of states, BPS black holes don't exist in those directions. Poles don't exist in those directions. And that's the point. Yeah, exactly. I'm just saying if and only if. In other words, the directions which do exist is predicted by Wittgenstein-Hockey, and the ones they don't shouldn't have existed. So you could have said it that way too. In other words, you could have said this is just a check on the Wittgenstein-Hockey formula for the BPS black holes. Well, do you need an infinite tower of states? Yeah, yeah. Wittgenstein-Hawkey predicts an infinite tower. Okay. Of course, right? There's no, if you, the only difficulty with. If you, the only difficulty with the biggest and hockey would be that you are not sure whether the first few charge states are occupied or not, because you could be talking about small enough black holes which are close to being clunking. But if you go sufficiently large, that's not a problem. So you do have a prediction that not only should be full, it should be full blattness. Which is what you observe, and that's a prediction. Yeah, no, that's a good point. Yeah, and there's one minor point. Of course, you could find examples where this genus zero would not suffice. And in fact, maybe none of the genus would suffice. If you go, for example, Maybe none of the genus would suffice. If you go, for example, to T6, so all of them would vanish. That's not an exciting example in that form, but there are BPS states, but these none of them will capture it because they all vanish in that language. Totally. And yeah. And in fact, I glossed over one related subtlety when I was talking about the divisors shrinking is that there can be cases where you think that there's a curve that can be flopped, but in fact, there are BPS. Flopped, but in fact, there are BPS states all along that array. It's just that the hyper multiplets and vector multiplets cancel out. Right, exactly. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Yeah, thank you for the talk, Naomi. Just very quick to make sure I understand or I remember all these cones. So the tower of states, the infinite towers that are not in the k tilde, if Tilde. If you follow them through the modern space, you follow their mass. Are towers that become massless at infinite distance, or they seem to become massless at finite distance, but are not weakly coupled? No, no, they don't become massless at finite distance. So at finite distance, for example, when you cross one of these walls, the only states that become massless are the ones associated to these curves along rays with only a finite number of states. So the conifold. Yeah. Okay. Conifold, yeah. Okay, thanks. Are there any further questions or comments? Well, just after you stopped, there were several raised hands, more than two at least. Okay. So let's conclude this session for today. Thank you for all the speakers.
