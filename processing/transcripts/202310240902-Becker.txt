Many people here who've worked on uh Twisted Bi Definitely know somehow the camera limit, but uh I feel like uh the only thing I've done so far in in Twisted BiDARP was to work maybe on the chiral limit. And so I think that now we have, I don't know, a certain amount of maybe understanding and especially things that we feel like we don't understand. So I think maybe it's a good point to somehow try to explain from a sort of mathematical perspective. And I really want to emphasize maybe the mathematics. And I really want to emphasize maybe the mathematical aspect here, because I think this model has some very peculiar mathematical properties that are worth pointing out. What is it that we feel like we understand, and what is it that we don't understand, or where I think interesting contributions are possible. And so this is sort of a selection of questions that maybe are somewhat coherent or hopefully are somewhat coherent in the sense that they In the sense that they are somewhat connected to the basic properties of that model. And certainly, you can ask many more questions, but this is sort of what I'm aiming at here in my talk. Okay, so I think there's going to be a survey paper by Mazzak Swolsky on the Carmel Limit soon, which tries to, I don't know, maybe summarize and I guess also be a bit more extensive than what I'm going to present today. Present today, but this is the idea that there's going to be maybe some articles from online that summarizes maybe many of these questions that we have. And so, this is going to be based on the joint work with Mark Embry, Justin O'Brier, and Switzerland, Mong Chong Young, and Machwalski on the cow limit. Okay, so just to fix notation, so for me, this is a McDonald's Hamiltonian, it's the Dirac operator, and then there's the tunneling potential. Operator, and then there's the tunneling potential. We have this V tunneling potential and the U tunneling potential, and with the bilayer graphene, and then the twisting angle is here, and so the full Hamiltonian in the continuum model is this here, this 4x4 matrix. You've probably seen that already. And so the camera limit is, there are many derivations now. I think there's also another one sort of forthcoming by David Conseil. David Conce and his collaborators. And so another way of justifying it through the density of states, if I understood correctly. And then the current limit is obtained by setting the diagonal entries to zero and doing this change of variables. So theta times z just becomes z, and then you have this new matrix here where the alphas are theta dependent. And so this current limit, I mean now. And so, this chiral limit, I mean, now there's maybe a change of notation to maybe what you usually see in the physics literature. So, please sort of accept my notation at least for this talk. So, the chiral limit is this off-diagonal operator where you have the two-z-bar operator on the diagonal. It's the alpha operator here. And the tunneling potential u of z and u of minus z of u of diagonal. I think the biggest difference is that here we use complex coordinates, which is sometimes useful compared. Sometimes it's useful compared to, I don't know, x1 and x2 in the physics literature. It's useful because the properties of holomorphic functions are quite essential to all the things that are related to the flat bands in the colour model. And so the stunning potential, the simplest tuning potential that satisfies all the relevant symmetries of the honey camera, the translational symmetry and the rotational symmetry, is given in this form. So it involves the third group of unity, and then it's for you. And then it's this simplest fourier expansion. Looks maybe also a bit unfamiliar, but it's somehow the simplest potential that satisfies the translational symmetry and rotational symmetry. So that's that. And well, one relevant property of the Carl model is that if you conjugate it by the third Pauli matrix, then you get a Hamiltonian with an opposite sign, right? So the spectrum is symmetric with spectra zero. Okay, so that's nice. Okay, so that's nice, and that's, I think, quite simple to understand. So, what is it that we want to look for? When it's looking for flat bands at energy zero, and if you look at this Hamiltonian here, then you're just asking for the kernel of this operator, the alpha, to be the entire convex plane. So, if you look at this Hamiltonian here, if you do the Bloch transform, then asking for a flatbed at energy zero is the same. For a flat bed at any zero is the same as asking that every k, so every crossing momentum is an eigenvalue of this operator alpha. So this holds for every k, that means the spectrum of the alpha is the entire complex plane. So you have some kind of operator here. The spectrum at these magic angles is the entire complex plane. That's the basic premise that one is working on. And then so what are these magic angles then? So one can plot them. Magic angles, then, so one can plot them. And this is the parameter set. Some of them are real, but, and these are the ones that I think were discovered in the first paper by Vishbonat and collaborators. But then there seem to be also some magic angles in the complex plane. Meaning that there are parameters alpha that are complex valued that exhibit this property. So the Hamiltonian is a flat band. Flat band, rather complex, this is still a Savage or Hamiltonian, and you have that flat band energy zero, meaning that the spectrum of the alpha for this complex alpha is being hypothesis to play. So this picture, this came from our first paper on this. And so the existence of his first magic angle, this was proven by Mitch. This was proven by Mitch and Alex. And the sort of simplicity. So, how many flat bands do you have? And are there infinitely many magic angles? This was proven in a follow-up paper afterwards, where we showed that there are exactly two flat bands here for this first magic angle, and the number of magic angles is infinite. Okay? So now we can see that this is slightly cut off. So I think one interesting So, I think one interesting mathematical question: so, this is my problem zero, probably this sort of happened to all my problems here, is just to find more such operators. Okay, so we have an operator here, this operator alpha. Let me briefly show again, and many of you might have seen this movie already. So, here's the parameter alpha moving. The spectrum of alpha is a discrete set apart from these magic angles where the spectrum comes to the entire complex plane. These are the magic angles. And now, I think an interesting graphical property in our An interesting metagraphical property in order to have some kind of toy model, maybe, for such an operator, would be just to design simpler operators or other operators that exhibit such a property. So at the moment, I think there's a huge lack of such operators in the mathematical literature, and it would be nice to have some kind of examples that would exhibit such a property. So I think essentially I'm only aware of one other operator like that, and this one's more dimensional, it looks a bit different. And this one's one-dimensional and it looks a bit different. And I think it would be nice to have more such operators. So, my other open problem is unfortunately now cut off, is that this is, I think, a question where we got started, is to understand the asymptotic scale of these metric variants, right? So here, as alpha goes to infinity, it was observed that this difference between these alphas is essentially 1.5. Not quite, but close enough. And I think any sort of heuristic argument, heuristic Heuristic, but still somehow maybe correct, or any sort of intuition that tells us why this happened, I think that would be very interesting. Yes? So I have to press something like, what is it? Command. F. F. Okay. Wait, okay, wait. So that has a positive effect somehow. Ah, okay. Ah, nice. Thank you. So you solve one of my problems, I think, from the minus one. Okay. Try again. So this is, I think, what I want. Okay. Right. So there's another thing about the semantic angle. So if I plot the, these are the angles. So, if I plot the, these are the magic angles now below zero, just the complex ones, okay? And this picture, it looks like it has a lot of symmetries, but it's interesting because it looks very similar to something else, namely the resonances of the Laplacian on the unit disk in the complex plane. So if you look at such a resonance plot here, it looks very similar to the distribution of magic angles. So this is a striking, I think, similarity between these two figures, and it's compared. These two figures, and it's completely unclear if there's any connection between these two things. So, that's maybe another property just when you look at the distribution of these magic angles. Is there some connection? And well, since there are these complex magic angles, it is kind of easy to prove a sort of upper bound on the number of magic angles. So, you fix now a disk of radius r, and you want to count how many magic alphas are in that disk. Then there is Then there is the Jensen formula in complex analysis, which essentially allows you to prove such a bound using a characterization of magic angles in terms of a certain operator that find in a bit. So once you know that sort of something is given by the eigenvalues of a certain compact operator, it's a sort of standard procedure in mathematics to get upper bounds on the number of eigenvalues you can have in such a volume. Such a volume. But it's much more difficult to find lower bounds. So one question is, and it seems to be true numerically, that the number of magic angles, let's say, for this kind of model, in a human ball, is also lower bound at 5 squared, right? So it really scales like the volume of the set that you're looking at. So I think this is also an interesting question where it's much less clear how to get such a bound. Much less clear how to get such a bound. So this seems to be the right behavior, but the upper bound that follows sort of from complex analysis, but the lower bound is far less clear. So I think why problem one is so difficult is because it turns out that this equidistance spacing for these magic angles that we see, it is very much dependent on taking the simplest potential. Unless you take the very simplest potential, the magic angles will in general not be accurately spaced. Be accurately spaced. And so here you see these red dots. These are magic angles where the degeneracy of the band is two. And here the blue ones, that's where the degeneracy of the flat band is four. Okay, so we're still talking about twisted by theme, but the degeneracy of the magic angles changes. And then, so as you change this parameter theta here that interpolates between the simplest and the second simplest potential, what you actually see between blue and red. What are you asking? You have blue and red dots. That's right. So the red dots mean that this is a magic angle where you have two bands that are flat. The blue dots means that if you plug in this parameter alpha and you have to, the degeneracy of the flat band is four. And so I think that there seems to be some kind of bias towards everything. It should be somehow two-fold degenerate, I think, in the physics literature. But I think there are two points that I want to illustrate. One is I think there are two points that I want to illustrate. One is that this is not so clear if you look at this family of potentials, and it's also not so clear that you have this equidistant spacing. So maybe these are the two things you want to look for in this movie when you see these magic angles moving as theta varies. But both of these properties are somewhat viable, right? Just aquidistan spacing and the fact they're only red dots on the real axis. So just the basic symmetries of the potential seems to enforce neither of these properties. Seem to enforce neither of these properties. So that's, I think, why this problem one is maybe also kind of challenging. So the question is, is there any asymptotic, so that's something that's not clear to me, for these real magic angles if you just have a general potential that satisfies the symmetries. So empirically, if you take one of those potentials that within this like viewpoint doesn't look like it's equally spaced, does it become equally spaced at larger alpha? So, I mean, it's not so obvious to me, at least for the range that I plotted. I was at some point thinking that maybe there are several periods. Like, for example, you have the simplest Fourier potential and you have higher Fourier corrections, right? So maybe you have like two periods somehow. But I was also not really able to verify that sort of. But it's not consistent with like a one-fourier type thing. No, I think that's not. But okay, obviously, you know, you cannot tell, right? Because it could be this is just a very large output. Because it could be, this is just a very large alpha effect. Yeah, but if you go to like 12. No, then I think it's not that feasible. Because you see, for this first potential, it's really like it starts right away, right? Yes. So of course this question about maybe large alpha, small twisting angles is a bit of a mathematical question, but I think it's still kind of appealing. So another question is maybe a bit more down to earth: is the question of these diracons. So, and maybe there is actually already an answer in the physics literature, it's just that we don't know. So, one question is: is it true that in this McDonald Kenneth, you actually have, for all, I need a mathematical argument maybe for that, that you always have perfect D-RAM calls, no matter what your potential configuration is. So, I think it's kind of clear in this Karl model, but then as you turn on the anti-Carl potential, that was similar. Term on the anti-colour potential that was maybe not entirely clear. And I think, for example, you showed me some point in argument that I was actually looking forward to discussing about that. But I think I wanted to put it down maybe to see, because I think that there are a lot of arguments that show that there are protected states at energy zero, but it's not so clear that for me, at least that the Biscuits have a dronometer exhibits these Dirac cones for all parameters. They are protected states, yes, but they are Dirac cones. I'm not sure. The same happens actually. I'm not sure. The same happens actually for a larger number of points where there are two bands at zero energy or I think I mean yeah, I mean somehow exactly that I mean that you have a band and you have a linear dispersion relation. Okay. If it's quadratic that's then I would be I think maybe not so satisfied. I don't know. Of course you can have something flat then or that the derivative should be zero but yes. Um yes, that's right. So I I so it seems to me, right, that unless this thing is somehow unless this thing is uh okay, so what I suspect, sorry, maybe I have to be more precise about this, is that so unless you have you write a special parameter set, some magic angle, okay, for the colour limit, you write a flat band, but otherwise, I would hope that there is a direct point. That there is a direct point. So that would be fine. Yes, there's, of course, an exceptional set to that, but otherwise, I think that there's a linear dispersion relation. I'm not quite sure if there's actually a really much, and I think this seems to be something that I feel like maybe one thing could answer at this workshop, showing the right tools to that. So it seems also to be true that, for example, the original argument, why, for example, the business electron terminology has these protected states, this argument, it doesn't necessarily seem to carry over so easily. Necessarily seem to carry over so easily to a larger number of layers, but still true, right? So if I plot a seven layer and I look at the band structure, so this is a bit of a rough plot yesterday, but we still seem to have protected some kind of D-rank coloncy, even in that model. Okay, and at least this kind of symmetry argument, even for these protected states, seems to fail for these n-layer things. So maybe that's something where I feel like, I don't know, just discussing with. I don't know, just discussing with physicists might already give the answer why this is so, but here in Photon we have seven protected states. We have two bands that exhibits two types of Dirac content, then there's an additional one by the third band. So it seems to be that for n-layer graphing you have to general n-protected Dirac content. So my seven layer here is how do you stack the seven layers? Oh, so here well, I mean my my feeling is that it doesn't matter something as long as you choose something commensurable. Wrong is you choose something commensurable. So I just mean the this is some kind of choice of commensurable twisting angles. So this relative, all the relative theta angles would be useful. That's right. And then I can talk about random structure and then it seems to be true. And seven layers, you can also three or more layers. You can also play with a shift of one layer with respect to the other. That's something you can measure where you can buy them, but not in a dryer. You mean this is similar to this helical model? Yeah. So I somehow intentionally exclude the itelical models because they don't quite fall into my mathematical framework here, but I think there the same question would somehow arise somehow. But I would guess that the same is true in these models. So something that we also find kind of curious is that you can ask the question. Of curious is that you can ask the question, okay, so you have this magic angle, right? And so there the band becomes flat, okay? But now, what happens if you take this band, you know, the band that becomes flat and you renormalize it by its largest point, right? So the k point where the first band is the largest. Okay, then you know, a computer will never exactly hit the magic angle, so you will never divide by zero here, right? You will never divide by zero here, right? Because you will never get exactly alpha to be what the magic angle is. But you're going to ask, okay, so what is this quantity? What does it look like? And so here we plotted that quantity for alpha between 0, 4 and 0, 6, and it seems to be a very rigid object. It seems to be always this kind of surface here. So this is this red figure here. For several snapshots of somehow alpha, we plotted the surface. And then you see that the surface, it looks like it's one surface. So this quantity. One surface. So this quantity here, it seems like it doesn't really move an alpha. And then what is the green surface here? So the green surface is the potential. So the tunneling potential just be scaled in a certain way. And then if you plot these two things on top of each other, they seem to be very similar. And this is something you should usually get out of maybe some kind of perturbation theory, maybe, around the magic angles. But the first question is: why is it so stable? And also, since you don't know the eigenfunctions. You don't know all the eigenfunctions exactly, it's not so obvious that this is actually true. So, one question that I think we found here is that why is it true that the energy surface close to magic angle is so closely related to the potential? This is current limit. So, maybe I can run this movie for certain values of alpha. So, here alpha changes and you see this lowest band, it's kind of steady, right? So, here it's it's renormalized, but all the other bands they change. All the other bands they change, apart from the lowest one, that one doesn't need to seem to change, okay? After this renormalization procedure. So why is it so steady and why is it related to this absolute value of u that is not clear to me? Is the function the same for the this you mean if this potential does or if it changes? Yeah, so I think it's I think uh yes, so as far as we looked, I mean we looked maybe two and three, it Looked, I mean, we looked maybe two and three, it seemed to be essentially always that function. Okay. Existence of flat bands. So. Sorry, some. Did you check if you did this cosine key that like you add the second harmonic? Actually, I think that it's a bit more off, to be honest. So I think that this seems to work very well when you take the U and it really seems to be almost the same surface. But when you take higher, so I tried actually. When you take higher, so I tried actually with some sort of interpolation of the next two, and then it looked slightly more off. I mean, it still resembled that because, well, I guess the principle of symmetry is only enforced if you have a certain structure here, but here I think it's somehow very striking that this energy band close to the magic angle. So is off you mean the changes in the range around the magic angle or it's more. No, it's off in terms of different distance to potential. Yes. So it's still somehow very Somehow, very rigid, but it's not. I think it resembles the potentials like S. Existence of flatbands. So what we, okay, when we first thought about this, we didn't quite know, okay, so about this curve limit, for example, what is it that prevents you from having, let's say, flat bands at certain energies, and when can you have them? So, when you look at what we call the anti-carl limit, that is, if you set these two potentials to zero and you just have this V potential here, then it's kind of easy to show, and this is a general argument for how people in the 70s found out that general Schrodinger operators, so you just have minus L plus n plus V, these are operators that don't have flat bands. And that essentially relies on some kind of self-adjointness of the differential operator. So, because when you look at this anti- Okay? So, because when you look at this anti-carl limit, that is, if you said this together to zero, you can write this entire operator as essentially a Dirac operator with a non-self-adjoint potential, but as a 2x2 matrix. This Dirac operator is a self-adjoint operator, so that's why you don't get flat bands. Similar for these TMD models, it's a 2x2 matrix, what is the differential operators, the Schrodinger operator here, so it's minus just a minus la flashing here. These are models that will not where you don't see flat back. Models that will not, where you don't see flatbands. So that's kind of something you can argue quite easily. What is much more difficult to argue, in my opinion, is what's going on for the general business of McDonald's tunnel tonight, right? So is there sort of any approach that allows you to show that this one, certainly you have to exclude the character test to somehow depend on having this tunneling potential V there because in the current group we know we have these flat bands, but is there any argument that shows that this kind of Hamiltonian? This kind of Hamiltonian does not have flat bands. I think that's commonly accepted, but it's also not a clear argument. I think this, the only argument that one has, I think, to exclude these kind of flat bands is using this argument that one has for these spring operators in the mathematical literature. So I think there is certainly something missing to understand these Hamiltonians. Okay, so the next thing I so these were only six problems, so there are still some more to come. Still, some more to come. So, um, I want to talk about the um the connection between the car limit and the Fulbright-Stutz-McDonald Hamiltonian. Okay, so here we have, so let's just think this B is equal to zero here, and we will come later to the case of what this B does. So, the question is: if we have this current limit, then we do some kind of perturbation theory using the Theory using the potential that we have excluded before, namely this potential here, the V potential. So, what is the first response that somehow the flatband does to switching on that potential, that we have excluded in this curve limit? Okay, so the question is. I have a question about the previous slide. Yes. Can you go back? So the argument here. So the argument here would not work if there's some derivative operators in all diagrams, right? So it works precisely if you can recast your differential operator, so for you may be looking at the zeros energy level, this anti-car model and write it essentially as a 2vz bar, 2vz, and then you have something like VV bar. I think. You can write it there. So you call this, let's say. So, to put this, let's say, until the alpha, then the Hamiltonian is 0, the alpha star, alpha, 0. Okay? And now you see the differential operator here is self-joint. And that's what, for example, allows you then to say, okay, actually, you cannot have flat bands and it's anti-carload. That's somehow the. So, because I could imagine just taking the car-Hamiltonian square. Yes. Square. Yes. That's right. So you have in the off-diagonal, you get some funny cross terms with a potential and a differential operator. And it's true that then you get a several joint operator, but it does no longer fall into this class of... So if you have some honest differential operator here that is somehow several joint without any sort of potential there, then you can run this argument similar to here the Laplacian. The Laplacian. Because otherwise, if it was true, then you could also use it for the chiral model, right? You could just square it. So there's certainly somehow something missing about understanding when you have these flat bands for these matrix value operators. Okay, so the question is: we have the common limit, we have the magic angle. What is the first response of the, I don't know, the band to the potential? And the answer is. And the answer is, okay, actually, both bands, so look here, there's a plus minus one, so that means you have these two flat bands. If you switch on this potential here, the potential we've forgotten before, then they move in the same way, and then there's only a splitting term, right? One that is F plus minus, right? So that discriminates these two bands and then splits them apart. What this means in practice is that, okay, so in a certain, in a very small regime, the response of these two bands is some. The response of these two bands is somehow linear, they both move in the same direction. And then the quadratic term, or the base model values of alpha 1, takes over. And it's essentially, that's the only decisive term to go from the chiral limit to the full visits of McDonald's formula. You see a linear part here, that's this term. And then you see something protetic, and that brings you then to order one. Uh uh order one uh potential V. And this is the only thing that somehow plays uh plays into these uh, you know, how do the bands respond to this kind of potential here. Okay, so what does that mean? That means that if I switch on the flat bands, I switch on that potential, first they move in the same way, okay. Obviously there are certain protected states like the zero uh states that have to be at energy zero. States that have to be at energy zero, so small that you don't see the Dirac cones now between these two bands. And then only, so this is for alpha to be 10 to the minus 3, and then it's only then that the splitting takes over. Then you see these two bands, they move differently in energy. And so maybe a simpler version of this Dirac cone question would be that you show that you have. That you have here this kind of linear dispersion relation. So I can also quickly animate how these two bands split, right? They are first flat, and then both of them move somehow in the same direction. And I understand that this is not a sort of a very physical regime because it's 10 to the minus 3. But still, it shows that somehow these are the two terms that are relevant to your perturbation theory, and actually, this one is only relevant in a very small regime, so it's this term that decides. That decides on the band structure. Okay, now you see the data. Yeah, another question is to just understand, so when you do this perturbation theory, what is of course the problem why I cannot say much more about this is because we know very little about the flatband wave function, right? We know how it depends on k, but we don't know any properties. And there maybe this asymptotic alpha regime could be interesting, right? So when you look at alpha large, So when you look at alpha large, you might expect certain structural properties of your wave function where it concentrates and where it's egliterable. And this is now, but also here I want to reference some work in progress by Matik Swasky and Michael Hitrick on the question where is the wave function actually small, right? So it turns out that the flatband wave function, so at a magic angle, it's It's exponentially close to zero at zero, and it's exponentially close to zero at the hexagon. But I think there's some very little, yes, not quite a good understanding about where these wave functions concentrate, even though if you plot them, you see that there are some kind of structural properties that seem to be interesting and somehow relevant to pointing out. So it seems like as alpha goes to infinity, the flap and wave function, they really seem to concentrate. The flat and wave function, they really seem to concentrate in certain areas and not in others. I think that somehow a complete understanding of that, where they concentrate, seems to be still a bit missing. Okay, so I think that this was somehow the asymptotic of traces, and I'll explain what this is in a second. This was somehow the only contribution of us in a way that I think showed that there is some kind of integral structure behind this. You know, that there's really some, that it's not a coincidence that these magic angles maybe look the way they do. But I think this was the only. Group. But I think this was the only property that allowed us mathematically to understand, aha, okay, maybe there's more that can be uncovered here. And what is it? So it turns out that you have a flat band at this magic angle alpha. Okay, this was what we said before. I have no idea of the spectrum of the alpha as the entire cone explained. But then there's a characterization of these magic angles in turn of this operator TK. What is this operator TK? That somehow, okay, you have your tunneling potential. Okay, you have your tunneling potential, you invert a differential operator. Compact operator, and then if one of the alpha is on the spectrum of this compact operator, then alpha is imagined. That's how we use these figures. Okay, so where does now the integral structure come from? Well, the integral structure comes from these traces. So what we showed is that you have interesting relationships for the sum of all magic angles. So if this is a compact operator, it turns out. This is a compact operator. It turns out that if you raise it to a sufficiently high power, you can even take the trace. So that's something that will converge. And then these traces are of a special type. They're always a rational number times pi by the pi squared root of 3. They are always like that. So you take dk to some power 2n and it will be of that form. And this is how we first showed that there's no magic angle. But then we generalized this result and showed that, okay, for a general p, this holds true, so your pipeline. This holds true, so you have pi divided by the square root of 3 times a rational of magic angles. And as a consequence, we are able to deduce that they are infinitely magic angles. That has to do with the fact that if you are finitely many, you could construct a polynomial that has essentially pi with rational coefficients that has pi z true, then that's not possible. So this is how we deduce that there are infinitely magnematic angles. But somehow this is a very structural result in the sense that it says that this is in here, right? It doesn't really tell you what the scaling. Tell you what the scaling of these objects looks like. So, this way we could also study the first magic angle because we could look at the determinant of this operator dk. This characterizes these magic angles. We want to understand what is this determinant equal to zero. And using the Taylor expansion of this determinant, you see that this is given to the traces. And then you can see, or you can study the first vertic angle. But unfortunately, we are only able to. But unfortunately, we are only able to, so here are some values of these traces, we are only able to study, say, a finite number of them, but not all of them. And if you want to understand maybe the asymptotic scaling or the asymptotic distribution of these magic angles, this is what you would be interested in. So somehow, what we can do is we know these traces, they always look like that. So the sum of magic angles raised to some power. We can only study a finite number of them. This will never tell us, you know, will they look at infinity or something like that. This would mean you have some sort of asymptotic. This would mean you have some sort of asymptotic understanding of what these traces look like. That seems to be not sort of accessible from the techniques that we have. So, for example, one thing I would propose is that one can somehow show that there exists, let's say, one magic angle, okay, so the first one, and then you take it by half because you know that's the symmetry of the magic angles, the positive and negative, and then you take the traces to the power minus two p. Minus 2p, and then okay, this limit is supposed to converge to 1 just because, yeah, I mean, this is the dominant magic angle, right? So it would kill all other terms. So if you take p to infinity, this is supposed to converge to more. So somehow, any asymptotic result on these traces, I think, will be very interesting. And so another thing is also that it seems like for essentially any real analytic. Essentially, any real analytic potential, you have that there are infinitely many magic angles. And our result so far works only for sort of a finite Fourier expansion, but I would expect that this is somehow still true. So there's a kind of limiting to or limiting argument to understand. So I'm presenting this now for the simplest potential, but it works also if you have any sort of finite query expansion of your potentials. And it also seems that no matter what potential you take, there's one property that's always there, which is that the largest Largest magic angle, right? We have complex ones in principle, but the largest one seems to be real. There's also a feature that is not somehow obvious to me why that's the case, but it seems to be common for all these kind of potentials. So, since there seems to be some kind of emphasis always on this real magic angle, I think it would be interesting to understand why. Why, I mean, okay, some effort went into sort of understanding this one for the simplest potential, but somehow maybe you would, even for the current model, like to have some sort of more general result. Maybe there's the first magic angle, and this one is supposed to be real, and that would be somehow a very natural result. Okay, are you getting close to the end? Yeah, maybe I talked briefly about smallplicities and then I'll come to it. It's supposed to be two more minutes. Minutes. I should have warned you earlier. No, that's fine, that's fine. So I'll maybe mention that because I think that there's also one of these questions. I think some interesting questions. So we have this. Okay, let me give you an upshot of what's going on. So you have these traces. So if you square, for example, the operator Tk that has these magic angles and eigenvalues, you get a diagonal operator, because Tk has this off-diagonal form. Okay. Okay, and then you can look at the subspaces that are first defined by a translational symmetry, so not to explain this now, and the rotational symmetry. And if all magic angles were simple, it would turn out that they would all have to lie in sort of one subspace. But it turns out they don't. You can easily show that these traces, they have to be zero in all rotational subspaces. And as a consequence, it turns out that there are always, essentially, so for a generic set of real and So, for a generic set of real analytic potentials, all metric angles are either simple or two-fold generic, meaning that you either have two flat bands or four flat bands. So, not that you take a generic potential and then look at the magic angles, and all of these magic angles will either be two or four-fold degenerate. And I think maybe a question that I would already have is that is there some sort of physical because it's a very important thing. Because it seems like people, I don't know, people like to say, okay, this car model, for example, you have these two flat bands for TBG. But my question would be, is there some kind of, how should I say? Is there some kind of traces that maybe these higher bands also appear? Because they seem to be, for example, for equal twisting angle tri-layer, there seem to be only bands that are four-fold or higher bands. That are four-fold or higher degenerate in these helical models. The same is true. So, what is it with the number of bands in these kind of models? Maybe that's a more general open question that I have. How does that play into the physics somehow? Because I think that these bands of high multiplicity I'm not really investigated so far because every argument somehow also regarding churn numbers always on these two or maybe four flat bands, but not on higher flat bands that you seem to see. That you seem to see. So I think this multiplicity business is also an interesting direction. Maybe I should stop here. Thank you very much. So we have some time for questions. Go ahead. You can get hexagonal moirel lattice explained with ethereostrains as well. For instance, a biaxial hetero strain creates another hexagonal moirel lattice with ABBA. A B D A regions on shared strain. You can combine everything with angles and you keep the salon asynchronous. But none of them sit and you can write down the AP model, the continuum model. But none of them seem to have magic angles. I wonder if it's a generalization. You can show it using the techniques you have at this time. Okay. Um so I must admit that I don't know what the model looks like in terms of what you're saying. Very much the same. Only do rotate the ice. I like only do rotate the actions. Okay. But you say that, for example, the current limit, it looks very similar to this cow. Okay, but it does not have flat reactions. Okay. And it's not known why that's all. The potential is still on a Belium. Sorry? Is the potential abelian or not? I think it's not. It's non-abelian, so. Okay. And yeah, so I think that would be interesting to look at what's the difference of how these models make it up. So at the very beginning, you know, kind of a little structural spectrum. I thought at some point either you or non-step joint operator joint operate or I do something to no, I think, yeah, so to be honest, I think there are only two examples of such operators that we call writers. One is this T alpha, and okay, you know, you have a tri-layer, and I have versions of Tri-layer and other versions of that operator. And there's this classical example by Seeley, somehow of a one-dimensional operator where you can solve everything by hand. But this operator somehow has a potential in front of the differential operator. So it doesn't seem to correspond to... It really seems to be structurally different, I think, from this one. So I think, yeah, it would be nice to have some kind of, I mean, I incentive this is for. I said that this is for physicists is already the toy model, but I think it would be nice to have a mathematical toy model for this in some sense to understand what's happening. I have a nice question on the significance of alpha. So the real part of alpha seems to be like a rotation. Now the imaginary part of alpha is what? Some scaling, some boost, some user, some interpretation that would correspond to what it is? There was a previous question. There was a brief discussion yesterday at dinner, so there's some physics group, I think, that have identified that if you place TBG in a magnetic field in a certain way, so I don't remember quite this construction, but it has something to do with a homogeneous magnetic field that is pointing upwards in one part and pointing down another part. You can somehow do a change of variables, and then you get that these imaginary ones are the real axis. ones are the real axis. So there is, so from the physical perspective, yes, there is a way to somehow design it that these imaginary ones come to the real axis. Mathematically, I think they are somehow, it's just difficult to, and this is why I think one has to include them, it's just difficult to focus only on the real ones. There's no real way to separate them out. And you see that if you change your potential, these imaginary ones, they somehow move to the real axis. And so your trace formula also tells you something about this. Trace formula also tells you something about the red ones, or if you are only I think it's not that's the problem, right? It's not possible to just it includes only a complex one, right? So it's only from these algebraic constraints you don't get that there's an infinite number of real ones. I don't get anything about real ones. Yeah, that's correct. And that's yeah, that's a good point. So I think one should maybe add that as well that the approach so far only talks about all these things. Okay, so thanks again. The next talk will be given by Patrick Leidwith, and the topic is more textable flat bands, or for textable, more textable term bands.
