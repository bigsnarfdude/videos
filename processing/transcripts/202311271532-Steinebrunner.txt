With Rachel Bloyd and Corey Gregman, where we're trying to say some more things about basically our goal is to study the classifying space of the diffeomorphism group of three manifolds. And maybe some of the ways I'm going to talk about this particular this kind of modular infinity opera perspective is also based on joint work with separately With separately with Shaul Bakan. But no statement, no theorem I'm stating today is this strong part. It's more kind of philosophical. And so yeah, just some preliminaries. Whenever I say manifold, I do mean compact-oriented, connected. Oriented, connected. So M is going to be compact oriented. Connected. Is this visible? It doesn't matter whether it looks like white, as long as it's... And yeah, what is this V diff? I mean, assuming you all kind of know, but somehow this classifies smooth bundles, the finite. The phi n. So, in particularly, we might care about its cohomology as those are characteristic classes similarly to Alexander's thought. And then, also, if you want a very concrete model for this, something you can do is just take the space of embeddings of n into some infinite-dimensional vector space. It's going to be contractible, and it has a nice action by the diffeomorphism group, simply by pre-composing with diffeomorphism groups, and this action is nicely. If a morphism groups and the section is nice enough, such that the quotient gives you a model for this. So we could think about this, but somehow that specific model won't matter too much today. And yeah, so I'm doing this in dimension three. In dimension two, the analogous thing, let me just say B diff fixing the boundary of the surface of genus G with one boundary component. This is really well studied. I mean, there's still many things we don't know, but I mean, there's still many things we don't know, but somehow we have the stable homology via the Manford conjecture proof by Matzen-Weiss, and many other things. So, in this dimension, this is also the same thing as the classifying space of the Mapping clause group of that same surface. And something in particular I want to highlight here is that we know that this is finite dimensional. In fact, it's equivalent. Equivalent to a finite CW complex. And I mean, in particular, this means that the cohomology of this is going to be bounded in some certain degree, that I want to try to figure out now. And so this is true in dimension two. And then there's also a lot of other work in high dimensions. So if we're in a high even dimension, then there's always this work by Geralazis Madsen. This work by Galatius Matson. No, by Theodore Galatius, Galatius Randall Williams. And completing this in a stable range. And then, of course, there's also kind of the dimension in between, dimension four, but that's kind of hard to halt on me, so I'm not going to try and say anything there. But the dimension we are studying today is one of those dimensions that Oscar considers silly. So it's dimension three, which, I mean, it's just silly. Which, I mean, it's just silly because, in a way, we understand those manifolds quite well, but that also makes it an interesting question to see how far we can actually push this and how much we can say about B D of M. Because in dimension three, still a lot of things behave exactly how you would expect them to behave. So, for example, diffeomorphism group is equivalent to the homeomorphism group, and so on. So, things are a lot less subtle, but you have kind of a classification, in a sense, manifold. In a sense, manifolds, and so we can try to see what we can compute there. And concretely, the thing I want to talk about today, I was planning to prepare a lot of pictures and hide them from you on another blackboard, but somehow then I saw the room, so that so how am I going to do this? Let me erase here and then I can use that board in a second. Board in the second. So, the thing I want to talk about concretely today is a gender by Silvic. So, which I'm going to place on 97 just because that's when it appears in the currently problem list, but I don't exactly know from But I don't exactly know from when exactly this came up. But the conjecture was kind of based on this thing I just erased that, you know, for a surface, the classifying space is fairly finite. He conjectured that at least if the boundary of the manifold isn't empty, then the classifying space of the diffriomorphism group fixing the boundary pointwise should be homotopy equivalent to a finite CW. Equivalent to a finite CW complex. Right? So this is the group of those diffomorphisms that when you restrict them to the boundary of M, they give you the identity. Was he planning this in all dimensions? Sorry, I'm now in dimension three for the rest of the talk. Yes. No, no, no. We're definitely in dimension three for the rest of the talk. For the rest of the world. Thanks. And so my comment about the year, you will understand in a second, which is namely that in the same year, this was proven by in a case, a special case, by Hatcher and McCallow, who showed that this is true and is irreducible. Irreducible. And irreducible means that every so every S2 bounds a D3, every two sphere bounds a three ball in the manifold, and thanks to the conjecture, I'm allowed to equivalently say that pi2 of the manifold is zero. And if you know some three-manifold thing, the stuff. Three manifold thing stuff, then you will kind of already appreciate that this kind of covers the most interesting case because everything else built from that, as I'll talk about in a moment. Okay, so they resolved this case, but somehow the case of a general manifold that might be reducible remained open. And quite recently, Sam Nerriman proved the homological burden of this. So, oh, sorry, this was in the same gear. Saying here. Okay, first of all. So Narriman proved this is true homologically if every prime factor has no empty boundary. But the Kutchman theorem doesn't consider the case with boundary or without boundaries. It considers exactly this formulation. So, if there is a non-empty boundary, then they show something slightly more general. They show you only have to fix part of the boundary. I'll say that more precisely later. But they in particular show this. If there is non-empty boundary, then the B-diff fixing all the boundary is equivalent to a finite CW complex. Actually, in this irreducible case, it's an aspirical thing. So it's entirely about the Mackenzie in that case. Philosophy in that case, but in general, it's not. So, there was this additional assumption here that prime factors have non-empty boundary, but there's somewhat more of a technicality that isn't supposed to really be necessary. And by homologically, I just mean that he showed that this has the homology of a finitely W complex, meaning that it only has homology in finitely many degrees, and each of those is a finitely generated debug. And then I better not write a date here. I better not write a date here because I was trying to get numbers here, but who knows? So with all coefficients or constant coefficients? Constant coefficients. And what we're showing with Rachel and Cari is that this is true. So it's for every three manifold with non-empty boundary, B diff fixed in the boundaries, a homogeneous equivalent to a finite CW boundary. Okay, but now I can, this is somehow what we're trying to get, but let's recap a bit and just start with some examples of what three manifolds are. As I said, three is kind of quite a specific number, and so three manifolds aren't your generic n-manifolds, they're more specific. And is there also a conjecture about what the dimension is, depending on the there was no conjecture. There is no conjecture. Presumably, you can go through our proof and figure it out. At least if you only want a really bad bound, you could probably get that. But it would depend on which prime pieces appear and some more specifics about those. But it's in principle effective. What if it's irreducible? Do you know what the dimension is? No, this is part of the reason why I don't know what the dimension is here. But I I should just say I'm not sure about the dimension. Our result is effective in reducing to here, I would say. Okay, so just very basic things. How can I get a three manifold? Well, I can take the threes here and I can remove a knot or a link. So this is a knot or a link complement. I learned how to draw the trephole for this form. You reduce the trephole and you get a three manifold with boundary of torus, and that's nice. Free manifold, this one's irreducible. Something else I can do is I can take mapping tori. So here I took some surface, sigma, across an interval, and then I identified 0, x. 0, x with 1,5x for some diffeomorphism that then moves this side to that side, and that also gives me an irreducible 3-manifold. This one doesn't have probing, this one's closed. Here's another closed one. So in general, the operation I'm doing here is connected sum. What I drew looks a lot like a two-dimensional thing, but I want you to interpret this in the sense. But I want you to interpret this in the sense that there is a little two-sphere at every point here. So this part is supposed to be S1 cross S2. And then I can take that and form a connected sum for another copy of S1 crosses 2, and I can keep going and build manifolds like that. Of course, nothing stops me from also taking a connected sum of this with that. In general, if I want to take a connected sum, I pick a disk here, pick a disk here, and I do a surgery attach a little tube. Attach a little tube. Right, and that's yet another three-half. And maybe the thing to point out is that this notion of irreducible is kind of quite complementary to this notion of connected sum, because whenever I take M1 connected sum, M2, and they're both not the sphere, then this is not irreducible. The reason just being that The reason just being that here I attached a tube and there was a little two-sphere here and this two-sphere will not be a trivial, this will not bound a ball. Because if I bounded a ball, then either this will be a ball or this would be a ball. So if I didn't start off with spheres, the connected sum is not going to be very useful. But this conjecture uh I came from Pratt and McCullough, so do they assume that uh boundary uh uh is never kinda have sphere as a comp as a boundary component? Sphere as a boundary component. Yes, but I think that follows from irreducible. Right, so they assume that. Yeah, they don't have spheres in the boundary. And this is like one of the things we have to deal with. It's really confusing because Hasher also proves this smell conjecture, right? So the correlation of S3 is also a finite complex. Uh yeah, but this includes S S three. But this is still that. But that doesn't have boundary. This is only if there's boundary and you have to extend it. Doesn't that actually use the smell projector? Doesn't that use the smell conjecture? Surely. So yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, yes. The smell conjecture was recent. Um okay. Let me Okay, let me also give some examples of diffeomorphism groups. The nice thing about three manifolds is that oftentimes the diffeomorphism groups are what you expect them to be, which doesn't mean that it's easy to prove that, but it's often a hard theorem that the diffeomorphism group is what you would expect it to be. So for example, if I take S three, what we just talked about, then in there lives the group O four of just rigid rotations of S three. Just rigid rotations of S3. And this is an equivalent for the inclusion, and that's the smell conjecture, which, as far as I know, was proven by Hatcher in 83. Another example is if I, for example, take diff S1 cross S2, so that was this manifold that I drew here, then still you could have a guess for what the diffeomorphism group is, because there's O1 coming from the rotations of the circle. O1 coming from the rotations of the circle. And then at every point of the circle, I could try to rotate this sphere. So I could also take the semi-direct product with the mapping space from S1 to O2. That's the rotation group of the circle. And I take O3 as rotations of the two sphere. And kind of at every point in the circle, I choose a rotation of the two sphere. And this semi-directed product maps into there. This semi-directed product maps into there, and this is also an equivalence by Hatcher in a rewrite of his paper from 81. Presumably, he didn't prove this in 81 because it seems stronger than the previous case. But anyway, and then to give just, yes, there's many examples here, but just give one more kind of feeling for how this looks like. With this free manifold stuff, it's often quite interesting to look at manifolds that admit. To look at manifolds that admit a geometric structure. And so, for example, if I look at the hyperbolic manifold, then, well, in the diffeomorphism group, I always have the isometry group. And it turns out that this isometry group is actually equivalent to the entire Different Morsel group. That's why the theorem of Gobay. I thought that was Moscow-Virginity, isn't it, in that case? No, that's not the Islamic treatment. So, in this sense, in these irreducible cases, somehow the diff often ends up being somewhat computable. Okay. But the classifier space is not finite. It's the classifier spaces. No, no. Because I don't have any boundaries of the. Okay. Now, how are we going to sorry, Shaw? How are we going to sorry, Cheryl? How are we going to do this? Well, as people familiar with three manifolds will know, the trick, of course, is that every three manifold can be decomposed into irreducible pieces. And this is the prime decomposition theorem of Milner. And okay, so our strategy will be to use the Hatcher-McCallo result in the Be use the Hatcher-McCallo result in the irreducible case and reduce to the irreducible case using the unique prime decomposition of three manifolds. And I'm going to state the unique prime decomposition of three manifolds. It was proved by Milner in 1589. I'm going to state it in a somewhat unusual way that is suggestive for the strategy that I want to use, which is that the commutative mode Typically monoid. And what's this monoid? So I take the set of all three manifolds, M, still orientable, compact, connected, and so on, and I take those that don't have two spheres in their boundary, and I take them up to diffeomorphism. Then this set of isomorphism, diffeomorphism. Set of isomorphism, diffomorphism classes of three manifolds admits a multiplication given by a connected sum. When I do a connected sum, I have to choose where I do it, but since everything is oriented and connected, up to differ-morphsome, it doesn't matter where I do it. So on the set of diffeomorphism classes, this is a commutative operation and well-defined and associative and so on. And this is a commutative monoid. And then Miller's theorem says that this commutative monoid is freely generated. Freely generated by the following set, namely by the set of irreducible three manifolds that aren't the three sphere. And additionally, the following manifold that is not irreducible, but it is prime, and so I have to include it, which is S1 cos S2. Okay, but Okay, but what Milner actually said, of course, wasn't some silly computer model, it is free, but he instead said the thing that this is, of course, equivalent to, which is to say that every three-manifold can be uniquely written as a connected sum of irreducible manifolds, like this, with multiplicity. And then I also have to have some copies of S1 cross S2, which I want to treat separately. which I want to treat uh separately here. So where the Pi are irreducible. Right? And this decomposition is unique up to reordering, blah, blah, blah, and so on. Of course this uniqueness statement is exactly such that this is the free commutative monoid on the set. So, but why did I choose to state it like that? Well, if you're very infinitely homotopically minded, then whenever you see like Homotopically minded, then whenever you see like a sum set up to relation gives a commutative monoid, and that commutative monoid is free, you immediately want to say something like, well, all of the moduli spaces, B diff m disjoint junior y all m is a free E infinity algebra on the moduli spaces of the irreducible manifolds. But of course, let me quickly erase this. But of course, let me quickly erase this before I go. This doesn't make sense because. Have you accidentally not erased the E-infinity algebra? That's exactly the worst part, right? Because it's not coherently permutative, right? The connected sum is unique enough to get a unique isomorphism class, but if I want to do a connected sum, I really have to make some choice, and there's a non-trivial space of choices. And as such, we don't have an E-infinity algebra, and we most certainly can't explain. Infinity algebra, we most certainly can't expect this thing to be a free infinity algebra. But the perspective I want to take is that kind of if we understand the correct algebraic structure that this is, then we will be able to prove that it's free as such. And this is where modular infinity operates come in. And Rachel, when she saw the abstract of this talk, had to love it because this is really not how we do it in the paper. So in the So in the paper we do this entirely without infinity modular curves and we do it by somehow studying the separating complex of spheres and then doing a lot of the same things that I'm doing. But it's not that I'm like artificially inserting like infinities here because I I like that, but I do like that. But the the reason I'm doing it is because actually this is how at least for me, this is how we arrived at it. For me, this is how we arrived at it. Because I was thinking about these multi-by-infinity operators and also together with Shaul. And then, in the context of this three-manifold stuff, Rachel and Corey proved something that maybe I won't go into now about the space of knots and links being free. And I was looking at this and we were talking about it, and then it became clear that in this module operator, well, this just meant that it's freely generated. And then, for the purpose of the paper, now that we're writing it up, we kind of went back and Is kind of we kind of went back and you don't actually need the infinity operator, so we're proving it without it now. But knowing the infinity operat statement is useful for like further applications that I'll hopefully mention at the end. And so that's why I'll take this perspective now. So modular infinity operates. And for the purpose of this talk, we won't have to know the full definition of this, but somewhat just the idea. The full definition of this, but somewhat just the idea of what it's trying to encode. And so, let me only sketch the definition here. So, this is after work of Getzler Kapranov on the chain complex case. And then the homology coherent version of it was defined by Hackney Roberts and Yao, kind of based on this Sinski Mode dendroidal category, you can generalize and so on. The way I think about it is in terms of the setup that Joel and I have, but the precise details of that. The precise details of that one matter. So, what's it supposed to be? It's supposed to be, well, so a modular affinity operate, let's call it M, supposed to have a bunch of things. Firstly, I want for all K a space of K operations, M K, and this is supposed to have an action of the symmetric group. So far, so good. So famous for Famous for operas. But then I also want to be doing maps. So that's going to be a map from mk times ml to mk plus l minus 2. And finally, I want self-booing maps. So that's going to go from m of k plus 2 to m of sorry, from m of k, let's say, to m of k minus 2. And there's some pictorial description here that maybe should make these numbers make more sense. So here I think maybe of a K array operation as a thing that has k legs, and I can permute the legs, and that's the action, and then the gluing. Action and then the gluing takes something that has K legs and it takes something that has L legs and it contracts them so it lose two of the legs. And for the self-gluing I start out with something that has K legs and I choose two of the legs that I would like to glue and after self-gluing them I've lost those two legs. These composition maps are supposed to suitably be activariant for sigma k and there is plenty of And there is plenty of higher coherence, ensuring that this entire operation is somehow sufficiently suitable to pencil in exactly the way you would want it to be. Okay, so what does this have to do with three manifolds? Well, the key example that I'll also call n is the three, let's say, the three manifold. Module operator, an infinity operator. And so what is this? M of K is just the disjoint union over all different Morphson classes that appear of B diff of the moduli space fixing K disks that I somehow embedded into M. So So I have M with K fixed dists in there, and the symmetric group action is kind of permuting the labelings of these fixed dists. Now, the gluing map then, okay, let me not draw the knot. So if I have something here and something here, so this is so, and this is maybe a three-array operation, so I have three disks in. Operation, so I have three disks in there, and this is maybe just a binary operation, so m3, m1. Then there's a gluing operation that just performs the surgery here, and it outputs a manifold as it's not here, and it just looks like this. And it used up these two disks in gluing, but we still have the other two, so we end up in an. So we end up in M2. And similarly, for the self-gluing, now if I take, I want to draw this. Well, if I take such a thing with a knot in there, and then I have maybe four disks, and I choose two of them to perform a self-crewing. So this is M4. Then I perform a self-crewing, I land in M2, and what's the thing in M2? And what's the thing NM2 that I end up with? Well, I do the connected sum on this disk, with this disk. This just means attaching a one handle. So in the end, the manifold I end up with kind of looks like this. I've used up the two disks in doing that, and I have these two left. So there are many self-bluing left and many blue graphs, and they tell me which of the disks I take. Yes, yes. I could say there's only one which takes the last. There's only one which takes the last and the first, and then you get the rest through the symmetric group action. But of course, the more canonical thing is to say I have a self-doing map for every choice of a leg here and the choice of a leg there. And somehow then it's easier to say the inquiry. And more generally, so if you, I mean, if you're interested in this kind of thing of how to set stuff like this up homotopically, then you can imagine this kind of dendritel category of Zinziwinski. Of Zinsiyinski and Murdak, and you instead of taking rooted trees, you just take arbitrary graphs because now I can compose along loops and edges and all kinds of things. And so I can just set up something like dendroidal SQL spaces. But instead of dendroidal, I've got all blocks. And that's the doing this over all different workers in the class and figuring out all the ways. Yes, yes. All possible ways of doing. All possible ways of doing these questions. I record all of those as part of the. So this is absurdly not, right? This knows like everything. But the theorem is that it's... Of course. I mean, I wrote a cartoon of the definition, but there is a book by Hackney. Let me write the name. Uh Hankne uh Robertson Piao, who gives the coherent version of this. And what I the cartoon I gave, of course, is exactly what you would get if you did a non-infinity array. And there you will see that, for example, Getzler and Kapranov. I mean, for a first reading, Getzler and Kapranov, the original papers, is the place to go for this. But the point of view that we'll show we're writing up at the moment, so that isn't most. And so the main theorem says that Rachel and Corey says that actually this huge thing that has all three manifolds built into it and knows about all of the moduli spaces actually isn't that complicated. Complicated. So the modular energy operator is freely generated by its irreducible product. So There's other things that I would rather say than what it means that this is free. So let me just be extremely brief here. Basically, I can restrict even further. I could just look at the spherical part. So that's just the part where I require that n is the three sphere. And then this is not a modular opera any longer because I can connect at some three spheres and get another three sphere, but I can't self glue a three sphere and get another three sphere. A three-sphere and get another three-sphere. So, this is not a modular operat because this misses the self-dealing, but it is a cyclic operat. And as a cyclic operator, this is equivalent to the frame P3 operat. So, as cyclic infinity operators. Okay, so the sphere part just recovers this using the smell conjecture. These moduli spaces are just as hard to compute as configuration spaces on the sphere or configuration spaces of R. It's fairly appropriate. Of R. It's fairly approachable. And then if I now look at the irreducible part, by which maybe I mean not the sphere, but all the other bits, then this is going to look roughly like, so P irreducible, and then it's V diff fixing a bunch of disks of P. And this has no composition anymore whatsoever. I can't just take two irreducible. However, I can't just take two irreducible pieces and connected some of them. That wouldn't be irreducible anymore. But it is a module over a spherical part, because the connected sum of a spherical piece with an irreducible piece will still be that same irreducible piece. And so this is a right module in operators over the spherical part. And the spherical part is E3. So the right module by E3 framed. In that sense, it's a disk module in imaging three. Sorry, I have a question. Yeah. Sorry, I have a question. Yeah. I mean, here we have classifying spaces of diffeomorphism groups, and the frame D3 operat is like configuration space cross, like some ON, some like four groups. But if you compute B diff of three of K disks, I should have said this, K discs in some manifold M, for example this here. This is equivalent to To the frame configuration space of k points in M, modulo the action of the diffeomorphism group of M. So this homogeneous orbits with respect to the action of the diffeomorphism group. This follows from some Palefire sequence. And once you have this, in the case of the sphere, the configuration space of the three-sphere is pretty much the same as the configuration space of the Same as the configuration space of R3. So you get the frame configuration space of R3 here. And here you get a copy of SO4, which kind of cancels out exactly one of the points. And you end up exactly with something that's equivalent to K minus 1 frame points on the thing. So it really boils down to just the ordinary E3 opera. Okay, and the irreducible part is a right module overhead. And now basically, whenever you have a cyclic operator and you have a right module overhead, Have a cyclic operator and you have a right module of it, you can freely generate a modular opera on it by just formally adding all of the compositions you didn't have. And the claim is that that's what you get out. But now I want to state a corollary of this, which is, and it's not really a corollary because it's completely equivalent to the theorem, but it's maybe a bit more approachable because it doesn't rely on this definition of modular infinity operators. So maybe we need some. Before you go on, is it supposed to be obvious that when you freely generate a module out from a cyclic one in a module, that it preserves the finiteness you claimed in the beginning? Oh no, I'll talk about that. So in building this free thing, we can also just forget about molecular operators and just think a moment about wait, I drew an. Wait, I drew an example somewhere. Okay, how can we build reducible free manifolds from irreducible ones? And I want to claim that, like, the general recipe for doing that is I pick some irreducible manifolds that I would like to use, P1 and P2 and P3, and I label a graph by them. Not everything has to be labeled. If it's not labeled, it's implicitly labeled by the three-sphere. So I just label all my vertices of the graph by that. Then I Of the graph by that, then I go and I draw the prime manifolds, sorry, irreducible manifolds, by me. So this is irreducible, even though it's a link, not a NOT. Then I draw a three-sphere here, and I draw pretty well again. Let's see if I actually love it. No, I don't. That's so funny. And then maybe this prime piece has. I lied to you early when I said that on it. This prime piece maybe has some boundary, that's a genus 2 surface or something. And, okay, so this is not yet a connected 3 manifold. I've got to do something to make it connected. But, well, what I can do is I just pick a disk in here, two disks in here corresponding to the two half edges. So I pick my disk here, pick my disk there, I pick three disks in the I picked three disks in the three sphere because there's three half edges, and a disk here, and two disks here. Okay, and these correspond to each other according to the graph. And after I've made all of these choices, I can perform a connected sum and obtain a free manifold. And the free manifold then looks roughly like this. My not complement here, but it kind of Complement here, but it kind of goes on into this manifold. I'm trying to draw the connected sum a bit smoothed out. Something like this, and then here's the Drefo again. And so I get a manifold like this. And so if we now look at, so this was like graph, gamma, that's labeled, and we look at all the choices we make. And we look at all the choices we made, we could call the space of such choices somehow the configuration space corresponding to the graph. This is not the configuration space of the graph, it's a configuration space associated to the graph. And this configuration space is going to just be basically I pick at every I pick at every vertex of the graph I pick I see I pick a configuration of the half edges in the prime piece that labels the vertex the irreducible piece that labels the vertex and I pick a framed configuration as such it turns out it doesn't matter if I act on here with diffeomorphisms I kind of always did Diffeomorphisms, I kind of always did a three-manifold, so let me mod out diff of this. And finally, also, there's a thing here where I chose a framing here and a framing there. So both of these disks are identified with the standard disk, so I can perform the gluing. But of course, to do the gluing, I just need to identify them with each other, not both with the standard disk. So I have an extra SO3 floating around, or O3, that I don't really need. O3 that I don't really need. So I'm going to mod out a copy of, I don't remember right now, SO3, let's say, for every edge. So there's some configuration space here that you can build that is computable if you know the configuration space of your prime pieces and you know the different multi-groups of the prime pieces. And this is the space of all of these diagrams that I could draw here. And for each such thing, I get a manifold that looks like M. So I get a point in the moduli space associated. Point in the moduli space associated to F. But now I can change my graph and still get basically the same manifold. So for example, if I have another graph, lambda, that just looks like this. And so I have this map of graphs here, where all it does is just it collapses this edge. Note that for this, it's important that one of them is labeled by a sphere, because otherwise I leave my realm of irreducible manifold. And this is not what I get. I get. This is not what I get, I get this. I could have started with this graph, made all of these choices, and I would also get basically this manifold. And what this means is that, okay, this is a functor on some category of graphs, and really I get a map out of the colonate. And this is the corollary that I want to state. So corollary, I apologize for not having fully defined the terms that appear. The terms that appear. But there's a collimit over some combinatorial category that depends on m because I want to make sure I actually land a pdiff m and not pdif of some other manifold. So I just combinatorially ensure that I have the correct labels to the actual of this configuration space associated with the graph. And that has a map to PDFM. And the corollary is that this is an equivalence. This is an equivalence. And as I said, this isn't really a corollary, it's more kind of the main theorem itself. Because over here, my claim is this is exactly what you get out if you build the free modular operat on a right module and a cyclic operator. You just put all the graphs where you label some vertexes by the right module and some by the cyclic operator, and then you model by edge collapses that use the action of the cyclic operat on the right module. And that's just what you get. Note, and that's just what you get. So, this is equivalently the main term. And what it's supposed to be is kind of a way of computing B diff of m if you really understand really well the diffeomorphism groups of all the prime pieces, of all the irreducible pieces, let's say, that appear, and you understand their configuration spaces, and you're happy to take a coulombit over some combinatorial category. Combinatorial category. To give an idea of what this combinatorial category roughly looks like, let me give the easiest non-trivial example, which takes us a long time to actually do. So this is an example of how to use the quarterly for something else, proving the conjecture. Else than proving the conjecture. I'll say something about proving the conjecture in a moment. And this is the example where I don't have irreducible pieces, I just have two copies of S1 cross S2. And if you do this higher dimensional stuff, you might find this example appealing, because it looks like Sn cross Sn. And now the dual the graphs that I have to consider in this procedure, turns out the ones with biblioman vertices labelled by spheres don't really matter. By spheres, don't really matter. You can just cancel them out. Suffice is to consider the case where you have only tribal vertices by spheres. And then, if you think about what can appear here combinatorially, it's just three graphs. This graph, this graph, and this graph. And there's morphisms here, kind of corresponding to collapsing one of the edges here, collapsing the middle edge. The edges here collapsing the middle edge. This graph has some finite automorphism groups, so does this. This has di-heal group, there's automorphisms. There's plenty of finite groups going on. And all of the labels are just the three-sphere. And this means that when computing the configuration space, I'll have the configuration space of the three-sphere, modulo diff of the three-sphere by spell conjecture, SO, that's just SO4. And so all of the terms are kind of known. And this in particular means that you can work out the Can work out the rational cohomology of conf gamma in this case, and we do get a closed formula for that for arbitrary graphs labeled by spheres. And then you can take the co-limit. This is some finite EI category. Unfortunately, the finite groups that appear are things like the dihedral group on eight elements. You have to kind of figure out how exactly it acts and take invariance. And this is why we do it rationally and not integrally. But at the end of the day, you can get like a very But at the end of the day, you can get a very concrete description. And so, just to show that this is something one can do, we compute that V diff of S1 plus S2, connected some of itself, has a rational cohomology range given as follows. Where is it? Class independent 4, class indicate 8, that squares to 0, and then separately there are. And then separately, there is another clause link. Now you can debate about what this means and whether you can classify any bundles using this. But somehow it's supposed to kind of prove the point that for sufficiently small combinatorial graphs and sufficient knowledge about all of these spaces, you can just run the computation. I will say though that. I will say though that as soon as I go to three here, I think there's somehow nine graphs there instead of three. The automorphism groups are accordingly more complicated as well. Okay, so this is kind of more of a quantitative application of like literally working out what happens to the rational cohort ring. But I want to finish the talk by saying more things about uh how we actually use this stuff to prove the the Curious about this manifold, how it appears in this free doesn't come from the irreducible parts. It doesn't come from the irreducible parts, it just comes from the oh I should have said this. So for the if I only care about S1 cross S2 connected sum itself, then it suffices to know that that modular operator is clearly generated by this cyclic operator. And this is the thing I have to say: there's a theorem by thing I have to say there's a theorem by Jeffrey Giancarakuza that says that the modular opera of handle body groups is freely generated by V2 framed and this is somehow a direct analog of this where in dimension three the modular opera just coming from the S1 process twos is freely generated by this cyclic operator and that's all we're using. And some of the there's more examples of irreducible manifolds that are computable. Manifolds that are computable. Somehow, if you say just have three prime manifolds and you take their connected sum, then this command of arcs is also somewhat controllable. And only your master student of mine is going to calculate that? We'll see how difficult that actually is. So now so proof idea for the conjecture. Uh for the contractor. So let me let me recall more precisely what Hatcher McCulloch proved. So what they actually prove is that for M irreducible compact connector oriented and some union of compact And some union of components in the boundary, not an arbitrary subset, but a union of components that isn't empty, they show that the components that aren't in this union are incompressible tori. But in particular, you could just choose F to be everything, and then this is also true. They show that. They show that B diff fixing F of M is equivalent to a finite a spherical CW complex. And the thing that we would like to prove that slightly generalizes the Koncevic conjecture is that if you erase irreducible here and you also allow some spheres Some spheres as non-fixed boundaries, then you still get that it's a finite CW complex, though it's not going to be a spherical anymore. And this implies the conjecture because I could just choose F to be the entire boundary. Okay, and we want to use this co-limit formula. So write that again. So and the formula tells us that the diff, well, it turns out it's fine to fix something if I want to. And the formula is just the same. So this is going to be a coordinate over the category of graphs associated to n of some configuration. Of some configuration thing. So I should take gamma again, and I have to modify it such that everything fixes f. And the idea now is, first of all, I have to address this point that Robert made earlier, which is graphs M is a finite EI category. But the infinity category first among you will notice that somehow. Among you will notice that somehow not every finite one category is a finite infinity category. And in particular, the problem could be that there are some finite groups appearing in here. And as part of the co-limit, I'm taking homotopy orbits with respect to those groups. And this could break finiteness because Vg for a finite group is not equivalent to a finite CW complex. And so it doesn't quite suffice to say that all of these are finite, to conclude that the co-limit is finite, but it suffices to kind of consider the worst case. To kind of consider the worst case where you just bought out the entire automorphism group of the graph. So suffices. Sorry, what is pi? Every endomorphism is an isomorphism as a conservative map to a positive. Suffices to show that if I take this configuration thing and I model all automorphisms of gamma, again they have to fix up, that this is equivalent to a finite. That this is equivalent to a finite single recompense. Right? Because these automorphism groups are like the worst part of this category in terms of non-finite. Okay. And well, now it turns out that it's such a shame that I don't have these pictures anymore. Right, I had some picture here, too, and then I obtained something as a connected. I obtained something as a connected sum. And it turns out that if I remember where I did this connected sum, I put a little two-sphere here, and I put a little two-sphere here, and two-sphere here. We call this a separating system. So that's just to remember where did we do the handle attachments. It turns out that if I do remember this, then the space that we need to consider here. The space that we need to consider here is exactly the classifying space of the differomorphism group of M fixing sigma as a subset. Now, not pointwise, but just as a subset. And you can, if you think a bit about this, you'll see, okay, if it has to fix sigma as a subset, then it can move something around in here and move something around in here, but it kind of can't mix these irreducible factors. And that's why this turns up in here. And so we need to show that that's finite. So we need to show that that's finite. And now I want to argue this by just looking at the simplest case and seeing what happens. In general, you have to do a bit more of an induction. The simplest case looks roughly like this. I have one irreducible manifold here, and then I have another irreducible manifold. But I do know there has to be boundary somewhere, right? So, and I've taken their connected sumsay. I know there's boundary. I know there is a boundary somewhere, and I know I'm fixing it. So, this is maybe part of this boundary F that's being fixed. And I take my sphere system in here, which is just the single sphere in this case. And now I would like to show that diffeomorphisms of this that fix this set-wise and fix this point-wise, have a finite class of transparency. Finite class of transports. But there's a fiber sequence where what I'm doing, and now I'm really specifically in this case, P1 connected sum P2. There's a fiber sequence where I take P diff fixing F of P1 connected sum P2 fixing the sphere that does the gluing. I can just remember only what this did on P2. So I just discard what the different morphism did to the left of sigma, and this goes to be different. Of sigma, and this goes to be diff of f of p2 minus a disk. Yep. And what's the fiber of this? Well, the fiber is going to be all diffeomorphisms of the entire thing that are the identity in this region. We can't take the fiber over that. Now, diffeomorphisms of this entire thing that are identity all the way over here is the same as diffeomorphisms of P1 that are the identity on this sigma. Actually, P1 was. Sigma. Actually, P1 was the thing that still had the disk in there. So maybe what I should write is V diff of P1 fixing a 3 disk. And now I want to apply Hatcher McCulloch, hopefully, to show that this is finite, this is equivalent to a finite dimensional CW complex, and this is. Because then if I have a homotopy fiber sequence, I can conclude that this here is also homotopically finite. Perfectly fine. HIMACHALO doesn't quite apply to this because I excised the 3-disk, but there is a fiber sequence where, again, not too much detail here. I take V diff F of P2, and the fiber is going to be the space of embeddings. Well, it's going to be equivalent to P2 itself. Now, this is finite by this matchup of colour. This is Hatcher McCallum, deals with this case. P2 itself is a compact 3-manifold, so it's equivalent to a finite CW complex. Now I have a fiber sequence here, so this guy is finite. This is a bit more subtle, and this is going to be half of the paper, which is the following kind of additional pre-theorem that you need to do this. And it's to say that it's part of our paper, that if m is irreducible. If M is irreducible, let's just say closed, it's a bit more general, then V diff fixing a disk of M is finite. Finite is complex. This is a special case of the general theorem because I could just excise the interior of the disk and then say fix the boundary. But it doesn't follow from Hatcher and McKellow because if I do excise the interior, Color because if I do excise the interior of the disk, this is not going to be irreducible anymore. So I can't deduce this from their work, but it's still true, and we do still need it as a special case to start our induction so that we can conclude that this guy is finite. So we have to prove this. And that's actually kind of a non-trivial piece of work. And it requires you to look at the JSJ decomposition of M and kind of reduce it to all of the different geometric. It to all of the different geometric pieces. And then for the geometric pieces, let me just prove by example: if m is hyperbolic, then if you remember from the very start of the talk, so first of all, V diff m is always equivalent to the space of embeddings of the disk into m, modulo diffeomorphisms of m. But now, if you remember from the start of Remember from the start of the talk for hyperbolic manifolds, the diffeomorphism group was equivalent to the isometry group of M. And also in general, the space of embeddings of a disk into a manifold is equivalent to the frame bundle of M. Let's even take the orthogonal frame bundle of M. But now the orthogonal frame bundle of M is a compact manifold. Very interesting, I didn't actually understand this argument until I tried to explain it far beyond and failed. This is a compact manifold. This is a compact Lie group, and it acts on here freely, because if an isometry fixes a point and it fixes the framing at the point, then it must be the identity, right? So this is a compact Lie group acting freely on a compact manifold. So I can take the strict quotient instead of the multi-p quotient, and the strict model quotient is going to be a compact manifold and therefore finite. Compact manifold and therefore finite. And so you can see that in these cases where I have this generalized smell conjecture that tells me that the diffeomoulton group is equivalent to an isometry group, I can just argue by this argument and get finiteness. But you first have to kind of cut along tori to get there, and for that we're using Hatcher's theorem that the tori that appear in the JSJD composition are actually homotopic. Right, I think that's. Right. I think that's the yeah. I guess from the argument, the only thing you would need to know to get a hold on the dimensions of the little term for that vibration is the dimension of the isometry thing, right? Is it? Because everything else has you know the dimension of everything else in that picture, right? Yeah, so as I said, I'm I'm not sure about the dimension of this, for example, like the hatch and a colour thing. Like the heterogene colour thing, when you have boundary and you're kind of fixing that boundary, uh I don't know what the bounds are there, but presumably there's something's known there. Uh I don't know if you can say it fully. And then here, yeah, on this guy you would get a bound certainly from the azone to group. And then you get some addition, like the bound the bound on the homological dimension would get slightly worse just because we're taking a co-limit, but this is a like finite depth category. Like finite depth category, so it only adds like finitely many dimensions. And then, also, in general, this fiber sequence is kind of more of an extended argument because I might have more irreducible pieces. And basically, the strategy is just start with a boundary piece that you're fixing and do a fiber sequence that first fixes this piece and then takes the fiber and then it fixes the next piece and you kind of trace out everything. And so, there's a lot of little steps in the proof where some more dimension might be added. More dimension might be added. But in principle, it's effective if you know what's going on. So, do sections also prove this claim of habitat about what the state-on-altiers of D1? Oh, I completely forgot to mention. So, not in this setup with what we're doing with Rachel and Cari, but in work with Shoal Barkhan, we're gonna reprove that hopefully soon. soon. Um prove that. Uh that right the the claim just for for people uh b diff of if I take b diff of s1 cross s2 default connected sum and then I remove the disk so I have something to attach to. I can take the co-limit of that and the answer here homologically is going to be the free infrared loop space on On, I guess I don't have to suspect SO4. And so this is going to follow from some general stuff about when you have a free module. So as I said earlier for these guys, I'm really just talking about the free module operat on a cyclic operator. And the SO4 kind of comes from the E three. And whenever you have the free module operator on a cyclic operator and you have some basic assumptions, we can basically compute the stable homology of this. Stable homology of this. And also, with the theorem of Geo-Siracuser, this would also prove the case for Hanimobodics. But the main theorem of this talk would kind of come as an animal. So this Hedgehog argument, does it also decompose into the by the JSJ decomposition or do they argue differently? Um I could I I guess so. I guess so. I honestly, I haven't looked at it. Enough to say that. I know that, I mean, the first thing they do is to say it's a spherical, so we can study the mapping class group. And then they have a more precise statement about the mapping class group is a finite sequence of extensions of the mapping class groups of surfaces by cyclic groups and these kinds of things. So, what's the kind of structure you get if you instead of doing a long sphere? Of gluing along spheres and doing connected sums, say you want to start out with an irreducible manifold and you want to encode just gluing along tori. Yeah, yeah, so this, I mean, this is also a modular opera then, and it's going to be free in an even somewhat better sense. I don't know, you use that. No, I mean, in a way, I didn't tell you at all what goes into the proof of the main theorem, right? And the Uh the if someone were to ask, the the answer would be that somehow there's a a complex of two spheres in M, uh much like the curve complex, and it's just the complex of two spheres. And by technical considerations, it suffices to show that this is contractible. And this is true by work of uh Sam Narriman and Narriman and Nunn as well. And I think uh i if you wanted to do the Tori thing, you'd have to prove something like that for Tori. Prove something like that for Tori, like you'd fix an isotopy class and you'd say, take the Tori complex of Tori and that isotopy class, and you have to show it's contractible. And I would, I have a feeling that you might be just redoing Hatch's proof at that point. Contractable, but I'm not sure. Is there corresponding theory for a non-arranger with three men points? Yes, I would expect most things I Most things I said to be true, but we genuinely haven't thought about it. Maybe it's a bit more worrisome because I'd have the twisted S2 bundle over the circle, and those I wouldn't related subtlety, which maybe the Infinity Opera people, I don't know, is there any Infinity Opera or not? If there were, they would appreciate it, which is that They would appreciate it, which is that really I want to talk about some more colored modular operators, and I kind of pretty. Oh, who's he? There you go. Sorry. I kind of pretended everything was one colored. And there is the subtlety where earlier at some point I also said this when I do a connected sum, I mod out by SO3 for every edge where I glue. And this would have to be replaced by O three. So the space of colors would somehow be more complicated. But I I would assume you could do most things. We just really haven't thought about it. Really haven't thought about it. Can you imagine that this is this modular operator for any dimension, I guess? Yeah. Is it going to be plot three if you don't have no so for example interestingly right in dimension dimension three is some of the easiest dimension for doing this it's easier than dimension two because what I said isn't true in dimension two so in general you could ask someone So, in general, you could ask someone what is the connectivity from this cold limit formula to the actual thing. And it's going to be the connectivity of the curve complex in dimension 2, so roughly 2g. So this connectivity of this modular operat compared to the, well sorry, not to, sorry, it's slightly more subtle, but there is a sense in which the connectivity is slope 2, which of course is somehow much better than all kind of homological stability statements. But this really kind of assumes that you know everything up to that, up to an Know everything up to and lower to that genus from arbitrary boundary components and so on. So there are some things you could say, but really dimension three is by far the easiest one. And the reason it's the easiest, I have to think about this at some point, is in this sphere complex, when you have two spheres, when you have two spheres that intersect in a three manifold, they intersect in a circle, and the circle is the easiest manifold. It's easier than the zero sphere. It's easier than the zero sphere because the zero sphere isn't connected. One sphere is connected. And this is why it works in dimension three and not in dimension two. So it's really specific to dimension three that somehow the theorem is this strong, that we genuinely have, you know, I like to call the main theorem like kind of a homotopical prime decomposition, a prime decomposition of homogeneous basis. But that's just going to last dinner, I might say.
