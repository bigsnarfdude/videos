It's already a lot of fun, so first day, and for this opportunity to speak. So I'm going to be telling you about a joint work with Sunita, who's here, as well as Emily Gunawa and John Pinkpan. Yes. So I can just do. I think I have to click. Okay, it's only can go one direction. Okay, so the starting point for our project was the following sequence on the OER. Was the following sequence on the OEIS? It counts a lot of objects that many of us love. At least, yeah, so the first two, I guess, were on there for longer. And then a few years ago, Davis and Sagan noted that this same sequence also counts the normalized volume of a certain variant of the Birkhoff polygon. And perhaps partially due to how the sequence counts all these things and due to some of their results, they asked the question. They asked the question whether this analog that they studied of the Birkhoff polytope is actually equivalent to an ordered polytope. And so Emily brought this question to a research workshop we were at at Minnesota. And nothing too important on the bottom. Our answer was yes. And the point of most of the talk is to make this less cheeky. And the plus means we showed that actually this is an occurrence of a wider Of a wider class of equivalences between polytopes. So let's build up to what these are. Okay, so the C singletons. So throughout we're going to work on the symmetric group on n plus 1 letters. And we're going to fix C to be a coxeter element. So recall that's an element whose reduced word has exactly one of each of the simple transpositions. Okay, so to define Z singletons, we'll define this formal object. We'll define this formal object, this formal word C infinity. We'll just repeat the letters of C over and over. And now, given any pernutation, we'll let its C sorting word be the reduced word that can appear lexigraphically first as a subword of C infinity. And this is well defined, unique. So let's do an example. Here I've picked a C, so I'm working in S4. I wrote the first part of C infinity, and then so far. of C infinity. And then so if we have, if W, this W has two reduced words, S2 S1, S2 and S1, S2, S1, and S1, S2, S1 appears lexigraphically before S2, S1, S2 can appear. So that's its C sorting word. So everyone has a C sorting word, and we'll use that to define what a C singleton is. So there's a couple ways you could define it, but this is a little faster, so good for a short talk. So we'll start with the C sorting word of the longest element. We'll look at its commutation class, so reduced words that are equivalent just up to the commutation moves, and all prefixes of those words in that commutation class, those are what the C singletons are. So that's another way for us to see that this example, that this W is not a C singleton. So I wrote this C sorting word for the longest element. And if you're going to take the first three letters, you're always going to have S3. So we can't get that W. We can't get any of Can't get that W. We can't get any of the reduced words for that W as a prefix. Okay, so our C Birkhoff polytope is going to come from these C singletons. So given a permutation, we'll write down its permutation matrix and consider it as a vector in R to the n plus 1 squared, maybe just reading by rows. And so then the C-Birkhoff polytope will be the convex hull of those permutation matrices where we only look at the C singletons. Look at the C singletons. So here's an example, also an example of all the C singletons for that C we saw before. I'll just pause for a second so you can see if this checks with what you were, yeah, what we just said. Oh, oh no, the beer's back. Okay. Okay, so anyway, so, yeah. Breakfast beer. It's not coffee breakfast, it's beer breakfast. It's not coffee break, it's good break. Okay, and then I'll just remark: so the ordinary Birkhoff polytope, as many people probably know, that's just the convex hull of all the permutation matrices. So you can see why this is like a variant of that. And the polytope that Davis and Sagan studied that led them to their question was, well, they called it the polytope where you just look at permutations that avoid three, one, two and one, three, two, but that turns out to be the same thing as the C Birkov polytope for this choice of C, S one, S two, up to S N. C, S1, S2, up to SN, which we call the Tamari case because that poxder element relates to the Tamari lattice. Great, so that's player number one, the C-Burkot polytope. Player number two, so we want to relate it to an order polytope, so for that we need a poset. So given any reduced word on L letters, we're going to define a heap from this reduced word. The heap will be on L elements. So first we'll just think about them as the numbers 1 through L. And in the post set, we'll have X less. The postet will have x less than y, if x is less than y as a number, and then ux and uy do not commute. So it's like si and sj or i and j are just one apart. Or we'll take the transitive closure of those relations. So here's our reduced word on six letters. So we'll have a post-set on six things. So one and two, we don't have a relation because the first letter is S1, the second letter is S3, and those do commute. But we have But we have 1 less than 3 and 2 less than 3 because the third letter S2 does not commute with S1 or S3. And then I also just, the way we usually think about these heaps is we put those letters they correspond to back into the Haase diagram. And I think especially looking at the picture with the labels, it's at least clear in this example that linear extensions of the heap will relate to the commutation class of the reduced rate you started. Class of the reduced rate you started. That's a proposition by Stenbitch, I believe. Okay, so there's a heap, and now in general, what's an order polytope? So if we have a poset P, the ordered polytope is going to live in R to the P, so we'll have one standard basis vector for every element of the poset. And we can think about the ordered polytope being the convex hull of indicator vectors of order ideals. We call an order ideal of a poset is a set that's closed going down. set that's closed going down. So for my example P here, the ordered polytope will live in R to the 6. Here are some of the vertices, so of course we can have all 0 for an empty order ideal. 1 and 2 are the two singleton order ideals, so we have E1 and E2, and so on. There's in total nine vertices of this particle. Okay, so our guess plus is now this theorem. So Theorem. So you take Hoxha element C, you take the C sorting word of the longest element, and you take the heap of that reduced word. And so there's a unimodular equivalence between the Birkhoff polytope from that Coxfield element and then this Olega polytope. So again, what in this language, what Davis and Sagan did was they showed these two polytopes have the same normalized volume. And then our answer gives a yes to their question in this. Is a yes to their question in this case. Yeah, their question was about the case where C is S1 and S2 up to SN. But yeah, that's why it's yes plus. And I'll note that the way we describe the C singletons gives a really natural bijection between the vertex sets already. Because C singletons are prefixes from the commutation class of the C sorting word, the longest element. It's a bit of a mouthful. So when you take the heap for that C sorting word, The heap for that C sorting word, the order ideals would exactly be prefixes of the commutation class. So it makes the, at least like a comatorial bijection between the vertices quite natural. And so I just want to, sorry, it might be less than 15 minutes. I hope that's okay. Just some ideas from, I want to give some ideas from the proof that I think are interesting in their own right. So the C-Birkhoff polytope, that lives in n plus one squared dimensional space. The order polytope of the heap lives in The ordered polynomial of the heap lives in r to the n plus 2, n plus 1 choose 2 dimensional space, because that's the link longest element. So a big problem is just to put that C Birkhoff polytope in the right, to show that it's an n plus 1 choose two-dimensional polytope when it's living in a much larger space. Even the ordinary Birkhoff polytope, since it's the convex hull permutation matrices, it has that rows. If you think about them as matrices, the rows of columns sum to one. So with that, you could show it's an n squared dimensional polytope, but this is even smaller. But this is even smaller. So, anyway, we needed to study this so that we could give a good projection of our polytope into the right space. And to do this, we studied properties about the C-singleton permutations on their own. So, something really useful is going to be this other characterization of the C-singleton permutations, of course, coming from pattern avoidance. So, given our C, so remember in S to the N plus 1, or yeah, Sn plus 1. Or, yeah, Sn plus 1. So, we'll take the numbers 2 through n and divide them into two camps. So, we'll put a number in the lower bar camp if si appears after si minus 1, so like they're in order as like indices. And otherwise, they'll go in the upper bar camp if si comes before si minus 1. So in our running example, s2 comes after s1, so 2 is a lower bar. S3 comes before s2, so 3 is an upper bar. In that case, s1, s2 up to sn. That case, S1, S2, up to Sn, everyone's a lower bar. So statements there are particularly nice. Okay, so reading says a permutation is a C singleton if and only if it avoids, so 3, 1, 2, lower bar, 1, 3, 2, lower bar. That means it avoids those patterns, but the 2 is from the lower barking. And equivalently, it avoids 2, 1, 3 and 2, 3, 1 when the 2 is from the upper barking. So we can yet again see that this permutation is in the C singleton. That this permutation is in the C singleton in this running example. So, this WS1S2S1. If I write it one-line notation, it's 3, 2, 1, 4. And I have the bad pattern upper bar 2, 1, 3, because 3 is an upper bar, so then I want to have 3, 2, 4. That's one of the bad patterns. And I could replace the 2 with a 1, that's another bad pattern. What an upper bar or an over bar? Oh, yeah, yeah, so that, so it comes from C. It comes from looking at the Cox development and the order the simple transpositions come in. Simple transpositions come in. So here S3 was an upper bar because it came before S2. So if you think about the indices, it's up here. Any other questions? So anyway, using this characterization of the C singletons was super useful. And it allows us to give these extra properties about C singleton permutations. So, yeah, so for our running example, Yeah, so for our running example for that C, if W is a C singleton, then its permutation matrix has these extra conditions. So X4, 2, and X1, 3 is 0. That means you can't have a 3 in the first spot or a 2 in the last spot by how we've set it up. And then also this sum is 1, which there's not like an immediately nice story for why the sum is 1. But we get like three extra conditions. And then in the Tamari case, And then in the Tamari case, so notice in this case, since everyone's a lower bar, that's why those are just normal 312 and 132 avoiding permutations, because all possible tubes are lower bar. Yeah, so in that case, the first condition, it's actually nicer to see, just in the permutation matrix, you have some force zeros in this like triangle along the bottom. So just all these entries have to be zero in all the permutation matrices, therefore in the whole polytope, since it's a convex hull of those. Since it's the convex hole of those. And then the second fact I think is really nice. I'm not sure if maybe it's already known because maybe people have studied these permutations before. But if you take a C-singleton in this case, you write it in one line notation, you look at the first M spots, each number is going to be distinct mod M. So like if you look in the first two spots, you'll have one odd, one even, always. Anyway, so we take these facts, and then we can use them to find a good projection. To find a good projection of our polytope into the right space, and then from there we find another unimodular transformation to relate it to the order polytope. Our result. And that is all. Thank you for listening. Are there any questions? Say a little bit more about how you knew that the heaps were the right thing to find by Junction. thing to find bijection with. And also the second part of your question is do you think there's an analogy for other Coxberg groups? For the first part I think it would somewhere between Emily proposed it so I think she had the intuition but I think I think those opening oh I think that from the fact that it's related to all these things it's natural because like these would course these shifted standard dung temple staircase shape would look Standard Dung Tableau staircase shape would look like linear extensions of the heap in this Tamari case, and then the number of linear extensions should give the normalized volume. So maybe that got in their head. But definitely somewhere between Emily, Emily had the idea, but it might have also come partially equipped and second. And they did suggest to look at other C singletons, so I should give them credit for the plus. And you had a second part. Other Coxburgs. Oh, yeah, I would expect, because I think even the readings result also should relate to other Coxburgs. Like readings result also should relate to other coxitar groups, I think. So I think that's our next step. Right now, we just want to write it up. I would expect it. That was awesome. That was your question. Oh, okay, cool. Any other questions? I have a nice question. So can you define a C tamarai lattice for each C lattice? C Cambrian lattice. Yeah, that has to do with the C sortable elements, which are a broader class that I didn't define. It'd be like. It'd be like C sortable, when you write the C sorting word, it sort of nests nicely between the bars. And C singletons are nice, are nice, are like a subclass of C sortable. So yeah, there are, so in that case, the Tamari lattice is one of the C Cambrian lines. So we have some announcements. So it's going to get pretty cold. Which perhaps you already saw really, really cold, like Fahrenheit cold. Not the Celsius cold. You're both when they are equal. Yeah, 40. You know, it's going to get 20 Fahrenheit. It's gonna get twenty Fahrenheit cold towards the end of the week. So some people suggested that the three afternoons should be on Tuesday rather than on Wednesday. And we want to leave it to the groups. So we want to leave it to the groups. So you talk to your group, whatever your plan is, right? And then, you know, we work on the group. No, we can't. Oh, but if we switch them, we will have to switch everything, right? So, do we want to? Okay, so we'll just do the switch. So, the schedule for Tuesday afternoon will be now on Wednesday afternoon. So, we will follow the same and then we will follow for tomorrow Tuesday, we will follow the Wednesday after. Okay. So then uh we have a coffee break right now and we'll return up pre-cooled for some more uh thoughts. Yeah, set everything up on Oh no, I thought it was just like that. I just wanted to start right now. I don't like you to play. So if you're five minutes, I'm going to find myself.  Yeah, but that's too much. Yeah, that's just a little bit of a title. I noticed that I'll do it because I can't remember. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in everything highlighting. It is very, and they do get delayed all the time anyway, so you really need to. Yeah. I guess especially if you're spending the night. Yeah, that's what I always think.
