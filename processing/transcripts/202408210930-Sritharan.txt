Good morning, everyone. Let's resume our workshop. Now, Dr. Sibaguru Sri Radan is going to talk about stochastic analysis and control of classical and quantum fields. Thank you, Sibaguru. Go ahead. Thank you. So I hope you can hear me clearly. So in the case of the current. Yes, we can hear you. Yes, we can hear you. I'm sorry. We have a good audio. We can hear you. Okay. Thank you very much. So, in this talk, I will make some comments and descriptions on some perspective towards a large class of classical fields and how possibly some of the modern. Possibly some of the modern ideas in white noise theory perhaps can help in the quantization of these fields and in particular enable control and stochastic analysis. So in this talk, I will not talk about the quantization, I will only speak about the classical aspects of the fields and the stochastic analysis control. And I will also take an Role. And I will also take an effort to orient the topics towards some of the discussions that went on, starting from the first talk of Professor Franco Finola on the invariant states for GKLS flows. So I thought, so based on that and some of the other discussions, I thought It's good to show some of the very interesting developments in invariant measures, Godicity, large deviations, etc. for Navier-Stoking patients. After all, they are one of the well-studied infinite dimensional fields processes, so to speak. And then I will also briefly mention, mention, discuss about. Mention discuss about young mills fields. Okay, so the topics I have in mind, the slides are extensive, actually. You can minimize this. So I will speak about the large class of non-linear PDEs in mechanics, physics, and they also similar things also arise in geometry. Also arise in geometry. Then we will alternate our discussions between Navier Stokes and Young Mills. And in particular, I will first speak about the ergodicity and large deviations of probability laws for Navier-Stokes equations. First, the Benzel Freilin large deviation. I put the Donska Varadan to the I put the Donska Varadan to the end so I won't get to it. Very likely that I will be able to cover topics one, two, and three today. Some of the other major developments in stochastic Navier Stokes, in some sense, the best developments in this type of questions for physical systems have been towards equations of fluid mechanics. With mechanics, and of course, not to mention similar quantum dynamic PDEs, but I am talking about more control and filtering type questions were addressed more so far in the context of Namiya-Stokes, but they can certainly be extended towards more quantum dynamic PDEs. So, So, one way of looking at a large class of equations of fluid dynamics and actually the particle physics and relativity is a semi-group viewpoint. Of course, there is also variational viewpoint and so forth. So, this viewpoint for Navier-Stokes started in the late 50s by Soboleski. Sobelewski and then Kresnoselski, Crane and Sobolesky actually, to write the Navier-Stokes as a semi-linear evolution, identifying the linear part as a self-adjoint operator that generates a holomorphic semi-group in the sense of Healy and Yoshida and Phillips. And Yoshida and Phillips. Depending on whether domain is bounded or unbounded, you know, you may have to extend to use Phillips theorem as well. So that's first for incompressible flow. And there was a famous paper by Fugita and Kato in 1963. In 1963 and 62 and 63, also extensively studied using semi-groups. For 2D, that establishes the global solubility and 3D, it establishes a local solvability. So as you know, one of the Millennium Price problems, Clay Institute Millennium Price problem, is to prove global solvability of deterministic 3D Navier-Stokes equations. Questions and so for compressible flow, it was Nishida and Matsumura actually brought in around 1970 a similar phrasing the compressible Navier-Stokes equation in a similar framework. So, and that's why I said compressible and incompressible. Compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes, as well as MHD equation, magnetohydnomics. You can actually, one way is to frame it as a semi-linear evolution. And you can get local or global solubility depending on 2D3D. And then, so, in this moment, I want to recall what's called the standard model in particle physics. Standard model. Physics. Standard model: you have the electromagnetic force which is governed by the Maxwell equation, and then weak and strong forces governed by Young-Mills, which is essentially a matrix version of the Maxwell equation. And then gravitational fields, which is governed by Einstein field equations. So the This class of queries, which often called the nonlinear quantum dynamic wave equations, can also be phrased in this semi-linear form. So that includes the Yang-Mills equation, which we will discuss a bit later, Maxwell-Dirac, which is a coupling of Maxwell equation to the equations of spinners, which is the Dirac equation, non-linear Schrodinger, non-linear. Non-linear Schrodinger, non-linear Klein-Gordon, all of them can be phrased in this semi-linear form with A, the linear operator, now this time generating a continuous, strongly continuous group. So it is positive and negative time. And is they are valid in positive and negative time. In general, the problem has what is called a gauge group, and the gauge group is non-Nabelian for. Non-Nebelian for weak and strong forces, and that's and hence essentially the Maxwell equation is taken to the next level, and they are called the Young-Mills equation. And I also wanted to point out that both the Einstein field equation, compressible inviscid, Euler and MHD equation, compressible inviscid, they all can be phrased. They all can be phrased as a quasi-linear system of conservation law. So they don't really fit into the previous two framework. When U is a scalar, even when it is a multi-dimensional in spatially, you can actually frame this equation in the non-linear semi-group. So, in which case, this whole operator actually becomes. Actually, it becomes an M, what's called an M accurate operator, but in the case when U is a scalar. So, that today we won't talk about that, but that also has is a unique importance. So, these three class of PDEs, there are other PDEs like Hamilton Jacobi, we will encounter if we start talking about control, actually cover a large class of. Actually, cover a large class of classical fields from fluid dynamics to quantum type field equation. Quantization is another step which we will not talk about here. That is where when after this classical interpretation, then you write U in Fourier transform representation, and then the Fourier coefficients are now then interpreted as non-commutative options. As non-commutative operators satisfying the canonical commutative relations. And so that's called the quantization step. The white noise theory gives a pathway, but it has not been completed. Professor Z Huang has taken the initial step of studying both the free field and the Free Foot. Both the free field and the FIFO field theory using instead of the non-commutative operator, you bring in the TIDA differentials which are non-commutative and using then the symbols and S-transform coming from his white noise theory. So that program is very promising, but it has not been carried out for For in extending or you know further regularizing quantum field theory using white noise calculus, but that's a program I will I'm hoping to show in future meetings. Anyway, so the first topic I'm going to talk about is ergodic theory for Navier strokes because there was a great deal of discussion. There was a great deal of discussion on ergodic theory for GKLS evolutions: Gorini, Kosakovsky, Lindblad, Sudharsen evolutions. So I thought that discussions will be enriched by what went on in stochastic Navier Stokes. So let's talk about that subject. So before starting that, I want to point out. To point out over the last 30-40 years, there have been major developments in stochastic analysis and control of Navier-Stoke equation. So that's one of the prominent field equations, so to speak. So we're talking about solubility, strong, weak martingale solutions, young measure-valued optimal controls, Portuguese maximum principle were proven. Fatarini and I proved these two steps. The these two steps. I worked on these areas also. Large deviations of Wenzel and Freidlin. Sunder and I wrote a paper, Professor Padmanab and Sunder in LSU and I wrote a paper in 2006. And then Matthew Gursi immediately wrote a paper in applying Donska Varadan theory to 2D stochastic Navier Stokes. Ergod CTF and Egodic control has a big history, H-infinity Control. A big history: H infinity control, impulse control, and stopping time problem will lead to infinite-dimensional variational inequality. And then, as I mentioned, this infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation also comes in that. And then there is non-linear filtering here. So, the subject has been richly developed. The vision I project here is to develop such theory to structurally different non-linear PDEs in quantum theory and geometry. PDEs in quantum theory and geometry. Okay, so let's discuss the Navier-Stokes theory a little bit. So the way you build the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation is to start with the deterministic Navier-Stokes, which is this. du by dt u dot gradient u gradient p and nu this is laplacian of u divergence free because this is incompressible flow let This is incompressible flow. Later in the slides, I do have compressible. And then in the initial data, you can put the noise in the boundary as well, but this is designed in a problem in R2 or R3. If it is bounded domain, then I will put a zero boundary condition. So the two places where you provide data is on the right-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equation. Side of the Navier-Stokes equation, so that's an external force, and all on the initial data. So, historically, Eberhard Hoff and many people beyond before that, going back to Osborne Reynolds in 1895, even though it's sort of his work, the probabilistic thing is not that explicit, and many others, Kolmogorov and GI. And G.I. Taylor and Chandra Sergar and Heisenberg and many others did statistical theory at Navier-Stokes. So that starts with a probability distribution for U0 initial data and see how that probability propagates as the evolution takes place. And so the Stochastic Navier-Stokes, the first paper was probably Eugene Novikov in 1973. Novikov in 1973, 63. And then there was a major paper by Bennon Timam in 1973 in general functional analysis proving strong solutions to 2D stochastic laministropes with a special kind of Gaussian white noise. So then the subject started, and then Vishik and Forsikov wrote a big book in late 18th. Late 80s, statistical methods from Lavier Stokes studying many aspects. Okay, so the Levy process, I was one of the first to initiate that instead of using just Gaussian noise, you also use the Levy noise. So if I explain it in Explain it in order to go from this to more rigorous description, you need to write down the Navier-Stokes in a functional framework. So there it is. It is like your semi-linear equation now. So A is a self-adjoint operator, Nu is the viscous parameter, B is a bilinear non-linearity. It has a derivative in it, so it's bilinear in U, but with a derivative here. U but with a derivative here, and so if you take the uh, so the noise is a in this simple framework, noise is a martingale, uh, it's a Hilbert space valued martingale. You could actually put very similar noise here, but then you had to replace B by weak product and apply the white noise theory. So the stochastic calculus method relies on what's called trace class covariant. trace class covariant for the noise. So the noise is taken as a generalized derivative. So if I formally if you divide by dt you know this is dm by dt. So that is the noise. But m is actually in the simplest case is an h value in a process with covariance q and like I mentioned if if you simply put q is equal to i. Is equal to I, then you have an open problem for Navier strokes. And so additive noise is the case when you don't have anything appearing in front of this noise. And multiplicative noise is when you have phi of u. And Lemmy noise is in addition to this eto integral with respect to. Eto integral with respect to Wiener process, Hilbert's face value at Wiener process, you also have a jump process in terms of Poisson random measure, compensated Poisson random measure. Okay, so the so to elaborate this WG a little bit more, so the WG, if you take WG as coming from a trace class symmetric positive operator Q. Operator Q. So trace class is finite trace, then W can be written. So the covariance is written simply like this. You know, you multiply by a phi, make it a scalar, and then take expectation. Then you expect the trace to be finite, so the eigenvalues sum up to finite number. In that case, you also have a very nice Fourier expansion in terms of eigenvalues of. terms of eigenvalues of and eigenfunctions of q so that you can see that w is actually an infinite number in a sum of infinite number of one-dimensional brownian motions so the the functional framework i don't want to go through uh here it's just that you had to build the functional framework so that it is divergence free and the boundary can be encoded here the h1 space is v and The H1 space is V and domain of A is essentially the domain of the Laplace operator projected to divergence-free functions. You can also define fractional powers. So the Stokes operator, A, which is the projection of Laplace operator into divergence-free, is generates a holomorphic semi-group. And so in the case of In the case of I will point out again that in the case of Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon, and the dominant linear operator is IA is more in the Stones theorem framework. Okay, so I want to quickly take you to ergodic theory. So that is the limit states of this evolution. So let's UT be the solution of the Navier-Stokes. So you take So, you take a borel function, bounded boreal function, and take expectations. So, that defines a fellasmic group acting on phi. And so, for so, a measure μ is called an invariant measure. So, you have to actually take enough duality pairing and move the PT on the measure. On the measure. So you have p star t mu is the evolution of the that measure due to this flow. So that is called invariant if p t star mu is equal to mu. So that's an invariant state. So it's of immense interest for fluid mechanics starting from 1895 work of Osborne Reynolds because Osborne-Reynolds, because that these invariant measures are understood to describe the statistically stationary states of turbulence. And Vishik and Vusikov has a proof, but I think the easiest proof of existence is due to Chao, P. L. Chow, and Hasminsky in 1994. Actually, they presented these results in 1994. Actually, they presented these results in 94 IMA Minnesota meeting where I also presented my results in non-linear filtering and stochastic Navier strokes. So I just distinctly remember, but it got published later in 97. So you can prove for 2D Navier strokes in bounded domains that you have an invariant measure. If the invariant measure is unique, then the process is called. Uh, the process is called ergodic, in which case you have this time average is equal to the space phase-space average. So, the so under what condition it was is unique, it was actually was a famous results of Plandoli and Masilowski in the mid-90s that they use Dupes' theorem to prove uniqueness of invariant measure and thereby establishing a godicity for 2D. A goddess city for 2D bounded domains. And the 3D case with Levy measure was proven by two postdocs, Sati Vale and Manil Mohan and myself, just a few years ago. So for 3D stochastic navigation stoke with Levy measure. But so here is what is Dupe's theorem. Dupe's theorem essentially says that if you have irreducibility and strong filler, Reducibility and strong feather, then that implies uniqueness of invariant measures. Say the moment you define this operator PT, the transition semigroup, you can easily show from the properties of the solution that Pt is filler. So, filler, but what you need is what is called a strong filler, and the other property is irreducibility. So, you also see, you saw. So, you also see, you saw a lot of discussion of reducibility in Professor Finola's talk yesterday Monday. And so, reducibility is whether you can get from, it also comes if you study queuing theory, whether you can go from one state. So, let's say u0 is a particular state. So, you build a step function. From there, you can. From there, you can you whether you can go from u0 to inside a borough set with positive probability. So that you can reach any literally any set in this phase space. So and strong fella, it turns out that reducibility you can prove for 2D and 3D by proving some controllability results. Strong fella is. Controllability results. Strong fella is a harder property. Strong fella says that bounded boreal functions are mapped by this semi-group into continuous functions. So that it turns out that you could only prove for 2D. And so that limits with a lot of noise on the right-hand side. So, in those, so Doops' theorem says that if you have these two, then your invariant measure is unique. And then you have. Is unique, and then you have the law converges to mu. So, and it's a very powerful theorem, and this is what Flandole used. And so, so irreducibility is connected to controllability problem of deterministic Navier Stroke equation, whether you can actually reach a certain state. Depending on if phi is not very degenerative. If phi is not very degenerate, that is not too difficult to prove. But if it is degenerate, that's another story. I'll get to that in a moment. Strong fella is a consequence of what is called Bismuth-Elworthy Lie formula. So if the in this transition semigroup, if the initial data is only borel measurable and bounded, what can you say about the solution of the transition PTP? Phi for positive times, and it turns out that it is, you have a powerful theorem that relates. So, if you look at the right-hand side, there's a one over t here, but there's no derivative of phi here, right? So that, but there's a phi inverse here. So, that's a so that means that phi has to be invertible. That is a problematic, but but it's a But it is a powerful theorem that relates the initial data to its derivative for positive times. And anyway, so this ST is the solution of the linearized problem. And so if you know, if you can prove Bismarck's L worthy formula, then you simply estimate and notice that the L infinity bound will ensure that there's a derivative is bounded. There's a derivative is bounded, so that gives you this strong fellow property you are looking for, and you need some approximations to get there. Martin Hera and Mattingly proposed what is called an asymptotic strong fellow, and so which is also connected to the controllability problem of deterministic PD. And so, of the linearized deterministic PD. So, the best. So, the best controllability problem is due to Amon Srikian that is relevant here. That gives what is called a strong controllability. You can start from, sorry, approximate controllability. So, if you start from initial data, you can get sufficiently close in this DA half. No. So, but we don't have actually any. Any results pertaining to very small modes, as conjectured by Hera and Matingvi. Okay, so now let's quickly, so that is a comment on a goddess city of 2D Navier Stokes. And I can talk more about it if there is a question. And so now let's talk about what's called the large deviation results of. Called the large deviation results of four Navier-Stochacic Navier stopes since similar results are of interest, both ergodicity and interest to all the non-linear semi-groups I mentioned, as well as I think the GK LS evolution as well. I don't know whether anybody is thinking about that. So, rather than essentially, you know, in the interest of time, I want to just briefly show rather than. So, Verdan defined the large deviation theory is about the formalizing the behavior of the loss of the solution depending on a parameter. So, and try to get this kind of exponential behavior for a rate function i. The rate function is defined to be low semi-continuous. Defined to be low semi-continuous, and you know, it's and it's for each level sets are compact. And so then the last deviation statement, which is this exponential decay, is formalized by Varadan by this kind of these two lines. So, just to tell you about the results. Just to tell you about the results, Sunder and I obtained. There's more than 200 citations of this paper now, but and then there's another 200 dozen cites. So this paper has inspired a lot of work. And so we proved that we look at, we put a noise, a small noise, and then we can show that the corrosion. We can show that the corresponding law will satisfy large deviation property. And what is interesting is that the rate function is essentially given by this kind of square integral of V function. That V is nothing but simply you replace the noise by a control. And so it is that V. So it is the rate function can be obtained by. Be obtained by replacing the noise by control by getting a deterministic control problem. This is also in the finite dimensional case in Varadan's book, Large Deviation. So you sort of generalizing these finite dimensional results to Navier-Stokes. Matthew Gercy wrote in the following year corresponding Donska Vergen theory, but I move that discussion to the end. Okay, so the The end. Okay, so now in the remaining 15 minutes, I want to talk about the Young-Mills theory. So that is essentially going to that second class of PDEs where we have. So Young-Mills is essentially, as Michael Attia said in the Millennium Prize talk, Maxwell equations seen on matrices. On matrices. And to build the theory, you start with a compact Lie group, let's say G, with a Lie algebra script G with a Lie bracket given by this. And let you have an invariant inner product. It's a vector space. So there's an inner product for G. So Young-Mills potential A is a G-valued one form over the Minkowski space. So you can talk about Young-Mills. So, you can talk about Young-Mills equation in the elliptic case, in the parabolic case, by looking at instead of the Minkowski space, just the Euclidean space. And that's a big field as well. People like Atiya, Donaldson, Karen Ullenpeck have made seminal contributions for elliptic Young-Mills equations. And Professor Akkadi pointed out. Pointed out, alerted me about the very interesting developments he led a number of years ago, connecting the Young-Mills equation to the Levy Laplacian and Levy de Lambetian. And that's also inspired us to think about trying to prove some of the results from elliptic Young-Mills theory, Karen Wullenpeck and Donaldson too. Wollenpeck and Donaldson, too, using the fact that it connects to Levila Plazi. So that's something we can discuss in the coming months and years. Okay, so the A, the potential is a one form, so I just write it this way. But they are Lie algebra value. And so you can sometimes in the physics literature, they further expand that with respect to the representations of G. To the representations of G. So the curvature associated with A is F mu nu, it's a two form. And so we are the F is actually given by DA plus this commutator. That commutator would be zero for when if G is commutative. And so the F in the tensor form it can be written. Tensor form, it can be written this way. So the Yang-Mills equation is the Euler-Lagrange equation for the critical point of the Lagrangian, which is the trace of this. And so you end up with an equation like this. This can actually be written as a is actually a wave map system once you try. So this is actually. Once you try. So, this is actually Bianchi identity, but the other equation also essentially gives you the same PD. And for the Young-Mills Hicks field, so what is not evident here is that you separate the time and then you can actually write it as a semi-linear system, which I will show you in a moment. Young-Mill 6 is introducing other fields. Introducing other fields, you can also introduce the spinner fields to couple with the Dirac equation. And so the Higgs field is a vector-valued function, you know, actually a Lie algebra valued function. So, and its covariant derivative is written out. And so, in that case, the Lagrangian is the Is the pure Young-Mills plus these two additional terms. And the Young-Mills-Hicks equations are then obtained as the Euler-Lagrange equation of that equation. Okay, so a number of people worked on studying the solvability of the Young-Mills-Hicks equation, most notably. Hicks equation, most notably Chakur Bruhart and then later Siegel. And so all the famous names you see in relativity and quantum theory, you see they studied on the solvability. And then Erdley and Montcliffe's used theories, but I want to point out here. And so they were able. And so they were able to, Siegel is the first one, I think, phrased it in this way most prominently and proved the local solubility theorem. So Young Mills equation essentially introducing this potential electric field and phi and the variable pi. And so that you can actually write it as a semi-linear equation as I started this lecture with. This lecture with where this matrix A is this operator or matrix operator and the J as this vector operator. So this is now in, so you can write it in the mild form this way, right, using the propagator associated with A. So the Younger's equation, which looks like this, this for the Higgs equation or this, but the This, but they are elegant, but they are phrased in the PDE language this way. And moreover, as Siegel pointed out, and then also later, that operator A generates a one-parameter continuous group by suitable chosen Sovelov spaces with a bound like this, where mu t is a certain A certain function of time which is L infinity locally and J actually is actually looks even better than the Navier-Stokes because it's locally Lipschitz with the same no and so with that you define a constraint which is essentially the Gauss Uh, Gauss theorem for the case, uh, Youngel's case for the matrices, the Gaussian matrices. And so then you get the local solvable theorem of Siegel, it's a prominent paper, and then Ginnibury and Willow and Adlian Montcliffe proved that you have a local solvable theorem up to a maximal time and And so that the equation is the Young-Mills system is satisfied in the mild sense, later also for the Young-Mills Higgs. And the invariant, the Gauss also preserved. It is initially preserved, then it's preserved up to a maximal time. But this theorem says that the potentially as t star goes to infinity, the norm can blow up. And then in a seminal paper, Uh, and then in a seminal paper, uh, Eardley and Moncliffe proved that indeed you can actually get a global L infinity bounds for the F and also the derivative of the Higgs potential. So that you have, once you have these two, you also have a global solvent theorem for all time. So Youngville system has a global Has a globally smooth Young-Mills Hicks system has a globally smooth solution for all time. For 3D Navier Stokes, we don't have this kind of global bounds. For example, for vote city, if you can prove such a global bound, I even put a weaker condition, then you prove the, you solve the Clay Institute Millennium Price Pro. So let me make further remarks on the young mills. So in the literature, in pure mathematics, elliptic young mills and parabolic young mills are very big with names like Donaldson, Michael Attiya, and Edward Witten and all these people, Yao and all these people. Yao and all these people. So they also have a Hermitian. What I spoke about is hyperbolic Young-Mills on the Minkowski space. As Professor Akadi pointed out, you can actually transform the Young-Mills equation to just Young-Mills, the PDE to Levil Laplacian in the elliptic case and dalambration for hyperbolic case. So that part is very interesting. So, that part is very interesting. It also then begs the question: what you can prove about the elliptic and parabolic and hyperbolic young mills using that results. And then, of course, as you all know, one of the other Millennium Price problem is the quantum Young-Milson mass gap. So, that involves quantization. Quantization of this. The quantization of Young-Mills was already done by T. Hooft in the mid-70s for which he won the Nobel Prize, but it's in the physics literature. But the mathematicians want a rigorous quantization and demonstrate the mass gap. So that's the Millennium Price problem. Okay, so my time is more or less up so that I can leave. Miss Modulus up so that I can leave for questions. There are a number of other topics. So you can see that it is out of my this is slide number 22 and you have I sent the whole slide so this you can read the rest of the areas so that I can close and ask for allow for some questions. Thank you. Okay, let's thank the speaker. Do we have any questions? Maybe online. Do we have any questions? Okay, no. Dr. Walu wants to have a question. Oh, no, I'm fine. It's a very interesting talk. Thank you. It's a very interesting talk. Thank you. Yes, please. Do you have questions? No, I just want to thank you. It's a very interesting talk, very inspiring. Okay, well, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
