Here. And a little disclaimer: I'm actually a different geometer. This is a fairly new project for me. So if I say something wrong, feel free to tell me because I'm still learning all that material. So this is Hypothy. I'm going to talk about random breeds and how they can randomly. So we've heard a lot already about random grades, random knots. So I'll be brief. One reason to one advantage of using grades, I mean we we do often random knots by setting a braid a knot. Setting a break, a not one, then giving a probability of one half of on each crossing if one strand is above the other or under the other one. And if you look at so this is a and so this is very messy, okay? This is fairly messy. Okay. But braids, you see, braids, the crossing points of braids, they march ahead in almost military order. So that's one advantage of looking at braids rather than looking at things like that. And the second advantage. And the second advantage is that you can do random walks on braids, as you have discussed. So I'll try to move to the next slide. Yes. So actually braids like the one like this one is even, this is much better than this, but it's still fairly general and difficult to handle. And so I'm going to And so I'm going to restrict myself to something simpler, which is called a rosette braid. So you see, this is a kind of braid for a torus knot. And the building blocks are the product of the odd generators. And here's the product of the different generators. And that's the building block. And you take it, you multiply it as many times as you want. Multiply it as many times as you like. And you can close it into a knot in two different ways. So there's something I'm sweeping under the rug. To close it into a knot, you need a specific, you take a product of a specific number. If you want to close, you have a restriction on the number of building blocks. On the number of building blocks which you multiply if you want it to close in one component. So, this is the usual closure, and this is the plat closure, which is only for an even number of strands. You can't do that if you have an odd number of strands. And this picture is also called a checkerboard diagram. And the reason we can use it is that there is this theorem by Lam that if you have a grade which If you have a braid which closes into a knot, then it's conjugate to a rosette braid like that. So it's conjugate to something like that. And if you have a knot for plaid closure of bridge number B, so the bridge number, there are many definitions and Moshe will tell us more about it. But basically, here you see we have, and go in this direction, we have three minima and three maximum. Minima and three maxima of the coordinate of this coordinate of the horizontal coordinate. So if you have a knot of bridge number P, we can draw it like this. So I'm going to just look at these models. And so I went to, as I said, I'm very new, so I went to see Tanovic this last summer. And he said, well, the simplest Well, the simplest invariant to look at. In this case, it's the Casson invariant. We saw that's what I did, and then I went to see Rheim who explained more how to handle it. And so the Casson invariant is the one which is one definition, it's the coefficient of the conveyor polynomial. But I'm going to use the definition which and the characterization, which From the characterization which all these people have given. So they look at their knot and they look at pairs of double points, certain pairs which I call valid, I don't know how they call them. So they have two, you have two double points, P P tilde and Q Q tilde. So the tilde is, as I go, I have a starting point on my note, and as I go, My knot, and as I go along the knot, the tilde denotes the second passage. I first go through P and then I go through P tilde. And I want them to be alternating. That is, they occur in this order. PQ, P tilde, Q tilde. So for example, here, let's say I start here at the little blue cross, and so I go through P first, then through Q, then through P tilde, and then. Then through P tilde, and then through Q tilde. So this is alternating, and here it's not. I go through P, through Q, and then through Q tilde. So this is not okay. Small question. I know that is the Polyapuro formula, but for that, or is it? Okay, all right. I would call that the Polyapuro formula. How'd you say? Polyakuro, Michelle. How'd you say? Polyak Bureau, Michael Polyak. Oh, okay. Oh, Polyak Bureau. Okay, excellent. And so you have so then I want something else. I want this to be ascending. So the first the first passage is under. Passage is under, and the second passage is above, and the second q tilde has only descendlin. So the first passage is above, and the second passage is under. And then we have the formula that the Casson invariant is a sum over all these pairs and of the product of the sign. So the sign of a The sign of a crossing point is the sign of the upper tangent and lower tangent. So here my sign is positive. So actually, so you see this is, if this is an assignment. this is if this is an ascending if this is an ascending crossing point so this would be the first one this would be the second one and so when I say I take the tangent the direction above and the direction under for an ascending process point I I can equivalently say I take the second uh the sec the direction of the second passage and the direction of the first passage. Of the first passage. So I define something which I can read on the great shadow, which is the sign of this determinant. I take the direction of the second strand, direction of the first strand, and the determinant and the sign. And so I end up with the expectation of, and so if it's ascending, the So if it's ascending, the sign as a crossing point of the knot is S plus. And if it's descending, the sine as a crossing point of the knot is minus S plus. So I'm sure this is also classical. And so I end up with this formula for the expectation of the Gaussian invariant, which is I take my Bray diagram or even my not. Or even my knot, my braid shadow, or my knot diagram. I look at all the alternating double points and I take this product. There is a minus because Q has to be descending, and there is a 1, 4, obviously, because there are two possibilities for each double point. Two possibilities of sign. So this is a quantity which I'm going to study. I'm going to study. And so now you have a diagram, and you count, and you look at practically count, and you get the following result. So for the usual closure, that is this thing for the usual closure. Have this formula. It's the length of the expectation of the Casson invariant over all over all braid shadows is the length of the braid shadow, is equivalent to the length of the braid shadow times the number of strands plus one. And for the For the plaid closure, I have a similar expression. It's the length. I also have a factor given by the number of strands and a factor given by the length and a constant factor. So I want to make two remarks. So, first, this is: I said in the beginning that taking this Rosetta-grade model Model simplifies things because it's so regular, and indeed, this comes as a cost because if we take a different model, then of breaks we get a different quantity. And if we take, this is more taking a specific model is a bit cheating. I mean, the most general model would be the following. I take a braid of length n and Of length n, and then it will be a product of rate generators and any product of rig generators. So for this model, if you didn't compute it completely, but I estimated it for three braids, and I get something different. For three braids, this model gives me the length divided by L the length divided by six, and this model gives me something smaller than seven L over 48. And since L over six is eight L over 48, you see that this is smaller than this. Okay, so that's the first comment. And so then there's a question, but they have something in common. They have to factor L. So that's the first question. How much do we depend on the body? How much do we depend on the model? The second comment is this paper I mentioned earlier. They noticed that in all the models, we have a positive value. Although the Cassandra invariant can be positive or negative, if they notice that if you Like this estimates, expectancy, we always get something positive. And so, here, and even more, because here I gave asymptotic equivalences, but actually in the course of the paper, you can compute exactly for each model, for each and you always get something positive. For each gray shadow, you get something positive. You get something positive. And so, my question is: since this actually is something you can read on the NOT diagram, I would like to think of the following problem. You fix a NOT diagram, and then you compute this, this, you compute it on the NOT diagram, but on a fixed NOT diagram, not on a family going to infinity, but on a fixed one, do you always get a positive? Do you always get a positive quantity for this? So this is the question. So, now I'm going to move on to the random walks, the second part. So, are there questions so far on the first part? For this last question that you asked, is that you fix this projection and then like no matter what the crossings are, you're saying? Right, I fix it. things are you're saying right and i fix a projection i i fix one i take one projection i take an object like this a curve with singularities in r2 and i say well compute this expectation on this curve because uh this computation you can easily write it as a computation directly on this object Okay, so I'm going to talk about random walks, but because I'm going to be discussing signature and determinant, I recall their definition. So I have a knot in R3 or S3, and it bounds an orientable surface, which we call the cipher surface. Which we called a cipher surface. So, of course, this is not the right. And so, if I have a loop on the surface, so this is the surface, and I have a loop on the surface. Since I'm actually in three space, I can push it in the normal direction. I'm here to normal direction. I can push it in the normal direction, a little, in the direction normal to the surface, and I call this alpha hat. And then I get a billionaire form on the first homology by taking the linking number of homes. Of a loop here with the linking method of a loop here, just pushed, or rather, this is pushed a bit in the direction normal to the surface. And so this has a matrix. And the matrix is not invariant, but you derive two invariants if you take this matrix V and you take it transpose. And you take it transpose and the signature of this gives you, it's called the signature of the naught, and the determinant of this is called the determinant of the naught. So these are the two invariants we're going to look at in the second part. So fortunately, people have defined random walks these past few days. Few days and so, what I'm going to look at, so Nathan talked about random walks, and you have a looking at the limit via random walk. And I'm going to look at something simpler, just transient objects. I have, I take my break group, I take a random walk in the break group. And if I take a subset in the break group, I say it's transient. Group, I say it's transient. If I don't, when I go on my random walk, I will almost surely never return to X. The walk reaches X in K steps. The probability tends of the walk reaching X in K steps tends to zero as K tends to infinity. So and so one activity One activity doing random walks on the rate loop is to find subsets which are transient for a random walk, which, and I'm not going to go into the exact definition of what we need on the random walk for this to be valid. Maybe I'll someone Someone right yesterday we heard about finance. So I can take a probability. Let's say let's say for n is equal to speed, so each sigma one and sigma two will have probability one fourth. probability one fourth sigma one minus one and sigma two minus one would have probably t one fourth four and and then and all the other ones will have probably c0 and then we do a convolution so so the first the first way the the the first classical way of finding transient transient Transient subsets of the break group is using quasimorphisms. So this quasimorphism is a map from a, you take a map from a group to R. And I mean, it's of course a more general definition, but I take what I mean here. So you see, if it's a morphism, then I have f of a star b is equal to f of a plus f of b. Plus f of b. So I want something a bit more general. I want this to be universally bounded. Whatever A and B, it's bounded. And so my Lutin showed that if I have a quasi-morphism on a group, then if I fix a constant, the elements of the group for which the quasimorphism will give me a value smaller than A, this will be true. And A, this will be transient. So I'm saying with these assumptions, because of course, there's some assumptions on the random wall for this to be true. But for example, it's true for this one. And so this is very nice because we have not invariants which are defined on the break blue and which are quasimorphisms. So that gives us already two. Already two transient sets. So the brace of bounded signature, that's a transient subset, and the brace of bounded 4 genus, it's also a transient subset. Actually, the 4 genus is larger than the signature, so we could derive one from the other, but it's more interesting to put it like this, because both these are quasimorphisms on the brake. And these are the authors who show that these are quasimorphalism. We show that these are quasi-morphisms. So I'm going to use something else to derive transient sets. I'm going to use representations and more particularly the symplectic representation of the great group. So I'm going to recall what it is. So we saw the Bureau representation produced. So I take So I take a bread in, I take with m plus one strands, and I get a matrix, an m cross n matrix in the unknowns t and t minus one. So for t is equal to minus one, if I fix t is equal to minus one, that means that I take a brace and I get m cross m matrix. And I'm going to restrict And I'm going to restrict myself to m being even. There is also a definition, and then I have an interpretation of P for P is equal to minus 1 as symplectic matrices. So there is also rep an interpretation for M odd, but um but I I I won't go into it. I won't go into it. It's not much more complicated, but I'm only looking at an odd number. M is even, so it's an odd number of strands. So a few reminders. If I take a surface of genus N, so I choose to generate the homology by these delta i's. And so, and I, if I take a break generator, I have the braid generator, I make it act on the first homology loop by sending the I generator to the den twist with respect to delta I. So I try to draw a den twist. So you see, you have this is delta, and once this is, you see the red line, and once you make the den twist. Line, and once you make the 10 twists act, then it goes, you get a right, you get a delta. Instead of being trivial, it acquires like a delta cycle. So this way I have a representation, I have a map, a representation of the break group to the homomorphisms of H2. Of the age of H1. And I have something more that H1 has a symplectic structure. There's the intersection form. It's a two-form. It gives me an alternating two-form on H1, which is even a symplectic form. And it turns out that this preserves the symplectic form. And so I have a symplectic what's called a symplectic representation. The symplectic representation from the brake group to the symplectic group of 2n on the space of dimension 2n with coefficients, and it coincides with a dual representation for t is equal to minus 1. Right, so as I said, we can also, if we want to, if we were doing this for an even number of strands, we would have. trends, we would have here that this would not we would deal with the quotient. We need to quotient by one line. So theorem? So I'm going to use a bit the same idea which Bram used yesterday that to go into Into an algebraic set. So I wrote this. So I have basically what I'm saying is that if I send the subset of grades for which the representation of an algebraic equation is transient. And I write it in this long, long-winded way. Long-winded way because I have a very close friend who's an algebraic geometer. And when I talked to her about an algebraic subset on the C, she was horrified because you're not supposed to do that, you're supposed to growth and degrader. So I'm not talking about something algebraic, I'm saying there's a polynomial, and the polynomial acts on the Polynomial acts on the matrices, and so the set for which this polynomial vanishes on the matrices representing the brakes, this set is transient. Questions? Okay, so the proof is very simple and uses the same ingredients as the brand used. So we first have a Account of he looked at these in the different in the context of singularities and he proved that this is a surjective map. And then we go to finite fields. So we can use the fact that in a finite field, an algebraic subset of a finite field over Fp is cardinal number. Its cardinal number compared to the cardinal number of the set is like at least smaller than 1 over p. So we take p large and large enough and get and so we and why do I need to go from sp to p of sp is that I want I want at some point I want my random work to be equity To be equidistributed, and so for this, I need certain assumptions on the group, like I need a group which are verified here. If the group is simple, then it doesn't have to be simple, but if it's simple, it's okay. So anyway, that's the result. That's one more way of finding transcendent sets. And the next example would be the Example would be the determinant. So we saw that the braids with bounded signature and bounded 4 genus are transient. So now we have the braids with bounded determinant are transient. And the proof is, so the determinant turns out to be delta I introduced the Alexander polynomial which was already introduced earlier. introduced earlier and so delta k minus 1 is a determinant of the knot which and so we have this formula which we saw earlier that we can compute the Alexander polynomial of a break crossing closing into a knot by this formula and right and so Right, and so so I go back to the fact that it's an odd number of grades of strands. And you see here, if this formula is true for also for even number of strands, but if I plug in t is equal to minus one, I get zero over zero. So you need to look into, you need to look more deeply at what. Look more deeply at what happens, and so a problem. Try to rewrite this more carefully and show that this corner is also true for breaks with an even number of points. I'm going to go to I'm going to go to three breaks. So we saw, I'm going to be talking about looking at quasi-positive script rates. So this is something, I mean, this is true in general, but I rewrite it here because it will look here in this page. So the signature The signature is smaller than the twice the four-genus of a knot. So the four genus of a knot is the smallest genus of a surface that it bands in the four ball. The knot is on the sphere banding the four balls. And a positive grade is, we saw what it is two days ago. A positive braid is just a product of positive generators of sigma i's. We don't know sigma i'm. i's, no sigma i minus 1. And so the signature, another fact, the signature of a positive grade is strictly negative. In the literature, there are two different definitions of signatures. So it can also be that with the other definition, then the signature is strictly positive. So at least something one has to be careful about. So the signature is strictly negative. Signature is strictly negative. And so a natural question is: what about the signature of the quasi-positive grade? So it's not necessarily negative. And we have Tanaka in the 1980s already gave examples of quasi-positive rates with zero signature. And I realize I haven't told you what quasi-positive rates are. So you see the products of conjugates. Of conjugates of positive grades. So the PKs are positive rates, and I take the conjugates and I take a product of it. So this is a quasi-positive grade. And it turns out that it can be seen as a knot property. You can talk of a quasi-positive knot, which has one representation, which is a quasi-positive thing. And they're very interesting because Rudolph, Lee Rudolph, proved. Lee Rudolph proved that identity you can actually compute the four genus for these things just by looking at the break, which is an unusual situation. So I'm going to now I'm going to go into three brains and I'm going to look at a specific To look at a specific type of break. I'm going to fix a break gamma. I'm going to fix i and j, so i and j can be one and two. So I look at this commutator, gamma sigma, i, gamma minus one. It's not exactly a commutator. Well, it's close to being a commutator. I'm looking at this braid and I'm taking a Grade and I'm taking a multiplying it n times by itself. So it is clearly a quasi-positive grade. And a Rudolph's result tells us that the 4 genus is n minus 1. So the 4 genus increases as n increases. But on the other hand, the signature is always zero. So I wrote it almost. So I wrote it almost every gamma belonging to these three verifies. So because I didn't want to write the whole, this is maybe not very rigorous. I meant with a set of gammas for which this is not true, for which they exist set, there exists either this j such that this signature is non-zero, this set is transient. So I didn't want to make the thing even more heavier. So that's what I mean by almost every By almost every gamma. So the idea is that we have more, this gives us more examples of quasi-positive grades you see with originous increases as much as black, but still with zero signature. And so proof is very simple. So I mentioned Gambo Do and Gis earlier. These are the ones who prove that. Earlier, these are the ones who proved that the signature is a quasi-morphism on the braid group. And they use something called, which I'm not going to define, although the Meyer-Co cycle on SL2C, because now we're looking at three braids, and so the symplectic group SP2Z in this case is just SL2Z. So now we're working with SL2Z, which makes it, which is very pleasant, because SL2Z is here. India. There are lots and lots of tools. So they prove the following. They say that the signature of the closure of a product of grades is a sum of the signatures of the two grades with this correcting term, the Meyer-Co cycle of the Bureau representation. So these two things live in SL2C and take their Meyer-Co cycle. So I'm not going to tell you what the Meyer-Co cycle is. Going to tell you what the Michael cycle is, just going to tell you one of its properties. And so, for this property, I need to recall something about SN2Z. We have this classification of elements of SN2Z. And the most common element is something which is called hyperbolic, and it's equivalent to the absolute value of the trace of the matrix being strictly larger than two. Strictly larger than 2. So, and if I have a hyperbolic element of SL to Z, then the Meyer cocycle of two powers of A is equal to zero. So, if I want, so I'm going to slice up two more. Going to I still have a few more minutes, so I'm going to show I go by induction so it's equal to the signature of gamma sigma i. gamma sigma i, gamma n minus 1 sigma j n minus 1 plus the signature of gamma sigma i, gamma minus 1 sigma j. So this is a plus or minus the Myrka cycle. So if I want to prove that this is zero, then I just, this is actually always zero because this is a ribbon you can prove. You can prove it's something very symmetric, so it's a ribbon knot, and so it's single, so the J for genius is zero, and so the signature is zero. So since this is zero, if I want this to be zero, I just need to, by induction, I just need to show that The microcycle of this I mean, it's enough to show this, and so I use this fact that in turn to show this. In turn, to show this, it's enough to show that this element is hyperbolic. So, what do I have? I have a matrix and so proving that this is hyperbolic is just a computation on a 2 by 2 matrix, and it's saying that the trace of this object cannot be marked. cannot be minus 2 minus 1 0 1 or 2 and so this is just an equation in terms this gives me an equation in terms of of the matrix and I can use a general meta so right so the not hyperbolic translates into Not hyperbolic translates into and last remark, as I said, Tanaka already this is not revolutionary because Tanaka already gave us examples of quasi-positive traits with zero signature. The last slide was just the thank you slide, and it seems that, okay, so I'll say thank you all. Questions, Tamarian? So for the result about the determinant, do you expect that it will satisfy some kind of central limit? It's like the signature because the combination of plasma is not a satisfying. Do you expect the same I don't know. I don't know. I'm just if this is true for like work in progress. So Sure, yeah, working projects. So yeah. But that's definitely a question for you. Questions? And we will continue at 10:30 with an open follow-up session. So I was told that I'm in charge of this open problem. I'm in charge of this open problem session. So, what I'm looking for for people to present five-minute problems, if we limit you to five minutes or less, that's, if everybody does five minutes, we only get ten problems. So anyway, I'm going to, please, if you want to give an open problem, maybe put your name on the board during the break. And I'm going to put some names on the board for you just to make sure that we've got some problems to go. So, case, that's all. Okay, so that's not right.
