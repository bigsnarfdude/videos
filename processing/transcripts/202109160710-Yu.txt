Circular exchanges of second cultures. Please. Thank you for the introduction and my great pleasure to have a chance to share this with everyone attending this good event, which is online also in Hanzhou, I guess. And I saw a few people who Few people who were also in the online conference about four months ago, honoring Professor Orafkov's 80th birthday. And this talk will be almost exactly with that. So sorry for the repetition. Meanwhile, I also see a few names that I know in person and who is not working in synchronic calculus. So I will spend some time with preliminary backgrounds and then. Backgrounds and then talk about what is going on here. So, this is the joint work with two students, Zhu Inchu and Xui Xi Jian, also from Tsinghua University. So, let me start. Now, the outline of this talk is like this. So, first, some backgrounds about sequencing calculus. We need to fix down some terms and notations. Or in notations, and then I will talk about what do I mean by the diagonal extension and a circular extension of the sequential calculus. Now, for the second part, I'll talk about some a set of conditions under which a diagonal extension and a circular extension of the sequential calculus will be sort of equivalent with respect to proving the same set of sequence. And so we will. And so we will finish by mentioning the application and some open problems. So let's start with sequent calculus. So by the sequence, well, this is just a standard Genshin sequence. Well, the only difference is we use multi-set instead of sequence. So we don't take care of order of formers in multisets. Now, by the sequence, we... Now, by the sequence, we mean the order pair of multisets of formers, right like that. Capital Phi is the multiset, then a capital arrow, and then a capital Psi is another multiset. The first one, phi to the left of the red arrow, is sorry, to the left of the arrow is called an antecedent. And the one side to the right of the arrow is called a succeedant. We also say that Say that formulas in the antecedent occurs negatively in the sequence, and formulas in the succeeding occurs positively in a sequence. By the rule or general end-premise rule, we mean something usually written like this in a sequence calculus. So the side of the line is the name of the rule. Below the line, there is exactly There is exactly one sequence called the conclusion of that rule. And above the line, there are finitely many here, n-many sequence, each is called a premise. And so an n-premise rule can be seen as the n plus one tuple of sequence. If it happens to be the case that n equals zero, yeah, or equivalently, Yeah, or equivalently, this rule has no premise, then we also call it an axon. If the rule has the following property, we will call it a proper. The property is each premise has strictly less symbols than the conclusion, where we use the symbol comma just to divide formulas and the number. formulas and the number of occurrences for common does not count here so by uh it by strictly less symbols we mean only uh like uh uh autonomic formulas or uh or propositional connectives or modalities like uh things like that so uh here are four rules and this four rules together forms calculus code g3cp which is good for class CP, which is good for classical propositional logic. So as you can see, the two rules in the first row are both axons. And the first rule in the second line is the two primates rule. And the one at the right down corner is one primate through. So this is G3CP. as G3CP. And formal occurrences in the rule are called weak, side, pretty simple, or active, depending on their role in the rule. So for instance, in the rule RL, in the rule RL, in the conclusion below the line, there is the formula alpha implication beta, which is the formula that principally introduced. that principally introduced by this rule. And so this occurrence, alpha implies beta, is called the principal occurrence. And formulas related or correspond to the principal occurrence is called active. So here in this rule, we have alpha and beta both as active occurrences. And we may say that alpha is the negative active formula and beta is a positive active formula. is a positive actual formula because alpha is to the left of the arrow and beta is to the right. Here, pi, capital pi and capital sigma are both multi-sets of formulas. And we can see that one copy of pi occurs both in the conclusion and in the only premise. And so formulas in the capital pi is called negative side equal to the left. occurred to the left to the left side of the arrow and it occurs both in the conclusion and in the premise. So sigma is a positive set. And for this rule, L bottom, bottom is only principle is only principal occurrence. And formulas in gamma and delta are called weak because there are no corresponding occurrences in occurrences in the premise. And so in the rule Ax, gamma and delta are weak. In the L arrow, in the L implication rule, this implication is principle, often beta active, and pi and sigma aside. Sequent calculus can also help us in the research of modal logic. And here is a group of modal rules. rules. So well they each have some strange names, but in this talk we will generally be focused in two modal logics at the first. One is K4 and the other is GL. So if we extend G3CP with this rule K4 box, then the calculus with five rules in total is called G3K4, which is good. G3K4, which is good for monoloid K4. And if we take G3CP and put GL box in, then this calculus with five roots is good for the monologic GL. We can also think about the roles of formal occurrences in this modal rules. And for instance, in the K-box rule, we have we have we have positive principles box eta here negative principles box capital theta which is the set of every formula in set of being being prefixed by the box and correspondingly we have a negative active formula capital seta and the positive active formula eta and some weak formulas more interesting is is a k back through and the gl box through here in k Box through. Here in K, sorry, K4 backthrough and GL box through. Here in K4 backthrough, we can see that the negative principle box capital theta has two corresponding occurrences in its only premise. One is original form, box theta, and the other in a sort of deboxed form, just the theta here. And both theta and box theta in the and box theta in the premise are called axial corresponds to the to the negative principle. And here, the repetition or the copy or in the community of sequence calculators, we sometimes call the built-in contraction. We also call this occurrence in the color of red as cleaning occurrence. This is recorded. Cleaning occurrence. This is because this sort of building construction is first introduced by cleaning into synchronic calculus. And in the rule GL box, we can see that aside of everything we already have in K4 box, here is one extra thing. That is, the positive principle formula box eta has the negative corresponding occurrence in its only premise. And this premise. And in this corresponding occurrence in the premise, which does not respect a polarity of formula occurrences, is called a diagonal in the color of blue here. Now we talk about what do we mean by saying that one rule is the diagonalized version of another rule. So given a rule y, the diagonalized version of it, d dot y is exactly dot y is exactly y with not diagonal copy of all its positive printing counts. So for instance, a gl box is not a diagonal, is a diagonalized version of K4 box because in K4 box, the only positive printable has a negative, has no negative actual copy here. Now, in the sequent calculus, This node proof is defined as the final tree of sequent occurrences in which each node follows from all its children via the rule. So as an example, at the bottom of the slide, you can see the sequence proof in the calculator G3GL for the lob formula. And there are two applications of the keynote root GL by. Of the keynote Root JL box, one here and one about here. So, in the one below, we can see that the clinic copy here and the diagonal copy here, which is crucial, it is crucial to carry this occurrence of box P the way up in order for this premise to be proved. And we also talk about derivation in sequencing. We also talk about derivation in sequential calculus, which is a definite tree of sequential currencies in which each node that is not a hypothesis follows from all its true value rule. If two calculi G1 and G2 prove exactly in the same set of sequence, then we say that G1 and G2 are equipotent in notation like this. Now we Now, we will talk about what do we mean by the term diagonal extension. Let Gx denote the calculus gained by adding rho x into the calculus g. If it happens to be the case that gx is equipotent with g, then we say that the rho x is admissible in a calculus g. And g d dot x, which is D dot x, which is the calculus g together with the rule diagonalizer version of x. And this calculus we call the diagonal extension of g on x. So for instance, as we have mentioned a few minutes earlier, G3K4 is G3CP together with root K4 box. G3GL is G3CP together with the root GL box. With the root GL box, whereas GL box is the diagonalized version of K4 box. And so we say that G3GL is the diagonal extension of G3K4 on its K4 box. Now let's move to the notion of circular extension. So the circular extension of calculus does not introduce any new rule, but it Any new rule, but it actually enjoys an extended notion of proof. So for a calculus G, its circular extension in notation C.g employs exactly G rules and an extended notion of proof like this. So the C.G proof is still a finite tree of sequent occurrences in which each node either follows from all is true around the ruin g x. The value in G exclusively or shares the same sequence with another node on the branch it resides. So the C dot G proof can sort of be seen as an ordered pair D and B L, where D is the G derivation. That is almost the proof, but with some open assumptions, which is not axioms. And the B L is an abacklink function. is an abling function that maps those hypothesis nodes to other nodes respectively on the branch that it resides in. And it also shares the same sequence with the open hypothesis. So now let's move to the second part, equipotence. So we have just talked about what the circular extension and diagonal extension sequencing. extension and diagnostic extension on sequential calculus. And in the year of 2014, Daniel Shankanov proved a very interesting result. And in the terminology we just defined, his result can be written like this. G3GL, which is the calculator for monologue GL, is equipotent with the circular extension of G3K4, which is which is which is which is circular extension of the calculus for monologic K4. So in other words, his result can be written like this. So G3CP together with the rule K4 box is circular extension and its diagonal extension are equipotent to each other. So this is an interesting question and our motivation is try to sort is try to sort of generalize this result. Can we have some generalized more general statement like if calculus G enjoins such and such property and the keynote rule X enjoys such and such property, then the diagonal and the circle extension are equipotent to each other. And so far what we have is, I don't want Have this, I don't want to call it in a serum. I want to only call it an approximation because, as you can see, we have a lot of requirements and it does not look like a good result. But anyway, if the kingdom rule X respects sub-formula property and has exactly one positive principle formula and arbitrary weeks, by arbitrary weaks, we mean this rule has This rule has in its conclusion negative and positive weak formulas with no requirement on the number of weak formulas, with no requirement on the specific form of those weak formulas. And we also require that the rule X has all its negative principles to enjoy and cleaning copy on each premise this rule has. So the third requirement is the positive principle formula eta should feed either keynote rule X as the negative side formula on each premise or a negative principle formula. The fourth requirement is that each rule in the underground calculus G is proper and each rule in G should respect some formal property. The fifth requirement that the possible fifth requirement that the positive principle former eta of the kinode rule X should fit in each axiom of G as an active weak and also fits in each non-axiom rule in G as an active side. So our last requirement is in GX and its diagonal extension, structural rules, the cut rule, and the rule ID are all admissible, where the rule ID is we simply have the same formula to the left. the same formula to the left and to the right of the capital arrow and this is not really in the calculus because in the calculus we we require that the principal former of the rule a x should be atomic formulas not upro formers if all the six requirements are made then we can show that the self-extension and the diagram extension are equipotent so we need to take care of two directions Need to take care of two directions. For the direction from diagonal to circular, we well, it is sufficient to simply apply the strategy developed by Daniel Shikanov in his 2014 paper. Well, although that paper is based not on Gensen sequence, but Tate sequence, which is the variation of one-sided sequence. Or one side of the sequence. So there are some differences in the detail level. And the one Cath II in a year after in the census rewrite Shankarov's proof for this direction for two-sided against the cell calculus. So assume that X has this form. This form. Here we have the positive principle eta, negative principle capital Seta, positive side sigma, negative side pi, and the positive and negative weak delta and gamma. And it may have multiple premises, and each premise should have the index small i. And so capital I is a collection of all these indexes. And we have in each premise. uh we have uh in each premise uh the negative side eta positive side sigma uh negative uh negative active formula capital phi uh positive active formula posei i and also and also in a cleaning copy of natural principle uh here capital theta and so by the definition of diagonal of diagonal of diagonalized version of the rule we We know that d.x should be in this form. Everything remains the same, except that in each premise, we should have an active occurrence of its positive principle. Observe that for each index in the collection of all indexes for the premise, well, equivalently for each premise of this rule, the following rule is. the following rule is admissible in the diagonal extension. So the rule goes like this. It still has all the collection of premises like the diagonalized version of the rule X, but in the conclusion, it has the J-TH premise of the undiagonalized version of rule. diagonalized version of rule. This admissibility can be proved by the help of admissibility of the cut rule in the diagonalized calculus. Well, so we can just use the diagonalized rule here to get a positive occurrence of eta, and we then take the jth premise and to cut that to cut the occurrence. That could cut the occurrence of eta, negative eta in the jth premise with the positive printing power. And as a result, with the help of some structural rules, we will have the j's premise. So this admissibility means that once we see a diagonalized, once we see an application of DX in the proof, we can we can know that all the corresponding undiagonalized version sorry all premises in the undiagonalized version are also provable in the same calculus and which means that we can we can simply change we can simply drop off drop off from the drop off every Trop off every premise of the application of d.x and replace it by sub-proofs with calculus with calculus here and turn this application of dx to an application of x. So this can be done from bottom up. And we use what we have just mentioned to replace d.x application by x applications. And by doing so, we will get an agro. By doing so, we will get a growing in height gx fragment from the root. Well, since we do this from bottom up, from the root up, then at the root side, we will have a fragment which is growing purely in GX without the diagonalized rule. And since GX enjoys sub-formular property, on each branch that keeps growing, only finitely many formulas may finitely many formulas may occur. And for the branch that keeps growing, since the underground calculus G is proper, only in Gx, only the rule X may make copies of occurrences. And in order for the branch to go in infinitely long, that branch must pass through applications of X infinitely often. Often. Well, so in the root X, cleaning copies in X may produce multiple copies of former without reducing its complexity. So this redundant can be treated when we meet the nearest X application because we require that the rule X should have arbitrary weeks, which means arbitrary weeks, which means those redundant copies can be seen as weeks and does not go higher at the next application of X. So by doing so, we can make sure that every branch that keeps going can finally determine the cycle. And we can then, well, by cycle, we mean the same sequence occur twice in that branch. Twice in that branch. And so by chopping off higher nodes and initial those branches by backlinks, which is allowed in the circular proof, we will get an approof in the circular extension. So this is direction from diagonal to circular. And for the other direction, from circular to diagonal, what used in Shakanov's original proof uses a specific Hilbert cell axiomatization. Hilbert cell axiomatization of the logic GL. And we want to do something different. We want to achieve the same direction with pure proof transformation without referring to anything outside of the sequential calculus. So this can be done in the following way. We have some terminologies here. Terminologies here. So, given a circular proof in the circular extension, which is the derivation together with the backlink function, for each backlink from the open hypothesis, from the leaf, which is non-axim, sorry, to another node with the same sequence on its path. On its path. We call X the source and anything image under BL the target. So nodes in the domain of the backlink function are all leaves and the nodes in the range of the BL function cannot be leaves. The function BL may not be injective because two sources may share any same target. We have a branching rule in, well, there may. Well, there may be a branching rule in the calculus. And since the underground calculus G is proper, each cycle or area of sequence from B L X up to X must pass through at least one application of X in order to get the same sequence appearing on the game. And for two targets, For two targets, we write x less than y if x is not equal to y and y is in the subtree x. And we write x tree angle y if x is not y and the subtree x captures the source of y. Well, we can easily check that the less than relation is transitive and the triangle may not be transitive. not be transferred. Well, if X triangle Y, then X and Y must be comparable. And this is so because if subtree X captures the source of Y, then the target of that source must rely on the path determined by the source of Y, which must pass the target F itself. Therefore, X. As itself, therefore, x and y must be comparable. It is not hard to see that if we order all the targets by the less than relation, we will get no graph which has no cycle. But if we order it with the triangle notation, the triangle relation, we may have no graph that have cycles. Have cycles, and it's not hard to verify that once we have a cycle, there must be a cycle for once too. Finally, if so finally, if some target determines in a sub-tree that does not leak, intuitively speaking, we'll call it in a container. So formally, it goes like this. So every source uh every source uh every source that uh that uh so the target determines the sub-tree and every source in that sub-tree must point into some some node inside the tree instead of instead of pointing to a lower node so if some target determines the subtree which does not leak in that sense we'll call it a container now the general strategy is like this Now, the general strategy is like this. I will quickly go through this slide and then I will switch to another set of slides with some graphics to show the procedure. So at first, we will, for each target, copy the sub-tree to its source. And we turn all application of X. Of X in that tree by the diagonalized version simply by adding diagonal occurrences. And then we tag them all the way up as negative size or principles. And then for each sort that feed to that target, we'll find the lowest application of dx rule. And since the negative copy of the PATO principle climbs all the way up to the lowest application, we can lowest application or we can then drop off a higher node and initial and initial in g and initial in the diagonal extension by admissible rule id and if the target has multiple sources we may need a multiple round of fitting so i will i will i will stop sharing this window and switch to another window wait a minute So I think here now imagine that this large triangle represents a proof tree in the sequence calculus. And let's focus on the right part, which is the easier case. So by I thought I should put the pointer at the pan. So this is the target, and there are two sources feeding to the target. So if we draw the backlink function in this part, it will go like this. So this two source will have the same sequence. Will have the same sequence as the target. And by these two curves here, we simply mean the path determined by the two leads. And by this three notation here, one, two, and three, we mean application of the application. of the applications of the keynote rule X in this two passes. So in some passes, there are one applications, in some paths there are more, but there should be at least one since under underground calculus G is proper. And so we first feed this grain sub-tree up here. Up here and here. By doing so, these two nodes are no longer sources. They are no longer sequenced from nowhere, and they are no longer pointing to its original target. So this is no longer a target. This is no longer a source. But these two copies of the green sub-tree still have backlinks. Why here? backlink one here and the other here just as copies of the two original backlinks now we consider the we consider the path from the original target to one of its original source and as we can see there are two applications of the of the rule x now Now, change it to another color. So this is the rule X. And if we convert this to the application of DX by adding a copy of the positive principle here as an active active formula, and then this formula carries Then this formula carried all the way up because the positive principle has a form because the positive principle formula has the formula eta should fit in X as well as every rule in the underground calculator G as negative side or negative principle. So we can tag the Tag, we can tag the negative occurrence of ether all the way up to every node in the subtree, and so it climbs up, up, up, up, all the way up until it reaches here. That is not copy of the original application here. Now, in the in the I got something wrong with my hand. So now, in So now, in the conclusion of that rule, we will both have an occurrence of positive principle eta as well as another copy of eta, which is the eta we added here and climbs up. So we can then chop off the sub-tree and initial that node by the admissible ID rule in the in the Rule in the circular extension. And with the same technique, we can chop this part, which is right here. And so it goes right here and it goes right here. Now, we have numbered these three applications, one, two, and three here. Now we have one here, two here, one, two, and three here. Now, there are two sources to be to be. sources to be uh to be uh to be dealt with uh but uh in in in for for each source we will not have the same uh application of rule uh appears twice on that on that branch that is where we need to call for another round of uh another round of transformation so uh we cut we cut this part we cut this part We cut this part and feed it up here to make the repetition of the application too. And we do the same technique. We add the diagonal occurrences here and all the way up until it miss the positive one at top subtree. In this way, for the left branch, we clear all the sources. And in a similar, we can do the same for the right. For the right. So, this is the general strategy. And now, let me move to my main slide. So, if the proof is sort of simpler by means of triangle is in a sub-relation of the less than, then we can simply We can simply proceed from top down, as we just mentioned. But if the triangle has the cycle, then we need to do the other way around, proceed from bottom up until all sources of all copies of the lowest container are chopped off. Well, I think I can again move to my other slide. My other slide. Now, here we need to take care of what happens to the left. So in left, things are more complicated. We have the right source one and two both feed to target right, R3 here. So R stands for right for red. Right for red. We have R1, R2, and R3. And we also have B1, B2, two sources in the color of blue, and then B3, the target of blue. So here we can say that the red capture sources of blue and the blue captures sources of red. So we'll have a cycle of two in this graph. In order to deal with this case, we should consider the lowest container here. Now, in this example, it's a red one. So we cut a whole red sub-tree and speed it up here and here. Now, we can easily do it with some sub-tree like here. Here, so because like here and here, simply because we have reputations of applications here and here, and the reputation of our applications here and here. Now, well, just to save some space, now for the next round, still we focus on the red color. We do the similar thing. Copy this part and feed it here and copy this part and fit it here. And in this way, we can finally erase all the sources of the red in the red color, like this. Now, only blue source and targets remain. It is much more complicated compared to the orange and blue part. We have a lot of copies, but the type of backlinks are not increased. We just made multiple copies of it. The type of backlinks, backlinks type 1, backlinks type 2, are all copied here. So this is type 2, this is type 2, again, type 2. Two again, type two, type two, and here this type one. There are multiple copies, but still with the same sort of backlinks. And this is really why we need to go bottom up in order not to not make existing backlinks longer and therefore increase the number of backlinks sorts. backlink source. So in this way, we can, as in the simpler case, treated all these remaining blue backlink sort one and sort two. So let me now switch back to my main slides and finish my talk. So this is a general, this is a general strategy. And in this way, we And in this way, we verified Shankarov's result from circular to diagonal with purely proof transformation without referring to any specific property of the logic or the Hilbert cell exponentization. So finally, let me conclude my talk with application and open problem. So except Accept offering the alternative proof of Chenkanov. We also have another example, which is actually included in one of the co-authors method thesis. That is, we can use the same strategy to show that arbor features, BPL, once you take the G3 cell calculate for it and make the digolite work. For it and make the diagonalized version, it will be equipotent to calculus that is good for upper feathers FPL. So this is a keynote rule for BPL, which in our terminology is a keynote rule X. And so adding, well, if in G3CP, you take. If in G3CP, you take only the fragment with bottom conjunction and disjunction, and you erase rules for implication and take the B arrow in, you will get the calculator for BPL. And doing a diagonal extension, we'll get a calculator for FPL. In the same technique, we can show that the circular extension of G3BPL is equipotent with G3FPL. There are some open problems. are some open problems and I think the most important one is how to deal with diagonal occurrences that are more complex rather than merely the negative occurrence, sorry, the negative copy of the Polymer printing part. So for instance, how about the I put two things together. How about the keynote rule for W? Keynote rule for a WGRD, which is just here, or one keynote rule for a GRD, which is this rule without this blue occurrence of kappa theta here. And in this rule, you can see the positive principle here, boxy eta, does not directly occur as an active active, but is in a much complicated form. In a much complicated form, and this brings something quite different. Daniel Shikhanov and his co-author, Yuri Savatev, has developed some non-well-founded calculus for both GRV and WGRV. So let me move to my other slides to use the blank. To you, to use the blank to show what the room may like. So, sorry. So, what they found for the non-well-founded the non-found in the non-well-founded culture, they found for Founded copy as they found for GRV, the keynote rule is like this. We have negative print simple, positive print simple, and some necessary weaks to make it in G3 style. But there are two premises. To the left side, we have this. So everything remains the same except the absence of the modality here. Of the modality here, but to the right premise, we have this. And this is very special in terms of sequential calculus because capital gamma here and capital delta here are side in the left premise and weak sort of in the right premise. So it's hard to say what the role are those occurrences. raw are those occurrences in this rule. And again, sorry, and also in their non-well founded calculus, they also require that every infinite proof in that system, sorry, every infinite proof in that calculus, every infinite branch in a proof must pass through, must pass through the right premise of the through infinite. Premise of this rule infinitely many times instead of always going to the left. So if you look at this rule and compare this with simply the rule for K4 and the rule for GL, you will see that it seems to be far beyond our notion of circular extension and diagonal extension. And so it's still, I think we are still very far to work. Very far towards the state that can actually understand the situation. So, anyway, this is the end of my talk and here are some references. And thank you to all for attention. Thanks. Okay, thank you for your talk. Any questions? Yeah, Professor Frichtenberg.
