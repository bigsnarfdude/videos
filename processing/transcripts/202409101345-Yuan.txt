So today I would like to tell you about our actually this has already been I have already been working in this field for more than 10 years and the title is called the large scale. Of course, we need to first to see how large we can do. It's also depending on the model which is used, for example, for the tidal bounding, we can calculate Bounding, we can calculate negative billions of atoms. So, this is just around just use one node, for example. You can do actually you can do the calculations with even larger system with more computer resource. And for the density function theory, this way we work in this field about six years. And right now, we can do the calculations on the order of one. Uh, on the order of one meaning items, uh, and of course, and also for content spin system, so this is really a strongly correlated system. We can do about 40 to 48 spin one half. Of course, if you look at the numbers from the top to the bottom, it decreases, right? Actually, uh, if you calculate the dimension of the harbor space, the first two is very similar: 10 to the power nine. And And for the last one, actually, it's much larger because for one spin, if you add one spin, actually the dimension and you need to multiply a factor of two. So with 40 spin, you see it's 10 to the power 12 at night. Of course, today I will mainly focus on the first two parts. And so this is out of nine, but as I mentioned, that I will mainly focus on the second and the third part. And I also Third part, and I also give some brief outlook of what we can do next. So, first, actually, if we go back to, of course, in physics, we know that we know that more is different, right? So, actually, first of all, there are many problems you need to consider a very nice system, like the defects, like disorder, especially if you consider the content interference, which is related to this kind of structures, like the transports. You have to consider. Transports. You have to consider very large sample. And if you go back to the textbook, normally when we do the calculations, we build a Hamiltonian, right? And then you make the diagonalization to get the eigenstates. If you get all the eigenstates, then you can calculate everything. So that is a standaway. But because you need to do a diagonalization, we know that that means that the scale will be the n to the power 3, where n is a dimension of the matrix. Dimension of the matrix, which means that if the system is, although this is a kind of easy problem in computational fix, but still with this scaling, if the system is too large, you cannot do diagonalization, then you cannot do further calculations. Actually, for us, we approach this in a different way. We solve instead of time independent shading equation, we would like to solve time-dependent shading equation. The advantage is that because to solve the equation, we The advantage is that because to solve that, there's different ways to solve the time demonstrating equation numerically. Then you have two say emissions. First is that you would like to reduce the scanning to the order of N3 to some other number, if two or one, right? One, that will be linear scanning. That will be perfect. Another thing is that so the second equation will describe. The second equation will describe how the wave equation changes according to time. But what we want to know is like the physical property of the verses. So there are many properties that we would like to extract from this wave propagation. So this somehow is the two missions, two tasks that we need to find the solution. So for the first one, actually for the wave propagation, as I mentioned, there are different ways. The basic idea is that The basic idea is that you need to find a way to now what you see here: that you have this time unit operator, right? Actually, there are different ways to decompose this numerically. And according to the property of the system, for example, for us, because we are mainly focused on the single particle approximation, then it is very convenient to use so-called chip chip polynomial algorithm. You just for this time. you just for this time your initial operator which is very similar from here you use the baseline function and the chip polynomials to to approximate this time your initial operator of course this is exact if you make the sum to infinity but actually using the property of the Bister function giving a time step you can always have a cut off the this decomposition such that with some final sum you can approach to the precision of the machine. To the precision of the machine, so it's very that will be very accurate. So, this action is also called the unconditional stable algorithm because the accuracy of this method is independent on the time step. If you have larger time steps, then you have more numbers in the decomposition. And in this way, actually, you have this recursive relations. You say, here, basically, all the calculations based on the Hamiltonian metric. Is based on the Hamiltonian matrix applied to a wave function. And in single-particle approximation, the matrix is a sparse matrix. In this way, the calculations will be linear proportional to the size of the system. So the memory cost and also the CPU time will be, they are both nearly to the dimension of the system. In this way, you solve the first problem. Instead of order three, you have the order one. Three, you have the order one, so now you have a linear scaling method. Um, in this way, then, because you can simulate the propagation of the wave, then you can extract the transmission, for example, transmission coefficients. And I do not want to go to the detail, but this is a very famous so-called clinton in graphene, right? So, you have a potential, but because for the non-energy part of the electrons or holes in graphene can be described. Graphene can be described by so-called Dirac equation, although there you use a piano spin, but you can have the perfect transmission if you have a normal incidence. And actually, this you can solve for analytically, which is giving you this red curve. You can also do this numerically, use this propagation idea, then you can get these dots. So you say for the transmission, you can get this kind of results. Of course, this is a direct application of propagation. The application of propagation, but we want to go beyond that. So I will use the telebounding as an example to show how we calculate the other properties. For example, now you can solve the problem of propagation. Then you can combine some other methods like the Fourier transform, which is very basic technique. And another is like the linear response theory or the Cooper formula. And in this way, you can calculate many other properties. So this includes like electron. So this includes electronic property, optical property, transport property, or plus molecular properties. Yes, many properties that you can calculate. And I want to emphasize that here we do not do any diagram because we avoid the diagram. That's why within the tight boundary model, just use one node that you can calculate the meaning of items. And I will show a few examples. Of course, the main idea behind this is that at the very beginning, you This is that at the very beginning, you prepare a rounded state. This is the round state in real space, and then you just let the states evolve according to time. What you say is the change of amplitude, right? So what you can see is a completely just a kind of loss, right? But actually, the information of the Hamiltonian has already been included in this evolution. So if you have one Hamiltonian, then you will have exactly the evolution of the The evolution of a given initial state. So you just need to find a way to extract the information which you want from this picture. And for example, so this is a calculation of density states. This is this actually is giving, I want to have the number of the states giving energy, right? This is a mathematical definition. And what you can do is that initially prepare random states. And then you calculate the states and then you calculate the time evolution and each time step you calculate this correlation and finally do a Fourier transform then you can prove that with the increase of the dimension of the harbor space or increase of the number of sites then this will approach to the density of space of course for final system you can add more rounded numbers to to improve accuracy we do this can be approved mathematically but we do not Mathematically, but we do not want to do it right now. We can just compare the results, numeric results. So, this is a very famous picture of the denser status of graphene, and which actually can be calculated analytically. I will give it by the red curve. And here, this is the size of the system, which we do the calculation. As you can see, that if you increase the size of the system, you will get a better result. So, this is the first property of all the methods, not only for the methods not not only for denser state but also for the other properties so neither is better right neither is better second is that when you do the calculation we just use one initial run state and from the picture you can see that only one initial state actually contains everything right especially if the system is larger so it contains all the eigenstates otherwise you cannot get this results and the last one is that we calculate the density which belongs to The denser state, which belongs to the electronic property, but we do not have any information of each individual agent state. So, this is very similar as in the experiment. When you do the experiment, you want to measure something, right? But you do not measure the wave function. You measure the physical properties, some observers, and this is the same idea. We do not, if you want to calculate the property, you do not need the v function. So, this is like these three properties. Property is nigger is better when it is enough, another is that calculated property without aging states. So, this is the three property of all the calcinations. I also would like to, so of course, with the tight bounding model, it's very easy to add a magnetic field by power substitution. Then you can see the number levels. And there's another property which is called the quadratic state, which we introduced. Actually, this state is introduced. Actually, this state is introduced to calculate our very beginning to calculate the transport property. Actually, right now we found this is also very useful property. For example, as you see here, now this is also a very simple structure of graphing, right? I just remove one item. Then if you calculate density states, you will see that there will be a mid-gap state because now you break the subnature symmetry. And if you do a diagonal, And if you do the diagonalization, you found that this will be the distribution of these aging states, like in this way. Then we want to ask: is it possible to get the information of the amplitude without diagnosis? Actually, this can be. You can do instead of previous photonic states, is the Fourier transform of the correlation. Now, you do the Fourier transform of the state at different time. And here, this E, if you put the E as the energy which you want. The E as the energy which you want to calculate. So, for example, here E equals zero, then you can get the so-called quasi-eating state. So, this is I initially prepare random states, right? And then do the calculation. As you see, the amplitude change according to time. You cannot get too much information from this picture. But if I do the Fourier transform of the state at different time, you can see that finally the states will approach to the one from the diagonalization. From the diagnosis, right? So you can also actually get the information of the Aigen state. Of course, here I saw it, I call it called the Eigen state because sometimes at one energy, there will be not just one state. Then what you can get will be the superposition of those eigenstates. That's why I call it as a quadratic state. As I mentioned, that this state actually is related to the experiment they do. Next, in the experiment, they do the experiment of next year. What do you see? It's an STM image. So, this actually is exactly the information which you can get from this so-called quadratic state. The NAPTA is experimental radio simulation. I would say it's matched reasonably well. I do not want to go to details. And this is the polarization function. Polarization function will describe how the response of the electron distribution to extend the field. From this, you can also. In the field. From this, you can also calculate the dielectric function. And what you can do is that instead of a stand textbook formula, we use this one. And here, this is the same as when you do the calculation of the denser states. It's also random state. And here, you have a Fermi distribution. So, one side you will have occupied state, and the other side you will have unoccupied state, and you will have the time you. And you will have the time evolution of both states, and then you calculate the correlation and then do the Fourier transform. You can get the polarization function. Of course, we need to prove that it is correct. Then, so this is also, I use the simple graphing model, which can the polarizing calculation can be calculated by the Lin-Haad function to the Fourier transform. Do the integration over the Bernism. Over the brainism. And numerically, we also use the so-called television propagation method. Then, actually, with different Q or at different mu, you say they match quite well. So, this is direct proof that the method works. And you can also calculate the optical conductivity. The formula action is very similar as the previous one. And the main difference right now, you have the current density operator instead of charge density operator. And you can also calculate the transport property. And here, this. Property and here, this actually is the quadratic in state, which I just described in previous slides. And so, this is a kind of benchmark to say if you do the diagonalization, and if you all you can do the tight bounding propagation. So, this is a calculation with just one node. And what you say is that if you do a diagram per sum, next this is about 10,000. You can, the memory, you cannot, and I think here is about 200. I think here is about 256 gigabit. So you will stop here, but with the propagation, you say you can go to the billions of items, it's just with one note. And so this is a time because both of them actually the memory and the time, they are scaled linearly. And so basically, what you see is that instead of order three, we have the order one. So this is a package which So, this is the package which we developed, and this is also open source. If you like, you can try. And those include the calculations of all the parameters listed here. Of course, we also add the other functions, also other methods. And there's also interface to other programs. Next year, this is one year 19 because in many situations, Because in many situations, especially if you want to consider the relaxation of the structure or the effect of temperature, you need to first do the molecular dynamics simulation. And then from the structure, you generate the tight boundary model. And then you do the further calculations. So this is for the NAMPS. So this is Vanya 90. If you do DFT, get Vanier 90 type boundary model, then you can direct me. import to our code to do the largest scale calculation. And so this is the works which we have been say in the last past less than 10 years, we use our package to do the calculations mainly focus on like the more supernatural quadratic crystal factor and two-dimensional crystals. And as I mentioned, that because here, when you do the calculation, you do not need to consider the symmetry. You can add whatever, what different kinds of disorder in the system. So there's no like different boundary conditions, different structures. Of course, here, what I need is many two-dimensional structure, but it also works in three-dimensional, one-dimensional. It doesn't matter. And so, this is a work we collaborated with Anik Bernung group last year to. Expert group last year to use the TB to do the calculations with very nice supercell. I do not want to go to the details. And so this is another thing which I want to mention that in our calculations, we need to first have a homotonium, right? But in many situations, it's very difficult to build a homotonic, especially if the system is very large, if there's a disorders. So there's a package called the DPDB. There's a package called the Deep DB. What they do is that they first do the DFD cognitions and train the neural network so that they can predict a homotonium, a tight-bound homotonium of a given structure, a very large structure. And then they, because when you have this homotonium, you have to also think about what you can do with this harmonic. For example, what they consider here is also one billion items. Billion items, but actually here because the Hoppins is not like the new rest neighbor, it's a very non-range Hoppins. And they, when they have this kind of Hamiltonian, they also want to calculate the physical property, but the Hamiltonian is very much. Then you need to have some way to avoid the diagram, right? That's why they use our package. What you see here, like the temperature depends. You see here, like the temperature-dependent densal states, and some other properties. They use our package to do the calculations once they have the tidal homotonium. So for the density functionary part is that because, as I mentioned, that for the tidal bounding, actually, in many situations to get a tight bounding model is very difficult. Right now, they have this deep DB, but I think that in many situations it's not. That in many situations is not enough. That's why we think about it's possible to do DFT cognitions also using the idea of wave propagation. We have tried many years and finally found the solution. So this is a standard way to calculate the like here. You need to solve this KS equation, right? And what you can do, of course, I do not want. Can do, of course, I would do not want to explain all the terms here. I think most of you are very familiar with them, but you need to solve two problems. First, you need to find accurately where is the feminine, right? Another is that once you have the feminine level, in traditional way, you do a diagonalization to find all occupied states, and then you make the sum of the amplitude, and then you find the chart density. Of course, you need to do this safe consistently. You need to do many diagonalization, right? If you look at those two quantities, actually, the Feminine level can be obtained by the integration of denser states. So, if you at the very beginning, you assume a Hamiltonian or you assume a child density, you build a Hamiltonian, then you can calculate the density states using the propagation method, and then use the number of the electron, you can determine the feminine app. So, actually, the first, this one has been already solved. The most important thing is the second one, right? So, previous week. So, previous, we can calculate the global property. Also, we can also calculate the local property, but associated with one, with the state with just one energy. Of course, you can also calculate all the occupied states by using the quadratic state, but that will cost a lot of memory. Then we found that actually numerically, mathematically, you can prove that this quantity can be expressed in this way. You have initially. Way you have initially around the states, you apply a free mediocre distribution, then you can have you will have only the occupied states. And here you can also introduce temperature. And then you do the time evolution at a different time step. You make the sum of the wave function amplitude. You can prove that if the system increase, the size increase, then this will approach to this one. And the accuracy is nearly proportionally to the y. Nearly proportionally to the one over square root of number of electrons. This can be proved analytically. And so, this is the comparison of different approaches. So, this is a standard way which you need to do taglization. So, this is the way you do not do the technology. Instead, you do the wave propagation. And I will show you some examples. For example, very beginning, we just use the atoms and molecular to show that this works. And then we consider the crystal. Then we consider the crystal. So this is about 10,000 atoms. And what you see is that both the cost of the memory and the time are linearly proportional to the number of atoms or the number of electrons. And we also can compare the results with WASP, with also the diagramization, which is just within our codes. We have the method. Codes, we have the method with diagonalization or propagation. You say they match quite well. And also, if we increase the number of the atoms, as I mentioned before, you can get better results. Of course, so this is arrow per electron. If you increase the number of the electrons, you see the result will be better if the other setting are the same. So this is to show the arrow which. To say, to show the arrow, which is as I mentioned, is the proportional to one over the number of electrons. And of course, for final system, if you want to increase the accuracy, you can also add more random states to make the average. So then the arrow is proportional to one over square root of s, where s is the number of the wrong states. And so this is a convolution if you do a diagonalization and the And the propagation. I think, so if every other setting parameter is the same, then around 1,000 electrons propagation will be faster. If the system is small, then it is much better to use the traditional way. Of course, right now you can get with the propagation, you can get the ground state electron density, which means that you get the Hamiltonian. That you get the Hamiltonian, then you can also use the idea of propagation to calculate other properties because right now the system is very large, right? Now you have the Hamiltonian, but still you cannot use the traditional way with diagram to calculate other properties. Then we can use the methods which we developed within the tight boundary model, which you can just use directing here to calculate other properties. Of course, you can also extend the method to many other. Then the method to many other cognitions, as you can see here, there are many things that we would like to do in the following years. And I will just show, for example, we can also calculate the atomic force, which is say it's very important to do the relaxation or the molecular dynamics simulation. And also, if you introduce the propagation, the occurrence will be better. The occurrence will be better. And we can also combine the machine learning because the advantage of machine learning here is that, as I mentioned, that in order to get the ground state, you need to do the safe consistent calculation. But if at the very beginning, you can have a very good initial charge density, right? Then you can reduce the number of the iteration. And this can be. And this can be say, as you can see here, we can train the neural network to use the, if you, because right now we use the real space grids as the basis, where giving a point in the space, then you can see the environment, the distribution of the atoms. And then from that, you can predict what would be the electron density. And you say, And you see, of course, this is some result which we obtained before. Actually, right now, the result is even better. So this is without machine learning. And this is with machine learning, you say. If the neural net work is very good, then you do not need to do the safe consistent calculation. You can just check whether it's good or not. Then you can do the following calculation. Can do the following calculation. So, this is way, we say this is a calculation with one meaning atoms, and we just use AT CPUs to do the, you say, of course, here we just consider a perfect crystal. That is why we can use also vast above course, for example, here to calculate this state, right? We can also use one million items to do the calculation. Of course, here. Of course, here, this is just to show that it works, right? But if you consider, for example, temperature, then the structure will be different, but then with what we cannot do. But that, then we can do the other calculations. I do not show some other results, but so for us, we would like to develop this simulation package and hopefully it can be applied. And hopefully, it can be applied in different subjects: physics, chemistry, biology, and material science. For the quantum space system, also it's also related to quantum computer. I do not want to discuss them, but I just want to mention that over there, the main challenge is that if you have n spin one half, the dimensional hardware space will be two to power n. So it increases. That's why for those kinds of strong credit systems, it's really a hard problem. Okay. But nevertheless, many methods which I introduced before can be applied in there. And so this is, we can also, like, for example, in the tidal boundary model here, we can also introduce how about U, right? Use, for example, here, just to show that with the mean failure theory, you can. With the mean field theory, you can also get the results of this degradation without degradation. Use the way of propagation, you can get similar results. And another system is called the following. Actually, in many situations, the following calculation is even more difficult. And here, I just want to show you that. So, this is the following spectrum. One is from the diagonalization, another is from propagation. Propagation. It also works because, in principle, what you want to calculate is also the property of a matrix. So, the matrix could be the harmonic of electron, but it also could be a property of the photon. So, this is with even larger system. And the important thing is that we can somehow now we can consider electron and forlon. We want to, in future, if possible, to consider. Are possible to consider them at the same time, and then we can think about the superconductivity. And that I would like to thank many of my collaborators and the group members and the fundings. Okay, thank you.
