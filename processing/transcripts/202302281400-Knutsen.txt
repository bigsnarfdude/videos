Anyway, we're happy to have Andreas Knutson speaking about civili varieties on ranking surfaces. So, go ahead. Thank you very much. First of all, thanks to the organizers for inviting me. I'm really happy to be here. It's my first time in Banff and even my first time in Canada. So, I will talk about cerebral varieties on North Enric's surfaces and Surfaces and well, K3 surfaces will show up pretty quickly actually. Let me this is joint work with Chile, Didieux and Galati. So let me fix some notation. So S will be a smooth projective surface and just to be safe, it will be over the complex numbers, but a lot of things will be valid in general. To be valid in general. And then we take L, a line bundle. Just tell me if I write too small, if I write ugly, I'm sorry, I cannot do anything about it. Line bundle such that the complete linear system L contains integral curves, because otherwise the question is not interesting. So integral curves. And then in this case, we can define the severe varieties, and they will be V L and then you can either fix the geometric genus or the nodes. So let me just fix the genus, it's easier for the talk. So this will be the variety of curves. Of curves, parametrizing curves in the linear system such that C is integral and nodal, so only nodes as singularities of genus G. Okay? And of course, nodal of genus G means that it has PA. PA of L, so this would be the arithmetic genus of the line bundle L, meaning the arithmetic genus of all the curves in the linear system minus G nodes. So it will be PAL minus G nodal curve. And this is a locally closed sub-variety inside here. And then we can also look at, if one wants to, the same variety, but without imposing conditions on the singularity. So we call this V bar, but it's not necessarily the closure. And this will be, well, the locus of curves such that C is integral of genus G, so not necessarily normal. And let me just write the expected dimension of these guys. So x them of V G L and also of V bar, G L. That's simply the dimension of the linear, the complete linear system L minus one condition for each node. And the nodes are P A of L minus G. of L minus G. So this will be minus P A of L minus G. This is the expected dimension of these several varieties, meaning that if they are not empty, the dimension is at least this number. And these varieties were introduced by Severi in the twenties, so Severi varieties. In the case where S is the plane, and in that case, he and Joe Harris basically proved everything there is to know. So, in the case of plane curves, these varieties are always, no matter which linear system you take, these varieties are always non-empty, smooth, of the expected dimension, and they are even irreducible. That was proved by. Irreducible, that was proved by Joe Harris, stay claimed by Severi and proved by Joe Harris, and this guy is in fact the closure of this guy. So this means when this is the closure of this, it means that any integral curve of genus G can be deformed to a nodal curve of genus G. This is the meaning of this being the closure of this one. So in the plane, everything is Is known. And well, later people started studying other surfaces. And of course, the PEXO surfaces were studied. Basically, the results are pretty much the same in the case of the PEXO surfaces, also certain rational surfaces. And then, as it happens, always, the next step is always K3 surfaces. So, what is known in the case of S K3 surfaces? So, let me K3 surfaces, so let me just write it here. Known for S equal F K3 surface. Well, then it is known it is known that if these varieties are non-empty, so if V If V G L is non-empty, then it is always all components are smooth of the expected dimension. And the expected dimension is, well, the dimension of the linear system is always actually the arithmetic genus of the linear system. So then we see that we get Get the expected dimension is G. So this is pretty easy to prove. And then it is known that if T G L is non-empty, then T G prime L is also non-empty for all G primes larger than or equal to G. Of course, this. equal to g. Of course, this here makes sense for genera, of course, from zero and until the arithmetic genus of the clouds. This is always a limitation on the genus. So this result here says that the nodes can be smoothed independently, right? Because the larger the genus is, the fewer the notes. The fewer the notes are, and this means that any time you have a curve in Ono K3 surface with a certain number of notes, you can always deform the notes one by one and lose them one by one. So this is why all these other salary varieties of higher genera are non-empty once you prove that they are non-empty for a fixed genus. So, this is known for any K3. For any K3, and what is known on a general K3? So known, yep. Are these actually non-empty wherever one expects them to be? Yeah, exactly. That comes now. So known for, and now the problem is, of course, for general pairs, S L in the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces. And here one needs L2. And here one needs L to be primitive or indivisible. Indivisible. Okay, so these form a nine, there is a 19-dimensional moduli space of these gadgets. And in this case, it is known that non-emptiness is known whenever one always, basically. So V G and also for all multiples of Of the linear system L. These guys are non-empty for all genera from zero and until the genus of the arithmetic genus of ML. And so this holds for all m's in C plus. And this was proved by Mumford in the case M equals 1. M equals one by degenerating or specializing the surface to a Kumo surface where we explicitly constructed rational curves because by this result here it is sufficient to prove the result for rational curves. And then Chen proved it for all m's by degenerating the k3 surface to a union of two rational normal squares. Then it is also known that in the primitive case of when m is equal to 1, then the closure of the G L is in fact the bar G L. Okay, and this was proved again by Cheney. So this means that any Any curve of integral curve of genus G can be deformed to a nodal curve within of genus G within its linear system on the K3 surface for the general such pair SL. Then Chen also proved the following interesting result: that in the case of genus zero, phi bar zero, so the locus of integral rational curves, is in fact equal to Curves is in fact equal to the locus of nodal rational curves. So all rational curves are nodal, and this was proved by Chen. And in particular, this implies, and this also shows why one was interested in this question, this implies that the number of, so this is zero dimensional, right? Because expected dimension is the components are of expected dimension. R of its vector dimension, which is zero. So you can count them, and the number inside here is then equal to, so it's given by the formula of Yarzar's law that was proved using methods from physics. And Boville then actually proved, so I should probably also write Boville here, proved it mathematically. So this is a formula that counts all terms. A formula that counts all curves with the multiplicity that is precisely one in the case of nodal curves and with a multiplicity higher than one if the curves are not nodal. So the fact that all the curves are nodal proved that in fact this number counts precisely the number of rational curves. And finally a very recent and fantastic result actually is the following. Is the following. It's the irreducibility. So V G L is in fact irreducible, like in the case of plane curves, for all genus, genera bigger than or equal to four, and it is connected for all genera bigger than or equal to one. Of course, in the case of genus zero, it's a finite number of points, so it's not connected. But otherwise, it is always connected and even irreducible when the genus is bigger than or equal to 4. And this was proved recently by Gumuno and Lely Kiesa. Okay, so this is basically everything that is well, there is one more result that I wanted to say, but for the moment this is what is known about. What is known about severe varieties on K3 surfaces today? So, exciting open problems, just in case you want to do something else than bowling. This is no bowling score, curling, whatever. It's something Norway won the gold medal. I'm still gently, sorry. Open problems is problems is here so this is open for m larger than one which is an important problem because then if all curves are nodal in the multiples of this primitive linear system then again this bovilia formula would count the number of curves and of course this question here is open irreducibility Irreducibility for G bigger than or equal to one or from for g between one and three is still open. So for this is still an open question. Anyway, so the point here is that for general pairs, one knows what goes on. And if you specialize on the other hand to particular K3 surfaces, Hand to particular K3 surfaces, then these heavily varieties here, where the curves don't vanish, of course, because when you specialize, the curves survive, but they could break into, they could become reducible. So in theory, these severe varieties could basically become all empty except for some curves of very low genus. And in the case of rational curves, from these results, so From these results, so you know that on a general K3 surface, in all linear systems and multiples of the generating of the primitive linear system, there are finitely many rational curves. When you specialize the surface, in theory, they could all become a multiple of a single rational curves. Just from these results, you cannot avoid that. Luckily, recently, Chen, who Fairly recently, Chen Hoodenazen Littke proved that this is not the case, so that there are actually infinitely many rational curves in the following way. So, also known Known on any K3S that for any genus bigger than or equal to zero, there exists a sequence of curves, so a sequence of integral curves, so reduced and irreducible of Of genus G such that the degree is unbounded with respect to any ample divisor H. So this means that it cannot happen, for instance, that all rational curves when you specialize with any K3 surface all become multiples of finitely many magnitudes. Of finitely many rational proofs. And in fact, and this is Chen, Gunelas, and Littke. And in fact, Chen and Gunnellas also proved that Cn squared goes to infinity, which means that the arithmetic genus of the curves goes to infinity. If the genus is bigger than or equal to one, this was Chen and Shen and Hunelas, or if the genus is equal to zero and S is elliptic. And this is a result of recent result of Baltes, a PhD student of Unelas. So did you say all K3s or alternate K3s? All K3s, all K3s. Yes, on any K3. On any K3 and any genus, there is this sequence of curves. So, in particular, any K3 surface contains rational curves of unbounded degree. Okay, so this tells us that somehow not all these several varieties, when you specialize to special K3 surfaces, vanish or Vanish, or how to say these infinitely many of these survive, but if you give me any particular K3 surface and any particular linear system on that K3 surface, this result doesn't tell me if there are nodal curves or if there are irreducible curves of specific genera in that linear system. It just tells me that there are some infinitely many linear systems with With curves of genus G in them, and it also doesn't tell me whether the curves are long or not. And so, back to the study of severe varieties, as I said, they were studied in the case of the plane, in the case of the pencil surfaces, in the case of K3 surfaces, and otherwise they have been studied in the case of abelian surfaces, where basically a result similar to this pulse. So, they are always in the general. On the general polarized abelian surface, all these guys are non-empty of the expected dimension for genus bigger than or equal to two, of course, because in general there are no rational or elliptic curves on abedian surfaces. So the next case we wanted to study was the case of Enrica surfaces. So I guess an Enrica surface S then weaker surface, and of course, in this case, we have the K3 double cover. And we wanted to ask the question, given an L on this Enrica surface, can we say something about the severe varieties in this case? And of course, from these results on K3 surfaces, since these are special K3 surfaces, one cannot actually. Surfaces, one cannot actually say very much except that one expects certain severe varieties or the ones with the bars, so the ones parametrizing integral curves, to be non-empty because there are such curves on K3 surfaces. But in general, this result here doesn't tell you anything if you fix one particular line bundle. So I wanted to. So I wanted to tell you about our results in this case. So the first result is a result concerning, well, if severe varieties are non-empty, what can we say about the dimension and of the smoothness of these components? proposition, so first result which is actually not, I mean it's basically an observation. So for S an Enrique surface, any Enrique surface, then we have the following. So if we have a non-empty component V, Non-empty component V inside some VGL, so V and irreducible component. Then V is automatically smooth and two cases occurs. And either I forgot to say, in the case of an weakest surface, one can prove that the expected One can prove that the expected dimension of any Sevelli variety is one less than in the case of K3 surfaces. So it's G minus one. Basically, because the dimension of the linear system is the arithmetic genus of L minus one compared to the K3 surface case where it is the arithmetic genus of L. So this is why the dimension drops. Drops by one. So this is the expected dimension. And either, okay, so we have two cases. One case is that the dimension of B is actually one more than the expected dimension. And in this case, if we look at the K3 double cover, then pi inverse of C. Of C splits into two components, so is equal to two components for all curves C parametrized by this irreducible component. And this means that if we make a picture of the curve, so if we have, for instance, a curve on, so here we have S and here we have the K. And here we have the K3 double cover pi, and we have, for instance, here a two nodal curve. Then this is an atal double cover, so the number of nodes must be four, but the curve splits into two parts, so the picture could be something like this. So here the inverse image of a node could be a node on one of the irreducible components or it could be an intersection between two curves. And of course these two curves are conjugated by the involution on the kit, by the Enrique's involution. By the Enricus involution on the K3 surface. Can we say why that splits into two components? Yeah, you restrict, you look at the canonical bundle, restrict it to the... So the two-to-one double cover is given by KS. You restrict it to the curve, take the pullback to the normalization of the curve, and then it depends whether that is trivial or not. Trivial or not on the normalization of the curve, whether the curve splits into two parts or not. So sorry, I misunderstood your statement. I thought you said it always. No, no, no, no. That's an either, this case, either it splits or it doesn't. So it's actually very, it's very not completely trivial, but it's completely expected statement. Okay, so this is this first case, or Or the dimension is g minus 1, the expected one, and pi inverse of c is irreducible for all c's in b. So of course in this case the picture is two notes above every node and okay let me Okay, let me get it right so here, and then we have something like this and reduce a curve with two notes about every note. And of course, well, in this case here, these two curves are live, they're the surveillance varieties of the K3. Therefore, the Sevelli varieties on the K3 surface, so therefore they live in families of dimension G, and this is why we have a dimension that is too big on the Enrica surface. Whereas here, these curves live in the expected dimension on S and they are not the general members of the severity variety on the K3 surface. And then we prove, in fact, that Then we prove, in fact, that this uppercase is pretty rare to a certain extent, because if S is general, then this implies that L is too divisible in num S. Too divisible, of course, in numS. So it's um yeah it's not obvious, but it's um it's the computation. It's the computation. So, somehow, this case here doesn't occur so often in the case on the general surface. Because when S is general, these two curves lie in the same linear system. And this is what we use to prove this. Otherwise, it's not at least clear to us why. At least clear to us why. If these two curves are not linearly equivalent, which could happen if S is not a general and weakest surface, then we cannot prove this. But it could be perhaps true in general. So these two cases, we call them regular and non-regular. So this is a regular component. Component because it has the expected dimension, and this we call a non-regular component because it has dimension one more. And in both cases, we prove that the nodes smooth independently. So, let me write it here. So So note the existence of a component of one of the two types, so of a regular, respectively non-regular component for some fixed genus. Some fixed genus G implies the existence of regular, respectively non-regular component for all genera G prime bigger than meter to G. So again, this means that the nodes can be smoothed independently. Can be smoothed independently. Once we have a component of one type, we can smooth one by one the nodes and get non-emptiness of several varieties of curves of higher gender. What happened to the K3 upstairs? Well, the K3 upstairs, well, it's well here you have several varieties with twice as many nodes, and well, you can compute the arithmetic gene. The arithmetic genus of the linear system, if you want to. And here you would have curves that have the same geometric genus because this map is birational. So to a certain extent, it also proves... I mean, this is just... It's not an existent result. So in any case, this doesn't prove anything. But in this case, these curves come from, are the images of the curves The images of the curves on a Cevelli variety and in a K3 surface. And in this case, they are the images of the co-dimension one family of curves in a Cevelli variety on the K3 surface because the dimension is one less than the dimension of the Cevelli variety on the K3 surface. You see, you cannot use very much K3 surfaces to get the result on a VK3 surface. No, no, we thought somehow about it, but no, because on K3 case, it's Because on K3K, nothing is known basically, except that there are a lot of curves. But apart from that, nothing is known about several special LK3 surfaces. So I wanted now to tell you about the existence of these doubts that we have, which settles the lower case, so the case of a regular component. So existence theorem so contrary to the K3 case where the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces of the fixed gene K3 surfaces of the fixed genus has one component. In the Enrique's case, there are very many components. So let me, let us fix, let us call it EP, the moduli space of pairs SL such that S is an Enricke surface. And N has arithmetic genus P, so this means that L squared is 2p minus 2. And inside here, we can define EP2, which is the case of two-divisible pairs. So this is sublocus of pairs such that N is two divisible in num S. So we have to take out these components and then And then if we take S L general in any component of EP minus these two divisible pairs that we, well, the proof doesn't work actually, but it could the result could still be true in that case. And in fact, And in fact, PGL is non-empty and has a regular component. So meaning that it's one of the dimension G minus one for all possible genera. So this means from G minus one and until And until the genus of the linear system. So we have non-emptiness of all possible several varieties of nodal curves. And yeah, let me... And in this case, we cannot, at the moment, we cannot say anything whether there are non-empty components also in the case of in the non-regular. Of the in the non-regular case. We would expect that there are, I mean, since there are rational curves on the K3 surface, we would expect that this is somehow non-empty in a lot of cases. Of course, they could be non-nodal. This is the problem, which means that they would lie in the non-emptiness would be valid for V bar and not for V G L. So, um good questions so far? Good questions so far? Okay, so let me say a few words about the proof, so idea of the proof. So by this remark here, by this node, so let me call it star, it suffices to treat suffices. Suffices to consider the case of lowest possible genus. So this means the case of genus equals one, because once we have the existence of a regular component of genus one, then we have also the existence of regular components of all higher genera. And the idea of the proof is the following. We first generate Following, we first generate the Enrique surface, so we find a suitable flat family. So find a flat family, well let me call it curly S to D, the disc, unit disk. Let me call it well F not to use the same letter as the cake free cover. As the cake could free cover, like this, such that an F inverse of T, which I call S T, is a smooth and weaker surface for T different from zero and F inverse of the special point, the O zero, is S naught. S is a reducible surface, which I will come to. So it's a reducible simple normal crossing surface consisting of two components. I will come back to what those two components are. And the second step is to identify limits of nine bundles. So identify limits and not of of L for all components of all components in the moduli stasis EP minus this EP2. As I said, there are many components and we have to identify in all these cases suitable limits. And then the third part is to construct find the curves. In the linear system L0 on S naught, the special surface that deform to nodal elliptic curves. Nodal elliptic curves in the linear system L on a general S. S if you want to on an S T for T different from zero and let me say a little bit about point one which is perhaps the most interesting one so which are which are the candidates which are the surfaces S naught well we start with E a smooth elliptic curve And let us denote by plus the boot operation on the elliptic curve. And then we can consider the symmetric product sym2 of E with the natural projection map to E, which takes a point here which is of the form x plus y and it sends it to the sum with the group operation on. With the group operation on E. Inside here, we have an elliptic curve T, which is the set of all points of the form X plus X plus, as a group operation, eta, where X varies on E, and eta is any non-zero two-torsion point. Or 02 torsion. So there are three possibilities. So we can pick any of them. And then we have this curve here. And this is a curve that covers E2 to 1. And the special feature with this T, as one can compute, is that T is not anti-canonical. So let me call this surface R. T is not anti-canonical, but anti-canonical but 2t is bi-anti-canonical and this one can compute then we can take this t and embed it into p2 as the smooth cubic and then one can choose x one to x nine on t such that Such that the sum of these points lie in the following linear system: the tensor product of the normal bundle in these two embeddings. So it's the normal bundle of T in R tensor the normal bundle of T in P2. So one picks a general divisor in this complete linear system, and then one blows up the two surfaces. In these points, so our twiddle to R, it's the blow-up at, well, x1 to xn, where we fix some integer n between 0. n between 0 and 9, so it could be an empty blow-up if one wants to. And then p twiddle to p2, it's the blow-up at the residual points, so at xn plus 1 to x9. And then we let t be still be the strict, denote by t the strict transform of Transform of T in P twiddle and R twiddle, and then we can glue these two surfaces along T. So we take R twiddle union along T twiddle. So this will be the correct candidate and this will in fact deform to a smooth and weakened surface. Yeah, of course here this smooth cubic is anti-canonical in P2, so T is minus K of P2. So basically the fact that it's anti-canonical on one of them and bi-anticanomical but not anti-canonical on the other one is what makes it an Enrico. Is what makes it an Enricus, a limit of an Enricus surface. And why do we blow up these points here? Well, we blow up these points because this makes the first cotangent sheaf, so T1S0. So if you don't know so much about the deformation theory, you shouldn't care so much about this. But this guy here can be computed. This is in a paper. This is in a paper by Friedman. This is in fact the normal bundle of T in one surface, so the blown-up surface tensor, the normal bundle of T in the other surface. And since we have chosen these points in here, when we blow up, this in fact becomes trivial. And this is what makes the surface difficult. This is what makes the surface deform to a smooth Enricus surface. So, this is basically standard deformation thing. So, here we have candidates. Well, here we have limit Enrique's surfaces. And if you count parameters here, you get, so what are the choices here? So, this is a digression, but kind of interesting. You have one parameter for the choice of the elliptic curve, one for the choice of the One for the choice of a G23 on T, which embeds it into T2, so that makes two parameters. Then you have to withdraw the automorphisms of E or T, so you're back to one. And then you have eight parameters because this guy here is a P8. It's a divisor of degree nine on an elliptic curve, so it's a P8. So you have nine parameters, and intuitively, And intuitively, this shows that surfaces of this form form somehow a boundary device in a partial compactification of the modular space. But it's only a partial compactification and not a complete compactification. And the limits surfaces are, so it's kind of tricky because the limits surfaces are not these, but they are equivalent classes of these because where you choose to blow up. Where you choose to blow up, it's the same. I mean, you can put the minus one curves on this surface or on this surface, it doesn't matter. So, what matters is actually the choice of points. Okay, so once we have these surfaces. There are other ways to deform an ambiguous. Then you deform to this as zero or to a zero to an ambiguous. There are other ways to do that. Other degenerations? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. So there was a huge like with K3 surfaces, you have a smoothing component and a lot topologically attributable components. Yes, yes, sorry, yes. So you can also smooth or deform these to not to and weakest surfaces. But that was not your question. For K3 surfaces, you have the worst deformation has two components. One component, you take the singular surface and you You take the singular surface and you smooth it. The other component, it remains topologically the same. Yeah, but it's no longer weakness or a Q3 surface. Yeah, you basically change the points, so you get non-stable, non-semi-stable and weaker surfaces. But there are other boundary components, possibly other boundary components. The list of all possibilities, I think, is in these papers by Pinkham and Pierce. These papers by Pink and Pearson. The problem is that it hasn't been proved that all the candidates actually deform. This is the... And that's also type 2 degree. That's a type 2. Of course, if you go to type 3, it becomes just pretty bad. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. So what are the limits? So now I will skip this. Identify limits of line bundles, because this is, okay, you have to. What is a line bundle? You have to. What is a line bundle or a limit curve here? Well, it's a line bundle, it's a pair of line bundle here and line bundle here, or cartier here and here that glue together, that have a compatible intersection on the double curve. And okay, you can classify basically all sorts of limit line bundles on these two on the components, but I will I will skip that. I will just say what kind of curves are the correct ones that that smooth. So ones that smooth. So here are the two components R twiddle and P twiddle and if we blow up less than nine points this will be a del petzo so this will be what we do because the pets of surfaces are nicer to to deal with the surfaces where you blow up the two and nine points and in not they are not they're in a special position right so it's not such a good idea but in general It's not such a good idea, but in general, we blow up less than nine points at the petzo surfaces, and this is a blow-up of the symmetric square of an elliptic curve. So what are the limit curves here? Well, we have to find a curve here that is Cp on this component and on this, sorry, CR on this component, and CP twiddle on this component that have. That have a compatible intersection, so such that CR twiddle intersected with T is C P twiddle intersected with T. These are the Cartier divisors on the border, and we have to find suitable such pairs that default. So they have to be genus one in the limit. So of course, here this is a symmetric square of an elliptic curve. Well Of an elliptic curve, well, the only rational curves here are the fibers of the vibration of the projection down to E, but they are not very useful to work with. So in fact, here we must take a curve of genus 1. So hopefully no. And here, of course, if this has genus 1 and we want this to be a limit of an elliptic curve, we have to take genus 0 on this side here. Here. So, this the only possibilities are these. Then we want these to be, as I said, limits of elliptic curves, so they cannot intersect in too many points. Because once we make a loop here, this will be a limit of, this cannot deform to an elliptic curve. So we need to make a tag node here, so only one point of intersection, and the rest like this. So the notes here, the notes on the smooth locus. The notes on the smooth locus, it's easy to prove that you can keep them when you deform. And then you need to prove that this m-tech node can be deformed, deforms to deforms to m minus one nodes. And this is a result by myself and Galati in another setting. So basically, Setting. So basically, if you have an M-tech node, you can deform it to M minus 1 nodes. So, for instance, if you have a one-tech node, so it means just a transversal intersection, this deforms to zero nodes because this, when you smooth the surface, this also will smooth. And well, these would be the right candidates. The problem is that this situation here is now wiggle. Widget. I mean, you can find such curves, but the dimension is zero on both sides. So it's basically impossible to prove that they are nodding because to prove that the curves are nodal, you need some flexibility. So what we do is that we change the situation a little bit. So I'm done now. Change the situation and we augment the number of intersection points. So we take a curve here that intersects in a huge tangent. A tangential intersection here, and then intersecting in three points. On this side, we then put minus one curves. We glue them with minus one curves, which exist because they are blown up, they are the petzo surfaces. And then we do the same for the other component. So this has a huge tangential internal. Tangential intersection, and then it intersects in three points like this, and we make we glue together with three minus one curves. Because there are more intersection points here, this curve here now moves in a positive dimensional family, and one can prove that the general one is nodal, and the same here. Then we have to glue these things together and show that there are minus one curves glued in each. There are minus one curves including the right points, but now we use the flexibility of moving this in a p8. So when we move these nine points in a p8, at the end we manage to show that things glue together. And at the end, the idea is very simple, but I mean you have to do some work to prove this. But these will then be the candidates, genus one here, noble, genus zero here, noble, tangential intersection. Tangential intersection and these are so-called logarithmic severi varieties. So these are the good old severi varieties on the petzo surfaces, but you impose a tangent in tangential intersection with the fixed curve. And this theory has been developed by basically Joe Harris who did it in his proof of the reducibility of severe varieties in the plane. And here in the symmetric two products, Two products of an elliptic curve blown up at a certain number of points. We had to somehow prove it to this theory, but it is possible to do it from there. Everything reduces to theory of basically severe varieties here and here. Yes, and this, and I'm done. Sorry for going over time.
