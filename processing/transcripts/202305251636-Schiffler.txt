You an example how one could maybe relate joint spectra to two cluster algebras. So for the purpose of today's talk, I would just want to think about a cluster algebra as a machine that produces polynomials in several variables. Okay, so that's fine. It does that. And it also provides a way of computing these polynomials. I should say, ways of computing these using several ways to do this so that combinatorial methods you can return this. For representations and other things. And I mean the joint spectrum, as Romway defined it in his talk, is the zero set of a determinant. zero set of a determinant. The determinant is a polynomial in several variables. So a question one might ask is: can we use these cluster algebras to compute the joint spectrum? Okay, so let me start now with my example. I'm optimistic, I write example one. Let's, I'm not sure if I will get to example two. So, yeah, so I take the finite proximity. find approximately and let me actually be more specific I want to take one of type a n so this g is really just the symmetric group on n plus 1 letters and then you have generators the usual coxeter generators The usual coxseter generators also simple reflections and I want to take a representation rho where V is So V is a finite-dimensional C vector space and then we can define square matrices K sub i is rho of plus 0. Is rho applied to S sub i and yeah, S and Roman's course you define the joint spectrum As the well-zero set of the determinant x1A1 plus xn a m minus the identity This definition is good because it tells you, well, there's some interplay between the Well, there's some interplay between the geometry of the joint spectrum, or the analysis, if you like, of the joint spectrum, and the representation theory of the group. So let me just mention again the two theorems you already saw in Romney's course. And Jennifer part one, which says that, yeah, for any G, any finite oxider group, so we're not necessarily in type A, then G is determined by its joint spectrum. Is determined by its joint spectrum. Okay, what is this representation? They should use the regular representation and then how And then howl and yeah, that's part two of this theorem show the same thing, but for the reflection representation, you call it the Jitz representation. Sorry, I will use the word reflection representation. Okay. Good. So this was the only part I'm doing here for general cox center groups, for general finite options of cocksetter groups. So let me go back to type A. And let's look at this reflection representation. So I will tell you what this V is. And B is the orthogonal complement. Of the diagonal in C to the n plus 1. And maybe let me not write out what the basis is. So the basis are the simple. Are the simple positive roots in the root system? The simple reflections, well, all the reflections of the oxidative root act in a well-known way on this basis. And then yeah, so the joint spectrum, let me write down the matrix, which gives you the joint spectrum. So it's this is really, well, it's an exercise how to compute this, not very hard. So I will change variables here a little bit. There's A1, A2 up to AN. n x2 the x is our original axis from the definition here we have everything from x1 to xn minus 1 and the rest is 0 so it's a tri-diagonal matrix and the AIs are The Ai's are, well let's say Aj is the sum of all the xi's. But then you subtract xj and you also subtract 1 because you subtract the identity. Okay, so this is of course, well I should have said zero set here, but let me just skip this. So this is of course a polynomial in So this is of course a polynomial in these variables. And since this is a tri-diagonal matrix, you take Moore's book on determinants and you find that this is the same as the numerator of a continued fraction. All the a's I have already defined above. Here b j is negative x j, x j plus 1. xj xj plus 1. People call this generalized continued fractions or continuance. These have not ones in terms of both, but that's what you get from here. And once you have that, then you are in the world of cluster algebras. This is known to be a specialization. Of a cluster variable. Okay, if you cluster variable just needs a generator of the cluster algebra. Cluster variable of in the cluster algebra Of the following quiver so cluster algebras are defined in terms of crivers. Let me show you the priver that you need here. Okay, so there's here's the private of type A. And then the B ones may have arrows in and out of it also in an alternating way. So here I don't put the arrows because it depends on parity. And then there's more to that. There's the A's as well from the matrix over here, which sit just Which sit just below the arrows. And then every vertex here from 1 to n minus 1 has two incoming, two outgoing. Well, I guess some forget about the B's, and there's two in and two out everywhere. And here we have little oriented triangles. And then we don't know which one is the right thing to do. Okay, so I guess if you don't know so much about cluster algebras, then this doesn't tell you that much, but at least it tells you there's a certain construction you can do where you have the f variables in this matrix over there. In this matrix over there, and then you have some additional things which I just labeled one n minus one, and so then this joint spectrum can be computed as a sum over all parameters. As a sum over all perfect matchings, so maybe you might think of this as a partition function. It's a weighted sum. Of the following graph So there's n minus 1 tiles. A tile is a graph with four vertices and four edges. Are edges like so. And what are the weights? The horizontal edges are weighted one and the vertical edges are weighted A1 through AN. And then also we have phase weights corresponding to the B's. Every tile in this picture has a weight as well. Let me do an example for S4. So n is equal to 3 here. And we have two tiles: a0, a1, a2. And then I want to do the perfect matchings of this graph. This graph has exactly three perfect matchings. This is one. So a perfect matching is a set of edges such that every vertex Set of edges such that every vertex in the graph is covered exactly once. And it's a weighted sum, so these two edges have weight one, this edge has weight two. So that's what I'm going to write. And then I can twist the first tile and get this perfect matching. And here the weight will be a1, a2, a3. But there's a phase weight as well, so I multiply with b1 inverse. It's a0, a1, a2. 0 and 1 and 2. Oh, that's because I switched my tage. Okay. And the other one then will be A3. Thank you. And then the last perfect matching is like this. And so this would be A1 from the edges, but then the phase weights would give me E1 inverse, E2. And yes, that's the same that you would get as the numerator. That you would get as the numerator of this continued fraction. Up to re-normalization, you have to multiply with V1 or V2 ingress. I've forgotten. Okay, so this is an example where the joint spectrum So this is an example where the joint spectrum is determined as the specialization of the cluster variable. So there's, it works nicely here, then maybe it works in other instances as well. We are not there yet. So this is one example. An important remark I think I want to make here is with Ryan Kinzer on Tuesday. On Tuesday, we have considered, so what, right, you have Sn plus 1 is generated by S1 to Sn as we just considered, but it's also generated by the two cycle S1 and an n plus 1 cycle. We just call that one C. And while the C. And well, the C actually can write as the part of all the S i's. And so you might ask, well, maybe it is better to just consider two generators instead of considering n generators, right? This whole purpose of this, of going down to n generators, was that in Lavinia's original determinant, there were all the elements of the group, which is way too much. There's too much information there. There's too much information there. So going down to n generators makes it easier to handle polynomial in n variables. Going down to two generators, it's just a polynomial in two variables. So it's natural to ask what happens in this approach when you do that. And what does happen is you get, you can compute this in the same way, but all these higher a's, they're just the same as a2. The same as A2, and the higher B's are also just the same as B2. And only A, well, A, so there's two A's and two B's, but the same formula will give you the joint spectrum here. I should also say the A's and the B's are not exactly the same A's and B's that I had in the first place. Slightly different. How much should I draw? Well, you start a little later, maybe four more minutes. Okay. Let's get a peep. Good. Let's get a peep. It's going to be peep, yeah. But my plan was to stop a little early so there's time for questions. So maybe I'll ask for questions now and then I'll do something else if there are no questions. Yes? For the three diagonal matrices, there is a formula for the determinants due to check all. Is that entry into your recursive formula for calculating the terminals of successive worst book? That's gave us the key. It it probably comes down to the way you have it. So that is a recursion. For calculating determinants, I thought that this should be reflected here in some power quality. Yeah. Yeah, the continued fractions also have a regressive, yeah. So I have a question here. Now you have a sequence of boxes here. Does it have anything to do with the Coatster diagram of A N? Which diagram? The Tingen diagram of A N. Yes, so actually this would be. Yes, uh so actually this would be uh a n minus one, kind of surprisingly. Um related is here. Right, I start with a n, but then yes. It really comes from this priver. Uh if you forget all the a's and the b's, it's a river of type a, and the cluster variables are all computed like this. With these extra vertices, some labels are fixed here already. But this also corresponds to this particular orientation that everything is alternating. It means that this graph is going straight. If you would have paths in a certain direction, then this would turn and have a snake-like form. Do you have an explicit form where you use two generators as one C? Do you have that polynomial? Yeah, I have it here. Well, I don't know, I don't have it here. I have it in, yeah, it's really this polynomial in terms the A3 would be the same as the A2, but they are slightly different, is what I will show you after. In the last minute, let me just mention. Mentioning one other thing that I did yesterday. I thought you went to make Louise. Oh. Yeah, maybe on lunch break or just before lunch. So yes, in your talk there was another cool C0 square minus C1 square minus C2 square minus 2Z1 C2 cosine theta. This was for Theta, this was for the infinite dihedral group. And so if you look at the number of terms, there are five terms in this polynomial, and it's a Fibonacci number. One, two, three, four, five. And this graph has a number of perfect matchings. This is also Fibonacci number. So here you get this from From this graph, if theta is zero, so I don't know what to do with this cosine. So it's a cosine is equal to one, then it's polynomial I can construct. It's not a very useful representation, then, so you're so it's a problem. You probably just want to stick to your user. That way the thing is not where we want the balance. Well, a second constructor. Well, you still can construct it. Sorry? I can I still can construct it too. Sure, but you don't only have five terms that I can only get these three. Uh well I mean okay not for day for you know five. I think it's five, no? There's a square and plus the zero square. So this is coming from a different cluster algebra. So this thing here, there's a geometric realization of cluster algebra. So this part Of cluster algebra, so this corresponds to a triangulated polygon, and this one corresponds to a triangulated torus with one puncture or one point if you like. So this side is the same as that one, this is the same as this, and this is the three. And then you get, from there, you get these waste. And then again, you have to make some, you have to say what these numbers really mean, but these edges which have the same number will all have the same variable attached to it, the same function of these x variables or z variables. And then the sum of all perfect matchings here will produce exactly that one. Okay, thanks very much. So I think we already looked at the questions. So let's just give the frozen second applause. So you don't have to also really focus on it. You didn't calculate the discussion at all.
