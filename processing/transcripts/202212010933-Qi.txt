Pleasure to provide me with this opportunity to present our recent work. Today I'm going to talk about most induced choosing dynamics. These are my collaborators. Alex Honey is from Texas. He is working on mathematical biology. Minji is Minji was my uh PhD supervisor and Dong Ruishan and UNVER postclass drivers. Post-master drivers. First, I want to briefly introduce change in the length and then focus on those induced by noise perturbations. So first, what is changing dynamics? As the name implies, it basically refers to those dynamics that only exist over a finite time period. But we demand more. For real systems, the dynamics that people can often observe actually exist over time. Often observed actually exist over a certain long path. So we are mainly concerned about those interesting and important long trends and lengths. This figure gives a nice illustration. The process starts at the right point, then after a short time period, it is trapped in this region and stays there for a long time. Then at some moment it leaves this region and relaxes. And relaxes to some external attractor. In general, the process can actually go to anywhere else. Nonetheless, the dynamics when the process is trapped in this region is what we call long-term dynamics. It can be found in many real applications. This example is about transformations in a closed system. Busy oscillations or discretion is a chemical. BC oscillations were discovered in the 1960s, but they didn't draw much attention. Later, researchers found that chemical oscillations have many can be play very important roles in many applications, especially in cell biology. This figure recalls the chemical oscillations in an experiment. They use some device to absorb the light wave generated by the oscillations. Generated by the oscillations, and then a needle connected to the device could move up and down on paper and then draw these vertical lens. So we can see from this figure that the initial oscillations are pretty regular. However, after about one hour and a half, they become very irregular for a long time. About eight hours. Then the oscillations become weaker and Then the oscillations become weaker and weaker until the system reaches the thermodynamic equilibrium. But anyway, the transit chaos refers to these long irregular oscillations. The next example is about the dispersion of volcanic ash. A volcano erupted here. So meanwhile, many ashes are dispersed into the air, and with the help of atmospheric flow, they Atmospherical flow, they are carried to many parts of the world. It can suspend in the air for a long time before they eventually fall to the ground due to gravity. The results when they suspend in the air are serious. If a plane flies through it, then the engine can be damaged by the volcanic ash. So it is a very important issue to study the long-trending dynamics when the volcanic Dynamics when the volcanic ash suspends in this air. There are many examples where we can find the trending dynamics. But to save time, I'm not going to give more examples. Basically, you can expect any types of training dynamics, whether it can be relatively simple or chaotic. Our goal is to establish a mathematical framework. Establish a mathematical framework to understand the trending dynamics, to capture them, to identify the time scales. Trending dynamics, actually, they can be induced by many factors like bifurcations or noise perturbations, different time scales, and so on. So we don't know too much about them. We hope to identify the dynamical mechanisms of the changing dynamics. Change in their lines. So, to generate this goals, we address the following questions. So, first, how to define the state called the transit state that controls the transient dynamics? And for given systems, how do we know that the trend state exists? And how about the other properties like uniqueness and attractiveness? Attractiveness. Following from this, the next question is: How can we use the transient state to categorize the transient band length? In particular, from what time can we observe the transient band length? And how long does it last? These two questions can be asked for very general systems as long as you can observe channel length. Recently, we are mainly concerned about. Recently, we are mainly concerned about change in dynamics induced by noise perturbations. The unperturbed system can either be deterministic or stochastic. Interestingly, noise perturbations can change greatly the long-term dynamics. They can transform the long-term dynamics of the end-party system into long-trend dynamics. So, it is very important. So, it is very important to understand how the M-protein system influences the trending dynamics. And conversely, what can we infer about the M-protein system from the noise limiting of the trending dynamics? Now, let's look at the two models. The first model is adding small white noise to the OE system. It is often used to model To model the evolution of species abundance in time transactions or the evolution of single species in population dynamics. So X is the risk given member of species, R is the intrinsic growth rate, epsilon is a small parameter. It is basically inversely proportional to the system size. Wt is a body motion. T is a burning motion. This is actually a mean field model because it can be derived as a diffusion approximation of rescue Gauss-Dash process. But to be honest, this term inside the square root is not like this, but we choose it for simplicity and also keep the key property. Anyway, the noise term. Anyway, the noise term mainly comes from two factors. The first is from the finiteness of species. The second factor is the randomness of individual activities, like collisions of molecules in chemical reactions, and the random dispersed in population dynamics. The second model only differs by a new noise term. Here, sigma is a constant, Bt is a constant. Is a constant, Bt is a boundary motion, it is independent of Wt. This term, this noise is often used to model the fluctuations of the sonic environment in population dynamics. But anyway, we can regard this as a small noise perturbation to a stochastic dynamical system. So, both these two models are randomly These two models are randomly perturbed systems. And for the M-perturbed system, the first one is OEE, so it has the simplest dynamics. And for the second one, it is a stochastic differential equation. So in terms of trajectories, it has a most complex dynamics. In more precise, the first, for the end-partners, For the M-partner system, the first one is actually a velocity equation. So the dynamics is very simple. R is a global equilibrium that exponentially attracts all the trajectories. A second one, we assume that R is greater than 1 over 2 times sigma squared, so that the system will have a unique speedrun distribution mu naught. It exponentially attracts the process with Attracts the process with any initial distribution. So these are the pictures of the dynamics of the M perturbed system. Now let's go back to the randomly perturbed system. It is amazing that this small demographic noise could greatly impact the long-term dynamics. In fact, almost all trajectories of the process will be driven by the noise. Will be driven by the noise population to zero infinite time. Because all these coefficients vanish at zero, so the process will stay at zero forever. In terms of stiffering distribution, the direct measure centered at zero is the unique stiffering distribution. So the long-term constants are not completely different. Completely different. But it is also boring, very boring. So let's look at the evolution of the system. These are small noise perturbation problems. So the dynamics of the randomly performed system will follow that of the unperturbed one over a certain long time. So for the first one, the process will quickly go to R and stay near R for a long time. Stay near R for a long time. And for a second one, the distribution of the process will be close to the situation distribution mu naught for a long time. So we do, for these two systems, we do have long trend dynamics before the process is absorbed by zero. And moreover, the transient dynamics is very close to the steady state of the amprotomy system. Prototypicism. But the question is: how can we capture the trend and dynamics, the trend state for the randomly performed system? Our approach is to use Causes different distribution. Because we are mainly concerned about the dynamics before the process is absorbed by zero, so we multiply the process indicator function. The process indicator function over this event. It is called the survival event because it means that until time t, the process hasn't been absorbed by zero. Okay, so we consider this process. However, bad news is that this process doesn't preserve probability. So we condition this process on this survival event. Then the result Then the result, then the conditional process has no loss of probability. And the station distribution of the conditional process is what we call quasi-station distribution of the original process. More precisely, it is a probability distribution. Once the initial distribution is given by the QSD, then the distribution of the process conditions. Of the process conditioned on this survival event doesn't change over time. Study of QSD has a long history, more than 50 years. However, for the model spin here, it is very challenging because both the diffusion and the drift vanish at zero. Actually, the first result was due to was due to CATIU in 2009. They showed the existence and uniqueness of the QSD for any fixed noise applications. Moreover, the QSD will have a smooth density UFC. Their approach is to analyze the spectrum of the associated focal plan operator. Focus plan operator is a PDE operator. It basically governs the distribution of the process. Distribution of the process of the solution process to a SDE. It turns out that the density of the PSD is in fact a principal eigenfunction of the focal point operator. More interestingly, the principal eigenvalue lambda epsilon has an amazing property. Once the magneto distribution is given by the QSB, then The QSB, then the extinction time has an exponential distribution. And the rate is given by exactly the principal eigenvalue. So it has another name, extinguishing rate. So these results are true only for fixed multiple divisions. So our question is whether PSD is really effective to capture the trend in the lamps. And if the answer is yes, how can we use the term? If the answer is yes, how can we use it? The first question about the effectiveness of the QSD is actually related to the tightness and the concentration of the QSD. The reason is that suppose the QSD concentrates near zero, then how can we use it to effectively capture the trend dynamics that happens before the process goes to zero? That's why we study the techniques and the concept. While we study the tightness and the concentration. Fortunately, for the two models given here, we do have tetanus. And moreover, for the first one, which is basically a ODE plus noise perturbations, we can show that the QSD will concentrate near the global equilibrium R. And we also establish the sub-exponential motivation for the QSD. QSD. B is a positive potential function. So, anyway, from here we can see the QSD actually is basically expression near near R. This is a result of the QSD for the first model. For the second one, which is basically SD plus noise coefficients, we can show the QSD will convergence to the unit the special distribution new naught. So, these results show that the noise perturbations actually transform the long-term kinetics of the end protein system into long-training kinetics. Then, how can we use it to capture the training dynamics? Our starting point is this inequality. It is that the total variance distance between the distribution of the process at MT Of the process atom T and the convex combination between two measures mu naught and the direct measures delta zero can be controlled by this exponentially small term. Here, alpha epsilon is a function. It can be defined via the principal as a function of L epsilon. L epsilon is nothing, it's just the diffusion operator, which is adjointed to the four completed operator. plant operator. And lambda epsilon is the extinction rate and beta lambda epsilon is the spectral gap of the diffusion operator of the focal point operator L C. The proof of this inequality is actually very simple. They basically relies on two facts. First, we split this expectation into two parts. The first part is content The first part is contains the information of the process before it is absorbed by zero. So we can extract the transit dynamics, the QSD, from the first one. The second one consents the information after the process is absorbed by zero. So it corresponds to this direct measure. The second ingredient is about the eigenfunction expansion of the first term. Fortunately, it is the summit group generated by the diffusion operator, or epsilon. But nevertheless, to get a clear information about the transient dynamics or the multi-scale dynamics, we need the information about the limits of alpha epsilon, lambda epsilon, mu epsilon, and the spectral gap, beta lambda epsilon. Okay, fortunately for QSD, for the QSD mu epsilon, we have just shown the results in the previous page. So we it remains to care about these three guys. For the first one, for the first model, which is basically ODE plus multiplications, we can show that alpha epsilon goes to 1 locally uniformly. The result is very simple. The result is very simple. This proof is very hard. Because it requires, from definition, it requires the detailed information about the asymptotics of the principal and function phi epsilon. But this can be done via the sub-exponential asymptotics of our QSD. For the expression rate lambda epsilon, we have shown that it is exponentially small and we also clearly defined the prefactor. And for the special gap bigger lambda epsilon, we have shown it goes to R. So from these two linking equations, we can identify the time scale for of this. Time scale of this. The lower bound is given by the reciprocal of the spectral gap, so it is of order one. And the upper bound is given by the reciprocal of the extinction rate, so it is exponentially large. Okay, so now having these limiting equations and these time scales, we can see from this uh we can see from this inequality that this this coefficient is almost one. Coefficient is almost 1, and this coefficient is almost 0, and the error is also almost 0. So the distribution of the process atom t is approximately equal to the QSD. In other words, during this time scale, the dynamics of the process is manufactured by the QSD. And the duration of the trend dynamics is Of the trend dynamics is potentially low. So, these are results for the first model. And for the second one, which is S D plus noise perturbations, the main difference is that the principal eigenvalue is now polynomially small. So, the time scale now is polynomially long. This shows that once the dynamics of the n polygons Once the dynamics of the n-partom system is different, then the duration of the training dynamics can be quite different. So this picture summarizes the information I want to convey. So if the dynamics of the n-perturbosis is the simplest, then we have the long-term dynamics is exponentially long. Otherwise, if the dynamics is If the dynamics has the most chaotic dynamics, then the duration of the training dynamics is polynomially long. And the question is, because most systems actually in between them, so the question is, how about the duration of the trend in the lamps? Up to now, we only worked on, we only have some partial results about the one-dimensional system, and we are working on. And we are working on the hair dimensional systems, but they are much harder to investigate. Basically, there are three reasons. First, for hair-dimensional systems, the boundary is no longer a single point. And the dynamics on the boundary is no longer simple. So they will come into play. Particularly, the tightness of the QSD will be very hard to prove. Moreover, the dynamics of the systems inside the domain can be very complex than one-dimensional systems. So we can expect much different time scale for the training dynamics. The other factor that makes the investigation very hard is that higher-dimensional systems are often irreversible. So the techniques for the one-dimensional systems For the one-dimensional systems cannot be applied. We have to look for new techniques. Now we have for fixed noise perturbations, we can show the discrete spectrum of the full component operator and the existence, uniqueness, and exponential charities of the PSD. But for small noise predominance, for the noise limiting, we are working on this. We are working on this and don't have effective methods to choose them. I will stop here and thank you. Can you give is there like an intuition of why the station quasi-stationary destroyed? Why the station quasi-stationary distribution looks like a Gaussian? You said something like mu epsilon is like something that depends on x, exponential function. Yes, actually you can do Taylor expansion for the positive for the quasi-potential v round R. So the first derivative of the the the first derivative of B at R is zero and the second derivative is positive. So it is nearly got to be directly concerning this I was thinking that but then we showed minus the estimate so this is all convergence and total variation or we're a total variation right it's really strong sorry it's really weak convergence it's reconvergence but then your estimate your exponential estimate was a total variation Your exponential estimate was a total value age? Yes. Because the initial distribution is actually fixed point R x. So we can take the initial distribution as compactness particular. So we can get this into a derivation, but it's such this is a technical detail, but okay. Okay. Uh I I don't know whether I got the ending quite correctly because you when you came back to the slide with like the in-between and so yes because uh what I was thinking if like you have a quality stationary distribution then you do have this like uh um killing time for extinction rate or so doesn't it automatically somehow have like this exponentially long Exponentially long staying in some possibility before I reach the disaster in time which this like to epsilon hour so this is a long uh family of epsilon so when you have these two uh Uh so when you have these two uh different uh times for say uh the duration of your transients, exponentially and polynomial, can you uh derive or s see some differences in the dynamical processes which are behind this? So from dynamical system theory we know, so to say, and you cited Tamashdale in the very beginning, and so in his book on transient chaos 2011, I think he elaborated so that different So, that different transient times and transient times distributions relate to whether the chaotic cell is hyperbolic or non-hyperbolic in this case. But this is chaotic dynamics. So, you are not talking about chaotic dynamics here. But can there be also a relation to really the characteristics of the dynamics of the system? So, why you get the different transient times? I think, well, the trend dynamics actually is related to the unparticular signal. When it is simple, it is exponentially long. And when it is very chaotic, then it is very long. So if it is in between it is like chaotic but not that chaotic, then No not that chaotic, then we can expect the time scale is in between this. But for chaotic systems, it's known that it's exponentially distributed. For chaotic saddles, at least. I mean, for single saddle, I know that the result is actually the time scale is the logarithm log logarithmic of epsilon. It is that long. But for chaotic saddle, I'm not sure about the results. Sure, about the results. Okay, so we can discuss it later. So, because there it's exponential, so for chaotic cells. And then to the chaotic sending fire? I mean, it looks like this can be used to answer the same types of questions that we studied with these finite time and the albino coefficient stuff, and then maybe this links to. Coalition stuff, and then maybe this links to dynamics as well. So did you comment on the do you know much about how these problems are related? Because I'm thinking specifically of the pressure. Well, because you have a similar problem, right? There's this deterministic pitchfork cascade, but it all just disappears in the bound time limit, but then for finite time, and you can try to quantify this time with these finite reaction coefficients. Time which is finitely optimal coefficients, you see this structure and then it disappears. Transient in this sense. Maybe just a comment is I've gotten the idea of conditioned lap and of its former that you use exactly quasi-stationary distribution to one name, sorry, no. No, I I think the ability is a button I don't know how to really stop. Yeah, no, I mean it is there's I can tell you that. I mean, I can tell you there are some papers that we wrote actually exactly about this. Did he use quasi-stationary dynamics to have an asymptotic description of the finite time level of exponents with respect to a certain kind of bounded domain or like a domain way that I've got of that? So yeah, this is exactly this connection.
