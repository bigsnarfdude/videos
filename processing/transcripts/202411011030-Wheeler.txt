For organizing and for the invitation. It's really great to be here, even if only virtually. And I've been very impressed by how everyone's keeping such good time. So, hopefully, I'll live up to their example. So, yeah, I'm very excited to be talking about some recent work on overhanging ways with Juan Davila, Manuel Del Pino, and Monica Mazzo, who are all like me at Bath. And so, I'll just jump, because it's a 10-minute talk in an audience of experts, I'll jump straight to the steady, solitary water wave problem with constant vorticity, gravity, no surface. Constant vorticity, gravity, no surface tension. So we've got the constant vorticity here, we've got some sort of a Bernoulli constant, which we're writing as one half c squared, and we've got the depth of the fluid. And then, of course, we also have the gravitational constant and everything else you can read off from the asymptotic conditions at infinity. And we're going to non-dimensionalize by setting this Bernoulli constant equal to a half and this depth equal to one. So I'm going to still write it g for this dimensionless gravity, but For this dimensionless gravity, but probably it would be more correct to call it inverse-squared fruit number if you prefer. Okay, so now for a bit of an aside, when I first tried to convince Juan Manuel and Monica to work on this problem, their immediate reference point was Sarin's overdetermined problem, famous problem from the 70s, which you can also think of as a sort of steady fluids problem. You've got a constant vorticity fluid with a kinematic condition on the boundary and some sort of a dynamic condition. And some sort of a dynamic condition that's now just saying that the velocity, that the speed rather, is constant. Somewhat strangely from a fluid's perspective, the Dirsley value of the stream function has to be the same on both boundary components. So there's some sort of a no-flux condition when you have multiply connected domains. And anyway, what Saren famously proved using the method of moving planes was that there are basically no interesting solutions to this problem when omega is bounded. Everything has to be a ball. And of course, our water wave problem, our steady water wave problem, is different in lots of ways. But what if we focus on Saren's problem a little bit and imagine just Focus on Saren's problem a little bit and imagine just weakening the assumptions a little bit. One option is to no longer require that omega be bounded, and then you can get solutions that sort of have maybe a periodic water wave flavor. And particularly, you have this nice paper by Fall Millenn Weth in 2017. Okay, so right back to water waves. I think maybe Eric was showing some of these pictures earlier in his talk. But we've got these famous numerics from the 80s showing overhanging periodic waves in infinite and finite depth. In infinite and finite depth. And we've got the more recent numerics showing these really sort of exotic things with what looks like a bunch of stacked disks and the folds and the caps and that whole story, which we've also heard a little bit about. And I think we've also even seen this picture that everyone uses from Telesisilva and Peregrine, which maybe offers some partial physical motivation for looking at these solutions. What we maybe haven't seen are some numerics for solitary waves. So this is a paper by Jean-Marc in 94. I'm not sure how well you can see this. I'm not sure how well you can see this, but these are some sort of maybe nearly limiting states with different values of a dimensionless gravity parameter. They've got a very sort of thin layer and then sort of bulbous things sort of glued on top. This one looks like a disk, but these definitely don't look like disks. And here's maybe a better view from another paper by Jean-Marc in the following year. So these are sort of branches of solitary waves with forticity and relatively small gravity. Here's one branch. Here's another sort of interesting branch that has sort of two little disks. Okay. So what can we say? Okay, so what can we say about these sorts of solutions rigorously? Well, as Eric was explaining in more detail than I'm going to here, the go-to technique would be global bifurcation. And there are some nice papers on this, especially Eric and Jorg's recent paper. But unfortunately, they all have the same weakness that they can't quite conclusively prove that the solutions that they construct overturn. Although, I think everyone believes that some of the solutions that these papers construct do overturn. What you can do, though, is look at these explicit solutions with zero gravity, which we've also heard. With zero gravity, which we've also heard about in some of the previous talks, where the conformal mapping is exactly the same as for Crapper's waves, but the stream function does this more interesting thing with constant vorticity. This is a nice story, and I think Eric already mentioned that these solutions are non-degenerate in the sense that you can perturb them with sort of regular perturbative terms like gravity or changing the depth from infinite to finite but very large. Of course, what we can't do in this sort of a setup is handle the sorts of singular perturbations like small surface tension that Josh was talking about in his talk. Surface tension that Josh was talking about in his talk. And there's also this very nice paper by a former master's student of Eric and Yevgeny. And this is somehow connected to these solutions with point vortices that Josh was talking about, but I won't dwell on that. Okay, but that's just one corner of this zoo of solutions that we see in the numerics. Are there any other corners that we can get at rigorously? And it turns out the answer is yes, and it's this corner. So, in their paper, Tells this Lilvin Peregrine sort of. Tells this little peregrine sort of make the conjecture, I guess you could call it, that there are limiting states that look like this. It looks like a circle and a line or a disk and a half plane or a disk and a strip. And these definitely don't look like crapper waves, but they have some nice structure, so maybe we can find them. And you also see pictures of them in John Mark's second paper. And there's again a whole zoo. You can stack a disk on a strip or two disks on a strip or a disk on some other non-trivial solution with zero gravity. And then you can sort of perturb these to small gravity. Perturb these to small gravity. And so, for the next few minutes, I'm going to tell you a little story about these most simplest versions of these solutions. And so, here's the theorem. The theorem more or less says that solutions like this exist with small gravity. So if you fix your dimensionless vorticity with sort of the right sign and in the regime where small gravity waves are going to be super critical, and you pick a radius this way so that the Bernoulli constants match, then you can find a solution that, roughly speaking, looks like. Find a solution that, roughly speaking, looks like a disc glued to a strip by a little neck that's an explicit solution called the hairpin, which I'll talk about in a couple slides. So the disc is just a Rankine vortex. It's just a disk of fluid in rigid rotation. That solves the problem, but only when you turn off gravity. Otherwise, of course, this disc would fall. We'll come back to that later. The strip is just everyone's favorite Couette flow, everyone's favorite trivial solution. So let's not talk about that. And instead, talk about this hairpin or double hairpin. So as far as I know, this So, as far as I know, this is an interesting potential flow solution, which was first found by these three people in 2011 who weren't thinking about fluids at all. They were thinking about something they called exceptional domains, which maybe has more of a geometric flavor. But anyway, it's an explicit potential full solution. Here's the conformal mapping from this vertical strip, zeta plus sine zeta, and the stream function is cosine zeta. And this again solves the problem, except for now, not only does it get the gravity term wrong, but it also gets the vorticity wrong. There's no vorticity. But it also gets the vorticity wrong. There's no vorticity for this solution. But thankfully, we're not putting this exact solution in the neck. We're rescaling it first in a way to sort of keep the Bernoulli constant unchanged. And when you do that, you get factors of epsilon effectively in front of the vorticity and in front of the gravity term. So it makes sense that this might be a leading order approximation of how the neck would work. Okay, so as a bonus, we also get to say something about Saren's overdetermined problem, which maybe I won't say too much about for this. Determined problem, which maybe I won't say too much about for this water waves audience. But again, we have these sort of periodic wave-type solutions by Fall, Mind, and Weth, and we can find sort of the large amplitude limit of these, although we can't say anything about what happens in between. Okay, and so this analogy with Sarin's problem is useful because there's a further analogy between Sarin's problem and constant mean curvature surfaces. So I think Jorg has already been telling us about these Dulaine unduloids in a different context with surface tension, but there's With surface tension. But there's a pretty good analogy, at least a rough one, between these sorts of solutions and the ones from Fallman and Weth and the limiting Delune ungeloids, which look like a bunch of spheres and the solutions that we find in our second theorem. There's also a nice correspondence by Trese, essentially, between sort of a zero vorticity hollow vortex version of this problem in unbounded domains and a class of minimal surfaces. Okay. So this analogy to constant mean curvature surfaces is useful because the constant mean curvature people have been grooving things together. Constant mean curvature people have been gluing things together since the 90s and are very, very good at it. So we can basically steal some of their ideas. They like to glue things together with catenoids, which are an explicit mineral surface. The analog of these catenoids, according to this correspondence from the previous slide, is exactly this double hair pin that we use to glue things together. Okay, and maybe one final slide, just say something about the formulation and the proof. We start off with a very carefully constructed approximate solution with lots and lots of cutoffs and further corrections, which maybe I won't mention. Further corrections, which maybe I won't mention. And eventually, basically, we want to sort of linearize the problem about the solution. And we do it in such a way that we get something that looks like a robin problem here, plus some sort of error terms, error terms coming from the fact that it's a approximate solution, and then nonlinear terms coming from, of course, the fact that it's nonlinear. And I'll stop there. Thanks. Well, do we have any questions? Thanks, Miles, for the interesting talk. How significant do you think? Like, is it more difficult if you want to start doing disks on top of disks on top of disks? Or is it just like adding more gluing each time? The disks on top of disks on top of disks is actually more difficult. I think the most difficult of all the generalizations you could imagine. The reason being is that there's sort of a balance between the width of this neck and the gravity. The gravity, there's a sort of a bunch of solvability conditions that happen. If you have a bunch of disks, then you have a bunch of solvability conditions, and it sort of becomes a system that you need to solve, and it really does become more complicated. And you might want to sort of set up the argument, sort of structure the argument differently to make it happen. Yeah, hi, Miles. The epsilon that you have in your problem is the width of this hairpin, right? Yes. So your solution is valid for every epsilon below some value. Every epsilon below some value and to zero, including zero. I guess I'm not sure what that means. Well, it depends on what you mean by including zero. Right, because I guess if you include zero, maybe you get this singular solution in the limit. But yes, it's all small epsilon. And then there's sort of an argument that relates this epsilon to the G. I think in the paper, it's a solvability condition, but maybe more physically, it's sort of a force balance condition. So this little neck is the thing that's keeping the disk from falling. And so if you do a force balance, you can sort of guess to leading. So, if you do a force balance, you can sort of guess to leading order how g and epsilon have to be related. Thank you. And let's thank Mais again. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, we can. Great. Yeah, I think it's Sam Robert. Are you okay with us recording? Yeah, go through. Yep.
