All right, so first I'd like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to share our work here and I will tell you about our recent work on sequence-based modeling of multi-scale 3D genome organization. So now we know that the genomic DNA is highly spatially organized at several spatial scales. And a large part of it is learned through assays such as high-C, which such as high C, which essentially will cut the genomic DNA and we relocate it together, then we use sequencing approach to detect DNA sequences that are in close proximity each other in high throughput. And with such assays, we can just using counting the number of genomic contacts to measure the 3D genome structure at different scales. So we can summarize those results in matrices like In matrices like this. For example, here, like both x-axis and y-axis represent genomic locations, and the diagonal represents the interactions with itself, and the off-diagonal positions represent interactions between two genomic positions. And at different spatial scales, it tells us about different characteristics of this 3D genome organization. Like at the very local scale, we can see those individual chromosome. Those individual chromosome contexts. And if we zoom out, we can see those topologically associating domains or TAS, and in which positions within a TAD will tend to preferentially interact with each other, but not with the other TAD. And we look beyond about one megabit scale, then the characteristics of those genome interaction patterns change again, where we see Patterns change again, where we see what's dominant patterns here are those checkerboard or plate-like structures, where we can consider the genome as largely being grouped into two compartments, the compartment A and compartment B, where genomic sequences in which compartment tend to preferentially interact with sequences within the same compartment, but not with the other compartment. And chromosome compartment A is more mostly enriched. A is more mostly enriched in actively expressed genes, while the B compartment is more enriched in inactive or gene-depleted regions. So like in almost everything in biology, we know that the structure is highly relevant to the function. And the genomics 3D structure is known to be relevant to the gene transcription or regulation and DNA replication and DNA repair. Repair. So, we definitely want to understand. So, and we know that the genome 3D structure is highly specific to individual genomic locations. And at different locations, we see totally different spatial organization patterns. And we expect that there is a strong dependency on the genomic sequence. So, we want to understand how does the genomic sequence encode the information of Um, encode the information of the 3D genome organization, and what we know about these dependencies are still rather incomplete. For example, we know clearly about the CDCF motif playing a role in the boundaries of TED, but still, we don't know much about the other types of interactions, and especially at the larger spatial scale, what are the principles that guide? Principles that guide the formation of the chromatin compartment. So we would like to treat it as a machine learning problem where we just simply ask the question of can we train a model that takes the genomic sequence as input and predict this multi-scale 3D genome structure at all those different scales up to an entire chromosome. So previously there have been excellent works that can do this prediction from sequence. Can do this prediction from sequence to genome 3D interactions at one megabit per scale, but it still remains a challenge to do this at all those different scales. So an obvious challenge here is, of course, that we're dealing with really, really large genomic sequence and very large data about genome 3D interactions. And to be able to do that, one realization is that we don't have to model all of those 3D genome. All of those 3D genome interactions at the same resolution. So, for example, when we're looking at ultra-long range interactions, we also cannot measure them as very high resolution. So, it's naturally represented as the lower resolution matrix. Whereas we're looking at closer and closer interactions, we can look at those shorter range interactions with finer resolution. So, we can do this multi-scale. So we can do this multi-scale prediction kind of in a Google Maps style where we start from very long, very large windows and long-range interactions, and then we iteratively zoom into smaller and smaller regions and look at it at finer and finer resolutions. So that allows to deal with the scale of the data problem. So we make finite size predictions at every scale. And to pair with such a prediction, Compared with such a prediction, multi-scale prediction strategy, we have generated the, we have designed the deep learning model architecture to generate the sequence representations at different resolutions. So at the lower level, we generate finer resolution sequence representations from ConfNet, where one value may be computed from a shorter range of sequence, such as 4KB, where Sequence such as 4KB, whereas in the higher level, one sequence, one value here is computed from a much larger chunk of genomic sequence, even up to one megabyte sphere. So we have those sequence representations at different resolution, and we use these sequence representations at corresponding resolution to compute predictions for this 3D genome interaction pattern at the corresponding scale. At the corresponding scale. So we start the prediction from the largest scale where we can cover the entire chromosome at the lowest resolution. Then we then iteratively zoom into finer and finer phenomenal locations with increasing resolution. So with this strategy, we can generate predictions like this. So this is on a chromosome that's On a chromosome that the model has not been, has never seen during training. And these are the predictions at the 32 megabit scale. And each heat map on the left shows the zoom lane region of a sub-region of the plot on the right. So we can iteratively zoom into smaller and smaller regions and all the way to one mega base pair. Mega base pair. So we can see different characteristics of 3D genome structure predicted at different scales as well, whereas in the more local scale, we see mostly those pad structures. And at the larger scale, we see the most prominent structures become the component compartment. And how does it compare with the experiment measurement? We showed the micro-C measure. The micro C measurement below. And as you can see, that the prediction actually matches very well with the experimental measurement, even though the model has never seen those sequence and data before during training. So we can also quantitatively measure the correlations between the prediction and the experiment over the entire holdout set. And we see consistently And we see consistently good correlations across different spatial scales from one megabase pair all the way up to 200 megabit pair scale, which covers the largest human chromosome. So when we look at our predictions in more details, we realize that the model seems to capture not just the most common type of interactions. Common types of interactions mediated by CDCF as those local scales, but it also captures other types of genome interactions. For example, in this example, we showed the predictions of a polycom-mediating interactions, which overlaps with the H3K27 time isolation. And interestingly, this interaction is also a cell type-specific phenomenon, which shows in the H1 embryonic stem cell, but not in the embryonic stem cell, but not in the skin fibroblast. And when we train the two models for these two cell types, our predictions also capture this cell type specificity, where it predicts the polycommittee interactions in EIC, but not in the skin fiber blast. So this is another example where we predicted an enhancer promoter and promoter-promoter interactions in this region. In this region. And similarly, this is also this type of interaction also tend to be highly cell type specific, whereas we see stronger patterns in the HFF cell, but not in the H1ESC cell. So now we can make all those kind of predictions and what is the use of the model. Of course, we don't just want to replicate what the experiment can already measure. And I think the And I think the applications of those sequence-based models largely is contributed by its ability to predict sequences that the model has never seen before. So we can, in principle, give the model any genomic sequence and it will give us a prediction of this 3D genome structure. And what can we use it for? So, for example, we can use it to predict the impact of structural variants. So, those large structural variants tend to be the Large structural variants tend to be the type of genomic variation that has the largest impact. And a lot of them is known to cause disease through the disruptions of the 3D genome organization. So we've collected all those variants that has previously been shown to have an effect on the 3D genome, and we want to see whether the model can recapitulate their effect by predicting based on the sequence. So basically, Based on the sequence. So basically, we can take those previously known variants and we can reproduce their sequence in silico. And then we can ask the model to predict what are the impact of the structural variant on the 3D genome structure by predicting the 3D genome structure on the reference sequence and on the sequence that carries that structural variant. So here is an example of predictions of several. Of predictions of several structural variants in a region where disruptions by structural variants lead to several distinct phenotypes. So we can see here that if we delete a region here, and this actually causes the shrinkage of this TAD domain and actually inclusion of this PAC3 gene. Of this PAC3 gene into this tad domain interacting with this enhancer at this position. And this interaction is not signal much weaker at the original wild type sequence. And similarly, in all those other structural variants, like the inversion here and duplication here and duplication here, all leads to all leads to an ectopic interaction between this enhancer and a gene that it does not previously interact. In different cases, it causes interactions with different genes. Like here, in F syndrome, structural variances cause interaction, de novo interaction with 1,6, where in this polydactyl duplication causes de novo interactions with India. With Indian hedgehog. And those de novo interactions between the enhancer and different genes can explain the different phenotypes that have appeared in those patients carrying those different structural variants. And we have also compared with the experimental data that's measured by 4C, which measures the three genome interaction patterns from a single viewpoint. A single viewpoint, and as shown here, that the model prediction matches very well with the 4C experimental data in those different cases. So in all those examples that we have tested, we found that the model predictions to be very closely aligned with the experimental measurement, which suggests that we can actually use this model as a tool for us to study those structural variance effects on. Those structural variants effect on 3D genome, where we have no prior experimental knowledge about. So, another directions of applications that is really important is that once we have learned those models that can very accurately predict the 3D genome structure from the sequence, and we think that definitely captures some knowledge about the sequence dependency of this. The sequence dependency of this 3D genome that we didn't know about. So, we want to be able to extract what are the potential mechanisms that the model has learned from sequence, and we can use that to generate hypothesis about the sequence-based organizations of the 3D genome. So, I tend to think about studying this as thinking of the model as kind of a virtual cell where we can design virtual genetics. Cell where we can design virtual genetic screens to figure out what are the sequence dependencies of those models. So, because a model can predict from any genomic sequence I give you to a three multi-scale 3D genome interaction patterns, so we can design those different sequences carrying different mutations, and the model will predict what are its impact on the multi-scale 3D genome structure. So, then we can use this to Use this to design any virtual genetic screen. And we can quickly also quickly iterate over this by looking at the results and design a refined and improved genetic screen to better understand the sequence dependency. So we designed several strategies to look at the sequence dependencies of multi-scale three genome structure. Multi-scale three genome structure at different scale. And at the more local scale, we use a more finer-grained 10-base pair resolution screen to mutate all 10-base pairs across the entire genome and look at all the motif scale sequences that can affect the 3D genome. Whereas at the combining compartment scale, we use a different strategy. We use a different strategy to perturb the genome to see what are the sequences that are contributing to the compartment. So now I'll focus on this part, which I'm most excited about, which try to probe what are the sequence dependencies of the completing compartment. So to do this, we have to first be able to deconvolve the effect of sequence. Deconvolve the effect of sequence on the topologically associated domain scale and the combining component scale. So, to do that, we actually train a model that is on a cohesing depleted data set that has cleanly eliminated the tag structure, but preserves the competing compartment structure. And so now we can use the model to study what are the sequences on the Are the sequences on the commune compartments without an effect on the topologically associated domains? And another challenge that we have to address is that the small genomic perturbations, like those 10-base pair perturbations that we see will have an effect on the local genome structure, actually largely does not impact the chromatin compartment. compartment. So we use a different screen strategy where we insert segments of genomic sequences into a set of target genomic locations. And we can measure whether those insertion of the SOL sequences impact the Chrome skin compartment scale tree genome organization. So we did that in this 32 In this 32-megabiscer region, where we insert sequences into nine of those targeted locations in this example, and we can measure the impact of sequences coming from each of the locations within this 32-megabit region. So, where we insert all possible about 12.8 KB sequences from this region into nine of those target locations. And we see that so. We see that, so here it plots the impact of the insertions at different locations. So, this is the plot the impact of the salt sequence on one of the target locations. And you can see that different positions, some of the insertions have strong impact on the chromium compartment scale 3D genome structure, while the others have very little impact. And this shows us a profile of the Shows us a profile of the sequence activities at the community compartment scale. And we see that different target locations show very different sensitivity to those SAR sequence activities. So this is because these three locations are in the B compartment. So they are sensitive to B compartment to A compartment transition, whereas these locations are in the A compartment and they are sensitive to A to B compartment transition. So we see that the B to A compartment transitions are A compartment transitions are so sequence with activity of B to A compartment transitions are actually quite sparse. And whereas the sequence with A to B compartment transitions are more widespread. And these B to A compartment transition activities are mostly enriched in A compartment. And those sequences are more, those A to B compartment transition activities are more enriched in the B compartment. So we also look at the scale of sequences that are necessary for having A to B compartment and B to A compartment transition activities. And so we look at the insertions of different size of sequences. And as we can see here, the B2A compartment transitions needs very small sequence, amount of sequence to be able to have an impact, whereas the A to B compartment transitions requires a much longer chunk of sequence. A much longer chunk of sequence to have a significant impact. And also, what are those positions that are actually having between compared transition activity, right? So when we look at it, we find that actually closely aligns with the positions with the GSS activity. So these are the transcription star sites. And when we zoom into those locations, we also find that the locations with the TSS activity is exactly. Activity is exactly the location where we see the strongest impact on B to A compartment transition. So we also look at the size of the sequence patterns that are required for those bitweight compartment transition activity and to be compartment transition activity by permuting the sequence and destroy the sequence patterns. And the conclusion from this is that we find that. The conclusion from this is that we find that the competing component activity actually depends on sequence patterns that are longer. And at least we need to preserve sequence patterns of about 100 base pairs and above to have a strong compartment A activity. And surprisingly, that this compartment B activity is robust to disruptions of those complex sequence patterns. And it seems to be not dependent on very complex sequence patterns. And we also find that the community component B activity. That the combined component B activity is consistent with the AT percentage in the sequence. So we summarize over those results and we have this model that's proposed from probing the sequence-based dependencies of 3D genome structure. And we think the competing environment A is strongly dependent on the sequences at the TSS and sequences. Sequences as a TSS. And sequences as a TSS can induce quite widespread compartment information, which is probably correlated with that, with the TSS sequence ability to induce long-range chromatin alterations. And in contrast, the component B formation seems to be not necessary to have complex sequence patterns beyond just the HEGC content, but it requires an extended amount. Requires an extended amount of sequence that does not have compartment A activity to induce this transition. So, I've talked about many of those applications from this sequence model and think it can be a very useful tool for study the 3D genome. And we also have web servers for predicting, to making predictions for structural variance on the 3D genome structure. And we also have the code available here. Um here. So, and thanks for the attention. And so, yeah.
