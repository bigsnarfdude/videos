It's my great pleasure to introduce Jin Dong from MIT, who is going to talk about regularity of Lagrangian flows on RCDKAN spaces and applications. Please go ahead. Okay, thanks. So it's a great pleasure to be here. Thanks to everyone for coming to check this out. And thanks to the organizers for inviting me. So, I'm going to talk about the regularity of a branch and flows and also some applications of it. So, this actually came out of working on the holding continuity of tangent columns and the methods used, at least in the general case, is some extension of the methods used in that paper. I will say the result is somewhat technical and the proof is sort of long and kind of annoying in some ways. Long and kind of annoying in some senses, but I think there is some ideas in there that's kind of cute, and I hope you'll find that interesting. It's very non-smooth in flavor. And also, of course, I think once you get away with it, once you're done all the technical details, you really do get something about the flow of vector fields, which is sort of ubiquitous harmonic geometry. All right, so it would be good to have. All right, so let me change. Sorry, maybe just me, but your mic, your sound seems to be kind of cutting in and out. I don't know if you. Let me just use it speakers somewhat. Is this better? Yes. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. So, all right, so let's start. So, let's talk first about the regularity of the Bondian flows. Sorry, let's talk first quickly about what a regular Bondian flow is. Okay, so the setup, we have XDM, which is RCD space. Okay, and then we have a vector field, which is L2. Okay, so that basically means just if you look at the norm of the vector field, it's Of the vector field, uh, it's uh it's in L2. And so we say that a map from time zero to t across x into x is a regular Lagrangian flow of this vector field, um of this vector field. Um, if the following three conditions hold, well, first, at time zero, it just takes x to x. So, you know, at time if you think about this map as an x, a map from x to x, at time zero, it's identity. The second condition, The second condition is a bit longer. It says if you have a Lipschitz function g, and then for almost every x inside of the space x, the map t to g composed with the flow map is absolutely continuous. And in fact, you can differentiate it and it comes out to be this way. So what this basically means is: so, first of all, this condition kind of forces for almost every x for this to be a continuous curve, okay, like depending on t. Curve, okay, like depending on t. So if you start an x, it's continuous. And then the fact that this derivative is what it is, is basically just saying that it's pointing at the right direction. So at any given time t, it's pointing in the direction of the vector field at that point. So, and of course, since we're working in RCD space, everything's measure almost everywhere, and this is sort of defined by duality, okay, which is fine for us. Okay, and then the third condition. Okay, and then the third condition is that there exist an L so that if you push forward, um sorry, there should be a bracket here. If you push forward the measure under the flow map, so if you sort of fix a T, then it's really a map from X to X. If you push forward the measure, then it's bounded by L M for every time. Okay, so I point out sort of this has a lot to do with the divergence of the vector field, okay, because the divergence of the vector field control. Okay, because the divergence of the vector field controls how the volume behaves as you move along the vector field. And also, this has a lot to do with uniqueness. Okay, so if you think about the situation where the vector field is, let's say you're just on R, and then the vector field is something like root of x. Okay, then if you look at sort of flows, you know, in theory, you can stay at zero for a very little time before you move on. Okay, but then the only type of flow where you have Type of flow where you have this kind of condition is exactly when you sort of move on from zero right away. Okay, so this condition sort of makes sure you have some sort of uniqueness, right? So it's a result of Ambrogio and Trivison that in RCD spaces in particular, although it was a bit more general than this, that if you have a vector field, which is in this, this just means it has an L2 hash, L2 covariant derivative with Covariant derivative with bounded divergence, then it emits a unique regular Lagrangian flow. Okay, so these are the objects of interest. We're going to sort of study the regularity properties of this, in particular, how distance changes as you move along these flows. Okay, so the first thing I want to do, okay, so is to sort of mention the main result. Okay, so I put theorems in quotation marks because it's actually upcoming work. Okay, so I haven't written everything. So, I haven't written everything out fully yet, but so in quotations. So, suppose we have a B vector field, which is in H12. Again, that means it has L2 covariant derivative, and it's supported in some large ball. And then suppose you also know that the norm of the vector field and the divergence of the vector field are O infinity. Okay, now if you consider the flow map, the associated The flow map, the associated regular Lagrangian flow, the claim is that give me any epsilon. Okay, I can find a large set S inside of this ball, okay, and some constants such that, so first of all, the set is large in the sense that if you take it away from the ball radius r, it's less than that epsilon, okay? So we can find a large set, and so that if you pick any x and y in the set. In the set, in the set, and you pick sort of two times, then the change in distance along the flow from time T1 to T2 between X and Y is bounded like so. Okay, so this is the holder bound depending on time. So I'll say quickly that this C0 here and this omega zero, which is sort of just how much time you can look at. How much time you can look at depends on the L2 norm of the covariance derivative, the L infinity norm of B and its divergence, the structural constants K and N, and this epsilon right here. Okay, but the important thing to note is that it does not depend on sort of the distance between X and Y here. And so, in particular, you can compare sort of two points that are Two points that are for a long time, right? Like these things can be very close compared to the time in which you're flowing them by. Okay, and so that's very important. Any questions about this result? Okay, so I'm really saying for a large amount of time, the distance changes in a whole trip continuous manner. Oh, sorry, for a large amount of space. Okay, so then let me first. So, then let me first of all describe what goes on in the smooth setting. And while I'm talking about this, I urge you to sort of pay attention to which part of this will generalize to the RCD setting and what ingredients are missing. Okay, so and I should actually also mention before that that this result is in the full generality for RCD basis, but in the non-collapse case, a version of this was proved in my paper with Elia Brew and Daniela Simola. Elia Bru and Daniela Simola. So I'll talk a little bit about this later as well. Okay, so let's go to the smooth setting. So in the smooth setting, we're looking at a compact Riemannian manifold. I just say compact here just to get rid of the ball radius r, like we a big r, like let's just pretend the diameter is finite. And suppose we have a smooth vector field and let f be the associated flow. So we want to control, we have two points. Want to control? We have two points x and y, okay, inside of the manifold. And for simplicity, let's assume there's a unique geodesic unit speed, let's call it sigma, between x and y. So sigma zero is x and sigma d is y. Okay, so we want to control the distance between x and y as you flow by ft. Okay, and so here I'm just writing out two formulas. First of all, if you differentiate the distance at The distance at time zero between the two flows, then this is the first variation formula. Okay, it basically says that, okay, maybe let me just quickly draw this. If you have X and Y here, and this is your sigma, then and you're sort of entra and you're flowing around here and here. So these are your directions B, then the Then the first derivative in distance as you flow along can be computed sort of using the inner product here minus the inner product here. Okay, that's all. So this is first variations. And then there's a second variations formula, which lets you sort of interpolate sort of what this difference is. So we're interested in this difference because it tells us the derivative. And that basically comes down to the comes down to the covariant derivative of B. It says if you can calculate this difference by integrating along this curve, the covariant derivative of B applied to the tangent vectors of the geodesic along with geodesic. So first variation formula and second variation formula, that's all. And let me just quickly point out that the second variation formula is sort of equivalent to the following thing, right? If you have Following thing, right? If you have your vector field is the gradient of some function, then if you have this formula, which we do in the Ramanian case, it says if you differentiate, you take two derivatives of f composed with the geodesic, and it's a Hessian of F sigma prime sigma prime. So if you integrate this once, ds, this side just becomes the difference of first derivatives, which is exactly this difference right here, right? And then this side. Here, right, and then this side, if you integrate it, is exactly like this, right? Because the Hessian of F is the same thing as the covariant derivative of the gradient of B, right? So as long as you have something like this, then you have the second variation formula. Okay, and the reason why I'm pointing at this out is because later on we'll see that sort of this is what you have in the RCD setting. And so you can expect this type of formula as well. So this is how you would control the distance along the flow. You would control the distance along the flow. Now, notice if you have an L infinity bound on the gradient on the covariant derivative of B, then you actually have pointwise control on this derivative. Okay, because you can just estimate this and therefore estimate this. So the question is, okay, well, what if you don't have L infinity bound? Now, of course, since we're in a compact manifold, you do, but let's pretend we don't have a quantitative L infinity bound, right? Let's pretend we only have a quantitative L2 bound on the covariant derivative. L2 bound on the covariant derivative, how do we handle something like this? Okay, so for this, you wouldn't be able to control things pointwise, right, because it's an integral estimate now you have on the covariant derivative. So what you would try to control instead is the integral distance along the flow. Okay, so in other words, you would try to control, let's say, if you have two sets AB inside of the ball, you would try to control the integral of the distance. The integral of the distance between pairs of points in AB as you move along the flow, between every pair, right? So let AB be in the ball and let sigma xy be a unit speed geodesic so that at time zero it's x and time dxy is y. Then first of all, we can just integrate the formula we had before where x and y can vary across a cross b. So x is anything in a, y is anything in b. Then you get this formula right here. Then you get this formula right here. This is just integrating what we had before on A times B. Okay, now these things are unit speed. The geodesics are unit speed. So this is just norm one, both of these. So you can use Cauchy Schwartz to just get rid of them. So you can estimate this like this, right? And then finally, this is a term that comes up in the segment inequality, okay, which is right here. Okay, so if you. Is right here. Okay, so if you have a function g, which is an L1 lock, and you're trying to integrate g along geodesics between every pair of points and A across B, then there's a bound like this. Okay, so this is from Cheegan Kolding. And so here, this quantity is just, this nambla B is the same thing as your G, basically. Okay, so you can estimate this side using the segment equality like so. Right now, everything here has a measure attached to it because you know what's the size of A cross B? So, really, you want to control the average of this, right? So, if I now add an average, then this kind of spits out an MA times MB here. So, let's move it to the other side, okay? All right, and now let's also take an average of this. So, that means we multiply by measure of B2R. By measure of b2r. Okay, so this quantity is the same thing as one over mb plus one over ma, okay, and you have the measure of ball radius 2r here. So for this to be an effective bound on the average distance derivative, then you really need to have it so that this measure isn't too big compared to the measure of A and the measure of B. Okay, so in other words, you can only So, in other words, you can only expect to have control on the average distance if A and B are large in size compared to the ball itself. Okay, if they're small, then you lose control, right? And so that's important to keep in mind. And that's what you expect, right? Because otherwise you would be able to compare points. And then, as I said before, you shouldn't expect to be able to do that because you don't have L infinity control on the covariant derivative. Okay. Now, notice. Now, notice if you're trying to, so this controls the first derivative. Now, if you're actually trying to go from some time t0 to t1, you would integrate this. Okay, so a so what I'm saying is if you have a bound on the covariant derivative of b integrated on some time interval, then you have a bound on the change in distance on some time interval as well. Okay. Any questions so far? Any questions so far? Okay, good. Okay, so this is a general strategy of sort of what you can do in the smooth setting. And notice basically so far, everything I've introduced does carry over to the RCZ setting. There is something to be said for the second variation formula, which I already kind of alluded to. So now let's go a little bit further and see if we can get the theorem that I claim. And see if we can get the theorem that I claimed at the beginning, right? So, suppose you have a vector field where the covariant derivative in L2 is bounded. And again, the L infinity norm of B and divergence of B is bounded. And if you have F the associated flow. Okay, so first of all, let me introduce a useful transformation. So suppose you have a function g on the manifold, then you can take the maximal function up to the radius rho of g, and that produces. row of g and that produces another function on the manifold okay and the definition of this is that it's just a soup of the average of g on the ball radius r of x okay so x is the input right so you look at all the balls of radius r around whatever the input is you look at the average of g and you take the soup where the radius goes up to rho okay so in particular r could be zero and so this is bounded below by g okay just to point out G, okay, just to point out. Okay, so a fact about this is that if this is standard maximal inequality, is that if you have a function g which is in L alpha, then its maximal function will also be in L alpha, and you have quantitative estimates on the L alpha norm of the maximal function in relation to the L original normal alpha norm of G. And this has to do with basically doubling, okay, which we know R C D spaces have. Okay, so now for each x inside of the space, I'm going to define a function capital G of X like so. Okay, so let me just maybe quickly draw what this is, right? So you have X, okay, and then you have this thing, which is its flow, flow line, right, F T X. And so basically what we do is at each point of the flow line, we We look at sort of the covariant derivative, right? And we also on the ball radius r, okay, where r goes up to 10. And then we sort of look at the supremum of the averages. Okay, so I'm basically looking for the biggest average at each point, and then I'm integrating from zero. integrating from zero to t. Okay, so in particular, if you just pick any tube of radius less than r, less than 10 rather, okay, so if you pick any tube of radius less than 10, so what I mean by this is if you just look at each point and then you pick, you fix an r across all the points, and then you look at the volume radius r, then and then you look at sort of the covariant derivative, then it's it's Then it's going to be bounded by this essentially. All right, so notice that g is in L1. Okay, and the reason why g is in L1 is because the maximal function is in L2, right? Here there is a transformation, but we know Ft is a bounded compression. So even if after you do a change of variables, it's still in L2. Okay, so then you square it, it's in L1, you integrate it across time, right? So it's still L1 on spatially. Still L1 on spatially. So G is an L1, and you can bound its L1 norm. Okay. And it's entirely bounded on sort of the constants H and D, which bound the divergence in the covariant derivative, and also on the structural constants and time itself, total time. Okay, so and so, in particular, if you apply Chebyshev inequality here for any epsilon, you can find You can find large enough C1 so that the volume of the things, of the points which have G, this G bigger than C1, is bounded by epsilon. So what I mean to say here is there is a large set where G is less. This is the same thing as saying there's a large set where G is less than or equal to C1. All right, so let's gather. So let me make. Gather. So let me make a claim here. So the claim is for any x where this is less than this quantity we just defined as less than or equal to c1, then at least half of the ball radius r around ft0 of x will stay close to ft of x in a holder continuous holder manner under the flow. Okay, so the thing I want you to note here is that if g of x is less than or equal to c1, that means I can apply I can apply Cauchy-Schwartz here to say that on a time interval t0 to t1, the maximal up to radius 10 of nabla b is bounded like this. Okay, so this is just applying Cauchy Schwartz to the time interval. Basically, you multiply this by a characteristic of t0 to t1, right? And then apply Cauchy Schwartz on the functions in terms of time. Okay, so. Okay, so why is this true? Okay, so it gets a little bit messy here. So let me maybe quickly just describe the heuristics. So again, we have this flow line starting from X. Okay. And then we have sort of F T 0 X and F T 1 X. Okay. So the first thing to know is that sort of First thing to know is that sort of we have a bound like this, right? And so, in particular, because it's a maximal function, you can think about the radius zero. Okay, so really then you have an estimate on the curve itself, right? It says the integral from t0 to t1 of the covariant derivative, the norm of the covariant derivative is bounded in this manner. Now, notice that the covariant derivative is basically Is basically the lead derivative with respect to the vector field of the metric, okay, which controls sort of the, and this quantity controls the size of the differential of the flow as you move along, right? So being able to control this quantity along this curve means you get to control sort of the norm of the differential. And so in particular, it says infinitesimally. Infinitesimally, the differential sort of you can control its size and it's going to be a holder. And so then by smoothness, you have that it's true for a small ball as well. So for a small ball, a lot of this ball will stay sort of holder close depending on time, right? And then sort of, and then the next argument, basically, you kind of bootstrap your way upwards, right? Bootstrap your way upwards, right? So, if you already know that there's a small ball which stays very close, then you can look at a slightly bigger ball of let's say radius 10r. So, if this is r, we can look at the radius 10r. Okay, we know a lot of this ball stays close, and so and also the ball radius r does have significant size in the ball radius 10r, right? That's just from Bishop Cromoff. That's just from Bishop Gromov. And so, in particular, if you recall what I said earlier about trying to control the total integral distance, it is totally valid to use this as one of your sets, right? Like we're trying to, I was talking about controlling the integral distance between two subsets A and B earlier. And as long as A and B had significant size compared to the larger ball, then you could control the integral distance. And so, in particular, since this has large enough size compared to 10r. Of size compared to 10r, we can, it's totally valid to use this as one of the subsets. And then the sub the other subset we're going to use is maybe, let's say, the ball radius 2R. Okay, which again also has large size compared to the larger red ball. Okay, so now both of the, so based on what I said before, you know, you're moving along a vector field X where you have control. Where you have control on this quantity, right? And this quantity sort of lets you control the integral change in distance between two large subsets within this ball. Okay. And so in particular, if the green one you all know is already staying close to the curve, then this slightly larger ball radius 2R will mostly stay close to the curve as well. Okay, so this is what's giving you control here. This is what's giving you control here. Any questions with this? So this all works basically in the smooth case, and then you get this, what I just claimed here. And then to finally conclude that the change in distance is holder, basically what you could say is, okay, well, let's say you have an x and You have two x's, you have an x and a y where both of them have this estimate right here. Okay, we know we know like a large set of a really large set of points inside of my space have this estimate. So let's pick any x and y so that they have this estimate right here. So I know that a ball of some relatively large size compared to the distance between x and y is staying close to y under the flow. Close to Y under the flow. And the ball here is also staying close to Y under the flow. Okay, so now if you kind of look at, let's say now, a really large ball around the flow line of X right here. These two things, by the way they're chosen, I said, okay, well, let's just pick a radius which is, you know, Just pick a radius which is relatively large compared to the distance between x and y. These two balls will still have significant size compared to this big ball here. And so then you can use the control you have on the covariant derivative in this large tube to sort of control the integral change in distance between these two smaller balls as they go along the flow. So then you know sort of the distance between these two things don't change too much in an integral sense. But then since they're both staying close to these curves. They're both staying close to these curves themselves. That means the curves themselves also cannot change in distance too much. Okay, so again, we're first of all controlling, we're saying, okay, these two things are close to the curve, these two things are staying close to each other, and therefore the curves are staying close to each other, at least in a holder continuous manner. Okay, so this is what lets you prove sort of if you have two points inside with this type of estimate, then there are. Estimate, then their flow lines also have to stay close in a holder-continuous manner depending on time. Okay, so this outlines the argument that you would make in the smooth setting. Notice again that everything I used is more or less available in the RCD setting. And then again, I'll talk about the second variation formula in the next page. Except for this start, except for. This starts for except for the fact that sort of you uh you have this estimate right here, so this is not available in the RCD setting. In particular, you don't get to start with some sort of infinitesimal estimate along the flow line itself. Okay, so this is the main issue we'll have to deal with. All right, so now let me let me quickly mention. So, as I said, one of the key ingredients to all this argument was a Ingredients to all of this argument was a second variation formula and also the first variation formula. So in the RCD setting, the first variation formula is basically for free. The reason why is because if you have a flow of some vector field B, then the flow cross the flow is going to be a flow of the vector field B, direct sum vector field B on the on the space cross itself. And then D is a Lipschitz function. Okay, so then this. Function. Okay, so then this just comes from the definition of a regular Lagrangian flow on x cross x. Okay, so the first variation formula, you can just get it easily. The second variation formula follows from a result of Jigli-Tamanini, which gives the following second-order differentiation formula along a Worscherstein geodesic. It says if you integrate f along a Worscherstein geodesic and you take its second derivative, Take its second derivative, it's what you expect it to be. Okay, so notice I wrote down a point-wise version of this in the Smooth case, and this is just an integral version of that, right? And here, phi is a potential corresponding to the Warshazstein geodesic. And so it's, it wouldn't, so as I mentioned, sort of this gives you the second-order interpolation formula as well in the smooth setting, which lets you interpolate between these two quantities, right? Interpolate between these two quantities, right? And then that's in the same way, once you have this in the RCD setting, you can, after doing a little bit of work, also get the second order interpolation formula in the RCD setting. Okay, but this was this is sort of the key step. All right, so we have both of these, and therefore you can assume what I said earlier about actually using the covariant derivative to control interval distance is completely valid. Okay, so the only thing we're really missing is these. Okay, so the only thing we're really missing is these infinitesimal estimates. All right, so let's let me quickly now talk about the non-collapse case. So, actually, the cool thing about the non-collapse case is that the same idea actually essentially works to get holder regularity from infinitesimal estimates as in the smooth case. Okay, so, and the other thing to note is that you actually do have infinitesimal estimates. So, in other words, you can control, you can understand. You can understand how the flow changes distance infinitesimally along most curves. Okay. So, the reason why you have this is because, and this is coming out of work that sort of was pioneered by Elia and Daniela for RCD spaces. So, the key idea is to just use the Greens function instead of to analyze everything using the Greens function. Okay, so just as a reminder, the Green. So, just as a reminder, the green function, the lambda green function is defined as the following. So, here this is the heat kernel. Okay, so the lambda green function between x and y is just the integral from e to the lambda t of the heat kernel between x and y integrated from zero to infinity. So, this could be a priori infinite, but we have Gaussian estimates on the heat flow, depending on the distance. And so, in particular, if you just pick lambda large enough, I think it's like c times some constant times k, then Constant times k, then this will be a finite thing. Okay. And so I'm not going to say too much about how to handle these objects. I will say sort of three things about them philosophically. So the first thing is that if you look at the Lambda Green's function between two flow lines, this is much easier to estimate than. This is much easier to estimate than the distance between the two flow lines itself. Okay, so that's the first thing to note. And the second thing to note is that in the non-collapse case, G lambda is really controlled on both sides by the distance to the negative n minus 2. So it's kind of equivalent to the distance in some sense. And then the last thing, which was really leveraged in the paper between myself and Ilya and Daniela, is sort of. Myself and Ilya and Daniela is sort of the idea that if you go to the infinitesimal, in other words, if you let y go to x, then g lambda and d are basically exactly the same. It limits to something like this. Notice that these are just constants, right? n minus 2n and omega n. And then theta x is the density of the measure at the point x. And so in the non-collapse setting, this is really nice because it's just constant almost every time. Nice because it's just constant almost everywhere. Okay, so there's not much to deal with here. Okay, so basically, the key idea, building on sort of what Ilya and Daniela did, is sort of, okay, well, let's analyze the Green's function. We can control it. And then infinitesimally, it actually gives us complete information on the distance function. Okay, so controlling the Greens function infinitesimally gives us complete control infinitesimally on the distance function. Okay, and so now we have complete infinitesimal control. And so now we have complete infinitesimal control on the distance function, and then, as I mentioned, you can sort of bootstrap your way upwards again. Okay, so this is really nice. I will say one comment is that the infinitesimal control one gets from this method is quite strong. It's actually optimal. It's basically linear in time, okay, which is stronger than what sort of the holder continuity is able to get you. Okay, so this is what you. Okay, so this is what you do in the non-collapse case. So, how about the collapse case? Well, so the collapse case, this no longer works because you no longer have these nice things for the Greens function. And even if you did, notice that this density isn't as nice anymore, right? It's not constant almost ever. It can change. So, even if you're able to control the Greens function, that doesn't necessarily give you control on the distance function unless you knew how this theta x was changing. How this theta x was changing, okay, which you don't. So, and so in the collapse case, you don't get these infinitesimal estimates, and I don't actually know how you would do it. Okay, so instead, we would just try to get the older estimates right away, okay, without actually dealing with the infinitesimal part. Okay, so let's talk about the general non-smooth case. So, recall that for each x inside of the space itself, we define something like this. Defined something like this, and this was basically an estimate. You can think of it as sort of an estimate of the norm of nabla b or the covariant derivative of b along tubes of this nature, where this is this is ftx. Okay, so if you have, if you if you bound this, then you bound the size of the covariant derivative along this tube for all tubes up to, let's say, radius 10. Up to, let's say, radius 10. So, as I mentioned before, this thing was naturally an L1 for each as a function of x. And we can, for each epsilon, find a C1 so that the size of the X's with G greater than C1 is less than epsilon. In other words, there's lots of almost a lot of your space has G less than or equal to C1. Less than or equal to C1. Okay, so we're going to call these points C1 nice points. Okay, so C1 nice points are the ones where if you look at the covariant derivative along these tubes up to a radius of 10, you have estimates. You can bound the covariance derivative squared averaged along this by C1. That's all I'm saying, right? So in other words, we have a lot of C1 nice points. Of C1 nice points. Okay, so now we consider any x which is a density point in the set of C1 nice points. You know, so C1 nice points take up almost all of your space or almost all of your really large ball. And then you look at its density points. Again, that's almost everything as well, right? And so consider any x, which is the density points of the C1 nice points, and any radius so that if you look at the C1 nice points in the ball radius R. The C1 nice points in the ball radius r, and you compare it to the size of ball radius r itself, it's greater or equal to a half. Okay, so since you're a density point, this is going to happen starting from some radius depending on x. Starting from some radius and for things which are smaller, this is going to hold. So we fix an x which is density point, and then we fix a radius where this is happening. Okay. So, oh, right. So let me let me now. Oh, right. So let me now argue sort of what you should expect for these density points. Okay. And so this really comes back to something that I did also for the holder-continated tension cones. Okay. So let's say we have this ball radius. So let's say we have x right here. Okay. And let's just do everything at time zero. Let's forget about the intermediate time. So we start at time zero and we go up to. Start at time zero and we go up to a certain amount of time, right? So, this is we start at x, okay, and we look at a ball radius r. So, this is this is r and then we know that at least half of this ball consists of these c1 nice points. Okay, so there's there's a large portion of this ball that are c1 nice. And so, in the sense that, so and again, this means that if you picked a C1 nice point and looked at the tube around the C1 nice point. Looked at the tube around the C1 nice point instead, you also have reasonable hash messages, so covariant derivative estimates, right? So, so now what you here's what you do: um, so we fixed an R. So maybe I'm gonna bolt this, fixed an R. Okay, and we now have these C1 nice points. Okay, so now let's look at also the ball radius, let's say 10R. 10r okay, so it's all radius 10r, okay, and then we have this curve right here, right? So this is ftx. Okay, so as I mentioned, since we don't have sort of an initial if and a decimal estimate to bootstrap on, in theory, this could just sort of start leaving right away, right? Start leaving right away, right? So, what I'm saying is that sort of this ball right here, in theory, it could just mostly do something like this, okay? Because we have nothing to hold it to this line right here. Before, if you had a smaller ball, which was close to this line, then you can hold this larger ball to the, if you had a small, smaller ball that's close to this line, you can hold a slightly larger ball close to this line as well. Okay, but we don't have that in this case, so we could just do something like this. But even though we Like this. But even though, when it's doing something like this, it still takes some amount of time to leave this large tube. So the minimum amount of time it takes is exactly dependent on the radius and the L infinity norm of the vector field. So at minimum to leave this tube, the amount of time it would take. So let's say you're leaving at this point, something has left. Point you something has left the tube, the minimum amount of time it would take is something like, let's say, 9r divided by the L infinity norm of the vector field. Okay, so this isn't nice because it depends on the radius. Okay, and so in particular, if you just took this, then you can only get estimates between two points for a time, which depends on the radius. Okay, so in other words, you can't compare them to far away, which is something we'll. Can't compare them to far away, which is something that we like to do. So the key observation here is: okay, well, in this short amount of time, you're still staying within this tube. Okay, so in particular, like everything in this ball is staying within this large red tube under the flow. And also, if you look at sort of the following two sets, so let's say A is your C1 nice points. Your C1 nice points in the ball radius BR, and then B is just the ball radius R. Okay, if you look at these two sets right here, both of them for this amount of time is staying within the large red tube, and also they have significant size compared to the tube itself. Okay, because again, Bishop Gromov. So, in particular, So, in particular, you can actually sort of use the estimates I mentioned earlier, and these two things are both subject to this really nice covariant derivative estimate of the large red tube. Okay, so the conclusion is most of A and most of B stay close to each other under. Underflow up to time 9R B O infinity. Okay, so at least till this short amount of time, you know, some things can drift apart, but mostly you're subject to the really nice covariant derivative, so you still have all the reasonable estimates. Okay, but at this point, you could have drifted very far away from this curve. Okay, like everything's staying mostly. Like everything stays mostly close together, but from one curve, it could be far apart, right? So then the key observation is sort of we just we just we just change the anchor, right? So instead of looking at the blue line, we now take a one of these nice points, look at the associated flow line to it instead, okay? So because this is a nice point, it has the same. It has the same covariant derivative estimates around a tube around this as the original red tube. Okay, so now if so, what I'm saying is if you take a red tube around this ball and you sort of move it along here, you have nice estimates as well. Okay, so in this way, you sort of switch your anchor and then you say, okay, well, you make the same argument again, right? So up from time zero to time nine R divided by. To time 9r divided by this, everything is staying close, most of the things are staying now close to this green line. Okay, afterwards, it could again drift apart, but then it still takes a certain amount of time to do so. And then all that time, it's being subjected to the really nice covariant derivative estimates that you have associated to this green line. And so you can go further and further and further. Okay. And so that's the key idea. And so, in particular, what you end up with is the following. The following. So let me maybe write this quickly. The thing you get to conclude is there is some Y in the ball radius R, which is nice. So maybe let me just write it this way. Which is nice, which is C1 nice. Yeah, so that. So that most of the ball radius R around X stays close to Y in a holder continuous manner. For an amount of time independent of radius. Okay, so that's the conclusion of the argument that I mentioned earlier. Okay, so now what you do is you actually get to repick your original trajectory. So what I mean is, okay, so you had ftx, okay, and at every single scale r, you found another curve, which is called fty, where Where in fact it is what most of this ball is sticking close to. Okay, so most of this ball is sort of sticking close to this curve instead of maybe possibly this one. Now, it could be that it's also staying as close to this curve, but we don't know that. All we know is that most of this ball is staying close to this new curve instead. Okay, and so you can do this at every single radius. So if you use a smaller radius, again, you can find a nice point. Again, you can find a nice point so that the small ball is staying close to it. So, in this way, you get a sequence of flow lines, and then you can take a limit of that. And then you end up with maybe a limiting curve. Let's say right here. Okay, and my claim is that sort of this is sort of a canonical choice for what the flow line with respect to x should be. Okay, so I mean, right. Okay, so I mean, regular Lagrangian flow is defined measured theoretically, so you can always alter it up to a set of measure zero and it doesn't change anything. But it's kind of cute in the sense that for certain points, in particular density points, to these C1 nice points, there is a canonical choice of what the flow line should be, right? The reason why the black line should be preferred over the blue line is because the black line has this really nice holder property in the sense that if you Nice holder property in the sense that if you start with a ball around the black line under the flow, almost everything will stay close to the black line as well, right? Whereas the blue line doesn't have this property. Okay, so in this way, there's a canonical choice of what the flow lines should be to your regular Lagrangian flow, okay? Which again, I think is kind of cute, right? And so now it takes some argument to say that, okay, well, this line actually. Say that, okay. Well, this line actually, if you replaced, if you took sort of all your C1 nice density points and then you replaced them with this replacement, that it's still a regular Lagrangian flow and therefore agrees with the original almost everywhere. And this comes from the fact that you can just check the definition. So I'm not going to do that, but it's basically these curves differentiate ellipsis functions sufficiently close. Ellipsis function sufficiently close to the original. And so you can, in the limit, it'll actually be the same. So it ends up being fine. Okay, any questions here? Okay, good. So let me now talk about something. Sorry, I have a question. Yeah. Do you know if this avoids the singular set? The singular set if your flow lines are avoiding the singular set at all? Sorry, does what avoid the singular? Does the this canonical flow line f t of x does it uh I think in the Almost everywhere it does, I think. That's all you can say. Because I think along the lines of proving this, you actually get volume density control. And then, so if you and in some sense, you get the same type of thing that you. you you get the same type of thing that you would you get like the same thing as the holder continuity attention cones essentially along most almost every single flow line um and so in that sense then if you put in a measure theoretical argument to say okay well almost all these lines have dense regular points then you can conclude that in fact you have regular points among along all these flow lines i think that would work i actually hadn't thought about this but i Actually, I hadn't thought about this, but I would expect anything that worked for the holder continuity tension cones would carry over here. Okay, it's not squeezing too much. Okay, great. Thanks. Yeah. Pardon? Yes, it's not squeezing the meshes too much or lowering the dimensions too much. It's controlled like that. Thanks. Right. Okay. So just to conclude, basically, now we've established that sort of there's a canonical choice. That sort of there's a canonical choice almost everywhere, and for everything in the canonical choice, you have these nice holder properties, which is which is nice. Okay, uh, so let's talk about some applications of this, and I'll I guess I'll have to breathe over things quickly. So, let's so null applications of this type of idea is holder continuity tangent cones, which is basically if you have, let me just, so if you have an R C D space, and for simplicity, we just put And for simplicity, we just put the curvature bound to be negative n minus one. And then you have pq in the space itself with distance, again, for simplicity equals to one. You can take a geodesic and then you cut off sort of the delta ends. Okay, and then the claim is that if you take a ball radius r here and the ball radius r here that are sufficiently small. That are sufficiently small where R0 is sort of depending on and delta, then the change in point and Gomal-Hausdorff distance is sort of dependent in the time distance here. Okay. Okay, so I'll mention quickly why this is actually sort of a very specific case of what we just talked about. Okay. And then just another application that's an extension of the hotel continuity contention cones is the fact that RCD space is non-branching. So in other words, if you start with two geodesics which agree for some amount of time, then they'll sort of agree for the same amount of time still. Okay, so the idea of the proof behind the holder tangent continuity tangent cones is as follows. Tangent continuity tangent cones is as follows. Okay, so you're trying to construct an approximation from this ball to this ball, right? And what you do is you just, for any point here, you connect it to P like this. And then you hope it lands in this ball. Okay. And it turns out for most of it, it does. Some of it actually leaves, which is fine, but most of it will stay in here. But we have to show this, right? In here, but we have to show this right. So, this map where you move this point here by the distance t1 minus t0, I'm just going to call it the gradient flow of negative dp. Okay, because this is sort of a flow line of negative dp. There's a choice involved sometimes because geodesics might not be unique, okay? But you just pick one and then you move it here, okay? So, measure theoretically, this is well defined, right? Theoretically, this is well defined, right? So you take this map right here, and that's what most of this approximation is going to be. Okay, so now let me convince you that almost everything stays in here. So first of all, the distance function isn't smooth enough. Okay, so in particular, you can't apply the second variation formula to the distance function in the RCD setting. And so what I said before for regular Lagrangian flows of vector fields with L2. Vector fields with L2 covariant derivatives doesn't apply here. Okay. But the key observation, this was made by Kolding neighbor, was that instead of looking at the distance function, you can look at the heat flow approximation of the distance function. And if you're trying to sort of construct an approximation of radius r, then the thing you look at is the heat flow approximation up to time r squared. Okay, so to get into how this works, let me just introduce a quick terminology. So an R geodesic. Quick terminology. So, an R geodesic from P to Q is a curve sigma from P to Q, so that the length of the curve is almost the length of the geodesic, the length of the distance between P and Q. So it's like one plus R squared times the distance between P and Q. Now, if you assume the distance between P and Q is just one, which we did at the very beginning, just for simplicity, it's just one plus R squared. And so, what's true by integral Abercrombie Gromaul inequality, and you can find Aberchman-Gromaul inequality, and you can find this in Mondino-Nebras, for example, is that there are lots of points x around a ball radius r in gamma t0, so that the curve pxq is an r geodesic. Okay, so if you look at a ball radius r here, that's well within the delta. So you again draw up this delta n points. Look at a point here. Lots of these curves will be in. Lots of these curves will be in our geodesic. Okay, so this is not. When I say lots, I just mean like there's a quantitative lower bound on the measure of the amount of these points compared to the measure of the ball, right? Okay, so lots of these are R geodesics. And what is known, and so these are these points, I should say, are also called points of R squared access. That's another language for this. So what's So, what's known about R geodesics is that if you take an R geodesic and if you look at again this tube, you look at the Hessian of HR squared on the ball radius 10r along the geodesic itself. So these tubes, again, they're bounded nicely. Okay, in the same way that it was bounded before when I was talking about the regular Lagrangian flows. Okay, and then the other key thing to note is that the gradient of distance function and the gradient of the heat flow. Distance function and the gradient of the heat flow approximation of the distance function are kind of close as well. Okay, and so what these two things combine lets you do is it actually lets you control the flow, the distance between the flow in some integral sense as well. Okay, so now instead of these C1 nice functions, what you replace them with are just these functions of low excess because you notice that they have the same features in the sense that they have good Hessian bounds along these tubes. That they have good Hessian bounds along these tubes or good covariant derivative long bounds along those tubes. So you can make the same argument essentially, replacing the C1 nice functions with the points of R squared axis. And then everything basically goes through. And that's how you control the distance along this flow. And it's going to be the same thing. It's going to be holder-continuous in matter. Okay, so. Okay, so as I said, arguing as before, you can conclude. So this is why, sort of what I, so what I just said for the regular Lagondrum flow is just a slightly more general case of the argument here. But in fact, the essence to sort of overcoming the lack of smooth structure is the same. It's arguing by sort of moving these anchors around and being flexible with how you choose your tubes. Okay, so and then I don't think I'd have time for this. So this also lets you prove non-branching. Okay, but I don't think I have a minute left, so I'll leave it there. Some other applications that I want to point out that was used in the smooth and the Rigi limit case for these for the flows of L2 vector fields. There's two that come to mind, but I'm sure there are more. One is the generalized Margulis Lemma by Calvin. The generalized Margulis Lemma by Kapovich and Wilkins. It says: if you have a compact manifold with region bounded below by negative n minus one and diameter bounded above, then if you look at the fundamental group of m, it contains a new potent subgroup of index less than or equal to c n, and then the nopotent basis of length less than or equal to n. So, this is something I'm actively working on right now with Dimitri Navarro. So, I'm not going to claim it for CD spaces because we haven't really resolved everything yet. Resolved everything yet. But so, what I'll say is, sort of, this is true for the sort of proof of this heavily involves being able to understand the holder continuity of flows of vector fields where you have control on the L2 norm of the covariant derivative. Okay, so there's hopes that if you can do this in the RCD setting, you can just carry this over. Of course, here, you would have to replace this with the revised fundamental group. And then another thing which is a result of Kapovich non-Li is the sort of metric measure holder-continuity tangent cones. It says if you have a Ricci limit space, then the tangent cones are holder-continuous in the interior of Richie limits with respect to the string distance. Okay, and it's basically the same estimate I did before for pointed Gomev-Hausdorff, right? And it's, and the argument here also heavily involves being able to estimate. Heavily involves being able to estimate the hotocontinuity of flows of sobola vector fields. Okay, so I think this is a good place to stop. Thank you very much. Are there any questions, comments? Agin, thanks a lot for this beautiful talk. Just a question. How we should interpret this last slide? So are both kind of a work in progress or is one of the two say the measure? Say, I know that you're working with Dimitri on the first one, but say on the second one, is it done or is it also something you are thinking of? Second one, I'm very confident about. Okay. Because it's sort of. Because it's sort of, I think, just with what the result I presented in today's talk and sort of what I understood from Vitali talking to him, the argument just carries over directly to the RCD setting. The first one, there's some nuances to to the I mean, it's a really long paper, so I mean already understanding the paper is not real work, yeah. The paper is not real work, yeah. Yeah, and say, and um, right, um, can you maybe in the questions, uh, can you briefly sketch the idea of the of the non-branching? So how does the non-branching follows from the estimates? Uh, yeah, sure. So, um, okay. Uh, yeah, so I would have talked about this if I had more time. So, I guess thanks for the opportunity to actually. For the opportunity to actually present this. So basically, if you'll say something is a good geodesic, delta good geodesic, if you look at its delta interior and it has this nice holder property, right? So like, I don't claim control on the delta, delta side, on this part and this part, but at least inside of this interior, we have, so this is good holder control. Let's say whatever that means, right? And then I say a geodesic is good if for any delta, it's delta good. Okay, so in the sense that if you kind of cut off any delta piece, then inside of this, you have good holder control on small balls as you flow along the negative grab dp. So, what was basically just shown is that if you start with a geodesic, Start with a geodesic, you can sort of, and you pick a delta here. You can sort of construct a delta good geodesic. So, this is from P to Q. You can construct a delta good geodesic. Always. Okay, that's basically what the argument ends up leading to. So, then sort of this will have really nice property inside of this interior. Inside of this interior. And so now, if you do this for every delta, you can come to a limit geodesic, possibly not the original one. Okay, and this will be just good. Okay, so we'll keep this. So you take a limited delta goes to zero of these delta good geodesics constructor, you get a good geodesic. Okay, so let me just say if you have two good geodesics, then non-branching can occur. Okay, so if they're both good. Okay, and it's because if it did occur, then you can pick a small, if you can pick two small balls, which are small compared to the amount of branching that has happened. And then basically the argument, basically what you would understand is that sort of these two small balls, first of all, has to still stay close to the, most of it stays close to the geodesics, okay, because that's what it means to be good. And the other thing is that. The other thing is that while you're proving everything, you actually show the volume changes in a holder-continuous manner as well. So, in fact, the volume of this ball compared to this ball shouldn't change too much. So, now you're flowing two separate balls of really large size into this big ball, and the volumes don't change much. So, that's impossible. You can't fit it in there, right? So, if you have too good geodesic, then this just can't happen, right? So, now let's. So now let's. We don't know a priori all geodesics are good, right? So let's assume we start with just two geodesics, which has branching. So what you could do is you could construct in the manner I described here a good geodesic between this point and this point. Okay, so this is good. Okay, so you just kind of forget about the rest first and uh. And just focus on this part and then construct a geodesic, good geodesic from here. Okay, now notice that this curve right here is also a geodesic, right? Like where you just put these two things together. And so in particular, you could carry out this construction again, right? So in other words, I carry out this delta-good construction on this geodesic right here. Here. So it'll maybe do something like this. But the key thing to note here is that this is delta good, which means the red line is delta good, which means it has good behavior inside of this interval. And then this black line is just good everywhere. Okay, and that's actually enough for you to argue in the same way that I did here that this can't be branching. Okay, so in fact, this delta. Okay, so in fact, this delta good line can't actually branch off here. It needs to continue with the black line up till this point. Okay, so this picture is actually impossible. And what you actually end up needing to have is when you do this construction is something like this. Okay, so this will be the new delta good line constructed from sort of this geodesic right here. Now you can do this for every delta, and so and then take a limit, and then you also And then take a limit, and then you ultimately produce a good, good line, maybe a good geodesic, maybe this one. Okay, it doesn't look like a geodesic, but share with me. And then you do the same thing with the other, same construction with this other curve as well. So then you construct also a completely good geodesic like this. Okay, so now notice that these two lines are now both good. Okay, and then by again, this argument, there couldn't have been any brand. This argument, there couldn't have been any branching. So, this picture is impossible. All right, thank you. Yeah. Are there further questions? If not, let's thank Chen again.
