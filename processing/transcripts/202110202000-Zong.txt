 It's my pleasure to start this morning's session with Professor Chuan Ming Zong's talk on characterizations of three-dimensional multiple types. So, thank you very much for the introduction. And I'm very grateful to the organizer, in particular, Professor Ye, for organizing such wonderful activities in the pandemic. Today, I would like to report some brandly new progress on the multiple tiding. So, very recently, Very recently, we made some progress to prove the following result. I just state the result now. If a convexbody can form a two-fold, three-fold, or four-fold translative tiling of the three-dimensional space, then it must be a parallelotope hexagon principle longbeak that Dedocahijo, erongated the docahijo, or truncated octahedral. This is one of these five. This five object was discovered more than 100 years ago, but that was for the lattice tiding. But now we can extend it to this theorem. Okay, this is the theorem, and then we start from the beginning. And the story started very early. Started very early. So, in the whole talk, we only need three or four definitions. Okay, it's very simple. We do not need PDE and the others, the integral. In the n-dimensional Euclidean space, assume A1, A2, En are linear independent vector, then we can produce a lattice, which is a discrete group generated by E1. Generated by A1, A2, and AN. It's very simple. The concept was introduced by Gauss in the 80s, 1840s, I think. And this is a graph for the two-dimensional one. So let P be a convexbody and let X be a discrete set in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. If p plus x, this means translated by the pointer of x, is a tiling of the n-dimensional space, then we call the p a translative tail. In particular, if the discrete translative set is a lattice, then we call p a lattice tail. It's a very simple sense. And in 1885, the 85, the Fidorov, the Russia crystallographer, who characterized how the three-dimensional lattice tale. His work is very long, it's more than 100 page long. But the main theorem of that paper is a three-dimensional lattice tail must be a parallelotope, a hexagonal prismal, a rhombic tedocahedral. Rhombic tedocahedral, erongated the docahedral, or a truncated octahedral. This is the five object on the right. In the previous page, it's the same. So the object was discovered in 1885. This is for the lattice tiling. And this is relatively simple. You can say when we fix a lattice, then we... When we fix a lattice, then we can produce the delikate volonois here and then can produce this object. And but if you well, we can produce this object, but if to prove only this object is not so simple, that is why Fidolov's paper, in fact, is a small booklet, is so complicated. So if we wanted to extend If we wanted to extend the result into high dimension, even just extend Fidelov's result to high dimension, it's very non-trivial. In the four dimension, it was done by Delon Lee, Stoking, and Peter Inge. The story was very dramatic. In between, somebody, I forget, it's Stoking or Delonee, announced a Announce a complete solution. After years, Peter Inger discovered a new one. But anyway, now we know in the four dimension, there are 52 combinatoric different types in the four dimension. In the five dimension, then with the just with the logical, it's no longer we can handle it. Longer we can handle it. So, with the computer program, there are several mathematicians, in particular Aches Sherman in Germany, they were able to classify it. The paper is quite long, published in the crystallography journals. Okay. To be honest, I forget it in the five. How many and different classes here? Maybe more than a thousand. Okay. And in this direction, there is another very famous conjecture. In 1908, the famous Wollonoi made the following the reader conjecture. Every let me make it here. Oh, yeah. Every parallel hedge is a linear image of the deliquitate volonois here in the suitable of a suitable lattice. This is very simple sounding, but if to find a regular proof is very complicated. We only know up to dimension four, this is correct, which was proof by Delaunay. By Delaunay more than 100 years ago, more or less. And in high dimension, this is still open. Okay, this is the situation for the lattice. Then we turn to the non-lattice case, try to see whether we can get more. Well, during this workshop, we already heard many times the name of Minkowski, the Brun Minkowski, and so on. Here is for some other things. Here is for some other things discrete. In 1897, Minkowski proved that a translator tail must be a central symmetrical convex polytope. This is a very important step further. And based on his work, there are some mathematicians, in particular, some Russian mathematicians that seriously attack the program on the attack the program on the translating time. So here is another technical definition. As I already said, we only have a couple of them, but we need a couple of them. Let P be an n-dimensional central symmetrical concern with the central symmetrical phys, like this guy here. And assume F is an N minus two-dimensional phase. dimensional phase here in the three-dimensional case the F here is an H which is the A minus two dimensional face then we call the set of all phaset of P each contain two translator for F as a subface set here for example the F1 have this F here and this one so F1 is one element of the phaset then turn around The V set, then turn around, hold this circle, then form the set is an ab of the P. Okay, this is a very intuitive concept, okay, but very important during the research. So through the work of Minkowski, Volonoi, Wenkov, Alexander, and Peter McMullen, we have the following fundamental theorem. Serium. This Peter McMahon's redoubt was, I think, in the 1980s. And when he published the paper, somebody pointed out Menkov already had such an approved. So Peter McMarlin published an acknowledgement of the proof. Anyway, the theorem said, let P be an n-dimensional conx body, then the following three states. Then the following three statements are equivalent. So if P is a trislative tail, and then it is a lattice tail, then structurally, P is an essential symmetrical concolytope with the central symmetrical physet such that each bill contains four or six phys, not more. Since it is a central symmetric, so you only So you only have two pair or three pair, okay, opposite. This is a very strong theorem from the structure point of view. Okay, we already finished some of the basics. Okay, then another concept, the sonotope. Let a P be an dimensional concept polytope. We call it an. We call it an zonotope if it is a Minkowski sum of a finite number of segments. So, in other words, the S1, S2, SW are the segment, then we make the Minkowski sum produce a tonotope like this one on the right hand. So, clearly, the tonotope are central symmetric. In fact, each every Each every phase of a sonotopy is a centralized symmetric as well. Okay, so now come to the multiple tidy. Let P be a convex body and let X be a discrete set in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. If P plus X is both a care-fault packing and a care-fault. And the K for the covering in the Euclidean space, we call it K for the tiling and call P for the translative tail. In particular, if X is a lattice, we call the P a K for the lattice tail. Intuitively, this is just a concept extension of the one-fold tiling. So in other Tiding. So, in other words, in the whole space, every point was covered exactly k times, except the boundary. The boundary is a zero measure point, so it doesn't matter at all. But the most point was exactly covered by k times. So this is well much near in 2012. In 2012, three mathematicians studied the multiple tiling in general dimension and discovered the following result. I know the C Nai Robinson very well and have a lot of discussion with him. Professor he is not here today. Okay. Well, this is the picture here. Picture here, so hopefully it makes trouble. Then, Robinson and his colleague discovered the following theorem, which is very important for us. N-dimensional K-ford translative tail is a central symmetric polytope with central symmetric visat. In particular, every three-dimensional K-fought translator is an authentope. Is an zonotope. So in three dimensions, we have lucky have such an consequence that which is a sonotope. But in four dimension, this is not true. Since we know in four dimension, one of the tail, one of the translative tail is a 24 cell, which is not an osonotope. So in three dimensions, we are really lucky. And when we make this program, When we make this program and have a correspondence with Professor Robinson, well, we both believe we are really lucky. So why the tone of work? Since, well, here is a little bit technical, okay, but if you can, if I cannot make you clear, I just forget. Assume the G is an age of the polytope. Age of the polytope with endpoint at the origin. And the B G is the build produced by the G. And like here, this is the G, G one here. And then we have the bell turn around. And we look at this V set here, the Fi, and since it was determined. And since it was determined by the GI, so here this is the height, we just frame this direction and then, for example, here, we just make the parallel line here, here, here, and so on. Then produce such a one, produce an R I. This means if the visit here was produced like this one, then Produce like this one, then plus another one, the g one, which is the here is the mu zero. Okay, and we get rid of the mu zero, then reduce such a one. Then this lemma is very simple. If the F1 is here, some then we plus by the reduced one, the R i, then hold this. I, then all this set, the Minkowski sum here, is contained, is a subset of the whole polytope, which is a sonotope. This lemma is simple, it's relatively intuitively very clear, but you have to make the expression here clear. Here is a little bit technical, okay? And then if we want Uh, if we want to study the multiple tiding, and this is a breaking through. Uh, that in fact, several years ago, uh, Chi Yang, who was a student of me at that time at Peking University, and now he, I think today, she went to Israel to do his post-work. Okay. Several years ago, we together work on this subject on Subject in the plan, and then we produce the adjacent realm. This here is very confusing, but we look at the picture, okay? And if we start with one object, well, we just at the plan, okay, and we start with the p plus xij here, and we fix some point v here and Here. And if this is a tiling, it's an a multiple tiling. This means very smoothly every point was covered by the k times. So at this vertex, it must be another one like here, this one, join properly at the edge. Well, here we just look at the planks. Join properly at the edge, or here, like the right one, there are some. The right one there somewhere in the in the at some point of the edge, but anyway, it has to turn around properly at the end. So start with the this one, black one, then came this blue one here, then at this point you have to another one. Anyway, turn around at the end, join properly. Otherwise, cannot produce multiple tiding. Okay. Multiple tiding. Okay. In this way, we produce an adjacent, adjacent very well, adjacent wheel, and then we produce a multiplicity index. Okay. So we define such an we define such an vertex v at the v and the And the roughly away at this point. Well, geometrically, here is the tiling multiplicity at the V when the V is in the boundary point. And here is the multiplicity produced when the P is an interior point. So the multiplicity together. Together is the sum of these two. So this is very simple. But when we produce this guy and try to compute it and to study the angle joined together, there are some elementary number theoretical property which can work together at the end. At the very beginning, we did not wish we were so lucky. Wish we were so lucky. But anyway, they are very complicated technical lemma. At the end, it works. But anyway, we have some technical lemma. The lemma two is in fact more or less like this one here. When we start with the phase here and we make the Minkowski sum, this means we This means we move the RI, just let this point touch this facet and turn around. And then we produce another part of the object which belong to the P. Then we look at the interior point, then produce the lemma 2. And the counting come here is this one is more important and more useful. One is more important and more useful if we work on an edge of the polytope and look at get rid of the zero measure point, then we get a general position of the edge and to compute this the well the adjacent well part and when we worked And when we work together out, they produce two parts. That was the lucky point. And one is if the build which produced by this guy have two m. Well, the m is somewhere here, but this is important here. Well, here, okay. In lemma two, this means the bill of determined by a fixed h have so many element, two times, two, two m element. And then the multiplicity. The multiplicity here is an integer times m minus one over two, and another integer L times half. Okay, this formula is important for the analysis later. And then we have some another technical Technical analysis and so on. This means to get rid of the zero measure point and etc. But anyway, then we produce the counting of the interior part. The boundary part was can be handled by the previous technique. And here is the interior. This means if we This means if we, when the number of the bill, well, the number of the element at the bill, then it come here, minus through over two, then get, we get again some sense for the verf of p weights. And this is the relatively non-technical, but it's already. Technical, but it's already quite technical. And then we, since our game, our goal is to prove when the number of the bill is less than six, then can reduce to the Winko-McMarlin theorem, then can come to the Then can come to the Fidelov's result. Then, based on this preparation, what we need to do is to analyze what happens when the number of the element in the bill is larger. Okay, so here, if p plus x is Plus X is in a toll for tiling. Assume this is an arbitrary toll here. And assume the G is age of the polytope. Then we look at the build produced by determined by the G and assume it has two M phys determined by this in this view. And then we what we Then sometimes we need to project it into the XY plane, assume the G is perpendicular to the XY plane and use the projections. And then we can use the planar case. So use some technical, we will say a little bit for the technical, okay? But the idea is But the idea is we first lemma if the number well here you remember 2m is the number of deficit in the bill determined by this age. So if m is 4, then we can prove the multiplicity of the title is larger than or equal to 5. Equal to five. This is one of the most difficult technical lemma in the proof. It is, well, we recall the multiplicity toll is the sum of the age part, the boundary part and the interior part. And the hard part is the boundary part, which is an integer. An integer times when the m is 4, 4 minus 1 is 3, so we came two-third times kappa, then plus the L times 1 half. And since the kappa is at least one, it's an integer, positive integer, and L is a non-negative integer. Therefore, Negative integer. Therefore, here this number together at the end is another integer. Therefore, here is larger than or equal to four, equal to two. And on the other hand, this guy, we know it is at least one. And so we have only a couple of cases needed to be to handle. So if the So if the is larger than four, then we immediately get one is four, another is at least one is already larger than five. And if this guy is three, and then we just to look at this equation, with here is three, we try and here is an. And here is an integer, here is another integer. We try to see how many possibility. So there are only either the L is larger than zero or is equal to zero. And we're defined, we're just to consider a couple of different possibilities. But here is already the geometry is very complicated, but I do not want to confuse you. Do not want to confuse you, but anyway, just to look at this couple of possibilities, and in particular, to deal with sometimes we need to consider 10 or so different cases. It's rather boring, but as you can imagine, the number of the cases is not so good, but it can be handled by. It can be handed by. Okay. And so for the case when the L is larger than zero, we can get the this guy here is larger than two, then plus the fact that the other part is three, then we get at least five. And then another case is L equal to zero, then the adjacent will fall. Adjacent will fix. We start with, for example, here is the starting point, the black one. And then we need this yellow one, have to join here very perfectly since the L is already zero. This means hold this guy in this JSON wheel to This JSON wheel to join properly at the V point. You cannot at the middle point or somewhere in the H if you project it. And so the configuration, in fact, in this case, is unique since it's just two times. Each time is two-thirds. And then since this configuration is unique, then you analyze. Then you analyze the possibility if one another guy came to at least an interior point of two or three other polytopes in this translative configurations. And then by consider this possibility, then we get another one, which is at least five. Which is at least five, then the most straight way is this number, the alpha v is two. This means at every point, okay, at every proper time. And then the configuration is more complicated. But anyway, since the possibility is only a number of Cases you need to hand it to try to sort away the different equations with only two or three possibility, but you have to be careful. To be honest, even in the plan case, three years ago, I made several mistakes. When I put the papers on the ICAF, then the next day I realized I made a mistake and get a headache. A headache and then, but anyway, uh, we ourselves found the miscape, not the other code. Okay, in this here, we try to look at every point and assume all every point satisfy this simple equations. This means the kappa is equal to one and L is equal to The L is equal to as well. But so, well, better not to go to the very technical detail. And in this way, we produce, we get the when the number of the bill, number of the element in the bill is eight, this means. Is eight. This means m is four. We get the multiplicity is at least four. I'm sorry, here I came to this thing. I cannot get rid of it. Okay. And when the bill, the number of the element in the bill is 10, this means m is equal to 5. Is equal to five here? The toll is five. This lemma is not as complicated as the previous one, since when the number of the element in the bill is small, is the smallest, this means the eight, and the technical you need, you have to analyze more cases. And here, And here, when the m is 5, we need to get some complicated figure, but not as complicated as that one. But at the end, we get the multiplicity is at least five. And similarly, when the number of the element in the bill is six, we get the multiplicity is at least six. And when the m equal to seven, we get the multiplicity. When it's very larger, it's larger than or equal to eight, then we are free. The toll is at least seven. Here, we need sometimes need the colorful figures, okay? But anyway, we are lucky in these directions, and so in this. And so, in this case, we just look at if the number of the element in the build is larger, we can easily get rid of. And when it is smaller, we look at and hand it. Then at the end, we can use the Winkoff McMarlin theorem and we when the And when the multiplicity is less than or equal to four, then the number of the element in the build is at most six. So this means only two possibility, have four or six. Then apply the theorem at the very beginning here. Very beginning here, this one, and in particular, this two. If P is a central symmetric concuss polytope with the central symmetrical physic, such that each bill contains four or six phys, and then it is a lattice tail, which is only have Is only have five possibilities like here, the Fidelof. So this is the reduction idea. So the proof detail is really boring and complicated. And you can imagine in the plan case, it's already very hard, like the figure here. Figure here, and this is only the projection from the three-dimensional space. Therefore, the three-dimensional case by the imagination is okay, but try to get the picture is not so easy. But anyway, we are lucky since in the three dimension, we know it is onotope, then can use the projection. Otherwise, we even cannot do this. Otherwise, we even cannot do this. And so we luckily get this result. And through this technical lemmas, we can deduce every bill of a five-fold translative tail in the three-dimensional space has at most 10 facets. In fact, we have examples. In fact, we have examples, it really has 10 facets. And for example, here on the right hand, this purple figure, which this is a cylinder. This guy is indeed a five-fold translative tail in the three-dimensional space. But it is a cylinder, which is not so nice. And we wanted to get a non-trivial one, but after now, we are not. But after now, we are not so lucky. And for the six-fold one, we have the serum six. Every bill of a six-fold translator tail in three dimension has at most 14 feet. This means the number is fixed, but the complexity is higher. We do not know. But anyway, we also have an example like the right-hand one, this yellow one. Hand one, this yellow one. This guy is this is a cylinder over an octagon, and this one is an cylinder over deck on. But anyway, we have some candidate, and it looks like maybe it's possible to have a characterization of the five-fold lattice tail or the translator tail. But it seems very challenging. And in the plan case, in the two-dimensional case, we know the answer. So in the plan case, we have only five candidates. One is the parallelogram, another one is the central symmetrical Higgs gun, and then we have these three non-trivial one, two octagon, and one big. Octagon and one decagons, which can produce the five-fold translative tail in the plane. And in the three-dimensional case, we wanted to get an along true one, but we are not successful for us. So here is the reference. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, the figure is very confusing and very complicated, but Confusing and very complicated, but okay. Thank you very much for this very nice talk.
