Screen model of intracellular transport into dendritic spines. And okay, let's see if my pointer is going to be working. Is there another pointer? Right there, the songboard right there. Just take yeah, take it away. Okay. No, just pull it off the other end. Okay. You won't be able to advance the lines or display. Right. Great. All right, so before I get started, I just want to thank my collaborators. So this project started during my postdoc, and I started really by learning about this problem from Raimi Custers, who was a visiting graduate student at the time. And so it really went from there. And more recently, I've been working on this in my own group together with a former postdoc, Youngman Park, who's now at the University of Manitoba, Stephanie Porte, along with Prashant. Along with Prashant Singh at ICTS Bangalore. So I'll tell you a bit about sort of the early days of this project as well as some more recent results. So first of all, I just want to orient everyone. So here's a kind of standard cartoon of a neuron. So there's the cell body, the axons where it propagates action potentials to downstream cells, and then this dendritic tree where it integrates all of the signals from upstream. All of the signals from upstream cells. And so if we go ahead and kind of zoom in on one of the branches of this dendritic tree, along this dendritic branch, there are going to be a lot of synapses and a lot of connections to other cells. So again, if you sort of zoom in one level more on one of these synapses, there's a pairing of a presynaptic cell that releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Transmitters into the synaptic cleft, and then a postsynaptic cell, which is, say, this cell. So, this is what's known as a dendritic spine located along the dendrite of this cell. And so this post-synapse is going to be the focus of my presentation. And one thing that has really inspired this is recent high-resolution images, where using EM images, scientists have been able Scientists have been able to get very high-resolution images of the structure of these dendritic branches, and again, their pairing to presynaptic exonal cells. So, here what you see is a section of a dendritic branch with several of these dendritic spines. And here, this is a synapse that's being formed between one dendritic spine and its presynaptic exon. So, I'm really going to be zooming in. Really, going to be zooming in on a specific sort of compartment, one of these dendritic spines along the dendritic tree of the neuron. And so now, if you just take one of these reconstructions of a volume of, this is the neocortex of a mouse, what they've been able to reconstruct is essentially part of the dendritic tree of one neuron. So this is shown in red. This is all belong. Is shown in red. This is all belonging to one neuron. So you see many, many, many dendritic spines corresponding to many synapses formed with other cells. And so what's shown here in this cylinder in all these different colors are different cells that have been identified. So within this volume, it's packed with neurons. And those neurons have many, many, many synapses with each other, many connections. So it's a really beautiful, as you can see, very complicated geometry that is. Complicated geometry that is determining the connections and the interactions of these cells. And so, again, my focus for this talk is just going to be at the level of one of these postsynaptic dendritic spines, and sort of, I'm not going to be talking about it, but of course, there's a presynaptic cell that is also forming the synapse. Okay, so now from the cartoon of a neuron, let's go to a cartoon of a dendritic. Of a neuron, let's go to a cartoon of a dendritic spine. And so the picture that is sort of the current understanding of what's going on in these spines is, of course, at this postsynaptic density, that's where the neurotransmitters are detected. So the key kind of function of these spines is that there have to be membrane receptors at this postsynaptic density that can detect the neurotransmitters that are released into the synaptic cleft. So there's a transport of these membrane receptors. They have to constantly be They have to constantly be trafficked and replenished at this postsynaptic density. That transport is accomplished by vesicles known as recycling endosomes that come in along those long dendritic branches through microtubule transport. And then there's a handoff onto an actin-myosin cytoskeleton. And along that, sort of, once that handoff has been complete, molecular Complete, molecular motors force these vesicles, they squeeze them through these constrictions of the dendritic spine into the head of the dendritic spine where they undergo exocytosis and release the membrane receptors to the kind of target at the postsynaptic density. So again, this is a really kind of interesting and complex homeostasis that needs to be accomplished, this trafficking, constant trafficking of membrane receptors into the dendritic. Into the dendritic spine. And it's all at this kind of micron or submicron scale. And so this is kind of, of course, that very high-resolution image that I showed you. What they had done there is they basically took this volume, part of the neocortex of a mouse, they put it into some plastic block, and then they basically run it through a deli slicer where they section this block into very, very fine sections, and each of those sections is then... And each of those sections is then imaged using electron microscopy of very high resolution that's then reconstructed to form these volumes. But this is very high resolution, but also very static, talking about something in plastic. But so there has also been a lot of progress on dynamic measurements. And so here is an in vivo dynamic measurement where these vesicles have been tagged fluorescently. So what you're seeing, these Fluorescently. So, what you're seeing, these dark spots, are vesicles, and so what you see is basically in this video a vesicle that basically comes along, starts to move into a dendritic spine, and then reverses direction and comes back out. So, this is, you know, one, an n equals one data set, basically a dynamic movie of what's going on in one of these spines. But for now, this is kind of serving as motivation for a modeling approach, and you see sort of a Modeling approach, and you see sort of a similar time scale to what Bill was also discussing with this intracellular transport. This is on the time scale of minutes, this kind of transport into the dendritics plane. Okay, so I think I've explained sort of what is known. It's also, there's a lot of hypotheses about the function of this geometry. So these dendritic spines, they have a kind of mush, almost like a mushroom-like shape. And that geometry is Geometry is likely to play an important role. And there's been a lot of interesting studies. I know Jay Newby has also been involved in studying sort of diffusion along these spiny dendrites and how does this specific geometry of the spiny dendrite affect diffusion properties. And so I've been interested also in sort of what is the importance of this geometry, in particular, at the level of a single one of these transport events, squeezing these vesicles up through the narrow. Up through the narrow constriction into the head of the dendritic spine, what is the role of this specific geometry of the spine? And there are a lot of hypotheses that it's known that there are illnesses such as a lot of neurodegenerative disorders. The shapes of these spines are very different. It's hard to know, you know, cause and effect. Is that something that plays a causal role, or is just everything kind of changing as a result of As a result of this disease, but it's thought that the geometry, and in particular the width of this constriction, the overall size of this spine, will control this rate of flux and rate of transport into the spine. Okay, and so again, just kind of from the perspective of what do we know and what's the data that's motivating this work. So here is kind of one time series where we can see. Time series where we can see one of these fluorescently tagged vesicles getting squeezed up through this narrow neck of the dendritic spine until it reaches the head. And so if you make a chymograph, you can again see basically the time course of this vesicle entry. And the main question that I've been interested in is what is the role of geometry in this process? So to try to understand this, I've I've developed a kind of fluid dynamics model that uses lubrication theory to describe the kind of squeezing of these vesicles through the narrow constriction of the spine. And so I've really just started with the simplest possible model where I use a sort of axisymmetric geometry and I assume the vesicles are very close to being spherical. So that's quite different actually from what you see in that previous. From what you see in that previous time series where the vesicle is actually deforming quite a lot. But for simplicity, I just assume kind of a nearly spherical vesicle. And I assume there's some forcing that leads to a pressure drop across this vesicle. And also, a height, if you look at the distance between this sort of wall of the dendritic spine, the membrane, and then this vesicle passing through, there's a height function that reflects basically. There's a height function that reflects basically the spherical shape with some perturbation that results from a deflection based on whatever the pressure is at a specific location. So there's some elasticity that can lead to deviations from the spherical shape, but that plays a very minor role in the modeling I've done so far. The main takeaway here is that this system, this fluid dynamics can be characterized. Fluid dynamics can be characterized in terms of two-dimensionless parameters. One is a purely geometric parameter, it's just what is the radius of the vesicle relative to the radius of the constriction that it's passing through. And the other is the strength of the forcing. So it's basically how strong is the forcing relative to this elastic compliance. And if we do simulations and we've benchmarked And we've benchmarked these simulations also by comparing them to full 3D fluid structure interaction simulations. We see what one might expect, which is that in these sort of more open regions, so this is kind of a model of a dendritic spine where we have this constriction, and in the regions where there's sort of wider channel that the vesicle is passing through, it moves at a faster speed. Again, the forcing here is assumed constant, and then as the vesicle has to And then, as the vesicle has to squeeze through this constriction, it slows down a lot. So, there's this confinement effect as it passes through this constriction and then finally reaches the top. So, this is more or less the prediction of the model. And the kind of key takeaway here is that this constriction plays an important role. It changes the time scale of this transport. So, if you think about Stokes-Drag law, in that case, the Law. In that case, the viscous drag is just equal to 6π times the radius times viscosity times the velocity of this motion. And essentially what happens when you're in a confined geometry is that there's a correction factor that's going to increase the more confined this channel is. So you can think of basically this free space Stokes drag law being the limit in case you're. Being the limit in case you have a very wide channel that this vesicle is passing through, and that drag force is just going to become increasingly significant as this constriction gets narrower and narrower. So for now, all I've talked about is our model of the fluid. So, you know, this vesicle is squeezing up through the constriction, it's pushing fluid out of the way, it's moving up into this dead end so that this fluid is kind of trapped and needs to reach. This fluid is kind of trapped and needs to recirculate through these lubrication layers. So that's what I've described so far. But what I've kind of want to tell you about next is how do we actually model this forcing? So what is responsible for actually pushing these vesicles up through the constriction? Well, of course, that's molecular motors. And in this case, it's thought that it's the actin myosin system that is responsible for this. And so we have myosin motors that are coming. That are coming on and off of basically attaching and detaching and exerting forces in order to propel this vesicle through the constriction. And what's interesting here is that what's known for now is more or less the list of kind of what are the proteins that are present in dendritic spines. And it's known that there are various species of myosins. There's myosin 5, there's myosin 6. And what's interesting is that these can walk in different directions along the spin. Can walk in different directions along actin filaments. So, again, similar to Stephanie's talk last night, there's a tug-of-war, a competition of these antagonistic motors. At least it's reasonable to kind of assume that you don't have everything kind of aligned perfectly so that all of these motors are pushing in the same direction. As Bill was saying, too, there are a lot of caveats here. We don't even have a good sense of are all of these actin filaments aligned in the same direction or not. And filaments aligned in the same direction or not. So, even if you had only one motor that walked in one direction, you could still have a sort of antagonistic behavior. So, this forcing is also going to be kind of interesting because it's arising from this tug-of-war of molecular motors. And now, let's before we kind of try before you trust me too much, that this makes sense. Much that this makes sense, let's do a kind of back-of-the-envelope calculation. So, what I'm going to propose is that this transport is more or less dictated by a balance between this fluid drag and the force production of these molecular motors. But does that make sense? So, to kind of try to get a handle on that, it makes sense to do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. We know that the fluid drag, again, if you assume stokes. Again, if you assume Stokes' drag law, you'd get a fluid drag of around 10 to the minus 14th Newtons or around 100th of a peak a newton. And that's much, much smaller than the typical forces that we think of as associated with the ATP hydrolysis of a motor, which is more in the range of several piconewtons. So is this a problem? It seems like there's a big mismatch in the order of magnitude of this fluid drag and the forcing of the molecular motor. And the forcing of the molecular motors. So, can this be reconciled? And so, the way that we've reconciled this is by doing a more detailed estimate. The truth is that, you know, this is a very crude estimate. This is Stokes' drag law, again, that is valid in free space. When you have a confined geometry, that's going to greatly increase the effective fluid drag. It's also, this estimate used the viscosity of water. The viscosity of water, the cytosol or whatever, you know, this cytoplasm in a dendritic spine, it's likely to be much more viscous because you have, you know, all of these other constituents, and we know that the viscosity of cytosol is greater than water. So, if you include these effects, let's say that the confinement, you can, if it's extremely confined, you could imagine up to 10 times. 10 times increase in the effective Stokes drag law. There's also highly viscous cytosol, which can be even two orders of magnitude greater than water. So you can make up these orders of magnitude. There is a kind of reasonable hope that this balance between fluid drag and motor force production could lead to, could give you a balance of forces. Okay, so now. Okay, so now that hopefully I've convinced you that there's hope that this model could make sense, let's proceed with some of the details of the model. Okay, so what I'm going to assume is that these molecular motors, again, are coming on and off at some rate, so there's going to be a rate of attachment k on, and so they are going to attach at some specific at some specific displacement, which I'm labeling as. Displacement, which I'm labeling as A. And then the vesicle is moving along, and the motors can detach also at some rate k off. And now, because we're again allowing for the possibility of this tug-of-war, where you have motors that are sort of aligned in different directions, we're going to include the possibility that this vesicle is either moving in the preferred direction. Is either moving in the preferred direction of the motor, so these motors constantly are attaching with a specific displacement in a positive direction. So we're assuming that these motors basically act as a spring, so when they come on at a position z is equal to a, they exert a force in the minus z direction. And so this will naturally, if there's only this species of motor, it will naturally bring the vesicle to the left in the minus z direction. In the minus C direction. On the other hand, since there's this tug of war, there's a possibility that the vesicle is moving in the opposite direction. And so, in that case, the vesicle will still come on at this rate, and it still has this basal rate k off, where it can detach per unit time. But in addition, there's some maximum possible extension at which this motor is going to release. Is going to release. So, in other words, there's a maximum possible stretch at which point it detaches. So, this is basically the ingredients of the microscopic ingredients of this molecular motor model. And this is essentially based on a model that goes back to Huxley in 1957, where what he did is again postulate a certain microscopic behavior of these molecular motors and Motors and assume a kind of spring force or spring-like force for each individual motor. And then what you can do is write down a PDE that describes the probability density of the extensions of each motor. And the result is that you end up with a force-velocity function, which says that the force of a population of n motors is going to depend on the velocity u. U and it will have this following form. And this form is essentially given by what's known as a Hill relation. And for many of you are familiar with these Hill relations that come up in molecular motor forces. And I just want to say a couple words about sort of how do you get from this individual motor force to the the total force generated by a population of motors. Generated by a population of motors. So, again, the key ingredients in sort of the microscopic model of these motors is that they're constant rates of binding and unbinding. In this case, I'm going to switch polarity, so the motor is going to come on at an extension minus A, and it's going to want to push the vesicle in the positive Z direction. I'm going to write down a population density u of z. density u of z that gives the extension, the probability density function as a function of this extension z, and also define the total fraction of bound motors theta by just integrating this population density function. And now the idea of this derivation is quite simple. It's just conservation of motor number. So at steady state you better have the total number of motors Total number of motors sort of unbinding within a certain region of this extension, within a certain interval of this extension Z. So this is going to be the total number binding per time. That better be equal to the total number of motors carried out of that interval. And so there are two ways that they can be carried out of the interval. Either by unbinding, which again, that's given by this rate k off. So this is the total probability. So, this is the total probability of unbinding per unit time, plus advection, because this vesicle is moving at some velocity u, and so that can carry these extensions out of this interval from minus a to z naught. And so if you just take this basically steady state conservation of motor number, and now you just differentiate this with respect to z naught, you get a simple differential equation that relates d. Differential equation that relates du dz to the off rate and this velocity. And so if you apply the relevant boundary condition, you exactly end up with a probability density function. It's just an exponential function of position. And integrating this results in exactly the formula I showed on the last slide. The reason I'm getting into this is that we're going to actually use this model, we're going to keep track. This model, we're going to keep track of this population density function in order to compute the effective forces in this tug of war. Okay, so if you just zoom out from these details, here's the kind of takeaway at the mean field level. So if you just take that formula that says, okay, here's the total force exerted by the population. Total force exerted by the population of motors as a function of velocity, you end up with a force-velocity curve that looks like this. And again, there's a preferred velocity, so in this case, these motors want to push in the positive direction, so you have this kind of Hill function in the sort of positive half space. But then for negative velocities moving in the non-preferred direction, you get this kind of short. Preferred direction, you get this kind of sharp cutoff in the force. And so this is the force velocity curve that you get for one population, one species of motors, and that's the one that's labeled here in blue. But again, in this model, we're allowing for this competition of antagonistic motors. And so there's another population labeled as F sub A that has the opposite polarity. So it's the same exact force velocity curve, just rotated and reflected across. Reflected across both the x and y axes. And now, if we want to know what the total force exerted by both species of motors is, we just need to take the resultant of these two functions. And when you do that, you get this kind of black curve here, and you see it's very nonlinear. So these two kind of force-velocity curves from the competing species will give you this kind of net. Kind of net force that has a kind of interesting shape as a function of velocity. And again, the key point or the idea of our model is that this motor force production is going to be balanced by fluid drag. And the way to think about that, sort of in a picture, is that, well, we're going to take this force-velocity curve in black and find the inner In black, and find the intersections of that black curve with the fluid drag. And again, this fluid drag is just a linear function of velocity. So it's just going to be some linear function of velocity. And we're just trying to find all of the intersections between this black motor force curve and this linear fluid drag. And what you'll notice is that depending on the slope, Is that depending on the slope, which is governed by this confinement factor? Again, if it's in free space, we know that's just given by Stokes' drag law. But the more confined it gets, the steeper and steeper this green fluid drag line will get. So you can see as the confinement changes, the number of intersections will also change. So there are going to be bifurcations depending on the degree of confinement. And so just to illustrate that, And so just to illustrate that, so here, if that slope is great enough that you pass these kind of me's of these two curves, then you lose some of these intersections. You go through a saddle node bifurcation. So there's a multi-stability here. Again, this is reminiscent of what Stephanie was discussing yesterday in the context of intermediate filaments. But here we have this kind of additional component to the model where we're considering also this confinement, which in Also, this confinement, which in these dendritic spine geometries seems important. Okay, so that's really the idea here. And of course, you can pass through several bifurcations. Eventually, if the confinement is extremely strong, you'll just get a single intersection at the point of zero velocity. Okay, so what we've been able to do is sort of characterize all these biological. Sort of characterize all of these bifurcations. And what you can see is that if you illustrate this in the phase space of phi1, which is the ratio of motors pushing in each direction, and this confinement factor or fluid drag, you get some regions of phase space where you have only one solution. Again, that's corresponding to this very slow motion or zero motion. And then other regions of this parameter space where you get Parameter space where you get three solutions, so you can get bidirectional motion, or even five solutions with some intermediate slow velocities. So the reason that that gives us hope in the model is that, well, what we see again, if we just look at that data set where this molecular, this vesicle has been tagged fluorescently, and we see it kind of moving up a little bit in the spine and then coming. Moving up a little bit in the spine and then coming back out, that shows that, well, you can get within these spines sort of velocities that push them up into the head of the dendritic spine, and also velocities that push them back down. And so that's reminiscent of what we see in this kind of multi-stable model. So this kind of simple model balancing fluid drag with force production of motors does capture some of the important qualitative features of the data. Important qualitative features of the data, but there's a lot that we're still trying to understand. And so, what I want to say in just the remaining few minutes is that in what I've presented so far, everything was deterministic. We just took this kind of mean field motor force production, we balanced that with a deterministic fluid drag. But in fact, this vesicle transport and the dynamics of the molecular motors are noisy. Of the molecular motors are noisy. And it's thought that in these dendritic spines, maybe there's on the order of a dozen molecular motors or so. So this individual attachment and detachment kinetics is going to have some noise. And it's possible that, you know, again, especially in these regions of parameter space where you have multiple possible velocities, this noise could, again, Noise could, again, as Stephanie was saying yesterday, it could change what the overall behavior is going to be. And so, what we've done to try to understand this noise is we've built an agent-based model where we have, again, this force balance, but now the forces are going to be determined by the extensions of individual motors. And again, those extensions are labeled as C, and the extension translates into a force. The extension translates into a force through this kind of spring law. And in this case, we just take a linear spring, but then depending on the number of motors, we'll just add up each of those individual forces, and that gives rise to the total up and down forces of these two species. And we've simulated this agent-based model, and what we see is kind of fluctuations about these multiple stable states with occasional switches between them. And so, this again gives rise to trajectories. Gives rise to trajectories where you get at some points you get velocities going up into the positive direction, moving up to the head of the spine, at other times moving down in the opposite direction. And the key question here, when we add this noise, is well we can switch between these stable states, but are we switching between them at a kind of reasonable rate? And in particular, these simulations are very slow. Simulations are very slow. And so, is there a way of kind of speeding this up so to get a coarse-grained version of this agent-based model where you don't need to go through the computational complexity of explicitly tracking the position of each motor. And the first thing we tried was to use a Langevin approximation, where essentially we just took the previous deterministic model and added some white noise forcing. Some white noise forcing. And the interesting thing there is that using this Langevin model, you can get the right sort of steady state distribution of velocities, but the switching rates are completely inconsistent. So using this agent-based model, we get a switch on average every 0.2 seconds, but in the Langevin equation, it's orders of magnitude less frequent. And so it turns out that's actually a well-known. So it turns out that's actually a well-known thing. Using Langevin equations, you kind of get trapped in these local minima, and so you don't sample this probability distribution very accurately or at the right rate with the right dynamics. And so what we've done is kind of gone back to again this PDE of the probability distribution, probability density function of the motor positions, and we're And we're, instead of trying to individually track each motor, we just keep the sort of population density. So we replace the individual motor dynamics by the population level PDE. And when we do that, we end up kind of tracking this population of motors. We have the probability density function sort of changing over time. And by doing that and combining it with a random number. It with a random number of attached motors, we can sample from this probability density function in order to maintain the kind of stochastic aspect of the simulation. And so cutting to the chase here, what we do, what we get when we go through this course graining procedure is a much faster simulation technique, especially when you're dealing with many motors, that does accurately get the switching rate between these steady velocities. Okay, so now. Okay, so now I'll just switch, I'll just cut to the end. So this coarse-grained model accurately converges to the right switching rate. It's much, much faster than this individual agent-based model, especially when you have a large number of motors. And in the end, what we can do is use this to predict the probability of a successful translocation as well as the mean time to translocate. And so we've been able to. And so we've been able to compare that, compare this coarse grain model to an analytic solution from this process. Okay, so again, in the end, this model allows us to kind of understand what is the role of the geometry, how does the length of the spine, the constriction diameter of the spine, influence these properties, like how likely you are to successfully translocate. Okay, and this is. Okay, and this is basically described in this recent paper with Youngman Park and Prashant Singh, and so I just wanted to highlight their work. And again, thank you for the invitation. Questions? Um I will look also at the The asymptotic behavior, so are you stabilizing to only one or you still keep your destability? Yeah, so in our model, we're really switching between these stable states. So we're keeping the sort of possibility of basically bi-directional transport where the tug of war will switch. And it's just after multiple switches, you get either successful translocation into the Successful translocation into the spine or eventual rejection, where you end up moving in the opposite direction back to the base of the spine. So, yeah, it'd be interested to talk more with you, too, about sort of, as you said, this kind of stabilization of the noise and whether this bi-directional transport ends up, you know, being maintained in in certain parameter regimes. All right, we just have to wait uh a minute or two for the microphones to switch over so that we can take virtual questions. So that we can take virtual questions. Jay, I think there are a couple of questions here, too. I don't know if you're going to. David's next. Okay. Nice talk. I was just wondering about the ratio of the radii of the vesicle to the thinnest part of the neck. And in particular, I was thinking about it as a hindered diffusion problem or the friction coefficient, but those. Problem or the friction coefficient, but those are always assuming that this fluid is static, and as this thing's moving up, due to the incompressibility of the fluid, it's going to create a counterflow back. And the velocities could be really high depending on the space between them and the rate at which it's moving up. And that could be a really interesting extra contribution to the drag. Yeah, definitely. So that is precisely the mechanism of this kind of elevated drag. It comes from Drag comes from the sort of not just the confinement, but also the fact that it's moving into a dead-end geometry because that fluid somehow has to recirculate. What it does is effectively makes these thin lubrication layers even smaller because you have to accommodate both flow in the same direction as the vesicle and flow in the opposite direction. Yeah, so one of the simplifications of the model is, again, that we have assumed that the vesicle Have assumed that the vesicle remains nearly spherical. And I think that makes kind of the modeling simpler, but it's not realistic. So that's one of the things that it's still, you know, we still need to understand kind of how does the compliance of the vesicle also play a role. Okay, I think we should take a virtual question, Pat Mini. Yes, Thomas, great talk. I have a question about, well, I have two questions. One is these minds have different One is these lines have different shapes, as you know. And so, how does that play a role in your model? And the second question that is related is over the time scales that you showed for transport, the spine also changes its shape due to the actin remodel, right? So, you have the structural plasticity with a very dense actin network. So, have you thought about it or comment on these two factors? Yeah, thanks, Pat Mini. Yeah, thanks Padmini. So those are both really good points and I think these are sort of highlighting what a kind of interesting system this is because we've here we've just picked a very simple model geometry and really the only parameter that we're using to capture the geometry is this width of the constriction. So how narrow is the neck of the spine. And we think for the purposes of this transport that is the critical parameter. Basically what is the narrowest constriction? Is the narrowest constriction that this vesicle needs to pass through? But as you can see from those 3D volumes and these EM images, each spine has a very different kind of geometry and there's a lot of detail in these shapes and a lot of variation. So it's possible that it's not just kind of this constriction size, but other aspects of the geometry may also play a role. And then, as you said, too, part of on this time. On this time scale of basically minutes that is required for vesicle transport, we've taken the geometry of the spine to be fixed. And on that time scale, maybe that's reasonable, but certainly over time, these spines themselves remodel. And they change shape and change size, and that's also sort of closely connected with the synaptic activity. Synaptic activity. Essentially, how much, what is the strength of the synapse? How many action potentials are firing? So it's hypothesized that essentially stronger synapses, where it's more likely that an upstream action potential will lead to another action potential in the cell. It's thought that those tend to be correlated with larger spines. So larger spines tend to be characteristic of stronger cells. Characteristic of stronger synapses. So there's a lot of interesting aspects of the growth of the spines that we'd also like to pursue. All right, we only have time for one more question, I think. Melissa, you had your hand up first. You should go for Will because my original question was going to be about the deformability. So I need her to ask. Okay, Will. Thank you, Velessa. My question is about the processivity of myosin 5 and 6. Of minus in five and six. So if I understand it, if I remember right, the Huxley formalism is inherently for non-percessive motors. And that's not to say that it couldn't just be kind of leveraged. It's kind of like all in the Koff and the load depends on the KOF. So have you thought about that and is the processivity of those motors relevant for your model? Good question. So in what we've done, as you said, We've done, it's as you said, it's really just assuming this kind of Huxley version of the myosin activity where they just have some rate at which they're coming on, they can push, but then they disconnect and they don't really continue to take steps forward. So I think what we've done would, you know, is kind of neglecting that processivity, but it would be really interesting to include that as well. All right. Thanks. I think we have a coffee break. I think we have a coffee break now. The virtual participants are encouraged to
