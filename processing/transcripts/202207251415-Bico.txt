Very cool. No. And you guys can hear me. Perfect. Yes. Cool. We're all set. Okay, no little thing. I can hide that thing. No. Hide. Gone. This one. No? One more. Okay, super. Okay, everything all set. Sorry for the confusion. So, good afternoon, everybody. Well, first, I would like to. Well, first I would like to thank very much organizer to have organized this nice workshop. As most of the people is one of my first presentation in a conference since the pandemic. And so when I saw the title of the workshop, there was about pattern formations and said, okay, what should I show about patterns? And so I decided to present two. And so I decided to present two things. So, one, the old thing which were done in the lab. So, I'm working in the Mikawet group in PMHSPCI in Paris. And so, there is one part of the story would be on tracks. So, this is a bit of an old story actually done by Jean-Martolo, who is also present at the workshop. At the time, I sent the title, I didn't know that Ruel was coming, but that's a good news that it's coming. And the other thing would be an interfacial instability that we have. Instability that we have been working more recently. So, maybe I will quickly show you, present you the group for those who can do like a virtual lab tool. So, if you come to our lab, you will see that in our group, so that we call Mikawet, we have three main PIs, so there is Benoit Roman and Etienne Ressa. We have a few students and postdocs. Some of them are working on the the deformation of elastic structures, the people more in the left, so more in the so people in the left Left, so more in the people in the right are more working on interfacial flows, and but sometimes everything mixes. And this example is a sub-double which deforms a thin elastic sheet, which has the shape of a flower. And as you put the bubble in contact with this flower, the petals of the flower tends to wrap around the bubble due to capillary forces. And you will notice that we have also somebody who is obviously maybe not a student anymore, Etienne Uyon. Student anymore, Etienne Uyon, and we do some outreach with him. So I've also put him in the team at just give you like an advertisement at the end of the talk. Okay, so first story, so cracks. So as I told you, this story started with Joel Martelot, who at that time was a young PhD student. And so basically what the experiment Joël worked on is a very simple experiment. So you take a silicon wafer, you put on it a liquid which is called You put on it a liquid with this called a spin on glass solution. So it's like a silicate type of solution. This is used for surface treatment in glass. It's very standard. You put this, so you spin coat it. You have something which looks like a liquid. You put it in an oven, 300 degrees C, for a few hours. As you put it in the oven, the solvent where the silicate evaporates. And in addition to the evaporation, you have a chemical reaction. Chemical reaction that somehow transforms the silicate into something which looks like a glass. So you end up with a glassy layer of about one micron on your wafer, which looks like a glass, if you like. But due to the chemical reaction and the evaporation of the solvent, you have a lot of residual stresses, or residual tensile stresses, which are about typically 1%. And so you know that if you have stresses on the film, well, you're very likely to get cracks. So the question is, do you get cracks? So, the question is: Do you get cracks? And of course, this is something which is undesired for a practical application. I mean, if you put some coating on your glasses, you don't want the coating to make cracks, otherwise you cannot throw it. Okay, and so cracks on thin film is something which is an old story. And so, what people know is that usually when you have a strong addition of the film, you deposit on the substrate, when you have a strong addition. When you have a strong addition of the film on the substrate, what people know is that if you have a very thin film, even if you have some tensile stress, residual stress, you do not get any crack. And if the film gets thick enough, then you can get what people call channel cracks, which are cracks that go all across the thickness of the film and propagate in a straight direction. They tend to cross each other at an angle of 90 degrees. It's very close to also to mud cracks. Also, to mud cracks. And so the idea to find out what is this critical thickness beyond which you get cracks. So in this particular example, this was a sample with a grainet of thickness. So in the left side of the picture, the thickness is below 1.8 microns. You do not see any crack. In the right part, the film gets thicker and thicker. There is a region where you get. There is a region where you get this very simple well, this straight channel cracks, and a region at the right is a bit more complex. You see that the color has changed, so this is an indication that the film has delaminated. And for very thick, well, thick films, in addition to the cracks, you also get delamination. So, maybe just to give you the ingredients, how you can predict if you get channel cracks or not. Get channel cracks or not. The big principle in fractures is that a crack will propagate if it can release enough energy, enough elastic energy to pay for the crack, the energy you have to pay to create a crack. So it's a very simple statement. So imagine you have like a crack that a straight crack that propagates, or that starts propagating on this film. You want to know how much energy you release. You want to know how much energy you release, so how much energy you release. Well, you have a strain, an initial strain which is epsilon. So the energy you release will be the young minus times the square of the strain and times the volume that you what is involved in the in the in the deformation that of the solid which is obtained as you as you propagate your crack. So as you propagate your crack, actually what you so you Actually, what you so the crack is under tension, but at the same time is stuck on the surface. So the best he can do is to open a little bit along the crack, and he can only open a little bit on a horizontal scale, which is about the thickness of the film. So H is the thickness of the film. And so if you have a crack of length L, the volume which is deformed would be L times the thickness, obviously, and time also the thickness, because in the lateral direction you have the thickness. How much do you have to pay? How much do you have to pay? Well, the idea is that if you break apart a material, you have an energy per unit area to pay, which is what we call a GC. And so the area you create, obviously, would be like H, the thickness of the crack, times the length of the crack. And so you have a critical length scale that tells you that if, so you have an energy release which is proportional to the square of the thickness, an energy you have to pay which is proportional to the thickness. So eventually if the crack is Eventually, if the crack is thick enough, the h square will be bigger than h, and so you have a critical thickness above which you expect the crack to propagate. And this critical thickness will be given by the practical energy GC divided by the humanness times the square of the strain. Okay, yeah, sorry, can you explain it? Like in the first energy release, I think I understand the epsilon square, I understand, but why it's proportional to h square, okay? I mean, because I would expect that one. Okay, right. I mean, because I would expect that once you make a crack, you release strain everywhere. No, no, no, no, you don't really because the film is adhering on the substrate, and the substrate is rigid. So the best you can do, I mean, you cannot retract the whole film. So what you will do, you just open a little bit the film, and you cannot open it that much. So you will open across the thickness, you will shear a little bit the film, if you like. Okay. You like. Okay. And so that involves a lateral distance which is about h. Okay, so that's a classical result from John Jinson and something classical. And so what we were interested in is in a slightly different situation. In the case where we have a weak adhesion, so the film does not adhere that much on the substrate, we go to the regime where the thickness is lower than this critical. Where the thickness is lower than this critical thickness, so you will expect to not observe any crack propagation. But still, if you look at RAND effects, you do observe a crack. And besides, the crack has a funny shape. So you see, it makes an Archimedean spiral in that case. As you can see, the color of the spiral changes. So that means that in addition to the propagation of a crack, you also have delimination. So the film debounce. Delamination so the film debounce from the substrate. Okay, and also what's something which is interesting that the pitch of the spiral, if you prefer the width of the delamination front, is kind of constant. So something a bit peculiar. Okay, so basically, okay, as I tell you, so you're right. So you take your sample, as I told you, you spin coat it, you put it in the oven, and you and then you get a bunch of And then you get a bunch of transient stresses. And you expect you do your experiment with a thickness, which is lower than the critical thickness to get cracks. So you should expect to not observe anything. But in practice, what you observe that in places where you have little pieces of dust, you do observe the things happening. You do observe cracks. And when you look with a microscope, so I should have told you. So what we see is the film from above. Okay, the scale, the scale. Okay, the scale the scale bar is about 50 microns, so the pitch of this bar is about 50 microns, and you see something happening. Like this is real time. Yeah, so it's not obvious, so because Joel had to take off the sample from the oven, let it cool down a little bit, put it in a microscope, and then observe the cracks. And looking, I mean, you don't know in advance where they're going to be. So it was a bit tricky. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, some of them do these spirals, and some of them do this oscillating cracks, for instance. Well, we have all kinds of cracks that you can observe, but this one maybe is also interesting. So, you see, it's like zigzag, so we don't have the beginning, but as I told you, you have to take the sample and find out where you have a crack and put the microscope, and it may take a few minutes. And meanwhile, the crack propagates. But you see, it makes this kind of crescent. Crescent and the idea that you have this delamination front that associated with a crack that follows a previous crack. So if your first crack stops somewhere, the front will stop, go back and go doing this exact like that. And here is a bit the same idea that you have this crack that will follow the previous crack at a certain distance. And but here, since the first one did not stop, it just turns around. one did not stop it you just turned around without uh well just turns around because without finding an hand as you have here okay uh and so apparently this is something that you observe also in other systems so it's not unique to the very peculiar spin-on-glass system we have so it has been observed with other silicate type of materials as uh we have here but also with a very different system which is a molydon and Uh, molydon and silicium multilayers, which has many tons per third, so it's a like totally different technique at a different scale. And you do observe also cracks with this different technique. So, and again, the similar ingredients you have in both experiments that you have tensile stresses due to the deposition of the film and a weak, rather weak adhesion of the material on the substrate, of the film on the substrate. Okay, and so the interesting thing. Okay, and so the interesting thing is that if you plot the typical width of the of the crack as a function of the thickness of the film, so you can tune the thick you can adj adjust the thickness of the film by putting more or less by spin cutting the sample more faster or slower as you make it. What you observe is that independently of the system, independently of the film, you observe like a reasonably good linear dependence of the width of the system. Dependence of the width of the dilemma in front, of the pitch of the spiral, if you like, as a function of the thickness of the sample. Something a bit which is striking. And the proportion, the coefficient, the perfector is about 30, something like that. You may observe, I mean, if you go to all buildings, you may also observe cracks in paint. And we have one data point, well, it's maybe not enough, but which tends to follow. Which tends to follow the same scaling. In MatPrax, indeed, yeah. But the pattern is quite different. Yeah. So and the mechanism you see will be different. Well, I think maybe not actually, if you think about it. Okay, and so to understand that, we say, okay, whoa, that looks a bit tricky, a bit complicated. And by luck, we found out that there were also There were also these cracks, so these are a pair of cracks, okay, separated by the animation front, and they move in a straight direction. Okay, well, actually, well, they move in a straight direction. This guy initially was kind of narrow, and you see that the width of the crack increased until reaching something which looks like an equilibrium width, and then follow along a straight. Along a straight line. So we say, oh, maybe we can use these cracks as a, as a, maybe they will be easier to describe. And so you can do the same computation to try to estimate the energy you release by propagating the crack. You can compare with the energy you have to pay to not only break the material, but also to debum the material, the film from the substrate. And then you may even find a And then you may find a criterion for the propagation. So, what is the energy released? Well, the idea, so following Benny's idea actually, or remark, is that in this case, the light blue piece of material has debounded from the debunded from the substrate, which means that you expect, in that case, all the residual In that case, all the residual stress to be released in the light blue region. Okay, and so in that case, if you propagate by the certain distance dx, you expect the energy release to be E, the young analysis, times the strain, the square of the strain, times the width of the crack, times the thickness of the crack, times the x to be released. How much do you have to pay? Well, you have to pay for two cracks, so two GC for. For two cracks, so 2gc times h, okay, because you have two cracks that propagate, but also you have to pay for the adhesion energy of the substrate of the film on the substrate, so capital gamma times the width of the crack times dx. Okay, and that tells you that you should expect the crack to advance if the energy released is bigger than the crack energy. And that gives you this kind of complicated relationship that has that the width should be larger than the thickness times the. Larger than the thickness time, but the strength prefactor that depends on the pack energy, on the energy, on the stored energy, and the addition energy. So it seems not so satisfactory because there is no way to get like a prefactor which is 30 for all kinds of experiments where these quantities may have changed from one experiment to another one. Okay, so maybe that's not the end of the story. And so, why is it not the end of the story actually? There is maybe something. Actually, there is maybe something additional that we didn't take into account. Is the fact that as a crack propagates, actually, we may have underestimated two things. So we may have overestimated the energy release because since the denomination front is attached to the it sticks to the I mean since the the little The little tip you're lifting up is still attached to the substrate. You cannot release all the energy on the crack. There is a little region here of which W, and which is an unscale here, which about W as well, where you do not release all the stored energy. So you have a little energy that you do not release completely, which is be proportional to W square, the thickness, the width of the square. The thickness for the width, the square of the width, and the and the thickness of the film. But in addition, that's okay, that's a negative point. But since the film is not adhering anymore on the substrate, you have also the possibility of lifting up a little bit the little strip you're making. And by lifting up a little bit this strip, you may release a little bit of energy. And this energy will be like And this energy will be like the same kind of energy you release when you propagate a channel crack, and that will be proportional to the square of the thickness for the same reason as when you open a crack, a channel crack, it's proportional to the square of the thickness times the width w. And so the first one is kind of negative in a sense, that's something I forget to take into account. And as an energy release, and the first one will be somehow positive because it's something That I release in addition to what I expected. And so the total energy release actually would be: well, the strain, what the square of the strain times the modulus times the thickness, times the area of the strip, but minus something proportional to the square of the width, and plus something proportional to the just to the width. So as we can see, we have something with the minus the the square of the width. The square of the width plus the width. And so we may think that maybe there will be some balance between these two terms. For large widths, the w square will take over the other one. So maybe there was something to play with these things. And so indeed, what you can try to consider is now, okay, so far we've been talking of a crack that will propagate, two parallel cracks that will propagate in a parallel motion, but now imagine. In a parallel motion, but now imagine that the cracks decide to adopt a certain angle. Okay, and the idea is to see what is the energy release as a crack propagate depending on these angles. And so you use very simple, that's very simple, geometrical relationship. And so basically, as you can compute how much energy it's released, so you have this thing with a cosine and a sign just to the We have a cosine and a sign just to the simple trivial trigonometry. And you can also compute the energy you have to pay to propagate the crack as depending on the angle. Maybe it's better to display it in a graph. So in red, this is the cost, the price you have to pay to propagate the crack as a function of the direction of the crack. So the most expensive when you go straight, but it it gets cheaper if you accept to go to the side. Cheaper if you accept to go to the side. And in blue, this is what you can afford as a so the energy you release as a function of the angle. So if the so it turns out that in both cases it is kind of it's a cosine function, something like that, but there is a little this cosine function is shifted to the right if the width is smaller than a quantity which is the Quantity which is a geometrical factor times the thickness. And the idea is that, okay, so in that case, nothing will happen because the energy I can release is lower than the energy I have to pay to propagate the crack, so nothing will happen. And so now you can imagine, okay, let's increase a little bit the strain, the residual strain. So if you don't have any residual, if you don't have enough residual strain, nothing will happen. But if you accept to if you Nothing will happen, but if you accept to, if you now crank up a little bit the residual strain, okay, this the amplitude of this curve will increase and eventually it will touch, it will touch the red curve. So the blue curve will touch the red curve, and then that means that at that point you have enough energy to release to pay for the crack energy. For the crack in a and so, uh, in that case, you expect to be at a crack, and this crack will happen to this angle. And so, it means that if the width is too small, the angle will be positive, which means that the width will tend to increase. Okay, so you can do the same derivation in the case of where you have a large width, so the large width in comparison with a geometrical perfector times the thickness, and then you. And then you will, for the same construction, you end up with a crack that will propagate with a negative angle. That means that if the crack is too large, it will tend to narrow. And so what you may imagine that you expect to have a stable solution when the width of the crack is this optimal width, which is a geometrical perfector, which is just due to elasticity, solving elasticity equations, times the thickness of the times the thickness of the field. And if you do some finite elements to find out what are these little geometrical parameters, you find out that this pre-factor should be about 20, which is kind of close to the factor 30 we observe experimentally. Okay? But now actually there's something different because I told you, okay, we start with a low residual strain and we increase progressively the strain until the Progressively, the strain until the energy release becomes comparable becomes equal to the crack energy, which in reality is not what happens. So, in reality, what you have, okay, maybe I should have, okay. In reality, what you have is that you have a certain, well, you have a certain strain energy, you have a certain residual strain. Residual strain, which will be this blue curve. And what will adjust actually is the red curve, the crack energy. So, why do you adjust the red curve? It's because the position of this red curve will be set by the velocity of the crack propagation. So basically, the cost, the price you have to pay to propagate a crack would be a certain initial value, let's say GC0, gamma zero for the denomination. Zero for the denomination. But the faster you go, I mean, but this is at the lowest velocity. But if you want to propagate a crack at a higher velocity, then this price you have to pay to break apart your material will increase with the velocity. And so basically, what will happen is that if you have enough residual stress to propagate a crack. Stress to propagate a crack. The crack will propagate not too fast because otherwise you cannot afford it. But it will propagate to a velocity so that you exactly match the energy release, the energy you can release with the plaque energy. We are not super super clear, but the idea is that we had this first relationship that was a bit. Uh, that we that was a bit strange before, but uh, this relationship is not strange. I mean, it works well. Uh, I mean, there isn't nothing strange about it. The only thing is that the speed will adjust so that you ensure this relationship between the energy you release and the energy you have to pay to provide the crack. Okay? Okay, well, maybe I was a bit confused. Um, yeah, quick question. So, you showed one example. So, maybe you have a picture which is wider. So, is it the only one which grew or like is there a minimum spacing? There are many cracks started and stopped. Yeah, so the next two neighbors don't seem to be able to do that. So, the next two look, so does that, so there must be a distribution of bits, yeah, yeah, yeah. Distribution of bits, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, okay. The problem is crack is that it's kind of tricky, and the nucleation of a crack is always like uh is a bit always a bit tricky. So, to make that actually, we took a film or took a film and make a scratch, and there was a lot of little nucleations of cracks. Some of them started, some of them to propagate, some of them maybe didn't start right away. And you need to delaminate it exactly, yeah, yeah, and um. And okay, so maybe I can just finish with this for the practice with this. Yeah. Can I ask about the previous? So I'm a little bit confused. Okay, maybe I was a bit confused. I should have practiced a bit more before. The speed selection, you get it as a what's the time scale? Okay, well, the time scale, I cannot give you an actual number because the idea is that, you know. The idea is that whatever things you break apart, you have to pay a price, which is, I mean, the energy you have to put to break something apart will increase as you increase the velocity. And that's due to all kind of viscosity dissipation. What's the meaning of this? Okay, the meaning of this is that in practice, we're not changing the energy that we release. This is a given, this is something set by the system, but. But somehow you have to match the energy you release with the energy, you have to pay for the crack population. You have to match the rates of these two. But each one of them is characterized based on time scale. Yeah, but the thing is that the time scale is something super complex, which is hidden in the variation of the crack energy or the delamination energy with the velocity. So the only thing you have to So, the only thing you have to match is that you have to, in order to have something appropriate, you need that at zero velocity. So, this is a minimum condition. You need to have enough stored energy so that you can afford a crack even at zero velocity. I'm trying to understand if the okay, okay, okay. Okay, maybe I should have started with that. This is the only non-trivial statement from this. This is only the new input. Only one, you have only one non-trivial physical statement, which is the bottom one. Yes, the top one. Bottom one. Yes, the top one is just. Well, well, maybe this one is more trivial in a sense. There is one prediction, not two. Well, there are kind of two actually, because if you know how the crack energy and the adhesion energy depend on the velocity, you can back up the crack velocity if you like. In principle. No? Okay. We'll have to talk about it. Okay. Anyway, so after a while, you can we so what you can do is to try the different So, what you can do is to try different experiments with different strain initial strain energies. And so, you can non-dimensional the strain energy by the crack energy or this strain energy by the residual strain energy by the delamination energy. And then you end up with all kind of this complex landscape. So, if you have a very low strain energy. Have a very low strain energy. Uh, you well, you everything is stable, you have a stable thing. Uh, and then if you increase this strain energy, and you will end up with so this is this pinkish region is the you will not expect cracks to propagate in the standard view, but as you can see, you do observe cracks, and uh, in this region where you expect the dimension where the dimension could locate. Where the dimension could occur and the crack as well, then you get all these kinds of spiral, all kinds of patterns that can be observed: oscillating cracks, spiraling cracks, or what we call solar cracks. So you have cracks that tend to follow each other in this pattern. And obviously, the further you go here, and the faster they go. Okay, so maybe, okay, and you can have a whole Okay, and you can have all kinds of patterns that you can observe. Maybe even some in some bark of some trees, maybe you can also observe these kind of cracks. I don't know if it's exactly the same kind of cracks, but it will sound a little bit. Okay, so maybe I was a bit ambitious on my thing. At five minutes or something like that? Yeah, like 10 minutes. Okay, okay. Okay, so I will go quickly to this other instability, which is totally. Quickly to this other instability, which is totally different. Well, maybe there's something that well, maybe it looks very different at the first glance, but maybe there will be some similarity. So, okay, let's change the gear. So, now we go to something which is much newer for me. So, the experiment is super simple. So, you take two glass plates, you coat them with a thin film of viscous oil, silicon oil. The typical thickness is Silicon oil. The typical thickness is 50 microns. Okay, and you just let one plate you drop one plate on another one. So you make a wedge and you let the two plates merging. And the initial equation that obviously, since you have a liquid merging another liquid, you expect to have a you observe to observe the propagation of an adhesion front. And the initial question is, what was the velocity of this adhesion front? Was the velocity of the satisfaction in front, and uh, do you is this is the front stable? So, the movie I'm going to show you is a very preliminary experiment which is not controlled. Okay, this experiment has been done by Laurent, by Manon Estimé and now Maude Doblair with the help of Laurent Luchmer for the theoretical description. The experiment I'm going to show you is very, very rough. And so we just drop, okay, I will stop the move. We just drop okay. I will stop the movie because if we don't explain you what to observe, we don't understand anything. So, uh, so I just dropped one plate on the top of the other one. The whitish region is the regions where the two films are not yet in contact. Okay, you have a light reflection in that case. The dark regions are the regions where the two films are in contact, where the two films have merged. And what you observe is that you get all kinds of fingers that propagate, you have nucleation points. Propagate, you have nucleation points also propagating here. And maybe a little connection with other cracks. So the problem of the cracks, that if you look at these connections, you will see like things that tend to turn around. That's the connection I found with the previous problem. Anyway, so you have these things that propagate, tend to zigzag a bit. So you get these fingers. And for us, it was a bit surprising because. Okay. Seems to stop. If you go further, well, you get more things. Okay, but obviously, and then eventually, this so you get fingers of liquid fingers separated by air channels. These air channels eventually break into bubbles and you end up with two plates adhering through a thin film, but with bubbles. And these bubbles are undesired for practical applications. So you want to avoid them. So, you want to avoid them. Well, but this experiment obviously is not the best to try to figure out what's going on. So, what we did is a simpler experiment or more controlled experiment, if you like, where we make a wedge with a fixed angle. So, basically, we do the same experiment, but we have a spacer to fix the angle of the wedge. The typical angle of a wedge would be 0.1 degrees. And as we do the experiment, now you And as we do the experiment, now we will see that the cracks propagate in a more defined direction, still not perfect, but much more controls than before. And you see, you have these fingers that move straight forward. And the question is, why do you get these fingers and what set the wavelength and the dynamics? So, since I don't, yeah, I'm running a bit of time, so I was a bit too long with the first thing, but I can. So I was a bit too long with the first thing, but I can maybe explain you why do we get the fingers and what okay so the idea is quite simple actually oops sorry so the first thing is that we don't we may think okay this is we have seen many talks of many things about staphenteral instabilities so the first thing you may think oh this is a classical staff interla instability but no this is not the case because here you have a viscous fluid which is pushing away a non-viscous Fluid which is pushing away non-disclose air. So you should not expect discussed furthering from the standard criterion. But to propagate, okay, maybe I will play again the movie. No, there's a glass plate. Okay, so the blue is a is oil with a with a dye? Oh, it's a kind of blue in the blue. Oh, it's a kind of fluid. Oh, it was not clear. Okay, sorry. Yeah, so there's it's both. Yeah, it's both. Yeah, the both uh glass plates are coated with a viscous liquid. Okay, and you get this finger. So it's not like a rubbery thing. Okay, oh, sorry, but okay. Okay, but maybe I will stop in this movie and try to just to explain what we see. Okay, so in the dark blue, it's the two the two things are the two. The two liquid films have merged. In the lighter blue, you still have two films, but they have not merged yet. And you get fingers where the fluid merge. And between these fingers, you have this whitish region which corresponds to air channels. Okay? Okay. So Exactly. You first touches from the wedge and then propagate from the wedge to the less confined regions of the wedge. Okay, but just to get an idea of the physical explanation and then we will make the summarize of the thing. So the physical explanation is quite simple. So in order to, well, it's quite simple. Well, the idea. Well the id the idea is that in if you in order to to connect these two a movie a movie uh s sketch okay okay maybe that's a okay so in order to uh to merge these two uh these two films you somehow you have to fill fill up a gap between the two the two films and uh to fill up this gap you have to take some fluid from somewhere and the the only available fluid is above the the front so Above the front. So if you imagine that you have a straight front that propagates, it will propagate by hitting the film which is in front of it. But obviously, if you hit too much of a thread, you will deplete the film which is in front of you. And if you don't have any... And this film will take a long time because it's a film film, I told you, it's about 50 microns. It's a viscous film, so it will take a long time to get refilled by a flow, the horizontal flow on the film. So basically, if you So basically, if you eat more than the typical thickness of the film, it will be difficult to move further because you have depleted what is in front of your straight front. So a straight front will not propagate that much, and you can estimate how much it can propagate as a straight front. But then if you want to keep on propagating, you may think, oh, maybe now if I make fingers, maybe the fingers can propagate. Maybe the fingers can propagate by eating up what is in between the fingers. And basically, this is a mechanism we have in mind to explain why you get these fingers propagating as fingers. Okay? So is the air. So what drives the rate at which it falls? Is it the rate at which the air escapes in between the two gaps? Here, actually, we fix the angle of the wedge. We fix the angle of the wedge with a spacer. So the geometry of the wedge is fixed. And we just let the film coalescing. So initially it is kept like this and then released, right? Well, released or allowed to come together. Exactly. We start with a wide angle and we go to a narrow angle and we let the singer propagate. And so the fluid is, the capillarity is drawing the wedge together. Drawing the wedge together or no, no, no, no, the capillarity just makes the theme coalesce. Yeah, so actually there is no much, you take a long time to drain. So basically you yeah, you just hit what is uh surrounding you and yeah. Okay, but I guess I'm I think you're the last talk, so am I again oh. Am I? Yeah, you can take it. No, that is not nice for the no. Okay, but anyway, so I can give you maybe a summary. I mean, definitely, I'm sorry, I was a bit too. Okay. So basically, what we found out is that if you with this idea of hitting up what is on in between the fingers, we end up with the air the width of the air channel which scales the the thickness of the film. Which scale has the thickness of the film divided by the square root of the angle of the wedge? What we found out is that the edge channels, which are in between the fingers, are basically like a circular cross-section, and the cross-section is equal to the gaps that separate the two plates. So you have something if this is X, the the the width of the air uh channels will be like alpha x. Channels would be like alpha x. We found out that these fingers would eventually stop the certain distance, which would be the gap, the thickness of the firms divided by the angle of the wedge. And we find like a square independence of the moving front as a function of time. Okay, so I've got some fun demos that I can show you also that I gave you a glance in. That I gave you a glance in the presentation, like one hour ago. So we can discuss about these demos after. So, okay. Okay. Anyway, and so I will finish also with thank you for intentional and maybe I will finish with a little attestment. So I told you with the Ethan Union, we were involved in science outreach and so on. And so we have a book now, which is called Hiden Wonders. That will invite you to read if you like. Okay, thank you, and sorry, for the mess. I was a bit funny. Last time it was in French, but now it is in English. Oh, super. My wife both are there any questions? Are there any questions? I wonder if I can ask a question. Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess, so if you try to arrange, so in the last experiment, you could try putting disks together or cones together, for instance, to try to have the air channels live in a radial geometry. Have you tried that? Or other geometries? I mean, like a shallow cone. I mean like a shallow cone or something like that that you put on or right or or any other geometries other than parallel channels well it's not too obvious because in our case we we I mean if you want to direct the the instability you you need to have something which looks like a wedge or something like that and uh yeah basically we could use like a Yeah, basically, we could use like a very shallow cone, like for the rheometer or something like that. But yeah, like a cone plane geometry, that's something we could try. We haven't tried yet, actually. But that would be interesting, actually. Yeah, to see if we have a radial expansion, what will happen. You could also use maybe a very shallow sphere or a shallow cap that we put in contact with the plate. That's something we had in mind, but we didn't do it yet. Would the channels choose to split and so on? Yeah, that's a good question. And so on, yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, no, that's you're right. Uh, I guess it won't, yeah. Show the video of the guy pumping the thing up that you skipped over. You just go back a slide. Ah, okay, okay. You want the okay, super. It's late in the day. We want to see the pictures. Yeah, yeah. But how do you? But I didn't. Okay, sorry. Oh, here it is. Okay, so basically, okay, but okay, I will. Okay, I will. So, the idea is to use this kind of thing. So, these are two pieces of fabric which are nylon coated, nylon fabric coated with polymer, airproof polymer that you can glue on. So, you can glue these two fabrics by coming with a hot tip and making a certain pattern. So, this is the stem type of fabric that you use for sports equipment, and you can see it. Use for sports equipment, and you can seal it by a heat on a heat press. And so, you design a certain network of channels in this fabric. So, in that case, it's obviously we like Achimedian spiral, so we made an Achimedian spiral of a certain width, but here we selected everything. And so, basically, you have channels in between this thin lines. Okay, so the seam lines, it's like a seam lines between the two fabrics, and in between. Between the two fabrics, and in between you have the channels. And as you inflate that thing, okay, I can do it more okay for those who are lines, they don't see me maybe. As you inflate that thing, you end up with a saddle shape, okay? But here, here as well. And the question is, why do you get this shape? It's not so difficult. I mean, as you inflate the channels, you tend to induce a contraction in the cross-section of the channels. You don't change the... Cross-section of the channels, you don't change the exam length, and so you end up with a surface that has contracted on the radial direction, not on the outer radial one. And then your solution is to make a saddle. So you change the matrix by and you change your curvature by doing that. And the cool thing that, okay, maybe this one, okay, that's the one I wanted to show. You wanted to see. So you can make it at the big scale. So this is our student Emmanuel, who's going to inflate like a big scale. Big scale dome, so he makes a tent, and actually, you can fit many people inside his tent. And this is, and this is a shell. I mean, it's not like, and so in that particular case, he designed like a precise architecture for the channels in order to. You put this in an art gallery, you make a machine that pumps it up and deflates it over and over. No, no, no, that's an art piece. That's something we, you know, is that something we have in mind. Right. Yeah, so I just want to add that this can be used to mimic the liquid crystal elastomers, which has elongation and contraction perpendicularly. Something like that. Okay, I'm not sure. I got a voice coming from the sky. Sorry, sorry. This is a photo from the Zoom audience. From the Zoom audience. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Sorry, sorry about that. So this can be used to mimic. Well, it's a bit the same. Yeah. Well, it's not exactly as. So somebody in the audience was telling is the same physics as Liquid Summers. Well, it's not exactly, but it's a bit the same idea in the what you yeah, I also have like a saddle shape in my in my talk. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Can you hear me? Is it okay if I ask questions, Jose? Yeah, I do, I do. It's Kari here. Beautiful. Yeah, I do see you. Beautiful, beautiful talk, as always. A question that I have is about the delamination. And I'm curious in these spin-on glasses, does an anisotropy in the strain in the vertical direction or in the normal to the In the vertical direction or in the normal to the film direction, does that play a role? I don't think so. I mean, okay, that's something we did not consider. So, for us, it was like in plane residual stresses, I would say. Uniform. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Excellent. Thank you. I'm correct. I'm doing a question. So, going back to the last experiment you showed, where Where there were the channels. But behind it, there were air bubbles. Yes. And so I assume from asking. So, why do you get air bubbles? When does it happen? Okay, why do you get where you get air bubbles? Because these air channels eventually break into bubbles due to radio plateau instability. Right, right. So can you like, does every channel leave a bubble behind or only fuse? Well, then at the end of the experiment. Okay, so the thing that the fingers probably. The fingers propagate reasonably quickly, and then if you eventually stop, and then as they stop, the things tend to evolve. And so, that's something we did not look into much details. But typically, the liquid fingers may emerge or the air channels may break into a series of bubbles. So, it's not one channel, one bubble, it's more like a channel. One bubble is more like a channel break into many bubbles, I would say. But sometimes it's a bit more complex than that. But typically, a channel will break into different bubbles. Although the whole thing is more complex because the thing kind of relaxes and there are many things going on at the end of the experiment. Because obviously, due to surface tension, having like long fingers cost some surface energy. So you do get these fingers because due to the dynamics, but at the end the system relaxes and tends to make something smoother than having this series of fingers. Can I ask you for the delamination patterns that you showed, do you this is it's probably something you ha haven't done, but I assume these cracked in air, yeah. Did you ever look at cracks formation i i in immersed in a liquid? In immersed in a liquid. Oh, putting everything in a liquid, I see. And with the track. That's a good question. That's something we never... Do you have something? I mean. Changing air by. Okay, no, we didn't change the atmosphere or something. Do you have something specific in mind? I was just wondering if you if you act, no, sorry, I just wondering if you got, you know, if how. if you got you know how you altered the cracking the delamination process and whether yeah if um and whether you would you know you would get uh it could change the dynamics actually it could change the dynamics because uh in this thing well it's not so clear what uh what maybe that goes a bit to benefit so what said the velocity is not so clear of how does the crack energy and the delamination energy depend on the velocity and maybe if you change i mean If you change, I mean, that can be viscolistic things, but that can be also like the fact that you need to bring some oxygen molecules to break up or to water or liquid molecules. Actually, in the glass, sometimes water molecules need to bring water molecules in the cracked tip. So if you immerse, maybe it will go much faster or maybe to change the dynamics, probably. Any other questions from the audience here? The audience, here what happens if you keep pumping? What happens if you keep pumping? Okay, well, and you it may eventually explode. No, but it's the brain before it explodes. Okay, no, that's a good question. Okay, so no, no, but you made a very complicated. So, uh, in the brief presentation, I showed you these things which were like, did I show you? Yeah, I think with the mask, okay. With the mask, okay. So, I think here the principle is a bit different because it's a rubber, it's a material made out of rubber. And so, what will change here is that the so again you have the channels, it's not very clear, but so there is air channels embedded in this patch. As you inflate the air channels, the cross-section of the channels tend to increase proportionally to the pressure, not the parameter, and then in that case, you end up with a cone. On the ah, okay, okay. Okay, and then you make a cone, and then the amplitude of the cone of the amplitude of the formation is proportional to the pressure. So, here by changing the pressure, I change the shape. Here, the thing is a bit different. I've got a fabric which is stretchable. So, by changing the pressure, I do not change much shape because you already get to the final. Because it's you already get to the final shape, in a sense, but you change the stiffness. So, in the previous case, I get the stiffness does not change that much as a function of the pressure, but the amplitude changes. Here, the amplitude does not change much, but the stiffness increases as a function of pressure. So, these are two things. So, if you want to control the shape, the first, well, the pinkish latomer version is more interesting. If you want to control the stiffness and make bigger. The stiffness and like big objects actually, this technique is better. Yeah, yeah, you can. Well, this one was a few meters of diameter. So yeah, yeah, you can make big things. And we have a project now to do relevant, I mean, we got the money to get the, for the project, but I'm not sure we will succeed. But anyways, the idea will make like a structure that will be relevant for civilian general. That would be relevant for civil engineering applications? To I fail a bit ambitious, but we have in mind like cast for like for like to make a concrete domes or stuff like that. Well, we're far from that for the moment, but we have not yeah. So the yellow has a different So the yellow has a different um okay. So people who are online they may not see anything. Okay, maybe I have a bet we do it around here. Yeah, it will be visible. Okay, so in the where but they don't see the okay, so in the in the so this is a rectangle and in this rectangle you have like um longitudinal uh no transverse transverse channels, okay, and these channels are wide in the medium line. Are wide in the medium line and gets narrow when you go to the edges. And as you inflate the channels, you will get a strong compression in the medium line and not much compression in the edges. I don't know if it's clear for everybody. And then again, you cannot remain in plane, but if you accept to make an elixir where you see it makes an elixir. There we go. And again, you get something a bit misty if you want. We have two solutions, actually, if you like. Okay, and we can play. I mean, we well, we can play with the type of patterns and trying to figure out what finite shape you get as a function of the initial pattern and so on. Exactly. And it's probably bi-stable or multistable, something like that? Okay, so these things are indeed multistable. Well, for instance, the Zelix, obviously you have two positions. So indeed, all these things are more testable because for the same metric change, you may have a lot of isometries which are solutions. Isometries which are solutions. And so, yes, the system will pick up one of these isometries, and you may go from one to another one, sometime passing a gap, sometimes no. It really depends on the. So, it's kind of a complex, it's a kind of a complex structure because so what we have the zero-order approximation, what we control is a matrix, but in addition to matrix, But in addition to metrics, we also have like we also modify somehow the so we the bending of the or the bending stiffness of the of the material. And so that well depending on the way so that this bending stiffness will will maybe give you the the barrier you have in between the different isometries. So in some cases you don't have much barriers to go to from another. Various to go to from another one anisometry to another one. For other cases, you have to snap from one to another one. You didn't say anything about the design problem. Okay. For the analogous liquid crystal elastomer problem, there's been quite a bit of work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So here you have to be able to make the channels. To be able to make the channels, which is a greater constraint, exactly, exactly. So, so, okay, so I was very brief in this. So, yeah, if you like, we can discuss later. So, we do have some ideas for the design, which are close to what is used for liquid stomachers. And we, for instance, we interact a lot with Ile Aroni, who is like one of very, who is very interested in programming the right. Programming the orientation of nuclear astomers to get 3D shapes with a certain 3D structure. So, for simple geometries, we are able to find out what is architecture that yeah, but this one is a is a simple uh is just a one line. Okay, okay, sure. Which one is the idea? Okay, sure. Which one? Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, but okay, but this was one nine. Here it's a bit more ambitious, it's a wall surface. So, when it is like a simple surface, and axis after we can discuss if you like, I don't want to occupy too much time, but uh, for axisymmetric shapes, uh, for well, I mean, for these fabric materials, and uh, if we if we do like axisymmetric shapes or simple shapes, we can uh we can somehow solve the inverse problem when it's more complex, so it's a bit uh When it's more complex, so it's a bit uh more difficult and we cannot do it uh well we don't have the numerical tools to to to do that. Uh for the rubber uh sink we have uh we have a recipe uh which works more or less uh well that works as a first approximation uh to to find uh a network of channels which give will give you uh a target 3d shape as The target 3D shape as you inflate them, as long as the target shape is not too is not too bumpy or too sharp. As long as you get something smooth, we have like an inverse problem. We can solve the inverse problem. But this is a yes, this is a very important question for practical application and it's something we we working on on uh currently. But for the fabric is much more uh difficult, yeah.
