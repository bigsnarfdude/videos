Myself, Laya, and Georg Lojo on constructing oriented metroid using tropical geometry. So, I guess the overall theme of my talk is that we should study oriented metroids from a tropical and atrophic geometry point of view. And conversely, if you have some metroidal, polyhedral, or tropical ideas, try to see if you can include science in some way. So, I will give a very, very general intro. Very general introduction of what is an oriented metro. So, if I'm giving this talk to a general math audience, I would say it is an abstraction of the net dependency over the wheels. If I'm giving this to communicators, I would say it is a matrix with signed data. And if I'm giving to this audience, it is a matrix over the sign hyperview. So, just as ordinary matrix, they have been very useful in discrete geometry and optimization. But in this talk, I want to talk a bit about. I want to talk a bit about some new perspectives that myself and some other people are trying to work on, motivated by the success of the ordinary matriarch theory. So one slogan that we all know by now is that it is interesting to study matroid from the perspective of complex algebraic geometry. So the analog for oriented matrix would be we should study that from a perspective of real algebraic geometry. I would try to give Geometry. I will try to give some hints that this is doable. And the second thing is, or just as Lucius talked about this morning, that in the theory of tropical manifolds, locally the theory is coming from the tropical. And then if you want to add a real structure to tropical manifold or some similar object, then by the recent work of Johannes, Chris, and Arthur, it is that what you should be looking at locally are pre- What you should be looking at locally are precisely cryptomorphic to oriented metros. So, if you want to study tropical objects with a real structure, then oriented metro is the correct notion. Okay, so by now, I guess I can get away by saying an oriented matrix is a matrix over the sine hyperfield. But again, let's do that from scratch. So, start with a real matrix. If we want to get a matrix from that, then I'm going to remember which maximal minors are non-zero. Miners are non-zero, and then declare that as a basis. For oriented matron, because I have a real matrix, so I'm going to remember a little bit more that whether this determinant is positive or negative whenever it is not zero. So just as the ordinary matriarch case, we take the intuition into definition. So a kirotope is a map that sends a d-tuple of the ground set to a sign. And then, first of all, it is alternating because determinants is alternating. Because determinants is alternating. And well, we also know that the support of this function should be the basis of a matrix. And because it is alternating, I can always only remember the case when we are listing that in increasing orders. So I can also think about a chirot as a map from the basis to plus n minus. And there is a second condition that is more subtle. You actually don't really need to remember this by heart for the rest of the talk. So I would say that it is coming from looking at the Yeah, that is coming from looking at the original Grassmann-Luki relation over the reals and then use the chief observation that if a bunch of real numbers added to zero, then either they're all zero or there must be a positive or a negative to cancel out. So any questions with the definition? So just as an example of how little have we explored in this direction of interacting science and tropical objects, let me tell you a lemma from our paper first. You, uh, Lambert Paper first. Uh, so again, thanks for all this discussion in this uh workshop so far. I can show this and say that this is a natural supervision without too much explanation. But then now I'm putting signs at the vertices as an indication of I have a map from the basis to this plus and minus. And using matroy subdivision, I can partition this sine function into sine functions for smaller matrix. So, um So, the landmark I want to talk about is that I have some kind of a Guillain procedure. That if you have some arbitrary sine function, that is some matrix of division, if you can check that the restriction on every piece is an oriented matrix, then the whole thing must also be an oriented matrix. So, when we first came up with this lemma, the first instinct is we need to find a reference because it's definitely somewhere. Because it's definitely somewhere. But after asking many experts like Alex Felipe, David, Laura Anderson, and many others, we are more confident to take the credit of being the first formulating this seemingly very basic and fundamental lemma. But on the other hand, I also want to mention that the notion of pository subdivision, I think introduced by David and Lauren Williams, can be thought as the thinking about when. Thinking about when this converse is true, when you put sign positive at every vertex. So even special cases are already very interesting. Can we characterize positorides or positively oriented matrix? I'm probably not the correct person answering this. I'm probably not the correct person to answer this in this room. Okay. Okay. So how do you characterize positroids? So positroids are those positive are those oriented matroids where the character is almost plus or zero everywhere, where you order the elements in order. That's the theorem of Federico, Felipe, and Warren Williams, is that right? Can you say this condition is that? So it's an oriented matrix, where for every basis, the sign is plus, if you order the basis. The sign is plus if you order the basis more. No, I mean a character presentation in terms of but okay, let's postpone the later. I would give a one-line proof of this. So because sine s is perfect, so you reduce that to three terms, Grassmann Pluke, and then you only need to analyze matrix superficial on the three skeleton. And you can convince yourself that the only non-trivial case you have to check is this one, the standard example. So it is a proof that you can explain. It is a proof that you can explain, you can come up with in 30 seconds. So, for the rest of the talk, I will focus on matrix subdivisions coming from one source, which is actually the main subject if you read our papers. So, they are coming from triangulations of the product of two synthesis. If you first only first see these objects before, then you might ask why are these polytopes interesting? I have two answers. The best answer I can give is ask the genuine expert in the room. The genuine expert in the room. Federico would be happy to give you one-hour talk of why these things are awesome. For a short answer, I would say that in many places they serve as polyhedral information for tropical matrices. So as a quick seanatic check is the vertices of the product of two simplices are in one-to-one correspondence to a d by n matrix. And then in a lot of cases, when you are trying to work with a tropical matrix, then the actual data. Matrix, then the actual data you have to remember is the triangulation of the product of two simplicities. And I'm listing a bunch of topics that people have been using these triangulations in their work, that I'm not going to go through them one by one. So I would first try to convince you that at least in the case of regular triangulations, you should expect that these kinds of triangulations are related to oriented metroid. I'm not going through all I'm not going through all details here, but the idea is any triangulations will give you a leading term for every maximum minor of a generic matrix in the sense of Grubner basis. And then, so this is an example. So by definition, every regular subject triangulations comes from lifting your vertices to some height. And then I remember these heights as some tropical numbers. And in this case, because we are looking at signs, I'm also putting signs here. So the idea is. So the idea is instead of taking the sign of the whole determinant, I compute this and I only take the sign of the leading term. So this is how I'm going to get some sine function from now on. I would still have a real matrix A, but then instead of taking a maximum minor, I would just use some lookup table to look up one term that I want to evaluate that basis at. So, in this case, because the leading term, if I compute that, will correspond to this. So, the sign of this perimetation is minus, and then I look at the signs that we have, then we only remember this as a plus. So, one observation is actually you still get an oriented matriarch. Because even if I'm only taking the sign of this leading term, if I plug in t to be a sufficiently large number so that it dominates the lower order terms, then this. The terms, then this sign is actually the sign of some determinant of some actual real matrix. So in this case, any regular triangulation will give you a realizable oriented matrix, but you only develop it one term at a time. That's something that I've been saying. It is the signed tropicalization construction of Orientabetro. So, because of the time, then I'm not going to explain the exact construction of this arrow, but the idea is even if you get to an arbitrary triangulation, there is still a way to build a lookup table for every maximum minor so that you can pick a term. That term won't be a leading term in the sense of Grubner theory, but you can still use the same construction to evaluate just one term and get a sign. Evaluate just one term and get a sign for every maximum minor. And a quick history is what this kind of lookup table are called as the matching fields in the literature, which was introduced by a paper by Stramfeld and Selovinsky to study the grouping theory of determinantal ideal. A quick history was in their paper they introduced something called the linkage matching fields, which are some lookup tables satisfying some exchange axiom. Some exchange axiom. I think they believe that just because these things have exchange axioms, you can always get an oriented mature from that. We have a counter example in our paper. So it turns out that the correct class of lookup tables of these leading terms you should look at are those coming from actual triangulations. So it is something sitting inside of the two. So let me quickly sketch how we can prove that this will still be. How can we prove that this will still give you some kind of oriented matroid using the lemma I was talking about? So, the first observation is: I can also identify the vertices of the product of two simplices as the edges of a complete bipartal graph. And then I can encode every four-dimensional simplex in this triangulation by remembering which vertices it contains and map that to a sub-graph here. Graph here, and it is a relatively easy exercise to show that this will form a full-dimensional simplex if and only if you have a spanning tree on the right-hand side. So I can remember a triangulation by a collection of spanning trees. And then now the idea is I'm going to get one matrix from each spanning tree that form a matrix of division. So the matrix we are going to get from a spanning tree is the so-called transversal matrix. So the ground set. So the ground set will be the right-hand side of the bipartal ground. And I declare a subset here is a basis whenever there is a perfect matching between the left-hand side and the right-hand side. So in this case, 1, 2, 3 is a basis because I have this perfect matching. And then 2, 4, 6 is also a basis. And you can convince yourself that 4, 5, 6 is not a basis because of this. So now I start with. So now I start with a triangulation, I get a bunch of spanning trees, and then for each spanning tree, I get a transversal matrix. And it is a result, I believe the first time, appeared in a paper of Philippe, that if you start with a triangulation not necessarily regular, these kind of matri will still form a matrix subdivision of the hypersimplex, which in our case you should think of that as the matri polytope of the uniform matrix UDN. Uniform matrix in UDM. So the final step we are going to do is to put an orientation of each of these very simple metra. I believe transversal mitra of spinning trees are serial parallel, so they're very simple. And one way to they're so simple that there's a very direct recipe to represent them, namely that we start with any matrix. So remember that in our construction, we always So remember that in our construction, we always fix a real matrix. Then I restrict the entries of that matrix to the edges of banning tree, and you can convince yourself that this will represent the transversal matriarch. And then because I also have some signs on the entries, so I can also give them an orientation structure. And then now we use our lemma and say that starting with a triangulation and any. Triangulation and any matrix A. This oriented transversal matrix will glue the two an oriented uniform matrix. And if your triangulation is regular, then that orientation will be precisely the same as the one you obtained by sine tropicalization, that you take the sine of the leading term. So, this is the proof. So, any questions for the proof here? And then I want to make some quick remark on generalizing this to hyperfields. So you look at the picture in our landmarks that we put signs at the vertices. So it is tempting to also put something, something from hyperview. So in our paper, we worked out In our paper, we worked out this thing at the generality of hyperfields, but I'm 90% sure that everything can be translated to tracks or other more general objects. So you can do that putting hyperfuse numbers at the vertices of a matrix subdivision and ask whether you have the same lemma. And it turns out that we can classify for which kind of theories that this works. They're precisely what They're precisely what Laura Edison and Chris Abbles lit to called inflative hyperfield. Those are one plus minus one equals everything. So the sign hyperfield has this property, so we can use them to construct Bolly and the Mitroy. Then so I have two further remarks from here. The first one is, this actually gives a recipe to construct matrix over hyperfields when you don't have a like a field to push forward to. Like a view to push forward to, which I think for some very exotic type of view, this is a new construction. And then, secondly, remember when I was talking about the proof of the key lambda, I was reducing that to three-term Glassman correlation. That was fine in the case of oriented Metroid, but now it comes back and honors that I can only guarantee there is a weak Metroid. So, the obvious question is: can we get strong Mitroid? I feel like this is a I feel like this is a good checking point of whether the strong axiom is too strong, if we cannot, whether we can obtain that from these kinds of relatively natural tropical construction you see in real life. So I guess this is a question for me to people working in that direction. How much time do I have? For the rest of the talk, I'm mostly showing some colorful pictures of another way to interpret our results. Another way to interpret our results from a topological point of view. So every realizable oriented matrix can be represented by a real hyperplane arrangement. But actually, the only thing you need is whether you can cut, you want to remember what was the positive and the negative side with respect to each hyperplane. So something that looks like this will also give you an oriental matrix. You don't have to use straight lines. So these are so-called pseudo-hyperplane arrangements, and it is Pseudo-hyperplane arrangement. And it is a central and classical theorem in oriented matroid theory that if you allowed it to use these kinds of objects, then you always get all oriented matrix. And this one is, I think, is the smallest example in terms of rank. This is known as the Ringo line arrangement or Ringo pseudo-line arrangement. It represents an oriented matrix that isn't coming from a real hyperplane arrangement. A real hyperpain arrangement. So it is a non-realizable oriented metroid. And the spoiler is: you will see this picture again soon. And then I would quickly mention a construction from real algebraic geometry. So as I said, I'm going to show mostly colorful pictures and not give too much detail because of the time. So the idea is: this is a procedure introduced by Viro that you combined tropical. combined tropical and some sign data and then you can get from tropical hypersurface to real hypersurface. So this is a baby example and this is a not so baby example. This is how Barrows was able to push the known case of the Hilbert 16th problem to the degree seven case. And then this is also the counter example of a long-standing conjecture in Longstanding conjecture in real algebraic geometry. So the bottom line is: this is some useful method or powerful method in real algebraic geometry. And I want to show that this is actually related to oriented intros. So more colorful pictures that in one line is I can use rural spectrum or some variation thereof to start from a triangulation of product or two simplices and get the topological representation of orientation. Topological representation of oriented matrix. So this is what you get by slicing the triangulation by some clever subspace, so you get a simplex. So it contains some small triangle and parallelograms. And after doing some patchworking, we obtained the one I was talking about. So this is these matrix-oriented matrix are precisely what I constructed earlier using the matrix of division. The matrix of the vision lambda. And so, this is an example that our method can be used to construct non-realizable oriented matrix, even if you start with some very simple local pieces, as long as your matrix of the mission is interesting enough. So, yeah, I guess I have to stop. I would mention that there are some other topics that I definitely don't have time to mention in this topic in our paper. And then I would mention two more obvious questions of which oriented matrix can we get. Which oriented matrices can we get? And then at this moment, we can only use these methods to construct transversal oriented mid choice. So, what would be a good natural way to get something beyond those underlying matrix? So, I have a stop here. One quick question and then uh I'll sorry. You have a question on slide number ten. But it means weak matrix also give you strong matrix. Matroids must give you strong matrix. Representation of the signed tropical hyperfields, right? I mean, for signed hyperfield, we can get away with that because S is perfect. But yeah, but the signed tropical high fields, so that's tropical high fields with signs. So it's yeah, that's yeah, I think so. But this is over like the tropicalization of a more general tract on that slide, right? So regions you say. Yeah. I mean, if you start with something stringent, then it's unlikely that you're going to have this inflation property and be stringent. I mean, you have the sign up to test that property. I think from the perspective null that we have, I would say if it's not perfect, it takes perfection and then strongly agree. Then you have a tracker. Then you have a tracker rather than a hyperfield rather than half a track. I mean it's not the tracker of the of any other field. No, yeah. I mean you only want the track. Thank our speakers then.
