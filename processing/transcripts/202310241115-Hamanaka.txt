Okay, so I'd like to discuss the solutions of this specimen of the model today. So, the discussion is very, very simple, so please be easy. So, this is based on the collaboration with San Chi Fang and Kan Hirok Sang in Nagua University. Okay. Next. Okay, let me introduce the motivations. Introduce the motivations. The four-dimensional bestiminology model is the analog of two-dimensional bestiminology model and first introduced by Donald Dawson in 1985 and developed in 1996 by Lodef Mouva Negro and Shatasibi and so on. So this best minute model is dark side, conformal field theory. Actually, a conformal field theory and very interesting in itself. But this has another aspect. The equation of motion is in fact the Yand equation, which is equivalent to the Self-Judge-Yamid equation. So this closely relates to the integral system and the background geometry, the twist theory. So this model is very, very interesting. And moreover, in the split signature, In the spirit of signature, spirit signature is this one: minus, minus, plus, plus, but not the Euclidean. In this case, this specific action describes the Sun-field COD action of n equal to Swing, Sun-COD. So, this is also very, very interesting in Sunni COD. And we today we focus on this split signature and discuss the solitone solution. Discuss the soliton solution. Of course, this is extended to the Euclidean signature at value. So, my original motivation is related to the word conjecture. That is what the Richard Word in Dalamung. He conjectured or murmured that the many of the lower-dimensional integral equations. Dimensional integral equation, such as K d equation and two digression, and so on, can be derived from the four-dimensional anti-secondary amid by deduction. And this is there is no proof, but now we know the many, many examples is true in this sense. And actually, various lower dissemination integral applications. integral integral of the equations can be derived from only one master equation self-definitely young mutt so this is very very mysterious and interesting i think and i'm interested in the relationship between the lower dimensional integral systems and the higher four dimensional integral system so in four dimensions the integral integrability aspects can be explained in in the framework of two Explained in the framework of a twister theory. On the other hand, in lower dimensions, there are various soliton theodic. And one would jeep is a subtle theory. This is a very, very beautiful soliton theory. And in some sense, this is a unified theory. And this theory is based on the integral hierarchy and the tau function, which is described by Longstian. Longstean solution. And I want to know the relation to the subtle theory and the twist theory. But in four dimensions, such long-scan solution is missing so far. But today, I construct this one in four dimensions. And furthermore, in fact, I I've studied for about more than 10 years the non-commutative extension to this world convector. In this context, non-commutative means the non-commutative spaces. So we can extend to the non-commutative space settings. So this sounds very, very crazy, but in gauge theory, this has a physical meaning. The non-computer The non-cognitive extension just corresponds to the presence of the background magnetic field or B field. So, this is not just a generalization, but the have physical meaning. This is partly successful. But the most important insight would be that in non-cognitive settings, the quasi-determinant play crucial role. The quasi-determinant plays a crucial role. This is one of the non-commutative versions of the determinant. And in non-commutative settings, the determinant solution is replaced with the quasi-terminant solution. And the important point is that by using the quasi-derminant, the proof becomes much simpler, even in the commutative limit. So I feel this is more essential ingredient in the formulation of solution. In the formulation of soliton theory. So today I don't discuss the non-commutative extension and focus on the permutative theory. But the self-reliant is a non-R-variant system. So in this sense, this is non-commutative. So matter X value. So we use the quasi-tam yam today. Before that, I have to note that the signature. The signature should be the spiritual signature, not the Euclidean in this context, because of the following reasons. So let me show the example of the deduction from cellular middle to K duplication. So now a gate group is SL2. So the gate group and the field strength are two by two. So today I don't discuss. So today I don't discuss in detail. So the F is a two by two matrix. And this A is the independent dynamical body of two by two. And all the education is doing the four dimensions. This is a starting point. The first, we take the dimension deduction as follows. So from four dimensions, So, from four dimension to two dimensions. And in the second step, we take the non-trivial deduction conditions for the gauge field and follows. This is Miraculous. But then, the first and second equation is satisfied automatically. And in the third equation, one component gives the following differential. The following differential equation. And this is just look at the k-deplication. But Aussian settings, there are complex coordinates in general. And in the Euclidean signature, this z must be complex coordinate. Then this is not the standard ordinary cadification because cadification differs in the other two-dimensional. In the other two-dimensional space-time. But this equation, if this is a complex coordinate, this is not the case equation in this sense. But in the split signature, we can take the old z w or yard. So later, I'll soon show you. So in that sense, we always We always take this spirit signature in this reduction process. And this is not so crazy. And actually, this has a physical description of n equal to strings. So there's no problem, I hope. Okay, so now let me ask that question. Ask the question: Fatisa Lagrangian formalities of the secular Yamut. This is the main theme of this conference. There are two candidates. The first one is the Yamu theory. So this is a very, very popular one, the total SF square. And in this theory, the self-help Yamidus can be derived as a BPS equation, not the equation of motion. Not the equation of motion. And the second candidate is a four-dimensional basim. And in this theory, second-degree amid action is obtained by the equation of motion. So a little bit different. But in this conference, the Lagrange mass form theory gives the integral system as equation of motion. So let's take. Take the second choice. And furthermore, I'm interested in unified theory of integral systems. Thank you. Okay, so I'm interested in the unified theory of integral systems. So we use a word concept. So we have Water conductor, so we have to take the split signature now. So, and we have another good news for the construction of unified theory of integral systems. Probably, as you know, now there are hot topics that the four-dimensional channel theory. Chan Simon's theory gives the various solvent models. So it would be first discussed postero, fitting, and Yamadaki, and perhaps Nekulas and so on. And after that, there are many, many works and it becomes very, very hot topics. And in this conference, Bino Bis Bisteto-san will talk about this evening. This even so there are kind of a unified study of integral survival models from four dimensions and Chan Simon. On the other hand, in four demand bestiminal written, they are unified integral, unified theory of integral system via the world pond. And they had a more better. More better news that these two theories can be unified by one six-dimensional dimensional theory. So, this is divided in six-dimensional and described as a twist string action. So, this is a melomorphic Chan-Simon action on the Carabial Sylli pole. Now, this is the first Now this is the first suggested by Kevin Postelo and proved by Bitwerson-Skinner. So they proved that this six-dimensional theory gives the four-dimensional chance element by symmetry deductions. On the other hand, in non-trivial deductions, in another direction, this gives us the four-dimensional best simulated model. So this would be a real We are really unified study of integral systems and becomes very hot topics. And I so probably proceed and many colleagues have this unified theory, at least in their mind. But to me, I have to emphasize that from the best minutes, we should take. Hand side, we should take the spirit signature. They usually discuss in Euclidean signature, but other unified study of integral systems, we should take the spirit signature. And furthermore, there's a double fibrillation structure here. In this situation, there's a non-travierity between four-dimensional transignants and four-dimensional best model. For example, the two-star correspondence. For example, the three-star correspondence, the traditional three-star correspondence is based on such double vibration from the flag manifold to Glassman and projective spaces, the twisted spaces. So this is just a Klein correspondence. And the AGT correspondence is also such double vibration. Okay, so this is a motivation. And so I launched the following Nagoya MassFit seminar this year. And there are many interesting talks on such unified solar integral systems. And the next talk is also that one. She's a collaborator of the Yamada with the Yamadak Sam. So you're welcome to join. So you're you're welcome to join. And in fact, last last month, there's a flank talk and Zab recording video. So I recommend you to enjoy. Yeah, okay. Okay, so this is the introduction. I will finish by the lunch. So lunch is very important. Totally 2020. So, totally 40 minutes. So, probably no, no problem. I hope. So, in the next section, I just present the solution of Yand equation. And in section 3, I just present the calculated results of action density of best model. So, the discussion is very, very simple. So, it's not difficult, I hope. Okay. Okay, so let's discuss the certain solution of Young's equation. So, Young equation is this one. So, now we use the complexified space-time coordinates Z tilde, Z, W tilde, and Z and W. So, this is just a convention. And we can recover, we can already recover four-dimensional space-time by taking the reality condition. Taking the reality condition as follows. So this convention is just the same as the book of Mason Woodhouse. The starting point is a flat four-dimensional complex space, and the metric is given by Mason. So, for example, if we take the following reality condition, where ZW are all real coordinates. The L coordinate, then the matrix becomes the speed to signature the other speed signature of the L the time. On the other hand, if we take the standard complex conjugate, so zo child would be zo bar, and w child would be minus w bar, then the metric becomes the Euclidean signature. So we just take the complexified space-time to discuss in a unified. To discuss in a unified way. And the gate group is now the GLNC. Gate group is not sigma takes values in the GLNC in this talk. But probably GL2C mainly. I'm sorry. Okay, let's construct the exact solution of the Young equation by taking the Derby. Equation by taking the double transformation. So we need the Lax representation of the Yand equation, which is as follows. And the compatible condition gives the Yand equation. But we note that there are spectral parameters here, but this is a non-avarian system. So now we take this spectral parameter data at not the scale. At not the scalar scalar scalar, but the n by n constant matrix and the right action. So, this point is, in fact, important. Then we can define the turbo transformation, which leaves the linear systems adapted. The double transformation is the transformation of F and sigma. The sigma is the body. The sigma is the body of the of the yand equation. Now, I'm sorry. And f is a solution of this linear system. Usually, this part is a derivative of sheet, but this is replaced with the light action of the constant matrix. So, now the lambda is a special value of the spectral parameter matrix. Vector parameter metallics. And the state is a special solution which corresponds to the lambda. So this would be the standard double transformation, but the derivative is replaced with the right action of the matrix. So if the lambda becomes scalar, this double transformation becomes trivial because this is commuting and the theta and the theta inverse is cancelled out. Canceled out. Anyway, so by the iteration of this Caribou transformation, we can get the following non-trivial solution from a zero, trivial zero solution. This is so this is just a long stand type solution. So this is a sound story of the double transform the double transform transformation. I'm sorry. Transformation, I'm sorry. And this theta and the theta two is a special solutions. And if it satisfies the following decays and relations, this is just a linear system of the total biodiversity solution. So detail is not important. And in fact, we use the language of a quasi-determinant now. This is not a standard determinant. This is not the standard determinant, but the creation determinant. And I don't discuss today what the quasi-determinant is. So we just define the query determinant as follows. The quasi-demand is represented by the determinant symbol with the box. Determinant with box is defined as follows. So this is one of the sure complement. And in fact, relate to the And in fact, relate to the inverse matrix. And this can be defined for any non-commutative element as well. And now 0 and 1 and theta i are all n by n matrix. No matrix valued element, but no problem. So totally this sigma is actually n by n by the definition. Okay, so the in-solute solution can be described by choosing each element of theta as the exponential function, exponential of a linear function that follows. So that exponential part and L is a linear combination of the special space. Special space-time coordinates. So, this is actually soliton solutions. And I'd like to remark that if we tune the spectral parameters as follows, then the group can be considered as a unitary groups. So, physically, no problem. Physically, no problem. Okay, anyway, let's calculate the basimin action of this soliton solution from now on. So, now let's discuss the four-dimensional version of best-minute models. So, best minimum retain consists of the two parts. This consists of the two parts: the sigma model part and the best minute terms. The sigma model part is defined as follows, and the best minute term is defined as follows. This is in terms of four dimensions. And the sigma model term is a standard sigma model term here. But today the k ra form omega here and the And omega now fix the flat flat flat space flat bargain and there the potential A and we use this way in this description. Originally, in fact, this is defined in five dimensions, but we can substitute the omega into here dA and d d over this place the cubic. Distress the cubic terms, but it automatically vanishes. So we can integrate and to get the four-dimensional version of this one. This is weighted products, weighted products version of the cubic term. So a little bit different from the two-dimensional model, but essentially the same look like, looks very similar. Like, but looks very similar. And that convention would be the standard. And the equation motion is easily calculated from this action and give us just a young equation as well. Okay, and let me make a comment on the direction to the n equal to string set. To the n equal to string theory. So, this n is a number of the word sheet of supersymmetry. So, n equals zero string is just a bordering string. The food target of space is 60, I'm sorry, 26 dimensions. And the field contents are very many. And any code one string is a standard ordinary super string whose target space is a ten dimension. Space is a 10-dimensional. And the field contents implied give us many, many fields. And n equals to string is just n equals to string. And the food target space is just a whole dimension. And this theory have the strong consonant on the supersymmetry. So the strong blaster consonant. The strong blast constraint. So the excited mode is not forbidden except for the massive scalar. So the field content is just a massive scalar. This is a very, very important point in the NQ strings. So we can write down the string field action explicitly in terms of the massive scalar only. So far, we discussed the best unit model. Far, we discussed the basiminid model. So, the relation between the dynamical variable sigma and the mass scalar scalar phi is given by this one, which is proposed by Obri and Bafa. Then, the four-dimensional basim action can be rewritten in terms of the phi. So, this is actually the n equal to string pdo cell reactions. Then we can. Then we can calculate the endpoint fact function from this action and check the consistency with the water sheet calculation. And this actually gives the product results. Okay, so let's jump back to the solitone solution. So I just show the results only. So fully VG. The one soitone is easily calculated. Is easily calculated by the previous solutions. Sigma is this one. And substitute this data into here. And we can get the following. So basically term is identically zero. But the sigma model term is that the popular popular consideration, the check square of a linear function of x. Of linear function of x. X is defined L plus L bar. So this is the other value, actually. I did some constant. So we can plot the peak over this configuration. So we can find that the peak is on the x equal to zero, which defines the three-dimensional hyperplane in four dimensions. So in this case, we sometimes call the four-dimensional one solidiform. Point. So at least we can say this is not the instantron. The instant is a point-like configuration in four-dimensional. But this is a three-dimensional hyperplane. So new type of soliton solution. But this is very, very quite similar to like Kp solitons. So as you know, Kp soliton is given by this one. So one soliton is this one, this one. So u is just the check square of x. The tx square of x. x is a linear function of t, x, and y. So this can be plotted as a two-dimensional hyperplane in three-dimensional. So three-dimensional means one time and two spatial. So if we cut some time slides, then there's a two-dimensional plane, which just describes the water flow, water surface. Surface and the cutled soliton becomes line. So, line is just a peak of the big grave. So, this is a simple generalization of Kp soliton, I hope. Okay, we can calculate the two soliton solutions. So, fortunately, sigma model terms have such compact forms. forms and the asymptotic analysis would be possible and in some direction this one and in another direction this one so one soliton one solution and otherwise zero so this implies that this this action density describes the two intersecting soiton plane as follows but there are some constant shift here so which is just Shift here. So it just corresponds to the phase shift. So parameter is the same as the Kp soliton. Okay, this is a sigma module term. And let me show the best minute terms as follows. Unfortunately, this is not compact and they contain very, very long, many terms. I cannot write down in this slide. But But the happiness is this one in the asymptotic region, this vanish identically. So, this contribution is only in the middle region and there is non-singularity. So, the total action density is a sigma-model contribution and the best minimal contribution. And this is some dressing in the middle region. Middle region. So, like this one. So, mainly, this is intersecting with two solitons, but there is a dosing effect in the middle region. And in the solitone solution, we only succeeded in the asymptotic analysis of the in-solid solution and found that this is a non-linear superposition. But this is a non-linear superposition of the n1-soliton solution. So, like this one. So, this is also the same as the K-P soliton. So, we can classify this solution in the same way over the K-P solitons, I hope. I would like to remark two remarks. One remarks is a deduction. Deductions so you may wonder what is a two-time physics. So matrix is a plus plus minus minus. So there are two time. Yeah, it's okay. So let's reduce to one time by one dimension. So there are two time coordinates x1 and x2, but now reduced to the x2 direction. It's possible. And we can get easily the solution solution for the deduced system by putting. Reduce the system by putting the alpha and lambda better because the dependence of x appears only here, so the coefficients vanish. So it's an exact solution. Then we can calculate the Hamilton density in this case because there is only one time coordinate. And in fact, the best minimal contribution. The best signal contribution of the Hamiltonian automatically developed. And the sigma model contribution is just this one. So one soliton just corresponds to the soliton volt, and the two solitones because they are intersecting soliton volts. And the position of the peak is partially the same as the peak of the action density. Of the oxygen density. So the analysis of action density would describe the physical object, I hope, in four-dimensional way. And there is another comments. So in fact, the Euclidean case, in fact, the solid-wall solution is almost the same as in the super signature, except for the value of the constant. Concern, but in this case, there are interesting solutions, instant on solution that features very well known, the Yamundu theory. So we can get such instant on solution for the Yand equation as follows. This is actually localized at the origin. So this is a point-like configuration in four dimensions. But unfortunately, there is a singularity here. There is a singularity here. So, this is a nice correspondence. So, there might be the better solution with no singularity, but I'm not sure. And people believe that the solution of Yam Southern Yamil and the solution of Yam's equation correspond to one-to-one. But this is very naive. So, that singularity. So, we have to. That singularity. So we have to take care of that problem and discuss the one-to-one correspondence. Okay, let me conclude. Okay, today we construct a new type of co-dimensional solitons and calculate the action density of the four-dimensional basic model of its suggestion intersecting 3D brain. This is realized in the n-equales to 3. Realize in the n equals to strings, so which gives us a new physical object, I hope. And in at the future work, there are many, many things to be seen. So one is that soy property, such as charge, mass, and moduli, and so on. And the classification would be possible. But there are no theta transformations and the tau function. So partially So, part theory is not similar, but there's a beautiful theory by Podamas and William Town for Kp soliton. I hope this can be applied to the Celhudia Yamid soliton as well. And also, the new system contains the very interesting integral system such as the Yamil Sykes model and the hitting system and the Elon sequence and the KDB and so on. And so on. So we can apply the double transformation into the raw dimensions, hopefully. And furthermore, let's jump back to the unified theory of integral systems. Now we discuss the solution solution of this best-mutation sign. So there might be the correspondence in full-dimensional chance. And we have to calculate. Calculate more physical quantities such as the endpoint function and conflict blocks and the conduct quantity and so on. Then we can compare the Chang-Simon side and might find the profound duality between two theories. And furthermore, I'd like to. More I'd like to extend to the non-commutative spaces. So, this is just an exercise. And I'm not sure this non-commutative extension would be interesting or not, but this would be possible. And in non-content species, there is some powerful solution-generating technique. And in fact, we have some special solution for the best minutes. In my mind, for one minute. So, that's a very, very powerful technique. So, this might be applied to some time of site also. Yeah, anyway, anyway, in this case, the key ingredient would be the quasi-tagnant. And I plan to discuss this one in March, in the next March. In the next match, in the seminar type online workshop in non-computer index system, the speakers include the professor Vladimir Letak and Bolodia Tang and Ilina Sang and so on. And Letak Sang will give three debut talks on Kuwait Chang Nan. So you're most welcome to join. Join or to discuss the future work. Okay, thank you very much.
