All right, so I'm going to give you a very brief overview of some work on the accumulation of till in grounding zones. Now this should go without saying for the audience in front of me, but for the benefit of the recording and the people who might be watching from other backgrounds, I'll give you. Other backgrounds. I'll give you a bit of a background. So I slide over the subglacial till or unconsolidated sediments, water-saturated sediments, and mixed with clay, which then effectively serve as a lubricant that enhances glacial sliding and glacial slip velocities. What it also does is it accumulates. Why is that top? Why is that top there? It might be the mode that the DDI is not a minimum. Okay, let me fix it. What was I saying? So that subglacial till, what it also does is it accumulates in the grounding zones of marine ice sheets. Marine ice sheets in between freely floating ice shelves and fully grounded ice sheets. Between ice and bedrock, as this layer of subglacial till accumulates into these wedge-shaped structures, also called till deltas. And these groundings and wedges have been nicely imaged somewhat seismically for sequences of such wedges found scattered throughout the sea floor, such as in the high-latitude shallow sea. High-latitude shelves of Antarctica. And there have been nice observational studies of things like their shape and size. These Grammy zone wedges have also been found to be accumulating under present-day ice streams such as beneath Willand's ice stream, feeding into the Ross Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. And there's a nice data set. And there's a nice data set of a grounding zone wedge that's deforming in the ice stream's present-day grounding zone. There are some uncertainties as to exactly the downstream wedge shapes because of water infiltration, but the upstream shape is quite well known. Well known. So we're going to refer to that data set in comparisons to what we do. And I should mention that these grounding zone wedges have important implications on ice sheet stability against, so grounding zone stability against rising sea levels. And I'll briefly mention some previous work by Richard Alley and I'll And all others looking at these accumulations of till and their effect on, for example, grounding line position. Grounding lines tend to advance under these groundings on wedges. The ice also tends to thicken in comparison to its initial shape Initial shape without the groundings on the wedge. One thing I want to point your attention to is the upper surface slope as we approach the grounding line, which you'll see some more of that later on. Here is, there's a close-up of the previous pictures. You'll see the dip and upper surface slope a bit better there. A bit better there in comparison to the previous upper surface height without the wedge and with the bedrock elevation. What has been found is that the presence of such a wedge stabilizes your ground new zones without the wedge under Wedge under considerable sea level rise, we get considerable grounding line retreat. But with these wedges, and also it depends on the stiffness, and by stiffness I mean it's meant here, basically the beta, the sliding coefficient, being smaller with these grounding. With these grounding zone wedges, the grounding line position does not retreat as much up until a certain point after which a certain sea level rise, a certain number of meters after which the grounding zone rise doesn't really matter. But before then, things are stabilized quite a bit. And a similar story happens when we look at reduction in buttressing. If we reduce buttons, If we reduce buttressing, things change quite a bit without the wedge, but the picture changes once we had a wedge. The ground and line position doesn't change as much anymore. Okay, so they're important in that sense. And I'd also like to thank David Pollard, there you are, for pointing this work out. Work out, this recent work on sediment transport under forced retreats. And these are 10-year, 10-million-year simulations with forced retreats every 1 million years looking at the sediment production and accumulation in grounding zones. Under typical parameter values, nothing shocking happens. As more sediment is produced. As more sediment is produced, or if we think of an increased sediment transport enhancement factor, there is a mechanism that leads to the production of these sequences of wedges, which then remind me of one of the previous slides that I've showed you earlier of these grounding zone wedges found on the sea floor and the high-latitude shelves. And the high-latitude shelves sold more of Julian Dallaswell's observational studies. And then things change, of course, when the sediment viscosities decrease. And these simulations, I think they involve weekly non-linear rheologies for TIL. Alright, I think I'm gonna this and go over here. Go over here. We can do some more, and also want to thank Dave for pointing me into this direction. We can look more at sediment transport beneath Antarctica and look at sediment thickness and cross-sections of sediment deposition at quite long simulations with time series. With a time series of sediment accumulations in different regions, different grounding zones. Alright, now what I want to focus on here is why do these wedges form in the first place? So what is this basic physical mechanism that causes them to appear? And I'm going to walk you through two types of physical mechanisms. Or I'll walk you through this process in two dynamical regimes. One involving friction-dominated ice sheets and one involving frictionless ice sheets in which the ice is very well lubricated by till or ice streams, in which most of the shear is confined to the lower layer of till and there's not much shear in the ice. So both of these. So both of these regimes we can think of in an unconfined geometry, so nothing happens in the xy plane. We can look at xz and this is both the shear-dominated or extensional case in which either most of the shears can find the lower layer of till or not. In the friction-dominated case, a lot I'll walk you through this process. We can think of wedge formation in terms of a balance of fluxes either side of the grounding line. And I've color-coded things. The loaded region, that's what I called it. This region here in red, everything in red is going to be, is going to involve quantities relating to the loaded region. That's just the region to the left of the grounding line. We can think of wedge formation in terms of a balance of fluxes of till in the loaded region, involving both hydrostatic and glaciostatic contributions for the spreading of till under the weight of the ice mass above it, some viscous coupling contributions. You can balance all of that against the flux of till in the unloaded region, so this bit here. This bit here, which just a little springing of till under its own weight, to give what we call a local unloading condition, which determines wedge geometry, which is effectively a balance of fluxes of till. And that gives us conditions for when a wedge will form in terms of the upper surface slopes and the obiscous couplings. Couplings. This term, the second term, that's the risk of this coupling term, is going to change in the other regime. And the other ones are going to stay pretty much the same. So we find wedges as long as the flux of till under the weight of the ice mass above it, modified by some viscous coupling, exceeds that of Exceed that of the question. Capital H is the eye sickness, and little H is the thickness of the edge. That's right, that's right. Oh, I should have said that. Yeah. Big H, also the bigger value. That's that. Little H is that one. Or what I was saying. Oh, we find a wedge when the flux of till. When the flux of tilt downstream, modified by viscous couplings, exceeds that of the spreading of till in the unload region. In a frictionless case, the flux of till in the low region involves similar contributions, apart from a different viscous coupling term, which cannot now be determined locally. Which cannot now be determined locally anymore because of the velocity field u, which is now affected longitudinally by conditions all along the ice sheet. So the thing isn't a very local expression anymore, but we can still make progress. We can balance that against the flux of till in the unloaded region to give us a local unloading condition that determines which geometry in this other regime, which now involves a different viscous. Involves a different viscous intern. And the other ones are pretty similar. Alright, if we zoom into this region, so just the region close to the gravity line, and if you look at some simulations, I'll draw your attention to this, the dip and upper surface slope, which means to us. Means to us that even the surface of the ice, the upper surface of the ice, feels the presence of the wedge. This thing, this phenomenon, happens only for extensional ice sheets. So for the second regime, it doesn't happen for the first regime in which the ice is friction dominated. So that's one big distinction, qualitative distinction, between Distinction between the two? Just a short note. This bug on the upper surface, you can explain it with the. If you solve for the shoe solution, you will see and you don't need the teeth. Because you are not at the hydrostatic achievement. You can see this one. It's a slightly different pump, though. It's a slightly different origin, though. Yeah, no, you can expect this. Yeah, uh no you can explain this observe, but uh just if you uh solution moment on the upper surface of the ice, where the landing moment induced by if you solve the stone solution, you see the surface arena, right? So there are several contributions for bumps like that, one of them being a wedge. Um, but of course, what you've said. But of course, what you've said is perfectly another reason why you'd have a bump there. But I mean, if we decrease the wedge, if it's, for example, not there, or if we decrease it, then we get less of that. And if we go back to the very friction-dominated regime, we don't see it at all. So yeah, so there are different things, different contributors to why we see bumps. Contributors to why we see bumps like that. One of them being this. Sorry, another quick question. What's the characteristic thickness for the ice sheet, what you are taking? Because it's like non-dimensional and what I did is I really exaggerated things. So this isn't really holistic in terms of geophysical quantities. I've made this so that people can see, but you can of course rescale and put different parameter values. I gave it a really big flux here so that you can see the tilt. The two. Wait, yeah. Okay, um, any more? Yeah, so this, all of that stuff that you've been seeing is it was done in a very simple rheology, very simple linear rheology for the till, but of course there's a lot of thought, a lot of discussion as to, well, what kind of rheology do you give it? What kind of considerative law does till have? And we can get different answers at different scales. We can get different answers at different scales, small scales, large scales. So let's just look a bit at the different possibilities and see what happens as we change the rheology. What happens to the wedge? And what happens to, for example, ice sheet and ice shelf velocities. A very simple thing that we can do is to mimic this plastic behaviour of the pill in that it's effectively a lot less viscous in the loaded region. A lot less viscous in the loaded region. So we can think of very large viscosities, effective till viscosities in the unloaded region, which then what it effectively does as we do that, as we change that parameter, what effectively happens is our ice sheet. I always get sheet and shelf confused, but here I mean ice sheet. Ice sheet, it decelerates, so the viscosities decrease as we approach the grounding line. So it's like as if the ice sheet feels that wedge and it tends to decelerate. That really reminds me of some earlier work by, some of the work shown by Hillmar on flow of ice past an obstacle. Very similar kind. Obstacle. A very similar kind of mechanism that we see. More build-up, smaller velocities right behind, right behind the wedge. Alright, here are some pictures. This is a very simple rheology, so linear, so just like some treacle under ice. You don't really see, you do see a wedge, but it's tiny. And I've of course made the parameters slightly unrealistic so we can. Slightly unrealistic, so we can just see everything. So the toe is thick enough. We still see a wedge, but it's very tiny. And as we increase its level of pseudo-plasticity, so make it completely non-linear, the thing builds up and builds up even more as we change the parameter NL, the power law exponent. And as we And as we do that, if we zoom in and even exaggerate more, we'll start seeing more of those dips in upper surface slope. Okay, so that's what happens when we change NL. What happens to the velocity field when we change that level of elasticity? Our velocity fields, the ice sheet, sheet now. It decelerates as we approach the ground line again, slightly differently, but a very similar phenomenon. So, the very simple idea of just incorporating this piecewise constant effective viscosity for till captures essentially the same behavior as this is capture. All right, that's what happens with increasing pseudoplasticity. Increasing pseudoplasticity, I'm going to skip over this one and instead walk you through what's going to happen for yield stress materials. And this is a very exaggerated picture. Again, I made a very big, I gave it a very big value of the flux, but you can see things better. But again, what we see, we get much larger wedges and much, much more visible jumps. Visible jumps, much more visible dips than upper surface slope. And as we change our yield stress, our velocity fields, ice sheet velocity fields decrease and accelerate even more as we approach the grounding length. Alright, and I'm out of time. And I'll follow up on conclusion slides. We've seen that subglacial till accumulates out there. We've seen that sublacial till accumulates at the grounding line. We found some simple fluid mechanical explanations for why that is. We've seen that a wedge will form if the flux of till driven by the glaciostatic pressure gradient of the overlying ice is greater than the flux of till ahead of the grounding zone. And we've looked at different viscous couplings in two different regimes between ice and till and a weak effect of rheology. What happens when we change? Of rheology, what happens when we change the rheology? So, all right. Questions, Dan. That, that, one nice talk. Those observations you showed at the beginning, those radar observations, have they been done sort of like with repeats, as in, do we know what the rate of change, if any, are of these white chips? You should uh respond from uh You shouldn't respond from an image from Dowswell and Vugel. Oh, yeah, so there's a bunch of them. There's a bunch of data sets of different showing changes? Yeah. In time? I think so, yes. I think so. But here... For those images, submarine or sub-ice wedges? Here, this is all in the ocean. Okay. So no ice. But there is, I mean, if anyone knows of any more data sets of wedges under ice, I'd be really grateful to. I'd be really grateful to know, because this is the only one that I've come across the data from beneath the lens ice stream. There's a more recent paper from the Penn State group from a grad student from Luthra. Okay, where they find distinct sediment packages underneath lilens, I think. Oh, still. Yeah, for the Krishnan study. In the study, there was no time-to-time variation, but they just estimated the time scale of the formation just from the observed volume of the wedge and the estimated sediment flux from upstream. But that would come from a model as that's not just order back top. So I usually think of sediment as being highly dilatational, and we have some yield stress above which it's going to deform with some kind of associated disassociation. Is going to deform with some kind of associated or disassociative plastic law. Have you thought or incorporated the fact that it's going to change its volume as it deforms? No, I haven't. That's interesting, actually. I was just going to say the one study that I'm really familiar with that does see changes in time, I think, is Ed King's study on Rutford, where there are sediment packages, sort of zooming past. It would be really interesting to see this change. interesting to see this change but I think this work is this work done with seismics though because it sees partly through the ocean column and and so repeat studies require you to go back and repeat the seismic measurements and that probably means it's less likely to be done than the radius to try and everything. I don't have much authority on this but I do think there's slight spin. Um I it's sort of a question I'm throwing at because it seems unlikely to be radar but I It seems unlikely to be radar, but I'm not confident that because radar is easy to repeat. If you wanted to test this, you might even be able to. There's a radar campaign going on somewhere ask us the line, but if it's seismic, it means having to get a whole team out there and spend the CNN. I do think it is seismic, but I'm not much going up whether it's not sure it's relevant really, but some time ago. What Z discovered was that it propagates like a non-linear tilt wave. So the velocity of the form, the vector cell, was very different from the velocity of the individual particles within it. And the flood that you would have expected it to be transmitted was, as a consequence, much, much smaller. Because readers were ashamed of concerning the fieldway that is moved on with a very insignificant flux settling flux. That's really interesting because I'm extending this to more on the granular scale. If you can send me that. Yeah, I haven't probably written it up as well. This is a whole stalk, so it's basically two stalks both within the ice and of the two. Thanks. More questions? Okay, if not, I think we're going to break for coffee. I think we decided we were going to split two and two, right? Or unless I mistake. To right or almost open stove and save this coffee. Do you press the button?
