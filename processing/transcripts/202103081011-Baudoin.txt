It's a pleasure to have our second speaker here now, Fabrice Baudoin, who is a professor at the University of Connecticut. Fabrice was a student of Mark Yor and Hu Yan Pham, again, not hopefully too many years ago, because it was the same time I was a student, and also worked with David Newellart. He works on stochastic analysis, rough path analysis, and sub-Riemannian geometry. And today he's going to talk about logarithmic sub-love inequality. About logarithmic subtle of inequalities and how they fit into all of the things that we love. Take it away, Fergus. Okay, thank you, Todd. So, thank you to the organizer for this very nice workshop. So, I was asked to give an overview talk, survey talk on logs about inequality. So, I will not present anything new in the talk. So, it's more a talk which is aimed to younger students. And my main purpose. And my main purpose will be to show some ideas, you know, which are related to Log-Sovolev inequalities. So I will start with a brief introduction of the main character of the talk today, which is the Log-Sovolev inequality in Rn for the Gaussian measure. So the basic statement of the inequality is the following. If you consider the Gaussian measure on Rn, which is centered on variance one, Than variance one, then it's possible to control the entropy of any function in terms of the energy of the function. So the statement of the inequality is the following. You are able to bound the entropy of f squared with respect to the Gaussian measure in terms of the total energy of the function, which I defined as being the integral over Rn of Over Rn of the norm of the gradient. So some first brief historical perspective on the study of this inequality. The inequality involves, you know, on the left-hand side, the entropy of the function f squared, which is a notion, you know, that has been studied for a very long time, that first appeared in mathematical physics and was particularly important in the works by Boltzmann. In the works by Boltzmann in the 19th century. So you can see Boltzmann on the left picture and was kind of rediscovered in another framework by Shannon in the context of information theory. So Shannon is the picture on the right-hand side. So logs of all F inequality in themselves appeared before the famous paper by Lengross and can be seen in Be seen in different forms under different names in works by Stam in Information Theory, in a work by Federbusch in Mathematical Physics. However, Log-Sobolef inequality became the central object of studies in a very famous paper by Lengross in 1975, where the importance of this inequality was illustrated. This inequality was illustrated clearly in connection with hypercontractivity properties and regularization properties of semi-group. In particular, in this paper by Len Gross, the equivalence between the Log-Soble F inequality for the Gaussian measure, as I presented it on the first slide, and the hypercontractivity of the Orange-Tan-Mullenbeck submigroup. Uh, semi-group that was put forward earlier in papers by Ed Nelsons in 1966 and 1967 is shown in the paper by Lembross. That is, he established in a clear way the equivalence between the log-sorbolev inequality and the high pertinent activity property of the Arshkander-Lenbeck submigroup. So a very So, a very quick comment about the inequality in itself. If you look at it from the analytic point of view, that is, assuming that you come from analysis, this inequality belongs to the large family of Sobolef-type inequalities. This provides an improvement of integrability. So, a very naive way to look at it is you have a function which is in L2 of the Gaussian measure. Gaussian measure whose gradient is also in L2, then actually the function is more than in L2. It's such that f square root of log f is also in L2. So this is the typical feature of the Sovolf inequality. If you have a function which is in some LP, you know also some integrability property of its derivative. You have for free an improvement of the integrable. An improvement of the integrability of the function, which is quantified extremely precisely by a Sobolev inequality. So, this log-Sobolef inequality belongs to this family of Sobolef inequalities. Something which is striking about the log-Sobole F inequality is that you see that on the right-hand side, in front of the energy of the function, I have the constant 2. So, this is very striking that this constant 2 is... Think that this constant 2 is the same for all the Rn. And in particular, the constant is optimal, that is, the extremals in the Luxable F inequality are easily seen to be the exponential functions. The fact that this constant 2 is independent of the dimension is illustrative of the fact that actually Log-Sobolev inequalities are inequalities that are going to hold unlike the Going to hold, unlike the Sobole F1 in infinite dimensions. So, this is an aspect of the Log-Soble F inequality I will be trying to illustrate a little later in the talk. So, there exist numerous proofs of this inequality. Once, Michel Ledoux shared to me that he knew 15 proof of log servo life, so I don't know as many proofs. I will try to give you three. I will try to give you three proofs, you know, which are different, and each of them can be generalized in different directions. So, as this is often the case in mathematics, you know, when you have a theorem or statement that you like, it's always useful, you know, to think about different proofs of this statement because different proofs, you know, shed different light on the phenomenon of Of the theorem or the statement, and they can be generalized in different directions. So the first proof, which is amazing, is a proof by Len Gross, you know, which is based on the observation that the Log Sobole F inequality is an inequality which is stable by tensorization. So essentially, proving the Log Sobole F inequality for the Gaussian measure will Gaussian measure will follow from the Loxable F inequality on the two-point space for a Bern-Moulli random variable. Then, using tensorization and central limit theorem, you get the Log-Soblef inequality for the Gaussian measure as a consequence of the Log-Soblef inequality on a two-point space. And the optimal constant 2 is preserved by the tensorization process. So, even though this proof is amazing, I will... So even though this proof is amazing, I will not present it to you. I decided for my talk to focus on the semi-group approach to the LOXO-BOLF inequalities. And so a proof that we are going to see together in the next few slides that has been discovered by Bakri and Emry is a so-called Ernste-Weinbeck semi-group interpolation proof, where the idea is to look Look at the entropy functional along the Ernst Lane-Beck semi-group and study some monotonicity property of this entropy fall functional. There is a second proof that I will develop during the talk. This is a proof based on stochastic calculus, which is presumably due to Jacques Nouveau, where logs of Oleph inequality For the Gaussian measure is simply seen as a consequence of an inequality that holds on the space of Bronian function, that is, of an inequality that holds on the Wiener space. Then the Docso-Bolef inequality for the Gaussian measure is just a finite dimensional trace of this inequality that lives on the Wiener space. On the linear space. The third proof and the fourth that I mentioned today, the third proof I want to develop will be the heat kernel measure approach that has been first devised by Bakri and Ledoux and that has been pushed forward by driver and who and applied in the context of loop groups by driver, which is an interpolation ID again. Correlation ID again of the entropy function along the semi-group, but this time not the Ernstein and Helbeck semigroup, but the heat semigroup, the heat semi-group itself. So the first proof, which is based on interpolation along the Ernst-Uhlenbeck semigroup. So the idea is to consider first the Ernst-Umbellen Consider first the Ernst-Willenbeck operator on Rn, which is defined as the Laplacian minus X inner product with a gradient. And note as a starting point that C's diffusion operator admits the Gaussian random variable, the Gaussian distribution gamma as an invariant and symmetric margin. So, representation for the semi-group, the Einstein-Rombeck semi-group is well known. The Einstein-Hombeck semigroup is well known and is given by the Mellar's formula. This is a Gaussian semigroup for which the mean and the variance can be computed, leading then to the representation of the semigroup of the Ernst Lein Mullenbeck. So based on this very nice formula, this is straightforward to observe a commutation between the gradient and the orange channel and embassy. More precisely, if you look at the formula, More precisely, if you look at the formula for Pt, which is given by the Meller's formula, if you differentiate Pt with respect to X, you see immediately that the gradient of Pt is equal exactly to exponential minus T P T of the gradient. This is a typical commutation property between the first-order derivative and the semi-loop. So the Mellor formula not only does So, the Meller formula not only does it give this commutation property between the gradient and the semi-group, it also automatically implies, at least we can see immediately from it, that it implies the convergence to equilibrium at an exponential rate when t goes to infinity. So more precisely, when t goes to infinity, p t of f is going to converge to an equilibrium, which is the average of f with respect to the invariant measure. Invariant measure, which is in this case the Gaussian distribution, the Gaussian measure. So, based on these two observations, we have the two ingredients we need to prove the Logs-Obolef inequality using this interpolation technique. So, before going to the proof itself, there is something I would like to mention, because this is actually at the core of the argument. Of the argument, this is a subcommutation between the semi-group and the gradient. This sub-commutation is actually enough to run the argument instead of the commutation itself. So the commutation for the Einstein-Liemen-Back semi-group immediately implies, you know, using triangle inequality, of course, that it's possible to control the norm of the gradient in terms of Pt of the gradient. So this is Pt of the gradient. So this is again a regularization property for the semi-group PT, which is quantified in terms of this subcommutation property. So let's now go to the heart of the proof of the gross logs or left inequality using interpolation along the Arnstan and Beck Semigroup. So the basic idea will be to see the entropy of F as being the total variation. As being the total variation of the entropy of PTF when t goes from zero to plus infinity. So simply by writing that when t is equal to zero, PTF log PTF is equal to F log F. And then when T is equal to infinity, P T F log P T F is the integral of F times the log of the integral of F. Okay, that is, this is an interpolation formula. Formula, then you just write that the variation of the entropy is the integral of the derivative. And then you start doing calculus with the integral of the derivative. That is, if you differentiate with respect to time the expression PTF log of PTF and use the fact that PTF by definition is a solution of the heat equation. In other words, that the derivative of PTF with respect to T is equal to With respect to t is equal to L of P T F, you see immediately that the entropy of the function f can also be written as an integral of L P T log of P T F. Observe that if you apply the chain rule, you would have another term that would be L of P T F divided by P T F times P T F. But this is the same as the integral of L of P T F. And I remind you that the integral of L of P T F integral of L of P T F has to be equal to zero because gamma is an invariant measure for the semigroup PT. Then after applying chain rule you integrate by part. That is the idea would be to transform a second order derivative into a first order derivative using integration by part. So if you use integration by part for the Laplace operator in Rn you see that the integral You see that the integral of L P T F L times the log of PTF is nothing else but the norm of the grad of PTF squared that you divide by PTF. Now is the time to use my ingredients. So far I only did calculus. I did not use any specific property of the semi-group besides the fact that I have convergence to equilibrium when t goes to infinity. To infinity. So the key point is now to use the sub-commutation property between the gradient and the semigroup that I was trying to stress a few slides ago. So using this sub-commutation, you are going to bound the gradient of the semigroup by exponential minus 2t pt of the gradient squared. And in the next step, you use Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to make the energy of F happy. Of F happy. Using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and using the fact that probability measures, this is easy to see that you can control PT of gradient of F in terms of PTF, PT of the gradient squared divided by F. You just write the norm of the gradient is the same as the norm of the gradient divided by square. norm of the gradient divided by square root of f times square root of f and then you use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality with respect to the Heat-Kernel measure of the Einstein-Wienbeck symbol. So coming back to the interpolation argument, what you got so far is the entropy of the function f can be controlled in terms of this quantity on the right-hand side that involves the Fischer information of F. So now is the time So now is the time to obtain the Lux-Obolev inequality using the fact that the integral of pt with respect to gamma is a function itself, that is, a gamma is an invariant measure, and using the fact that the integral from zero to plus infinity of exponential minus 2t is equal to one half, you end up, after doing your interpolation, with the inequality which is a desire. With the inequality, which is the desired inequality, the entropy of F can be controlled in terms of the Fisher information. Now, if you prefer to deal with the energy form of the Lux-Sobolev inequality, this is enough to replace F by F squared to obtain the inequality with the constant 2 that I gave to you and the energy of F on the right-hand side. So what we use What we used in this proof are basically, you know, the interpolation property along the semi-group PT together with the commutation property of Pt. This is the main ingredient. So another point, maybe a remark, is that the sharp constant 2 in the Luxaboleph inequality in this proof appears as an integral from 0 to plus infinity of the exponential minus 2 t dt. Of the exponential minus 2 T dt. The second proof I would like to stress and later generalized in a different framework is a Clark-Okon formula approach. That is, if you prefer dealing with stochastic calculus rather than semi-group theory, you have a proof for you, which is based on the Brownian motion. So consider BT to be an n-dimensional Brownian motion and Clark Cochran. Clark-Cochin formula is a formula which is a representation formula for functionals of this Brownian motion. So, what the Clark-Cochon formula gives is an explicit representation of the integrand in the Ito representation formula for Martingase. So, it's possible to write any Brownian functional big F as a stochastic integral with respect to the Bronian function. integral with respect to the Bronyan motion B in terms of the so-called Mali-Van derivative on the Wiener space. So Mali-Van derivative is an object on which I will come back a little later in the talk. It's a derivative which is defined for functional of the Brownian motion. So you can think of it very naively speaking as a Frechet derivative on the space of Bronier. Space of Brownian functions. So, this claim-token formula, a way to prove it, is using the integration bypass formula, which is at the basis of Maliaban calculus. So, Clark-Okon formula, and this is something that I'm going to use a little later, is a very straightforward consequence formula of the integration by part formula on the path space. So, the statement of Clark-Okon formula tells us. Of the Clark-Occon formula tells us that if you look at the martingale exponential of F given Bt, where Bt is the natural filtration of the Brownian motion B, then the representation of the stochastic derivative of MT, that is the integrand, is given exactly in terms of the Malayvan derivative of the functional F, where I forgot to write the conditional expectation. The conditional expectation. So there is a typo at the bottom of the page. It should be conditional expectation of DTF given BT. So now that you have our presentation of the stochastic derivative of the Martingale MT, you can play around with Ito calculus. In particular, if you want to study the entropy functional, this is a good idea to try to apply Ito's formula to empty log empty. So using Ito's formula, So using Ito's formula for empty log empty, where empty is a martingale that I introduced before, and taking expectation, assuming that the local martingale part has an expectation that vanish, you end up with the following representation of expectation of m1 log of m1 minus expectation of m0 log of m0 in terms of the quadratic variation of the summary martin. Of the summary martingale empty log of empty. So the computation of the quadratic variation in Ito's formula for empt log of empty yields this one half of expectation of integral from 0 to 1 of 1 over ms square the norm square of the conditional expectation of the Mali-Band derivative. Therefore, coming back to the definition of the Martindale Mt, I remind you that M T is a conditional expectation. T is a conditional expectation of F given Bt. At time one, this martingale is F, the random variable I am interested in. And at time zero, this is simply the expectation of F. So we get that the entropy of the random variable F can be written in terms of the Malay-Band derivative. In particular, this is equal to one-half the expectation of the integral from 0 to 1 of this. To one of this expression which is inside of the integral. That already looks like a Fisher information on the Wiener space. So now the next step will be to use Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and replacing F by F squared. So if you replace F by F squared in the previous equality that I obtained, and you use Cauchy-Schwartz inequality after applying chain rule for the Maliaran derivative, you are able to You are able to control on the norm of the conditional expectation of the Maliaran derivative of f squared in terms of the conditional expectation of f squared itself and the conditional expectation of the norm of the Mali-Band derivative. So the conditional expectation of F squared simplifies and I end up after applying the fact that the conditional expectation is a contraction in L2, I end up Contraction in L2, I end up with the fact that the entropy of the random variable F squared can be bounded from above by two times the integral from 0 to 1 of the total energy of F, of the random variable F. So this is the Log-Sovolef inequality on the Wiener space. A very special case of this Log-Soberlev inequality. Of this log Sober F inequality, which holds, you should note, with the same optimal constant 2, which is dimension independent, as I already stressed out. A very special case is given where you take for the functional of the Bronian motion the end point. That is, if you apply the log-Stovel F inequality on the Vinear space to the functional f is a function of B1. function of B1, and you observe that B1 is nothing else but distributed as a Gaussian or non-variable in Rn with mean 0 and variance 1, you get the Log-So-Bolef inequality with the optimal constant. So what I like in this proof is that this proof illustrates the fact that the Log-Sobolev inequality in M can be seen as a trace, a finite dimensional trace of Trace of an infinite-dimensional log-suball inequality that holds on the pass space. The third proof I would like to stress is based on the heat-kernel measure approach. So, in this proof, we are going to see the Gaussian-Ronan variable with mean zero and variance one as being simply the heat kernel at time one issued from zero. Uh, issued from zero, heat kernel being the Euclidean heat kernel. So, if you consider the heat semigroup, the Euclidean heat semigroup, which is simply the semigroup generated by the Laplacian Rn, which is given explicitly as a convolution with the Gaussian kernel, the density of this heat semi-group at time one, if you plug in x is equal to zero, is the Gaussian measure gamma. So then you are going to perform an interpolation along an interpolation of the entropy functional along this heat semigroup, but not from 0 to plus infinity as you did for the Ernstian semi-group, but an interpolation between 0 and 1. So evaluating the variation of the entropy, we can write as we did before. We can write, as we did before for the Einstein-Ihlen-Beck semigroup, the entropy of the semi-group at time one, that is, P1 of F log F minus P1 F log of P1 F can be written as an integral from 0 to 1 of the derivative of C's forward-backward functional of the heat semi-group, which is given in my slides. This is the same observation as before, is that when S is equal to zero, you notice forward back. You know this forward-backward interpolation of the semi-group is nothing else that P1 F log of P1 F, and the value when S is equal to 1 is P1 of A log F times log F. So writing that the variation is equal to the integral of the derivative and then differentiating the expression, that is, if you differentiate with respect to S the for one. Respect to S, the forward-backward interpolation, and you use chain rule, you know, together with the fact that P solves the heat equation with respect to the Laplacian, you get a very nice formula, which is extremely clean. That is a lot of terms that simplify when you apply chain rule. I did not write them explicitly, but you have explicitly a next formula, you know, for this derivative of the forward-backward interpolation in terms of the PS of P1. Ps of P1 minus F of the norm of the gradient of P1 minus F squared. The next observation is that we need to go at order 2 to study the monotonicity property of the forward-backward function rule. And if you differentiate one more time this quantity, which is inside of the integral, you will see that this is increasing. That is the derivative with respect to S of this forward bound. To S of this forward-backward interpolation is actually non-negative all the time. There is an explicit formula which is given in terms of the Hessian of the log of P1 minus SF squared. So what we are using hidden in the argument is a convexity property of the entropy functional along the heat semi-group flow. So using So using C's monotonicity property of the functional, we bound simply, you know, the term in the integral by the largest value, which is obtained when s is equal to 1. If you bound the value by s is equal to 1, you get immediately that the entropy of the function f can be controlled by p1 of f, the norm of. Of f, the norm of the gradient of log f squared, which is a Fisher information of F. This is immediately the Sharploc-Soboff inequality when you replace, as you did before, you know, F by F squared, and you get from this proof, that is, by interpolation and using the convexity property of the entropy function along the heat semi-role flow, you get the Get the Sharp Loxable F inequality for the heat kernel measure of the heat semigroup, which is nothing else but the Gaussian measure. So these are the three proofs of the Lux-Sabolev inequality I wanted to point out in this talk, because I'm going to try to generalize them in different directions to see where they can be generalized. Okay, so more generally, a Lux-Serbolev inequality can be stated in an abstract form, for instance in the context of a Dirac space. A Log-Serbolev inequality on a Dirac space is an inequality that relates the entropy of a function f to the energy of this function f. So, the type of log-sobolef inequality we are going to be interested in are Steady now are logs of all f inequality where the entropy of the function f squared is bounded from above by a constant that on a purpose I write in the form of 2 over rho times the integral of gamma of F d mu. So the integral of gamma of F d mu in the sequel is going to be a Diracly form. You should think of it as being a generalized energy of the function f on an abstract space. function f on an abstract space. So for instance, you know, if you want to put the explicit example that we have been studying at the beginning of the talk into this framework, what we already proved is that the Log's above F inequality is true on the space X, which is equal to Rn, equipped with a measure μ, which is a Gaussian measure, and where the Dirty form of interest is the energy form with respect to the Gaussian measure. Respect to the Gaussian measure. So, Logs of Oleph inequality are the intersection of many areas of mathematics, and this is maybe why they admit so many proofs. And the field of application of this inequality is still growing nowadays. That is, they were extensively studied starting from 1975, and the field of application is still expanding today. So, I cannot, of course, mention all of the application, but I would just mention But I will just mention some directions that are particularly active. So, the first set of directions that has been following the study of Log-Sobolev is a study of isoperimetric inequality in infinite dimension and related concentration inequality. So, this line of research was particularly developed around work by Lodou, Talagran, Udre and Bobkov. There is a line of research about applications of log soboble affinity. Of Log-Sobole F inequality to Riemannian geometry, to sub-Riemannian geometry, to analysis in infinite-dimensional spaces, because one of the features of those inequalities, as I told you, is that they hold in dimension in infinite dimension because the optimal constant in those inequalities are independent of the dimensions. They found application in statistical mechanics, analysis on metric measure spaces, more Analysis on metric measure spaces more recently, where log-soble F inequalities actually can be taken as definition of curvature bounds on rough metric spaces. They have been applied recently to prove conversion to equilibrium for solutions of PDE. So they found application in PDE theory and to the study of heat kernel bars. So I do not pretend to be exhaustive, but I just wanted to point out But I just wanted to point out some of the areas in which Logs of Lef inequality can be used. So, in that general setting of Dirac space, I would like to mention a general theorem, which is a fundamental theorem by Lenn Gross, which relates the Log-Sobolef inequality, which is stated in this abstract framework of a Diracle space, to a regularization property of the semi-group associated with this Diracle space. That is essentially what sets. That is essentially what says the Log-Sabole F-inequality. This is a property about the improvement of integrability for the subming group Pt. So this is a regularization property of the subming group PT. So the following properties are equivalent in the framework of Nirikle spaces. The Log-Sovole F inequality holds with this constant 2 over rho if and only if there is an entropy decay of the semigroup itself. The semi-group itself, that is, the semi-group PT is going to converge to equilibrium to the invariant measure μ in the entropy, in the entropy distance, that is, with respect to the entropy. And the third property is called the hypercontractivity property of the semi-group. It says that the semi-group improves the integrability of the function f when the time t is large enough. So this is the T is large enough. So, this is a regularization property saying that the function f in Lp is transformed into a function f in LQ by the semi-group when t is large enough. So let me now play around with the proof that I gave you, the three proof of the Loxovole F inequality. I will try to play with them and to see in which direction they can be generalized. So the first proof I mentioned is a proof by interpolation along the By interpolation along the Ernst Linbeck semigroup. So I'm going to try to generalize this proof in the framework, for instance, of a Riemannian manifold equipped with a weight measure, which is going to be an exponential density with respect to the volume measure. And the log-servable F inequality I'm going to be interested in is a control of the entropy of the function f squared on this Riemannian manifold in terms of. Default in terms of an energy form which is given by the gradient associated with the Riemannian structure and a measure which is this weight measure I've been considering. So the basic question I will be asking is that under which condition on the geometry of the manifold M and analytic property of the weight U can I run the Ernst-Ulenbeck interpolation method to get the microphone. Interpolation method to get a proof of the Luxabolev inequality. So, as you have seen, we need two ingredients to run the Einstein-Weulhenbeck interpolation method. And the first ingredient is that we need an Einstein-Mullenbeck operator. So, in that framework, the Einstein-Weulhen-Beck operator is going to be the generator of the Director form I am interested in. This is simply the operator which is given by the Laplacian minus the gradient of the Minus the gradient of the weight. So this operator satisfies the property I've been using in my proof of the Gaussian-Marks-Obole F inequality using the Arnston-Beck interpolation. It admits my weighted measure as an invariant and symmetric measure. And the second ingredient I need is the sub-commutation property for the semi- So this is where the geometry is going to enter into the play and Going to enter into the play, and it's possible to prove that this subcommutation property for the semi-group turns out to be equivalent to the non-negativity of a tensor, which is associated both to the geometry of the manifold in the term of the Rigi curvature, and it's going to be associated with the convexity property of the weight I've been using on my manifold in terms of the HN of U. In terms of the HN of U. So the subcommutation ingredient that I've been using in my Anchor-Unenbeck interpolation proof is made available in such geometric framework as long as I am able to control from below this tensor, which is called, by the way, the BAC free M-RI tensor of the Riemannian of the weighted Riemannian manifold. So this subcommutation is satisfied if and only if. If and only if this cancer is bounded from below by the constant rule. As a consequence of this result, that relate the subcommutation to a lower bound on this tensor Rick plus Hessian using exactly the same proof as I did in the Gaussian case, I obtained without any further work the Loxo-Bolef inequality on weighted Riemannian manifold. This is exactly the Default. This is exactly the same proof. So the conclusion is that we just need the subcommutation to run the Ernst Lane Eulen back interpolation technique. So baccaliency criterion is a way to generalize in an abstract framework this method. That is a baccalaureate calculus. It's Taylor-made to run the Ernst Land-Weinbeck interpolation method in an Interpolation method in an abstract framework. So consider a general diffusion operator that could be on a manifold or on a more general Dirac space, actually, which is symmetric with respect to a measure mu. We can compute an analog of this bacterium retensor in the form of a gamma2 operator, which is an object which is constructed intrinsically from the operator L. The idea of the bacterium recalculus. The bacterium recalculus, the gamma2 calculus, is to extract from L an intrinsic notion of curvature that will allow you to perform the Ernst-Wühlenbeck interpolation method to prove the Loxaboff inequality. So the first idea is to extract from L a generalized notion of gradient, which is obtained by the so-called Car-Réluschen operator that was first introduced by Paul Andre-Meilleux, and iterates his definition. Iterates this definition as was done by Bakry, by Dominique Bakry, to get the so-called gamma2 operator, which is going to play the role of the intransigent curvature of the operator L. So, for instance, if you perform this calculus on Rn, where delta is the Laplacian, the Carrier-Duchant operator is nothing else but the gradient, the bilinear form given by the gradient, and the gamma2 operator is And the gamma2 operator is the Hilbertmint norm of the action. So, what is the Bachelor-Riceterian? Backlier criterion is a lower bound of gamma2 in terms of gamma. So, we are going to say that the operator L satisfies the bicycle criterion parameter rho if and only if it's possible to bound from below gamma 2 by ρ. For example, if you apply the gamma2 calculus to the case of the Einstein-Landbeck operator on a weighted space, the bakery and recritarium is equivalent to the uniform convexity of the potential. So, those are typical examples that have already been pointed out. This is a case of Laplacian operator on Riemannian manifold. I will go a little Many manifold. I will go a little bit quicker here because I would like to present the end of my talk. So, Baccalaure Mecriterion is actually exactly what we need for the subcommutation ingredient. So, it turns out that this is exactly equivalent to the subcommutation property I've been trying to stress out from the very beginning. That is, the subcommutation property. That is, the subcommutation property for the semigroup is equivalent to the validity of the Bakrin reguletelium. This is abstract framework. So you see now where the statement on the weighting Riemannian manifold came from. The subcommutation property for the semi-group on a weighting Riemannian manifold was equivalent to a lower bound on the backframe retensor because of this backframe criterion that was in the background. That was in the background. So, if we put the pieces together and we apply exactly the same proof that we did in the case of Rn, we conclude that at the high level of generality, this is enough to get the Baklin-Recriterion with the parameter rho to get the Logs of Olephnality with a constant 2 over ρ. Again, the proof is exactly the same as for the proof of the Logs of Level 1. The proof of the Luxo-Bolev inequality that relied upon the Harnstein-Wuhenbeck interpolation method. So this was playing around with my proof number one of the Luxable F inequality. At this level of generality, we may wonder what does the approach number three give, which was the approach by the heat kernel measure. And it turns out that in this context, In this context of semi-group or diffusion operator satisfying the Bakri-Ri-Cliterian, if you mimic the Eat-Kernel measure proof of the Log-Sobole F-inequality in R-Element, that is you apply the convexity property of the entropy functional along the heat-semigroup flow, you get something which is stronger than what we did before, that what we obtained before. So, playing around. So playing around with the proof number three gives us a stronger statement, which is going to be a family of logs of LF inequality depending on time. That is, the heat kernel measure approach to the Log Sobole F inequality yields that for any diffusion that satisfies the Bakerian criterion, there is a Log Sobole F inequality with a constant which is explicit. The constant is 1 minus. The constant is 1 minus exponential minus 2 rho t divided by 2 rho for any t. So, in particular, and this is actually a very special case, if rho is positive by letting t goes to infinity, we recover the log-so-boller-inequality for the invariant measure of the semi-group PT. So, this family of log-sobolev inequalities that depend on time for the heat kernel measure allow to The heat kernel measure allows to recover when t goes to infinity the Log-So-Bole F inequality for the invariant measure mu itself. So, this is actually a stronger form than the Ernst-Lenbeck interpolation method. So, this type of approach to Luxabole F-inequality for the heat kernel measure was further developed, in particular in Infinite Dimension, in works by Driver and Lorentz. And this type of technique. And these types of techniques were applied, for instance, in the context of pinned loop groups. So, now, maybe to conclude, let me play around with my proof number two of the Lau-So-Bolef inequality that was based on the Clark-Foucaux formula. And let me apply the method of the proof in a Riemannian setting. So, I'm going to follow the approach by Capitan, Shu and Lodou to prove a Luxo-Olef inequality. To prove a Loxable F inequality on the path space over a Riemannian manifold, Wood's trace, you know, could yield the Lox-Obolev inequality for the heat-kernel measure on the Riemannian manifold. So, as you have seen, and this is something I tried to stress from the very beginning, the starting point is a Clark formula, which is based on the integration by part formula. So, the tool which is required to run Which is required to run the method and to run this proof number two is the integration by part formula on the path space. So, fortunately, there has been a remarkable paper by Bruce in 1992, where he proved the integration by parts formula on the pi space of a Riemannian manifold, and therefore opening the door to Maliavan calculus on pi spaces of a Riemannian manifold, and in particular to Particular to the proof of the Log Souble F inequality following the Novell method. So, in a nutshell, so I don't want to enter into the details here because I'm pretty sure that El Ton is going to speak more about it tomorrow. So, in a nutshell, the approach is the following. We first have a Maliavan derivative on the path space of a Riemannian manifold that, very loosely speaking, I can define as follows. Speaking, I can define as follows. The main idea is that you have a Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold that you start from a point X. You can construct a Brownian motion on a tangent space by using parallel transport along the path of the Brownian motion of the manifold. Then, associated to this parallel transport and this Brownian motion in the Euclidean space, which is in the background. Space which is in the background, we can define the damped Maliarman derivative that takes into account the curvature of the manifold. So the damped Maliam derivative is defined as a modified version of the Valiaran derivative using the curvature of the manifold, the Ricci curvature. And the integration by path formula that holds on the path space is written in terms of Is written in terms of this damped malleable materiality. That is, any functional of the Brownian motion on the Riemannian manifold can be integrated by part in terms of this dense Maliaban derivative. So, this integration by part formula yields, you know, the Clarkochon formula, which is the only ingredient we need to apply. Uh, to apply the log-soble F to apply the Log-Soble F proof that I gave you using the Clark-Oben formula. So, in particular, we get a Log-Soble F inequality on the Riemannian path space that L turn is going to, I think, to develop into more details. So, I only focus on three proofs, you know, for the log-sober F inequality that I try to generalize in several directions. But you can try to play the same games, you know, with the other proofs. Games, you know, with the other proof of the Log-Sobolef inequalities that you know, for instance, the proof based on Sharp-Sobolef embeddings, proof based on direct hypercontractivity proof for the Ernstein-Nüran-Beck semi-group, and try to generalize them in different ways, and you are going to get an interesting mathematical adventure trying to generalize the proof in different settings, showing hence, you know, that logs. Showing hence, you know, that Logs of LF inequality turns out to be at the center, you know, of a circle of ideas reaching far out of the original aim. So this is it for today. Essentially, this is all what I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Thank you, Fabrice, for that excellent talk. Let's thank Fabrice. And so now, if anyone has
