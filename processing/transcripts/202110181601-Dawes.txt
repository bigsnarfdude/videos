So, in my lab, we're really interested in understanding how cells are able to integrate internal and external information to make the appropriate cell fate decisions during development. And so, we've got a couple of movies here. So, we've got a lot of activity. Basically, cells are very noisy and very busy. Very busy. We've got biochemical interactions that result in spatial patterning and localization. And together with that, we've got these mechanical structures here. We're looking at microtubular ways. And here we've got DIC just looking at all of the components. Oh, sorry.   Our proteins technique with RFP, and we can see that it's very good. And we can see this very nice segregation into these distinct domains within the same cell. And polarization isn't always, we often talk about it in a cortical context. It can also be cytoplasmic. It really is just this idea that we have these distinct domains without any kind of physical separation within the cell. And so why do we care about what's happening in polarized cells? Well, one consequence of polarization is whether or not we have a Is whether or not we have a symmetric or an asymmetric division. So if we have a polarized cell and we align the centrosomes, and the centrosomes are then to determine where the division plane will be positioned, and so if we align the centrosomes along the polarity axis of the cell, the division plane is then going to bisect that, and we end up with an asymmetric division. On the other hand, if the centrosomes are oriented orthogonal to the Polaridia, Orthogonal to the polarity axis. Now the division plane is going to be along the polarity axis and we end up with a symmetric division. And so this is very important during development, whether we have, for instance, sulfate specification, if we want to give rise to two different types of tissues, or for instance have stem cell renewal and then a colony forming unit, we will have something like an asymmetric division, whereas a symmetric division is generally associated with proliferation. So when we want to With proliferation, so when we want to generate many cells of the same type. And so, one very important process component for positioning the centrosome are the microtubular rays. So, we've talked about bipolymers a lot. Again, nothing new to this crowd. But the action of motor proteins on the microtubular rays that are associated with the centrosomes are what act to position the centrosomes appropriately for symmetric or asymmetric division. Or asymmetric division in polarized cells. Another thing that I think is really interesting is that centrosomes generally are positioned prior to entry into M phase. So prior to, for instance, nuclear envelope breakdown, prior to mitotic assembly, the centrosomes are already put where they're supposed to be for the type of division that it's trying to do. And this proper positioning of the centrosomes and therefore proper positioning of the division plane. Proper positioning of the division plane. Again, very important for development and is also a hallmark of metastatic cancer when you have a misalignment of the division plane from where you would expect it to be. All right, so how do centrosomes get moved around? Again, it's by the activity of motor proteins acting on microtubules that are nucleated at the centrosomes. And so in microtubules, just to remind ourselves, are polar filaments. And so the microtubule The microtubular rays that we're interested in, they're anchored at the minus end in this cloud of material called the pericetriolar material that's associated with the centrosome. And so the minus end is anchored into this cloud of material, and the polymerization dynamics all happen at the plus end. And I think, yes, there we go. So the polymerization happens at the plus end. We also have de polymerization through loss of monomers at the plus end. But another thing Plus end. But another thing that is typical of microtubules that we don't see, for instance, in actin is that we also have catastrophe where we have this very sudden breaking apart of the microtubule array. And then, at least for the process that we are interested in, the motor protein dynein is a very important motor protein. So Stephanie's going to talk more about kinesins in a minute, which is another microtubule-associated motor protein. Motor protein. But in terms of the movement of the centrosomes we're interested in, diamine is really the primary motor protein responsible for that movement. And so we've got diamine, it's anchored at the cortex, and then its heads reach into the cytoplasm to associate with microtubules. And it is a minus N directed motor protein, which means that it tries to walk along the microtubule and exerts force that pulls the microtubule and whatever's attached to the microtubule. Attached to the microtubule towards the periphery of the cell. And so we use nematode worms, C. elegans, as our experimental, our model organism for looking at this process. And there's a lot of reasons why it's a really nice model organism for this. So the first is that in that first cell cycle, after fertilization, you have polarization. So actually the polarization during the first cell cycle is critical for Is critical for survival and viability of the embryo. So we have a polarized cell and we have proper centrosome positioning to give us an asymmetric division for our first division. And in terms of actually seeing what's going on, you can see we've got a DIC image there. The polarized embryo is encased in this transparent, impermeable, and rigid eggshell. And so transparent means we don't have to do anything in order to be able to visualize what's happening. What's happening? So, Ed was showing us some beautiful images of the cortex, what's happening kind of on the surface of the cell, and here we're looking more at midplane. So, what's happening in the middle of the cell, really kind of deep in the interior. But we don't have to do anything special to be able to observe those dynamics. The eggshell is impermeable, which means that it's a little less sensitive to the external environment. I've heard colleagues tell horror stories about things like cell culture, so I think the worm embryos are a little bit easier to deal with. Are a little bit easier to deal with. And then it's ellipsoidal, which means for purposes of analysis, which we won't see so much in this talk today, but because of the polarization coupled with that ellipsoidal geometry, there's a lot of nice symmetries of the system that we can take advantage of to reduce the dimensionalities in our models. Because if we're going to do PDEs, 1DE PDEs are much easier than 2D or 3D PDEs. All right, so what does centerstone positioning look like in the early C. elegansen Rio? So here's a See elegance embryo. So here's a schematic just on the left here. So we've got the male chronucleus, so that's the genetic material that's donated by the sperm. It also donates the centrioles, which mature into centrosomes, and where the microtubules, those blue polymers, are nucleated from. And so it drags the female pronucleus over to the posterior end of the cell. So worm embryos are always oriented so that anterior Are always oriented so that anterior is on the left, posterior is on the right. And so we've got pronuclear meeting, which we abbreviate by PNM. We get this rotation as well as centration process. And then once it's positioned where the centrostones are aligned along the polarity axis of the cell, then we get a nuclear envelope breakdown and progression into MFAs and construction of the mitotic spindle. So we can look at what the centrosomes are doing. So here we've got a strain where So here we've got a strain where tubulin, so that's the microtubule subunit that it gets built out of, is tagged with GFP. So there we can see what those dynamics look like. And when we look at it in terms of the snapshots, we can see that we start out at zero minutes. We've got our two centrosomes are orthogonal to the long axis of the cell, which is also the polarity axis. And then we see that we have this both a centration and a rotation process. And when we overlay all of those And when we overlay all of those time points, we can see this very clear and very smooth movement as well, where we've got one centrosome that ends up pointing towards the anterior half of the cell. We call that one the leader because it travels the furthest. And then we have our lagger, which travels the least and ends up pointed towards the posterior pole. So we were very interested in trying to understand these centration and rotation dynamics. So certainly centration we can understand in terms of the ellipsoid. understand in terms of the ellipsoidal geometry and finding the center of the cell. The rotation means that we actually need to have some form of torque in the system. So to understand particularly how the rotation comes about, so we built a model and this was with my postdoc Valerie Kaufman and in collaboration with Berda Schiller who at the time was at Pomona and has since moved to Pfizer. And so we developed a stochastic model, launched a Langevin framework, and basically, we have our two centrosomes: we've got a red and a blue. The microtubules follow their stochastic dynamics of polymerization, deplymerization, and catastrophe. They grow out towards the periphery of the cell where they make contact with the motoprotein dynein. And so we know that dynein on the cortex is limiting. That's what those little segments are for. So each segment has a single dynein that a microtubule can interact with. That a microtubule can interact with. Any other microtubules that make contact with the cortex in that particular portion just results in a very small push force due to a Brownian ratchet type mechanism. And so then we've got all of these microtubules potentially contacting force generators or acting as a Brownian ratchet at the cortex. And so again, using our Launch Man framework, we then sum up all of the forces from the individual microtubules, and then we have movement of. And then we have movement of the center sounds, which we have connected by this rigid rod. All right, any questions about the setup of the model? Okay. So I'm going to jump ahead to the punchline of that so I can get to the really new work. So what we found was that we actually needed both cortical and centrosomal asymmetries in order to recapitulate the dynamics that we see in vivo. There were a couple of other models that had been proposed, but they... But they either relied on unrealistic assumptions about the geometry of the microtubular rays or had other issues with them. I'm very happy to talk them over. But what we found was that we needed both this region where we had inhibited dyneine activity that's due to a protein called Latin, and what we also found was that we needed to have a structural asymmetry between the microtubule arrays. And here we can see the experimental data, we're just tracking the leader and length. Data, we're just tracking the leader and lager trajectories, and then the simulation data on the bottom. And so you can see that we get a fairly good agreement. We also used other metrics to quantify that agreement. Now, one thing that we were concerned about, because I think we were able to capture some of the key ingredients for this centration rotation in wild type embryos. But what we noticed while we were looking at different perturbations using Perturbations using RNA interference, that there were some proteins, so this is legal, that when we knock it down through RNA interference, that we get this very oscillatory type movement. So here we've got wild type on the top, and then LET 99 on the bottom. And when we look at the angle, so if we think about the line connecting the two centrosomes and we track the angle over time, we can see the wild type in black is relatively smooth, and that's what we would Smooth, and that's what we would expect given what we see in the movies. But LET 99, which is shown in blue here, gives this its very strongly oscillatory movement during the centration and rotation process. And this was actually something we were not able to reproduce with the model. So it suggests that there's something missing. And so we wanted to try to drill down a little bit further to understand how this force defect arises that generates the water. Rises that generates the wobble. Now, since diamine is the motor protein that's responsible for generating this pulling force that moves the sazarsomas around, we decided to look at what was happening with dyne. So is the wobble coincident with, for instance, a change in dining localization? So is dynamine simply not getting where it needs to be, and therefore we're seeing a forced defect? Or is there a problem with dining activity? So it's not able to pull the way it's supposed to. Supposed to. And so, this is work by my PhD student, David Ignacio, who is defending this semester. But the first thing that we wanted to do was to actually quantify this oscillatory phenotype. It certainly looked like there was a very regular kind of oscillation to the movement that we saw. So, two math students, John Henry and Roberto Jimandez of Palomares, worked with me to develop a metric that would quantify the amount of wall. The amount of wobble that we see in these strains. So we've got three things to look at here. We've got our wild type, which is up at the top. We've got our LET99 RNAi and a GGB1 RNAi. That's the beta subunit of G proteins. So the method, the metric that we came up with, so what we do is first we look at the change in angle, so we look at delta theta over time, and these are all plotted on the same y-axis. Plotted on the same y-axis, although it's looking a little bit bleary. But we can see that indeed for the wild type, we have some oscillations, but they're relatively low amplitude, especially compared to our delta theta plots for Light 99 and GGP1. So we have our delta theta over time. We take the fast Fourier transform of that data, and so now we're in the frequency domain, and so we can already see that we've got, again, See that we've got again the same y-axis for all three plots, and so we can see that indeed we've got a spike corresponding to a dominant frequency in our LET99 and GPP1 RNA embryos. And then we take the L2 norm of the fast-fouriing transform, and that's what we call our wobble metric. So it's a way to quantify basically how spiky our FFT is. And so we see that in wild type, we get a wobble metric of about Type: We get a wobble metric of about four, and our LET99 and GGB1 are much higher. And this wobble metric is very consistent across the let99 and GGB1. So here again, we're looking at our delta theta plots over time, and then you can see that we've got our wild type has a relatively low wobble metric in our box and whisker plot, and that our LET99 and GTB1 are both relatively consistent within themselves. Consistent within themselves as well as significantly different from wallotyping with the wobble metric. One thing that I don't show here, though, it does look a little bit messy when we look at our delta theta plots, but again, that spike that we see in the frequency domain with the FFT is very consistent, and so suggesting that there's a similar oscillatory dominant oscillation frequency that's associated with this oscillatory movement defect. So one So, one road that we've started to go down, so Chenchi was an undergraduate, and so she took the software that was developed by John and Roberto and was able to go through hundreds of RNAi experiments that are available on a database called Finibank. And so what we found was the vast majority of RNAi, so RNAI depletes proteins, and so most of them we ended up with three different categories. We ended up with three different categories of wobblers. So, most of them fell into this wild type where we had a relatively low wobble metric. We had three that came out into this very strong wobbler, so Flet99 and GPB1, which we've already seen. We also uncovered through this GPC2, which is the gamma subunit of the G protein. So, GPB1 and GPC2, both G protein subunits, which I thought. G-protein subunits, which I thought was very interesting, as well as LET99, which is a C. elegans-specific protein with not really much connection to any proteins outside of pneumatode worms. But we also found that there was this kind of middle class of wobblers that were not quite wild type, but not quite these strong wobblers. And so these proteins tended to be associated with signaling and regulation. And all of our And all of our strong wobblers tended to be proteins that are associated with the cortex. So we haven't been able to really get into this much further, so again, very preliminary data here, but now we have some interesting candidates that we can follow up on to try to understand the regulatory pathway that may be involved in generating this movement defect. Okay, so we went to look at, we wanted to look at the cortical localization. Wanted to look at the cortical localization of dynein. And so, what we found was that it's actually the localization of dyne is not affected in response to depletion of LET99 or GDB1 at different points in the cell cycle. So, the way we've quantified this, so here we've got our wild type are along here, and so we've got our different time points. We've got the pronuclear meeting where the two pronuclei come together, and our centrosomes are orthogonal. And our centrosomes are orthogonal to the long axis. We've got centration and rotation, so while it's actively doing that centration rotation process, and then nuclear envelope breakdown, and then we also included cleavage furrow just to see if maybe there was a change a little bit later after the wobble phenotype. And so we take a strip along the cortex from the anterior to posterior and we look at the fluorescence associated with diamine. So this is a strain that has the diamine heavy. That has the diamene heavy chain tagged with GIP. And so here we've got the different time points. So we're going from anterior to posterior along that yellow line that we show up there. And then the different colors correspond to the different time points. And we can see that in wild type as well as the LET 99 and GPB1, that there's really no change in dyne localization. And we can summarize this in chymographs as well, where we look at that dyne intensity. Look at that dyne intensity, and here we've just turned those time plots on their side. So time is going down. So, just to remind ourselves that we're seeing that oscillatory dynamics when we deplete LET99 and GTP1, but really no concurrent mislocalization of diamine, suggesting that diamine is getting where it's supposed to be, but clearly, again, there is a force defect here. And so that's suggestive that it's diamine activity that's actually being modified. Modified. So it's a little bit of a nil result because we were kind of hoping that diamond would be not getting recruited appropriately to the cortex. So we still have a bit of work to do here. So just to summarize, so we've got a stochastic model that reproduces the wild-type movement, although it's unable to produce the wobble, and we're not sure why. I've got an undergraduate doing a parameter search right now to see what he can find. And so, in terms of the wobble fetus, And so, in terms of the wobble phenotype, with that movement defect, we see that there's no change in dynein localization when we see this wobble phenotype. And so, that suggests that there's possibly a change in dynein activity, or maybe there's something structurally different about the microtubule arrays. And so, we're following up on both of those possibilities. We are, there's a lot of different avenues that we're taking related to both the model that I introduced. Related to both the model that I introduced at the beginning, the stochastic model. And so, for instance, looking at the biochemical dynamics, we assume that the polarity domains are static, that there's no feedback between the dynamics of the microtubules and the polarity domains. That's something that we would like to expand out to look at both the cortical and cytoplasmic dynamics of these potential signaling networks that are regulating the pulling forces that position center somes. Centrosomes and also using mean field energy models to try to understand the mechanical equilibria that result from these pulling forces on the centrosomes. So, thank you to everybody who has worked on the project, especially David, who went down this interesting path of looking at dynamite, even though it turned out to be something a little different from what we were expecting. Thank you to my funding sources. And so, I do have some postdoc positions that are coming available. So, anybody who wants That are coming available. So, anybody who wants to work on these kinds of problems, please get in touch. We have a new HR system, so the job posting is not up yet, even though it should be. So, please just contact me directly, and please let anybody know who's looking for a post-op that might want to work on these kinds of questions. So, thank you. All right, we'll start with any questions from the room. I have a question about the small button now. The lobble null that you define, right? The the lobble null? Oh, yeah, the lobble metric, yeah. Is that something different from the cover spectrum of your signal? No, not really. So what it is different from is signal variance. So that's so we wanted something that wasn't looking at deviation about the mean, but was rather looking at absolute deviation. So yeah, it's not like it's a new thing, we're just using it in this context to quantum. Uh to to to quantify the uh the the wobbliness, if you will. Jay's got a question. Oh, Jay. I'm in your blind spot. Um maybe you said, and I missed it. Um, do you know what the like the distribution of waiting times between the switches of the wobble? I'm just wondering if they're exponentials, which is making what we would assume. Just a hush. No, that's a good question. The thing that struck us, though, was that Le9E9 has no connection to the G protein signaling pathway. And yet, Signaling pathway, and yet they give rise to the dominant frequency associated with the wobble is the same. So that's why we're interested in trying to understand G-protein, of course, is a canonical signaling pathway. And so whether LET99 is maybe downstream or maybe in a parallel pathway, that they're converging on some bottleneck. So that's why we're interested in trying to understand what that signaling mechanism is to try to understand why we're getting the same dominant frequency. We're getting the same domain of frequency under these two conditions. Yes. Are there any biological implications of the bubble? So that is a great question. So lead 99 is lethal. That's actually what the LET stands for. Now it's lethal a little bit later on in development, so it doesn't hatch, but it does get a little bit further down in development to be more multicellular. And so we don't actually know really what goes. And so we don't actually know really what goes wrong. We just know that it basically just kind of peters out and dies at some point. GTB1 and GPC2 are also lethal when they're missing. Now, what we did though, because we wanted to visualize LET99 and so the stream that was available, that aligned lab had LET99 tag YOLO threads and thrust. And it doesn't have a very strong signal. It approaches very rapidly. And so we created a CRISPR strain. We created a CRISPR strain where Let 99 tactics like GFP and wobbles. But it's not lethal. But it's one of the intermediate wobblers. So it's not a full blob, like what we see in the 99 RMI. It's one of the regulatory wobblers. But what means you just accidentally were able to, with 99, to separate a function. To separate the functions associated with wobble and the functions associated with viability. Different viability assays, and the words were defined. It just has this wobble when it's tagged with its GFP. So that's another avenue that we're trying to figure out, because I think it does start to get to that. What is the function? And we're trying to understand how the GFP is plugging into the three-dimensional structure. Into the three-dimensional structure of this protein to try to understand maybe a little bit more about what builds and space behind what we're uncovering to get to a little bit more of that functions question. Thank you. David? I was just wondering, is there something, some common phenotype then, of the intermediate wildlife that you can start to see a pattern that would indicate the biological function associated with it at least? We haven't been able to follow that, but that's definitely a question that we want to explore. That we want to explore, hopefully. But I think that there is something interesting in there because not all of the GWA wobblers are lethal. So I think that there is that we can get this kind of gradual phenotype with the wobble that doesn't affect viability, but still affects function. But again, a lot of the proteins that fan found in the intermediate wobblers are CLN specific, so we really don't have a sense of what their function is. Don't have some functions. So it really kind of comes back to this question of function. And whether or not they're operating the same or parallel sleeping out pathways, or they just have pathways that they have the same frequency. I can just follow up real quick. And the mega two assessments contact the cortex. What are the rules that you impose in the model at that point? So we used as many writers out of literature as we could. As we could. And so, for that one, if we contact the core cortex, there's some probability attachments that are associated with CAR proteins. There was some beautiful work by our stretcher, actually, at the University of Alberta, where he was tracking microtubular fragments, and he showed that the C was the same. So the dietine activity was not different in the anterior versus posterior names, but the probability of attachment that I'm real totally high-end those stretch showed with laser inflation experiments that there was, of course, the Experiments that there was a force differential. So we accommodated for that by having an asymmetric probability of a functional attachment of a dynae. And there is a certain lifetime of attachment during which it observes that force towards the cortex. With some Poisson distribution, like a lifetime that is associated with that. That one goes from intrinitarial experiments, but it's something it's a value. It's a thousand less common use in models. So that was one that we were comfortable using in terms of the lifetime attachment lifetime. All right. All right. Let's go ahead and take a couple of questions from the virtual audience. Orion, how about you take a crack? Yeah, nice comment. Ryan, comment and a quick question. So the comment is if you wanted to see whether this to pulling force for dippers versus, say, the inertia, the centrosome description outward. The centrosome sort of network themselves. Am I repurpose Tony Hyman's blowing up the centrosome and watching the speed of which the pieces take to the cortex to maybe back out the forces from the inertia? And then the question was to, so striking, you actually picked up the beta and the gamma, but not, I would have thought that G-alphas and disputable and NUMA would be the likely ones. Do you think these are just regulators of the alpha arm or that the beta gamma arm is doing something distinct? You know, you know, and that's a great question because I'm the data. And that's a great question because I may data go back a few times and double check that on the outside David Bobby type and it doesn't. So that was a big surprise to us, too. So again, suggested there's maybe some, you know, the beginning of the detached when the G, the territory is activated. And so we're thinking, again, that there's maybe something to do with that kind of. Maybe something to do with that 99 being all the time master signal pathway, but we just don't know. And there's LED99 has some depthomams, but otherwise we really don't know anything about protein and that deptoser are fairly controversial in terms of what they actually do. So there's basically something just we just don't know. I think that there is kind of a master signal in halfway that is converging on a dynamic regulating process. Converging on a diamine, that's regulating mass process. And that's why we're seeing the same dominant frequency, but low TNT and beta m strong losses. But we really, because it's becoming increasingly clear in the migration field, that alpha and beta gamma carry step of signals. And so if you had an insight of that, maybe the alpha is doing the dynamic localization and beta gamma is doing activities, that would be really amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But they do appear to have distinct functions, at least when it relates to the local phenotype. Yeah, hi. I was wondering: are you thinking about other force generators as well? This wobbling makes me think like there could be opposing forces at play. Things like microtubule pulmonization as pushing forces, for instance, where some kinescents might be involved. And that's what it seems so I've got an undergrad, but trying to progress that we did was the original. Was the original acid model? We did two priorities our searches to look at the timing of citration and rotation. So we had already done this fairly large parameter tea. So what we did was we went back to that data and looked to see if any of them also gave us a wobble. Because we weren't interested in the wobble during the original development. So we would have just, we would have ignored that data, but we kept it all. But in the parameter sweeps that we did, we actually were not able. That we did, we actually were not able to generate the wobble phenotype. So now we're just going really crazy and seeing how far do we have to push the model to be able to get wobble. Like, what if we have two microtubules at each edge right? I mean, clearly that's not what's actually happening in vivo, but how far do we have to push the system in order to get the wobble out? And then we're hoping, I'm hoping that we're going to find some conditions under which we can't wobble and then use that to direct further experiments to try to dissect out. Experiments to try to dissect out precisely those kinds of questions. So, using the model to direct the experiments. Yeah, thank you. Kid? Hey, great talk, Adriana. I'm just, I'm reminded of also of the oscillations, the spindle pole oscillations that occur in anaphase normally. So I'm wondering if you took a look at all to see how are those, first of all, is the frequency of the oscillator, of the wobbly year. Frequency of the wobble you're seeing related at all to the frequency of those spindle pole oscillations? And is would it be worth thinking about parallels between those two different things? And do the mutants you're looking at or the perturbations you're looking at affect the spindle pole oscillations? So that's actually the really intriguing thing. So in the wobble, in the wobblers, we actually get attenuated oscillations with the spindle. So we actually see less oscillations during the chromosome separation. During the chromosome separation, where we would expect to see the oscillations there. That's a good point about the frequency. I have not applied the wobble metric to those oscillatory movements, but that would actually be a really good thing to do too. It's you could get the same dawn frequency out. But yeah, that was the big surprise to us is that it's basically reversed. So now we've got the wobble in the central tone positioning, but very little wobble during During antiquates, and vice versa in a wild type. Yeah, so something's going on. Other questions from either the virtual attendees or the in-person? All right. Well, thanks, Dr. Annie.
