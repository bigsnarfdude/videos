Okay, welcome everybody back. Now it's my very great pleasure to welcome Florin Schaffhauser from the University of Heidelberg, who's giving his first lecture of his course. And it's titled Twisted Local Systems and Higgs Bundles for Non-Constant Groups. Laurent, you want to start? Yes, thank you very much. So before I start, I would like to To thank the organizers for inviting me, for giving me the opportunity to lecture here. Of course, I would have loved to be there with you, but maybe some other time. So the topic for my mini course this week revolves around so-called twisted local systems and their Higgs bundles counterparts. So the equivalence between local systems. The equivalence between local systems on the one hand and Higgs bundles on the other hand is something quite well known as since the 80s. It's known as non-abelian Hodge theory or Hodge correspondence. And basically this week is an introduction to some kind of twisted version of this, which is something that I will try to define for you during the week. Defined for you during the week. So today I will focus on the local system parts of the course. I will not mention Higgs bundles until Thursday, in fact, until my third lecture. And tomorrow we'll focus more on the moduli space, again on the character variety side or the so-called Betty side of the correspondence. Okay, so. Okay, so yes, before I start, I just want to say that feel free to interrupt me with questions at any time, either via the mic or via the chat. I'm happy to try and answer anytime. So the basic things I want to talk about today are twisted local systems. And first, I will start with the local systems in the classic. Local systems in the classical case, so with constant coefficients. And really, for me, the motivation, and I think it's also really the historic motivation to study local systems comes from differential equations, right? Ordinary differential equations, where if you look at an open set of the complex plane and you look at a differential equation of order r, say, given with Say, given with holomorphic coefficients. Well, okay, it has to be linear. Or more generally, you could look at a system like this. But in any case, the main theorem in this setting that we learn in our undergraduate curriculum is that basically the local behavior of the solution is entirely governed by an element. An element in a vector space, right? And it's basically the value of the function at the point and the successive derivatives of the function depending on the order of the equation. And this defines a local system of vector spaces of rank R, where R is here the order of the differential equation. Okay, so this is really the basic object to keep in mind, even if it's usually more convenient to It's usually more convenient to have an order one equation like this. So it means introducing matrix coefficients, but that's okay. All right, so how do we think of this a little bit more geometrically? Well, okay, as we're saying, so the general form in which we write this is as an order one equation involving. An order one equation involving a matrix with holomorphic entries. Okay, and then if you look at the sheaf of local solutions of this equation, then okay, basically, if you want to think about it geometrically, you can do that at any time for any sheaf. You just take the associated Italian space, and the sheaf you started with is the sheaf of continuous section of that Italian space. Okay, so the Okay, so the fiber of the italic space is really the stock of the original sheaf. So it's the space of germs, say in this case, of solutions of the equation. Okay, and then the fact is that this, it's easy to set up a bijection between this set of germs of solutions. Germs of solutions and this trivial or this product space over the open set U where the equation is defined. Okay, and it's basically a rewriting of the previous theorem where I was saying that the germ of the solution is determined by the value of the function at the point. Okay. And so it means that, okay, so this is just a bijection, but if you put Okay, so this is just a bijection, but if you put actually the discrete topology on CR here, it will become a homeomorphism. So what it means is that this sheaf is isomorphic to the sheaf of locally constant sections of this vector bundle, if you want. Okay, so now we can do things a little bit more abstractly, meaning for a more general or an abstract topology. General or an abstract topological group G, and we will look at G local system. Okay, so this is again a locally constant sheaf, but this time it's not necessarily sheaf of vector spaces. It's a sheaf of g torsors on X. So, okay, what is a G torsor? So, as I was saying here, it's a principal homogeneous G space. So, it means P space P with a G action. Okay, so maybe it's a right G action, so I'll write it like this. And it's such that this canonical map associated to any action Is a bijection or an isomorphism. Okay, so this is a definition or an abstract definition of what a torsor is. Basically, it means the space on which a group acts freely and transitively. Okay, so here's an attempt at a local picture of this. Of this, a g-local system means that we want to think of some space u cross g over u. Okay, and a g-local system will be a sheaf which is locally, I don't know, to the sheaf of locally constant section of this. Okay. Okay, so you may want to ask, you may ask, what is the relation with the previous example with the local system of vector spaces? Local system of vector spaces. And in fact, it's the same relation as you have between a vector bundle and the associated principal bundle if you take the frames. So if you take basis of solutions to the linear ODE that you were looking at, then you will replace U cross CR by U cross GLRC, where this invertible matrix is a matrix whose, so maybe. Whose so maybe here you have some solution y of z and here you will have an invertible matrix whose columns represent a basis of solution okay so this will be a GL yeah Uh, yeah, a GLRC local system, okay. A sheaf of locally constant sections of this. Okay, another way to construct G local systems for an abstract group G is just to take a representation of the fundamental group. And then the classical construction is to look at this G bundle over X. So, okay, so basically. Basically, you look at the product bundle over X Twiddle, the universal cover of X, and then you have pi1x will act on the universal bundle, the universal covering, sorry, because, well, it's just by definition, it's just the automorphism group of that universal covering. Okay, so it will act on the first factor, and then it will act on the second factor, the element in G, via this representation. Representation. So an element gamma here goes to some row of gamma in G, and then I just multiply to the left by this. So this is indeed an automorphism of principal bundle of X Twiddle, and it's compatible, well, by definition, I mean, you can just take the quotient by this pi one action, and then it defines a bundle on x. on on x which because x is the uh the quotient of uh of x field by pi 1 x okay so you just get this and the the what's left to see is that the transition functions for this g bundle are actually locally constant so it defines a flat principal g bundle on on x okay and then if you have such an object the notion of locally constant section Notion of locally constant section, I mean, the sheaf of locally constant section of that bundle is well defined, okay? Because it doesn't depend on the choice of trivialization. If you take an overlap, well, another transition local trivialization where they overlap, the transition functions are locally constant, so they will have the same locally constant sections. Okay, of course, when I do things like this, I usually make topological Usually, I make topological assumptions on X, but that's okay. You can always think that X is a complex analytic manifold if you want, which is basically what we will be looking at. Sorry, I'm just seeing that there is a question in the chat. I missed that. I'm sorry. So, I think it was about, yes, it's P cross G to P. Thank you very much. Yes, indeed. Yes. So, there is a G action on P. So that is that is a g action on p and then you have this map which is well defined. In fact, it was in p cross p. So that was correct here. And then this map is an isomorphism. Okay, thank you very much. I'll try to monitor this better from now on. Okay. Are there any questions? Okay, then um Okay then. So I will just say we're now on the classification of these local systems in the usual case. So basically these will be, I mean the local systems or the G local systems will be classified by representations of the pi one of the fundamental group into G. Okay, so we've already seen how a representation into G gives me a local. representation into g gives me a local system and I want to explain the converse direction. So okay, maybe I should say that if I want to talk about some classification result, I should say up to what? So it's up to isomorphism of G local system, which is just morphism of sheaves between the two local systems. And okay, yeah, there's a couple of observations. Okay, yeah, there's a couple of observations that one can make, which are really not difficult to check. So I said that a G local system was a sheaf of G torsors. And in fact, the stock for every X, the stock at X will be a G torsor. Okay, if you have a G local system. So that's something you can check easily. And also in the construction that I mentioned earlier, where from a representation into G, we could. From a representation into G, we construct a G local system on X. It's also easy to check that if we start with conjugate representations, so maybe I should say what that means, it means we have a G in G such that for all gamma, rho two of gamma is G rho of gamma G inverse. Okay, then in that case, the associated G local systems are isomorphic, okay. Are isomorphic. Okay. Okay. So the goal is to show that using this construction of a local system associated to a representation, we get all the local systems. So I think the easiest way to see it is through the general equivalence of categories, which are already mentioned, actually, between sheaves on a topological space and the Italic spaces over that. Italic spaces over that space. So it just means that if you have a sheaf, you take the italic space. So this will actually be, this will come with the natural projection to X, which is a local homeomorphism. So that's what it means to be an Italian space. And then the converse functor takes such an Italian space and looks at the sheaf of continuous sections. Okay, so in particular, if you Continuous sections. Okay, so in particular, if you have a local omeomorphism like this, the fibers will be discrete. However, just because the fibers are discrete does not mean that this space is locally trivial. So it's not necessarily a covering space, okay, of X. And when it is, actually, it corresponds exactly to a special kind of shape. Exactly to a special kind of sheaf, namely the locally constant sheaves. Okay, so we have this following equivalence between these full subcategories. Okay, so we are interested in the locally constant sheaves. We've seen this motivation coming from the study of linear ordinary differential equations. And these geometrically correspond to topological covering spaces of X. Of X, right? So, what is the point of this remark? It's just that when we do have topological covering spaces, okay, assuming some mild topological properties of X, which again are always satisfied in the case we're looking at, for instance, a complex analytic manifold. Complex analytic manifold. We have very important properties of topological covering spaces: is that we can lift paths uniquely and we can lift homotopies between them. And moreover, the lifting depends only on the initial point in the fiber. So it means that, okay, so pictorially, what happens is that if you have, for instance, a loop in the base space of the covering, The base space of the covering, you and you choose a point in the fiber, maybe this one or this one, or that one, it doesn't matter. You will lift the map and at the end of you will lift the path of this loop. It will become a path in the total space. And that's at the end of this path, you will arrive to the same fiber. Okay. And so this defines an action of the group of. An action of the group of loops, namely the pi one, on the fiber over x0. And this is what we can call parallel transport in this context. So it is because locally constant sheaves correspond to topological covering spaces that we can associate to any locally constant sheaf such a map, just by doing the usual lifting of path. Lifting of path. All right. So, what it means is that a G-local system has a well-defined so-called monodromy representation, which is a group morphism from the pi one of the base to the automorphisms of the fiber above point, say, the base point of the fundamental group. Okay. And if actually you choose a point in this. And if actually you choose a point in this torsor, then it will be identified. I mean the torso itself will be identified with G, and also the automorphism of G torsors will be identified with G. Okay. And of course, as an example, we have the fact that, well, if we take the local system associated to representation, then in fact, the monodromy representation defined in this way. Representation defined in this way is conjugate to the initial row. Okay. All right. So then the theorem that you all know and expect at this point is that we get all local systems in this, I mean, in this way. So basically, if we take a G-local system with monondromy mu, then if Then, if we treat this as an abstract representation and we construct a local system from it, we get back the original V. Okay, so it means that monondromy is the way to pass from, well, actually from flat principle G bundles to G local systems. Okay. All right, so that is the usual classification theorem. Classification theorem for G-local systems. Okay. Are there any questions? Maybe I should write somewhere that is the Is the set of isomorphism classes of G-local systems? Okay. So now I would like to define this for in the non-constant setting. Okay, so it's the notion of two. The notion of twisted local system that is one of the main points in this series of lectures. Okay, so again, I want to think of things a little bit more geometrically. So this is the space of representation that I was telling you about. Okay, and as we know, And as we know, the theorem that we have just proved is that the set of flat principle G bundles on X, which means looking at the sheaf of locally constant G value functions on X and taking the H1, it's just in bijection with this set. But this set is also the H1 in the sense of group cohomology. Okay, so if you look Okay, so if you look at the H1 of the group pi1x with coefficients in G, by definition, the co-cycles are just the morphisms, and the equivalence of co-cycles is given by this conjugacy relation. Okay? All right. So the point of this remark is that. The point of this remark is that this set, this group cohomology set, can be defined in much more general context. It can be defined, in fact, for any action of the group pi on the group of coefficients. Okay, so let me just explain this more in detail. Well, what I mean is if you take a group pi and you take And you take the group morphism, a group morphism from pi to the automorphism group of G. So let me just denote each the image of gamma by phi gamma. It's an automorphism of G. Okay. And then what are the co-cycles for this for this action? By definitions, these are the space of, well, okay, normalized cross-morphisms. Normalized cross-morphism. So normalized because they are supposed to send the neutral element in pi to the neutral element in G, but this is no longer a group morphism in general. So it's not like here. In fact, it's only a cross morphism. It means that it sends the product gamma 1, gamma 2 to this product in G. So it's rho, gamma 1, as you would expect, but then here it's not just rho of gamma 2, it's gamma 1 acting on that. Okay, so you see when... So you see, when this is trivial, you get back just the usual group morphism property. But in full generality, you have this. Okay, and this is also called a twisted representation. Okay, so now in this context, what is the equivalence of co-cycles? Well, in this context, two such co-cycles are called equivalent. Cosai and cosa are called equivalent if they're they are well conjugate but in a twisted sense. So basically, uh, means that there exists an element in G such that rho prime is not exactly conjugate to rho, but twisted by this phi. So, again, what you should convince yourself of is that if phi is trivial, this is just the usual conjugacy. And otherwise, what I'm really saying here is that if you What I'm really saying here is that if you have any cosycle rho and any element g, this is still a twisted representation. Okay, so it's still a cosycle. So you have an action of g on the cocycles, and by definition, the quotient is just the h1. Okay, so this is a very elementary definition, but it's a bit cryptic, right? It's not exactly clear. It's not exactly clear. I mean, okay, in the group homology context, there are more ways to justify this definition, but it's not exactly clear what is the geometric content of this, if any, right? So these are exactly the objects that we are looking to define, which are the local system with non-constant coefficients. Okay. Okay, so are there any questions? All right. Then I will move on to the basic constructions. So again, there is this fixed group morphism or this fixed action of pi 1x on the topological group G. And I, okay, maybe not right away, but very soon I will look at twisting representations. I will look at twisted representations of pi1x in j. So it means co-cycles with respect to this action. Okay, so the first thing I want to construct is this G sub phi, where I take again the product bundle x twiddle cross g on the universal covering space, and I model it by the action of pi 1 x given in this way. Given in this way. Okay. So you see here, okay, X Twiddle cross G is, of course, a group bundle over X Twiddle. Okay, it means that, so here you have evidently a group structure on the fiber, on the fibers of this. And it's just because G itself is a group. But the action of pi one here preserves the, I mean, it's an action by automorphisms. I mean, it's an action by automorphisms. So it preserves the group structure. And it means that if, when I take the quotient, I still have a group bundle over x, over the quotient of x twiddle by pi 1 x. So what is exactly a group bundle? Well, it means that there is a map from G phi to g phi, which I can call a map. Okay, which I can call a multiplication map. And there is also, in fact, a section. And these two together satisfy the usual axioms for the structure of group. Structure of group. Okay, so here I should be more careful. Actually, I'm taking a fiber product. So I'm just taking a fiber product over X. And there is this multiplication. So where does it come from? Of course, in this case, it's just induced by the group structure on G. And the point is that because acts by automorphism, the group structure here or on the fibers of this bundle. The fibers of this bundle will descend to the quotient and induce a group structure on the fiber of Gphi in this sense. All right. And of course, the section here, which plays the role of the neutral element in each fiber, comes from the neutral element in here. Okay, so this is exactly like Exactly like a group over X. It's usually considered in the context of the scheme theory, where it's called a group scheme. But of course, you can look at group bundles over a space in any category. So here I'm just doing it in the category of topological spaces. All right. And this is the basic construction. Basic construction. So now, if I have such a group bundle fixed once and for all, and I take a twisted representation rho from pi 1x to g, I can construct the following object, which is, or which will end up being my twisted local system. So it's kind of the same representation, sorry, construction as before, as when. A construction as before, as when we're constructing a local system from a representation. So, here we have a twisted representation and we'll construct a twisted local system. And so here, the big difference between the two spaces here is here I think of this as a group. Okay, it's a group bundle of X will. And here is just a space. So the group structure on G plays no role. I'm seeing this G as a group, but this G. G as a group, but this g as a g torso, okay, for the group g. So that's why I use a different notation here, and then I'm just defining the pi 1x action on this space in the following way. So you see, I'm not just taking the image of gamma by rho, I'm twisting it by this phi gamma. And again, when phi is trivial, you just get back the usual construction from before. Action from before. Okay, so in fact, it is an action because rho is a twisted representation. Okay, so if you want to check how the action of gamma 1, gamma 2 works, you will see that it's the same as having first gamma 2 act and Having first gamma two act and then having gamma one act. And that is exactly because of this property of rho here, okay? Which you need to take into account the twist here. All right, so then you see this is still a locally trivial G bundle on X, right? And And now, what I'm saying is that it has a locally constant transition function. And so, again, I can look at the sheaf of locally constant sections. This is well defined. And this is my twisted local system. Okay, maybe more geometrically, what I want to say is that. To say is that sorry, so this is this group bundle. So let me introduce this notation for this product when I see it as a group over X twiddle. It acts fiber wise on this space. The action is just write translation. And the point is that the pi 1 action that we defined earlier is compatible with this action. So what does that mean? So, what does that mean? It means that this diagram here commutes. So, if I first look at the GX twiddle action like this, so by, yeah, it's basically what defines the principal bundle structure on this. I mean, sorry, on this, but for this group. And then I look at the action of gamma. It's the same as if I first look at the action of gamma and And uh yeah, and then oops, what did I do here? Um, oh, yeah, okay, I have I have this one act, okay? So basically, the compatibility relation is, let me forget about the C because they make everything a bit more obscure. So if I look at C, gamma, sorry, acting on H acted upon by G, it's the same as gamma. It's the same as gamma of H acted upon by gamma of G. Okay, maybe this is a bit more. This is a bit clearer. I don't know. Okay, but in any case, this is the compatibility relation that is satisfied. And so it means that the action of this group bundle on the space will descend to an action of this group bundle over X on this. Over x on this space over x. And in fact, this action will make this space a torsor for this group. Okay? But now this group, sorry, it's only locally isomorphic to X cross G, not globally. So that's what it means to be a non-constant group. You're just not a product bundle. You're only locally. Only locally trivial. Okay. And then the action that we defined earlier, the one that comes from the action upstairs. So here, yeah, this action on that space was turning that space into a torsor for this group. And so basically, the induced map, the induced action, will also give you a torso. Also, give you a torso. Okay, that's just what I was saying earlier. But now it's a torso for a non-constant group. Okay, so this is the basic construction that we get to give some geometric content to this space. All right. Okay, so maybe I should give you some examples unless there are any questions. No? All right. Okay. Okay, so of course, it's all meant to generalize the example that we know. So if we just have a trivial action of pi 1 x on g. Action of pi 1x on g, we just get back the usual product bundle here on x, and a tolser for that group is just a principal g bundle. Okay, so there's nothing new here. So really, you see that if you want to construct interesting examples, first you need to have some interesting examples of non-trivial group bundles over some space. Okay, so just as in the usual case, As in the usual case, many interesting examples come from the theory of linear ordinary differential equations. If you just look at an ODE with some property of symmetry, then usually you will find a twisted local system. So let me give you a very elementary example to illustrate what I mean. I will just look at the unit disk. So it's a very local example. And I, as a group action, I will just look at this involution. So sending z to minus z in the unit disk. Okay, so then I claim that if we have, okay, so of course a linear ordinary differential equation will be given by a matrix with holomorphic coefficients. And then I will assume some symmetry with respect to this involution. So basically, I will assume that if I evaluate assume that if I evaluate this function a here in minus z I get just the transpose of the previous one so if I do this okay I will see that this the sheaf of invariant solutions to the to the ordinary differential equation okay because of the symmetry Okay, because of the symmetry on the coefficients, I can there will be a symmetry on the on the set on the sheaf of solutions. Okay, and then you can look at the subsheaf consisting of invariant local sections. All right, and this will be an example of a twisted local torso. So if I want to do that, to convince you of that, I need to construct a group bundle from, well, like which Well, like which is non-constant on the quotient of d by the involution. Okay, so it's fairly easy to guess what the involution should be on GLRC. It's basically the only outer involution that you can get, which is just a transpose inverse. So it is indeed a group homomorphism, and it defines a non-constant group bundle on the quotient. Okay, so you may say that I'm. Okay, so you may say that I'm cheating a little bit because the action of this involution here is not free. There is indeed a fixed point here. So it's not. If I just look at the quotient in the ordinary sense, okay, I will get a Riemann surface downstairs, but the covering will be a ramified covering. So that's not good. That's not what we want. So if we want to avoid that problem, we can just look at the quotient. We can just look at the quotient in the stacky sense, okay? So we look at this or the orbifold sense, if you prefer. We look at this orbifold and then the projection map, the canonical projection map is in fact a cover. And then what we have defined is a group bundle on this orbifold. Okay. And it's a non-constant group bundle on this orbifold. On this overflow. Okay, so then we do the same trick as before, and we don't just look at sigma-invariant solutions. Okay, so first of all, maybe I should say why there is an action on the solution. So actually, it's not easy to see if you don't pass to the basis of solutions first. So you look at the equation, okay, it's an equation on D. You take, as before, a basis. You take as before a basis of solution, so at every point, this defines a map like this. Okay, and then what I'm claiming is that there is an action on this set of basis of solutions. So basically, I'm saying that if m of z is a basis of solution at z, then this will be a basis of solution at minus z. And then I can just look at the solution satisfying this. Solution satisfying this relation, and it will be, yeah, okay, it's a subsheaf of sigma invariant solutions, okay? And this is how we can define a twisted local system on the quotient, okay? So there is this slight issue that the quotient is only an orbifold if I want this to work with the formalism that I've been developing, but of course, we can just remedy this by looking at By looking at more global examples where we have actually a free action of an involution on a compact Riemann surface. So let's say an involution something like this. So it's a holomorphic involution, okay, on a Riemann surface of genus 3. In this case, the quotient has genus 2. And okay, so let's take a local system of C vector spaces. Local system of C vector spaces on y. Okay, so it comes from some ordinary differential equation on y, if you want. Then we will assume that it's a so-called anti-invariant local system. What it means is that it's a local system of c vector spaces, which is equipped, well, which is isomorphic to its dual pullback, okay, or dualized pullback. Okay, or dualized pullback. Actually, you need a little bit more than this. You just, it's not enough to have just the isomorphism. You need some descent condition to be satisfied, to be really called an anti-invariant local system. And the descent condition is this. It means basically if you apply pullback and dual here and here, okay, so of course on this side, you will get back V, right? So if you Right, so if you compose the two, you will go from V to V, and then the descent condition is just asking that this is the identity, that this be the identity. All right. So this is a very widely studied notion of anti-invariant local system on a Riemann surface with involution. Okay, and what we observe is. Okay, and what we observe is that if okay, if you replace local system of vector spaces by local system of invertible matrices corresponding to bases of solutions of that differential equation, then the sigma invariant bases, I mean, these are the same as the anti-invariant local systems, and they define exactly a twisted local system on X, namely for. Namely, for okay, yeah. For which group, I guess I could say this for the group G maybe I should just denote it G sigma in this case, which is y across GLRC. mod pi one x sorry mod two sigma the automorphism group of the cover and sigma of g is of course transpose of g inverse okay so as i was saying it's just a global version of of this example before but then the virtue of it is that here we have at least a free action so so it's more obvious So, it's more obvious. I mean, we don't have to use all befores to make sense of the construction. So, sometimes people look at anti-invariant local system for a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. So, in fact, it has fixed points. And the quotient is like it's thought of as pi one, but in fact, it's pi one with these orbifold points, right? Befold points, right? And it's really if you see them, if you see the quotient as no before that you get this the same formalism that works, okay? So yeah, basically a twisted local system on the Riemann surface will come from a local system on some cover with the symmetry incorporated. Okay, just look at the local system with. Just look at the local system with the symmetry. I hope I convinced you of that more or less. Are there any questions? Okay, then let me state some classification results. So I gave you examples, but in fact, I gave you almost all. Almost all the examples, in any case, all the ones I know, and more than that, because in fact, if we look at an abstract group covering of X, then I claim that it's necessarily of the following form. So it's a quotient of a product bundle on the universal cover of X where X where gamma or the fiber of this product bundle is a discrete group okay and moreover the action of pi 1 x well of course on on x twiddle it's the usual action but on this fiber it's given by a phi as before as we saw in the example it's necessarily of this form where this phi is a group morphism okay so actually here i i use because it's an abstract result Because it's an abstract result, gamma is just an abstract discrete group. But for us, in the examples, gamma is always a Lie group on which I've put the discrete topology. So this is just to avoid things such that looking at the locally constant sections, I just take the continuous sections and then because the fiber is locally constant, it will be exactly what I want. It will be exactly what I want. Okay, so it's more convenient to think of it this way. Okay, and then what you can expect is that this group cohomology set that was introduced abstractly earlier. So it's a set of twisted representations of maybe I should say. Maybe I should say five twisted representations from pi one x to gamma to the discrete group here mod gamma. It actually parameterizes all torsors under this group. Okay, and again, a G phi torsor is just a covering space equipped with well a right G phi action such that this associated map is. This associated map is an isomorphism. Okay, so this will be the notion of fi-twisted local systems, and they are parametrized by this group cohomology set. Okay, so I think I can give you a good idea of the proof, if that's okay, or if you prefer to ask questions, that's also okay. So just let me know. I would like to know if there's a reason why all your examples are in Riemann surfaces. Can one think about these things in higher dimensions? Sure, sure. Actually, here it's just because, I mean, my motivation comes from Riemann surfaces and the examples are like sort of nicer in this setting and I can do the drawings, but I don't need any. So today I didn't use any type of even analytic structures. So yeah. So, yeah, today it's really purely topological. But as soon as you have a universal covering, then you're good. But yeah, of course, the actual examples I'm interested in are all of this type. Okay. Okay, so maybe. Maybe I can just try to classify, well, first, group coverings for you. So let's take an abstract group covering g of x and let me denote by q. Q the projection from the universal cover. Okay, so the basic observation is that, or the basic thing to do in that setting is just pull back the covering to the universal covering space of X. Okay, so this is actually a pi 1x equation. X equivariant group covering of X Twiddle. But of course, because XTwiddle is simply connected, this cover has to be trivial. It has to be a product. Okay, you just take the fiber at some point. Just take the fiber at some point. It has to be a group because, well, our space here is a group covering. Okay, and it's just a fiber at some point and it's a discrete group. So that part is clear. What is left to do is that we want to know. know what the pi1x action does okay how come it's defined by by a phi like this all right so let's try this um so basically the the pi one action um okay let me see how i write this so what i mean is that there's actually a lift Left of the okay, maybe I think I denoted it gamma. Okay, so the pi1 equivalent structure on this bundle is a lift of the gamma of the pi1x action on the base. Okay, so it means tau gamma. So it means tau gamma one gamma two has to be tau gamma one tau gamma two all right but now we have that this bundle is this so we can just use this isomorphism to define a pi one equivalent structure on this on this product bundle so on x twelve cross gamma This means okay, so okay, this also should be compatible with the group structure, maybe. So if I have something like this, should have this. So now if we carry it. If we carry it over to this product, what we will find is: well, more generally, something like this. Or sorry, full generality, something like this. Sorry, so here is just the gamma action on the base. There's no problem, but here the gamma action a priori. The gamma action a priori can depend on C and G. Okay. But still, it has to satisfy, has to be compatible with the group structures. So C G1G2 has to be equal to this. Okay, then the observation. Then the observation is the following. Okay, so maybe I should say phi, what is phi gamma? It's actually, yeah, how do I write this? Okay, maybe. India. Yeah, phi gamma is a function from x rule cross gamma to gamma. Okay, because it takes some C G to phi gamma of C G. But then you see this one is discrete and this one is connected. Okay, and all of this has to be. Again, all of this has to be continuous. So putting all this together, we get that this is actually independent of gamma of Xi. All right. All right, so now this property that we had earlier, this compatibility with the group structure will imply that phi gamma 1 gamma 2 is phi gamma 1 composed phi gamma 2. So it means that phi goes from pi 1x to One x to the automorphism of gamma. All right, and this is a classification theorem for the group bundles, the group covering, sorry. So it was important here to have to have a covering because, so yeah, group covering of universal cover has to be a product. Okay, right, so the classification for Twisted local system systems works in pretty much the same way. So we have already seen that if you take a twisted representation, you will get a twisted local system. So a torsor for a group of well. Well, okay, maybe I should say here the conclusion is that g, the original g, which you can get back by, so you pull it back to the universal cover and then you mod out by the pi 1x action to get it back. And then we have just seen that this is the same as x2 cross g complex. Across g comes by one x with respect to phi. Okay, okay, so this is this g phi. Okay, so maybe I should say what I want to classify now is G-fit also. So, what we have already seen is that We have a map from, okay, maybe I should start from twisted representations. This will give us a G-Fit also. Okay, so the question is: what about the converse? And then And then basically, it's the same technique. We take V over X per G phi tosser, and then we pull it back to the universal cover. And this will be a tosser under the pullback group. But this we have just seen. actually it's more than this it's a pi1x equivariant g phi torsor and this we have seen that it's just um it's just x p cross g okay or yeah maybe as a group you write it like this okay so it's a torso under this i'm sorry i was using gamma All right, and so this one is just the same as the principal gamma bundle on X-fill. So with gamma discrete, so it's actually a principle gamma covering, I should have said. So it means that This is isomorphic as a space to this again, and what we just have to see now is that the pi1x equivalent structure on this has to be given by a twisted representation. And well, in fact, this is not too difficult because, okay, let me just say a bit more. So the pi 1x action or the pi 1x equivalent structure. Yeah is entirely determined by this the image of this. The image of this. Why is that? It's because here, if we have if we have G, okay, in general, it's a G or an H, sorry. Well, yeah, okay. So the point is that the pi1x equivalent structure is compatible with the action of G on the fibers, okay? In the sense that I mentioned earlier. So if you know the image of this one by the compatibility condition, Of this one by the compatibility condition with the g-action, you get the image of anything else. You just need to define this, and then this is the definition of, yeah, okay. So by definition, it will be C rho of sigma. And then what's left to check, it's maybe a nice exercise. It's maybe a nice exercise is to check that row defined in this way. Okay, so I changed my notation halfway through. Sorry. Row defined in this way is a cross-morphism. Okay, and that's that's the end of the classification theorem. Okay, that's how you get back cross-morphisms from a G-phytos. So you pull everything back to the universal cover, and there you just have to write down what it means to have a pi one equivalent structure on a principal bundle, and you will find the cross-morphism. Again, to check that this only depends on gamma. That this only depends on gamma and not x. It's the same argument as before. It's because gamma is discrete and x2 is connected. Okay, so sorry, I went two minutes out of time. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. Thanks very much, Florence. Thank you for the very nice first lecture. Very nice first lecture. Are there any questions in the audience? Yes, Mark. Can you hear us? Yes, vaguely. You may have to repeat. I'm sorry. I think it's just. I don't know which microphone because there are two here, so I'm not sure you can tell me which one is the right one. Yeah, which one is the right one? No, no, not me. So, a trivial question: Is this formula gamma xi one gamma? Shouldn't it be the action of gamma on xi in the first variable also? Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I was getting confused towards the end. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Any more questions in the audience? In the audience? Anything from the Zoom chat? No? Anybody on Zoom who wants to ask a question? That's not the case, then let's thank Florent again for the very nice lecture, and we will resume in 10 minutes. Thank you.
