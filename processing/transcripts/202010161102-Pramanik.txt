Very nice. So, I think before we really start, I will ask Malabika to say some welcome words for Burst. Thanks, Thomas. Can you all hear me? Yes. Okay, great. Hi, everyone. Thanks for being here. Welcome to the first event of the Career and Innovation Hub series. Innovation Hub series. This program is new, but the idea is an old and classical one. The scientific community in particular and society at large have always benefited from intellectual connections. This could be exposure to new ideas, the understanding of current societal needs, and finding ways. And finding ways to meet those needs. The pandemic throws a new set of challenges, but even in these unprecedented times, we have been fortunate to take an opportunity to access the diverse skills and expertise across the world to make such connections possible. And our aim is to host a series of virtual events that bring Events that bring such connections to fruition. We try to do this by bringing students and researchers in academia in contact with industry experts. The hope is to showcase how mathematics and related STEM disciplines can lead to careers in industry. I would like to thank several organizations. Organizations and the people in the organizing committee who represent those organizations. This program is the combined vision of all of their efforts, time and expertise. The first person who's also going to be chairing the session today is Thomas Hillen. He's representing CAMES, the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society. Of Mathematics Society and professor at the University of Alberta. We also have Manuel Morales, who's representing CRM, Mathematics Research Institute at Quebec, and a professor, an associate professor at the University of Montreal. We have Saman Mutukumarana. He's the director of Nexus Data Science and faculty at University of Manitoba. Of Manitoba. There is on the organizing committee Sanjeev Sira, Director of ARMS, the Atlantic Association of Research in the Mathematical Sciences and professor at the University of New Brunswick. I'm Malabika and I'm the scientific director of Burst International Research Station who's proud to be the host of this event and I'm faculty at the University. And I'm faculty at the University of British Columbia. Our first event in this series is in the area of drug development, a topic that is particularly relevant under the current pandemic situation. I'd like to invite Professor Thomas Hillen from CAMES to introduce our speakers and the program for today. Thomas, over to you. Yeah, thanks a lot, Malapika. Yeah, thanks a lot, Malapika. Yeah, so this is about drug development. I saw in the pre-registration that we have lots of students here, in particular undergrad students, and I think this is great. So it's very important for you early in your career to orient themselves, to find directions and maybe even find new ideas and things you have not thought about maybe before. So the little program for today is quite exciting because we have representatives from pharma and drug development. Pharma and drug development companies, which are all a little bit on a different stage in this playing field. So, the first speaker will be Helen Moore from the company Applied Biomath. And this is a company who basically focuses on the modeling, mathematical and computational modeling, and then services to the pharma industry. And Helen will give us a little bit longer talk where she introduces also the mathematical challenges or the computational challenges. Mathematical challenges or computational challenges that arise. Then the second speaker is Richard Allen from Pfizer. Pfizer is a huge farmer company. I think these are the companies who are always portrayed to be the evil people in these movies and so on. So Richard is not an evil person. I know that. But anyway, so they do everything. They do the modeling. They have labs. They have animal testing. They run clinical trials. They produce medications. That produce medications and they sell medications. Then we have Dean Botino from Takeda. Takeda is also a pharma company, but I think it's not quite as big as Pfizer. But maybe Dean, you can correct me then later. But they do also everything from the modeling, from the lab, to the drug development. And then we have Jake Taylor King from Juveniscence. And this is a startup company. They're relatively young, trying to find their way. Young trying to find their way in this exciting market. And he will then tell us about his activities as well. And then there's a fifth representative not listed here, which is myself. So I'm also co-founder of a drug pharma company. It's called Cyndematic. And this completely failed. So I'm not shy to say that this company failed. This is what happens to many startup companies. And if you have questions about why companies Questions about why companies don't succeed, we can talk about this later as well. So, after these presentations, we have about two hours question and answer. So, I really want to make sure that all your questions are heard and we have time to discuss them and answer your questions. We can do this in the chat right here on Zoom, or there's a Slack channel which we have set up. You can also post your questions right there. Okay, so that's. Okay, so then I think it is time to start. So let me introduce Helen Moore. She's a chief scientist at Applied Biomath.
