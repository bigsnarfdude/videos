Aha, that's good. So, something which I will call Z2 harmonic spinners. And I'll talk about the problem I'm going to discuss. So, for those of you who were taking part in the Monza seminar last spring and summer, so I gave a talk on this topic last. On this topic last year. And so I'm going to not assume that you were all there, so I'll remind you of the facts. And so there is some new material. If you don't, let's say, if you just squint your eyes and don't pay attention, it'll seem exactly like the same talk, but there in fact is there are some new advances here. But unfortunately, this is still sort of a work in progress. I'd hope to have it all done by now, but you know how it is. So the part I'll be talking about later is joint work with Andre. Later, his joint work with Andrei Haidesch and Yasuke Takahashi. And let me see, I fit in there. Well, commutative triple. And so let me begin with the motivation. So what are Z2 harmonic spinners and where do they come up? So I'm going to, so let's just take the gauge theoretic motivation. So in a word, There are a number of problems in gauge theory. So, gauge theory is supposed to be this general term encompassing a lot of PDE techniques for studying gauge fields on manifolds. And the general thing that one wants to do is study the moduli spaces of these solutions and ideally find ways to get numerical invariants out of them, which are then going to be interesting invariants of the underlying manifold, for example. Now, I'm going to start with a very particular Um, um, a very particular and very simple thing, which doesn't need any real gauge theory to describe, but I'll sort of mention other gauge theories which are kind of uh identical, and all of these lead to these objects, which are called Z2 harmonic spinners. So the thing which I'll talk about is the following. So suppose you have a three-manifold, a compact three-manifold, and you have a complex, well, it can be a real complex, but let's say take a complex semi-simple Lie group. And so I can define what I call. And so I can define what I call the character variety of M, chi g of m. And this is the space of representations. Strictly speaking, you have to restrict to what are called the reductive representations from pi one of m into g sub c. And I'll put in this word reductive and you mod out by conjugations. You mod out by g sub c. Okay, so this is an interesting object in geometric topology. An interesting object in geometric topology. So it's, you know, all representations of the fundamental group. So you can think about it various ways, in particular, when G is, let's say, a compact semi-simple group or I'll say a compact semi-simple group. This is sort of a much studied thing that gives interesting invariants. So, for example, the Cast and Walker invariant is a version of this when M is a homology sphere. Another very interesting case. Another very interesting case of this is when G is SL2R, then this is Teichm√ºller space. So, you know, this is studying these character varieties is part of what's called higher teichmotor theory. Okay, so this is called a character variety. So a basic question you can ask is, how non-compact is this object? Well, obviously, if pi one of m is very small, then there's not much to say, and you can sort of extend it explicitly, and this may even be a trivial space. But on the other hand, if m is, for example, a Hand, if M is, for example, a compact hyperbolic manifold, then you're interested in, you know, what do its M's look like? What does it look like near infinity? Now, the point is you can turn this into a statement about connections. So representations. So I should say that we can turn this into the following statement. So suppose I fix a vector bundle. So let's suppose it's a, well, let me specialize to the case where GC is SL2C, just to be very specific. SL2C, just to be very specific all the way through. So E is a rank two vector bundle, complex vector bundle. Okay, and then I can think of a representation as being equivalent to a flat connection, a complex flat connection. So let me write this as NABLA. And when I say it's a complex flat connection, what I really mean is that typically we think of connections as D plus A and A in A and A, in the standard sense, if this were a unitary connection, A would be a skew symmetric matrix or a section of a certain add bundle, but it would be a skew Hermitian. And here I want it to be just a general matrix, so not skew Hermitian. So I'm adding on another part. So I'm going to write this very explicitly as A plus I phi. So in other words, I'm going to write this as D sub A plus I times phi. Okay, so sometimes we refer to connection to just A plus I phi. Just a plus i phi. And so, what's the relationship between a complex flat connection and a representation? Well, simply, if I have my manifold, I take a closed loop and I can take the monodromy or the holonomy of the connection around that loop. That's an element of the Lie group G sub C, and it's well-defined only up to conjugation. If I take a different base point, then it's going to conjugate the whole picture. Okay, so in fact, there's a one-to-one relationship between this conjugacy. This conjugacy classes and these complex flat these equivalences of complex flat connections. Okay, what does it mean for a connection to be flat? So, let me remind you that the standard definition of a connection A, so in local coordinates, you want to think of A as looking like the sum Aj dxj. J goes from one to three. These Aj's are, so the way I've formulated it, each A and phi are each skew Hermitian, so I times phi is Hermitian, and I times phi is Hermitian, and trace zero because I have SL instead of GL. Okay, so the curvature, F sub A, is by definition this object, D sub A plus A sub A. This is for the just the skewer Hermitian part. So for a unitary connection, this is the standard notion of curvature. And if I define script A is equal to what I called A plus I phi, then I can define its complex curvature. And it's going to have two parts, F sub A minus plus. plus yeah so this minus phi wedge phi and plus i times dA of phi okay so there's the real part and here's the complex part or the purely imaginary part okay so to say that a connection is uh um flat in this complex sense says that both of these two pieces individually vanish and uh to set up a gauge theory you often want to sort of say that the fees You often want to sort of say that the phi's are somehow properly gauged. So, I'm also going to impose the condition that dA star of phi is equal to zero. So, in other words, if I look at the three equations where this, this, and this are all vanishing, then I have an elliptic system on my manifold for the pair A and phi. Okay. Okay, so the question that motivated all this whole study is: what happens if you have a sequence of these complex flat connections? Of these complex flat connections, let's call these Aj and phij, or Aj plus I phij, which go to infinity. So what can you say about these limits? So this was taken up by Cliff Taubes, and he wrote a couple of very important papers in about 2013, and he pointed out the following. So one is that it actually follows by sort of fairly old standard gauge theory that if the phi j's are bounded in L2, Bounded in L2, then nothing happens. Then, up to gauge choice, you can actually find a convergent, a convergent sequence. So then all is okay. Namely, there's sort of compactness. So the only thing that can sort of prevent compactness of the sequence of connections is if this imaginary part tends to infinity. So suppose I let alpha j be the L2 norm of phi j. Sorry. And let's suppose it goes to infinity. I'm going to write phi j is equal to alpha j psi j. And then what I'm going to get is the following system. So then f of alpha of a j, and then I'm going to have a minus alpha j squared times psi j range of psi j is equal to zero. And then these other equations, which are in some sense, all these other equations are linear and fine. So the alpha. Equations are linear and fine, so the alpha just factors out. So I'll just have those corresponding equations. So this is kind of the crucial one. So if you think about this from a certain point of view, this is actually a semi-classical type of equation. I have a very large parameter in front of this. So it would look maybe better if I called epsilon to be 1 over alpha j. And then I would have this of the form epsilon squared f alpha j minus psi j wedge of psi j equals zero. Okay. Now a good deal of Okay, now a good deal of work went into showing that as epsilon goes to zero or the alpha j's go to infinity, then you can extract some sort of limit that's non-obvious. I keep on thinking there should be sort of a simpler and more direct proof using sort of what we know is semi-classical techniques that we know and love, but I don't know one. But in the limit, what you get is a connection that satisfies FA infinity is equal to zero and psi infinity widge psi infinity. Psi infinity wedge of psi infinity is equal to zero. Now let me point out what this is. So psi, and let me drop this superscript infinity just to make life simple. So it's going to look like a sequence of things, which I'm going to call, you know, sigma L tensor. Let me see, how did I write this in my notes here? I'm going to write these, sorry, I'm going to write this as, you know, sigma j dxj. So these are matrices and these are the one forms. So these are matrices and these are the one-form parts. And when I write psi wedge psi, you know, what I'm going to get are terms that look like sigma i wedge sigma j is equal to, excuse me, I want to say bracket, sigma j is equal to zero. So to say that this condition, this condition I'm sort of translating, it's going to say that all of these coefficient matrices commute. Okay. And so roughly speaking, what that's saying is that I can single down. Is that I can single down or I can diagonalize so that they all are just multiples of the same guy. So psi is going to look like sigma times some one form, which I'm going to call omega. Okay, so I collect all the coefficients into this omega, and I get something of this form, okay, sigma times omega. And the point is that psi is well defined, but sigma and omega are individually not defined. And so sigma can be replaced by minus sigma, omega by minus omega, and I'd get exactly the same thing. Okay, so. Okay, so let me just say that sort of at the end of the day, what you're going to get here is: so, what you're going to get is this form omega. The equations are going to boil down to the fact that d plus delta of omega is equal to zero, but omega is actually not well defined. Omega is identified with minus omega. So, this is really what I mean by the first example of the z-to-harmonic spinner. You extract this limit and you wind up with the Wind up with a harmonic one form, but it's not an honest one form, it's only a Z2 valued one form. The right way to say this is that you have a line bundle, a real line bundle, I, with Z2 monodromy. And I have to explain what I mean precisely by that. And omega is a section of one forms, let's say lambda one, tensored with this real line bundle. Okay, now where does this real line bundle come in? Well, omega can vanish. Well, omega can vanish. So, omega vanishes on some set gamma. Okay, so there's some set gamma, and you can actually show that this gamma is, roughly speaking, codimension two. So, this gamma is one-dimensional in this particular case. And so, this line bundle is something that has monodromy z2 as I go around here. So, this is, in fact, the story. So, omega is not well defined away from gamma. On gamma, it actually vanishes, and this z. And this Z2 ambiguity comes about as I sort of trace any loop around gamma. Omega gets replaced by its negative. Okay, so this is really kind of finally the sort of object I want to study. So I have a harmonic one form, so I'm going to have d of omega equals zero, and omega is a section of, and now let me just write it, here's the manifold minus gamma, and it's a section of, well, in fact, let's just turn this into a spinner, so or a twisted spinner, so it's going to be a section. Or a twisted spinner, so it's going to be a section of the spin bundle tensored with this real line bundle. This is what I mean by a Z2 harmonic spinner. Okay, so what Taub's theorem states is that if you have non-compactness in the character variety, then as you go to infinity, you converge to one of these things. Now, with all the usual caveats that convergence is tricky and there may be non-unique limits and et cetera, et cetera. What you'd like to do is to say that, well, under certain circumstances, these objects might. Under certain circumstances, these objects might not exist. These are impossible to exist. And if you can prove that, then you've actually shown that the character variety is compact, for example. So if you have divergent limits, they converge to something which can't exist, then in fact, you couldn't have had a divergent limit. Okay, so this story, I presented in the case of these rank two vector bundles with complex flat connections on a three-manifold because this is the very simplest version of the story. But I just want to note before going on. But I just want to note before going on that there are other versions that occur in other dimensions. So on Riemann surfaces, the corresponding objects are, you take the Hitchin moduli space. This corresponds to solutions of the Hitchin equations, which are going to look rather similar. Phi wedge phi is equal to zero. Is equal to zero, d bar A of phi equals zero modulo, the unitary gauge group. But the point is that these correspond once again to complex flat connections, but on a Riemann surface. So this is a complex flat connection. This is one interpretation of the Hitchhiker moduli space. And a huge amount of information is known about this moduli space. It turns out that if the Riemann surface is of genus G, then this is a 12G minus 12 dimensional space. It contains Teichm√ºller spaces. It contains Teichm√ºller space, it's a nice slice. And so I've actually been involved in trying to study what it looks like near infinity at sort of great detail. And one gets limiting flat, one gets sort of these limiting objects. So an example of a Z2 harmonic spinner in this context is square root of Z dz squared. So it's a holomorphic, or it's a holomorphic quadratic differential. So this turns out to be the right. So, this turns out to be the right object on the Riemann surface, a holomorphic quadratic differential, but it can have the Z2 ambiguity. Okay, so these have been much studied. These have been around for a long time. And this more general category of object is the outgrowth of that. So, notice that these things are singular at points, which is once again codimension two. So, on three manifolds, you have these objects, you know, these complex flat connections, which I just studied. And in four dimensions, And in four dimensions, for M4, there's various gauge theories which lead to the same thing. So there are the so-called Waffo-Witten equations and the Kapustin-Witten equations. Now, I won't write those down explicitly in the interest of time, but all of these are known to lead in their non-compactness, in the analysis of non-compactness, to Z2 harmonic spinners. And all of these things have branching sets, or the zero locus of the corresponding spinner is codimension two. Of the corresponding spinner is codimension two. So we can abstract all of this and just think about the following situation. I have a compact manifold, a compact Riemannian manifold. I have some Dirac operator on it, D, which again, you can think of little D plus delta, but it could be sort of a more general Dirac operator. And then I have a set gamma inside of M, which is codimension two. And I have this real line bundle, I, which is this real R, when I say real, I mean it's an R bundle. And when I say real, I mean it's an R bundle with monodromy Z2 around gamma. And what I'm interested in are studying the set of, let me call them phi's, which are in the kernel of D. So namely, I'm taking sections of the spin bundle tensored with I. I'm looking for elements of the null space. Of the null space and the zero set, so mod phi inverse of zero is equal to gamma, and then crucially, well, let me just say this. So, I want to study the space, which I'm going to call z. Okay. And let me just sort of point out that, so by definition, so phi is sort of only defined up to sort of plus or minus one out here. And as I go towards here, it's vanishing. So, phi equals zero there. And this is the set gamma. Okay. Okay, so what I want to describe is that, in a certain sense, this is a very interesting type of free boundary problem. And these things are very rare. They shouldn't exist. They do sometimes, but it's kind of by some weird extra magic or symmetry or something like that. And what we'd like to understand is to quantify how rare are they. So the deformation problem in my title. So the deformation problem. Problem is suppose that M, the metric G gamma, this real line bundle, supports a Z2 harmonic spinner. Okay, so suppose that all of these things have sort of come together to collaborate to say that there actually is one of these objects. And I'll explain why they're rare. And just in a word for all of us analysts, this is an over-determined Cauchy problem. So basically, you know, it's like setting all of the Cauchy data of an elliptic problem. So that's why it's overdetermined. Okay, so suppose that this supports a z-to-harmonic spinner. Then the question is, what happens? When G varies. So, in other words, what you'd like to say is the following. So, the best case scenario would be, if you don't want these things to exist, the best case scenario would be that you start varying G and immediately these things disappear. So, in the whole space of metrics, so if you look at the space of metrics, you know, then there might be some finite codimensional space of metrics where these things exist. Where these things exist, right? And that would be, you know, a reasonable scenario. Now, even better would be if you could show that the space of bad metrics or good metrics, depending on your proclivities, if you could show that that space of metrics that support these e-tarmonic spinners is codimension two or higher, you'd be in extremely good shape. Now, why is that? Well, let me just go back to the gauge theory setting. So I have one of these gauge theoretic equations, which I'm going to write down as, well, I won't write. Which I'm going to write down as, well, I won't write it down, but I have some sort of moduli space corresponding to a space of solutions of some gauge theory. In certain situations, you can show that this space is actually discrete, for example. Okay, and what you'd like to do, now this space is going to depend on the metric G that you're starting with, and you'd like to get some numerical invariants that are completely well defined. So, you know, what's often in the case is you'd like to say, well, you count the number of elements in M sub G. Of elements in M sub G, and then you show that that number of elements is independent of the metric. Okay, so somehow or another, you know, for example, you know, as you vary metrics, that, you know, there's some reason why that number of elements is well defined. So typically, you might want to take a signed number of elements. So there might be a number of elements, and they have plus one, plus one, minus one, plus one, and this, and these two can sort of cap off. So it's like a cabordism where, you know, the total degree is two because these guys cancel out. Is two because these guys cancel out. Okay, so what goes wrong with this picture in general is that you can have branches as G converges to something, you can have certain non-compactness phenomena in the moduli space. And this happens in many gauge theories, where the solutions get larger and larger as a metric converges to some perfectly good metric, as a sequence of metrics converges to some perfectly good metric. And what you'd like to do is to take M sub G, and then you. Take m sub g, and then you want to adjoin to it some sort of virtual elements, and they call it v. So you want to sort of add to it sort of solutions of the gauge field equations at infinity, and you'd like to count these things. Okay, and so the idea is that as you sort of move around in the space of metrics, sometimes things here diverge to become virtual elements. And as long as you count them appropriately and you know trade them off in the appropriate way, you get an invariant that's well defined, right? Now, um Now, why does co-dimension two sort of matter? Well, you know, the space of good metrics would be sort of well-defined and connected. So, in particular, if this sort of space of bad metrics where you have Z2 harmonic spinners is codimension two, then I can always take a path which avoids it. And that says you choose any good metric and you compute the number of elements and you don't have any of these virtual elements and there you go, right? On the other hand, if this is codimension one, then you have to prove a wall crossing for it. Mention one, then you have to prove a wall crossing formula. You say that there is some well-defined count as you cross that wall. Okay. Okay, so that's the motivation for why we want to understand how frequently these zeto-harmonic spinners arise. And that's the origins of this problem. Okay, so I want to restrict to the situation so. I want to restrict to the situation, so let's restrict to the situation where m is three-dimensional. Okay, and again, I'll think of my Dirac operator as just D plus D star, but it could be somewhat more general. Now, the best theorem that's known is that this branching set, gamma. Now, this is approaching it from the motivation of compactness theory. So, if you take a sequence of So, if you take a sequence of flat connections, in general, all that you know is that the set of points where the limiting object vanishes is rectifiable. And dimension one. Okay, so dimension one is good. That's codimension two, but the rectifiable is kind of a horrible condition. I mean, it's still nice from a sort of measure theoretic point of view, but it's pretty horrible for doing an. It's pretty horrible for doing analysis, at least our type of analysis. So, we're going to make some assumptions. So, I'm going to assume the most reasonable thing. So, one is that gamma is a smooth link. So it'll be compact, but it could be a smooth curve or a union of curves. And the second thing is, or gamma is a graph, by which I mean something like this, you know, etc. You know, et cetera. Okay. And we'd like to understand this problem better. So the question is: what does the deformation theory look like? Rave? Is that graph like smooth in some, or is it just a rectifiable graph? Or is it? No, it's a very nice graph. That's a piecewise smooth graph, Jesse. That's a piecewise smooth graph, Jesse. Yeah, so I don't mean rectifiable. Of course, you know, ideally, you'd like to be either showing that these things have to be generically piecewise smooth, or you're willing to do the analysis on a rectifiable thing. But I think that the more reasonable course of action, nobody knows how to do this yet, is to say that for generic metrics, the singular set should be piecewise smooth, but it's going to, I mean, in a three-manifold. I mean, in a three-manifold, notice that, you know, if I have like a crossing, I would expect that, you know, I could untangle that sort of just by moving the strands away. But, you know, for example, in a four-manifold, when you have a codimension two thing, you can have a surface sitting in a four-manifold and you can't disentangle it from itself necessarily if it's only immersed. Okay. Okay, so this was studied in the thesis of Takahashi under Cliff in, I don't know, it was around 2015 or 16. And he has a rather complicated formalism for understanding this. And one of the things I've been trying to do over the past year or so is to understand what he did and to try to translate it into my language. I mean, he has a very nice theorem, but I didn't understand it very well. And I've been trying to understand it in my terms. And then he was only looking at the case originally where you had a case one here, where you have a smooth curve. Okay. And so I'm going to describe to you what the deformation theory looks like. What the deformation theory looks like. And in particular, I'm going to look at the index problem about, you know, the index is: I'm going to get a certain linearization, a linearized operator, which comes out of this deformation theory, and I can ask what's its index. And what that index will tell me is exactly in the space of metrics. I have the space of, you know, bad metrics, and it'll tell me, at least virtually, it'll tell me what its codimension is. Okay, so if the index. Okay, so if the index is zero, then I might expect that you know, if things are going well, then for every metric, there's going to be a Z2 harmonic spinner. If the index is negative, then it should say that I should be able to perturb away. Given a given metric where one of these things exists, if I move in a generic direction, it will disappear. This Z-Dormonic spinner won't appear anymore. Okay, so well, I've given you a lot of generality, so let me sort of immediately get into some. Get into some analysis here. So let's look at the situation now. Let's look at the model case. The model case is a line inside of R3. And I can write down exactly what the Dirac operator is in terms of cylindrical coordinates. So I have r, I have theta, and I have a y variable along here. And I can write it down in terms of a polymatrix. Polymatrices. And so let me just do that for you very briefly so you can see sort of what it looks like. So there it is. So it'll look like the following. So up to some choice of things, it'll look like zero minus I, zero, zero, I. So I'm working in a normalization where the spin bundle in three dimensions is two complex dimensional. It looks like a C2, you know, a rank two complex bundle. So I'm going to have this times dy plus plus zero i times e to the minus i theta and then I have a i times e to the i theta zero dr and then my last term here is zero e to the i theta minus e to the i excuse an e to the minus i theta and e to the i theta zero times one over r d theta. So this is a simulacrum of what the Dirac operator looks like in cylindrical coordinates. Cylindrical coordinates. So, this is an edge operator. So, it's elliptic in order one. And I can compute the various standard invariants of it. So, the first thing are what are its indicial roots? So, remember that an indicial root is a number gamma, such that for some choice of function, let me call it a of theta, this is going to be bigger. Theta, this is going to be big O of r to the gamma. So, in general, you know, my thing in a curved setting, this was the model situation. In a curved setting, there'll be a bunch of higher order terms, and it's going to say that there's some leading order cancellation, and this really amounts to some sort of eigenvalue problem for the leading order term of this operator. Okay, so it turns out that this is true when gamma lives in z plus one half. So, half integers are the initial roots for this thing. The initial roots for this thing. Okay. So the second thing, and this is following the edge theory. So, you know, basically, I'd like to know when is this operator Fredholm, for example. Okay, so if I look at this operator as a mapping between weighted spaces, r to the gamma. And so it's first order. So I'm going to have an edge Soblov space. And then I'm going to take the measure to be dr over r d theta dy. be dr over r d theta dy. The only reason for taking this measure is that you're sort of right at, you sort of pass out of this space precisely when you have a function that's sort of a weight. If you take something of size r to the gamma plus epsilon, it lives in here, but r to the gamma minus epsilon does not live in this space. So, you know, choosing this sort of dr over r measure is exactly saying that this weight of the Sobolev space corresponds to an L infinity weight. corresponds to an L infinity weight. Okay, so D is mapping this to R to the gamma minus one L2 dr over R d theta dy. Okay, and so the theorem is that, well, the first theorem is that this does not have closed range when gamma is an initial root. So, we have to avoid those weighted spaces. But, in fact, all other weights, you're going to have a more reasonable problem, but it's not quite as reasonable as you'd hope. So, the second thing you want to understand is what in my language is the normal operator, which is just this Dirac operator in the model situation. So, this is just like a boundary symbol. So, this is equal to D on R3 minus R1 with no higher order correction terms. This is just sort of the Direction terms. This is just sort of the flat model. Okay. And so the theorem, this is an old theorem going back, you know, 30 years, I hate to say, is that D, well, let's just put it so if N of D mapping between two spaces, let's say R to the gamma H1E to R to the gamma minus 1 L2, is surjective. Then D is essentially surjective, namely surjective up to a finite dimensional. And if N of D is injective between these weighted spaces, then D is essentially injective. So essentially, just means up to a finite rank error. Okay, so you want to think of n as. Okay, so you want to think of n as n of d as being the symbol, and so you know, this is the usual kind of statement that you know, for example, if the symbol is invertible, then the operator is Fredholm. So, these are sort of semi-fred home analogs of these two things. Now, notice I didn't put any case of if n of d is invertible, because unfortunately, n of d is never invertible. Okay, so n of d is never invertible. r to the gamma, h1 e to r to the gamma minus one, well, two, never invertible. Never invertible. And so, what actually is true is that if I look at the weight scale, so here's minus three halves, minus one halves, one half, et cetera. It turns out that if gamma is less than minus one half, then it's injective or at least, actually, surjective or almost surjective, namely up to finite rank. And if gamma is greater than minus one half, then it's injective. Greater than minus one half, then it's injective or almost injective. Okay, and this is the um the generic situation. So if I were to take a generic curve, gamma one inside of M3, and I look at the Dirac operator on here, what I would find is that the corresponding operator, this D, would be actually surjective if I look in a weighted space less than minus one half, and it would be actually injective if I look in a weighted space greater than minus one. If I look in a weighted space greater than minus one-half. Okay, there's no Fredholm range. Now, what we're looking for in our problem, remember, the space Z contained a set of phi's, which are harmonic one forms. So, d of phi equals zero, but phi vanishes. Phi goes to zero at gamma. So, these are going to be not in these spaces r to the minus one half, they're going to be better. So, in fact, One half, they're going to be better. So, in fact, the regularity theorem. So, regularity theory for this class of edge operators is going to imply that if phi is in z, then phi is actually polyhomogeneous. So it has a complete asymptotic expansion, starting with terms that look like, let's say, a plus r, there's going to be e to the minus theta over 2, a minus e to the plus i theta over 2 times r to the two times r to the minus r to the one-half plus high order terms and excuse me this is in this case it's going to be plus and minus forgive me okay and this is r to the i didn't write that very nicely let me do that one more time it's going to be r to the one half plus hundred terms okay on the other hand in general there are many solutions and infinite dimensional space of solutions Space of solutions, many solutions, psi, let's say, which have the property that psi looks like now, let's say b plus e to, now this is a minus i theta over 2, b minus times e to the plus i theta over 2 times r to the minus one half. And in fact, there's a well-posed Poisson operator and a boundary problem. So in fact, there exists a unique solution, well, unique up to finite rank, but you know, almost a unique solution. But you know, almost a unique solution, psi given B plus. So, namely, B plus is like the Dirichlet data, or you know, it's like, you know, the boundary data that you need to specify. So, if you know B plus, then you can solve this problem. You can find a solution which blows up like r to the minus one half. Okay, the two coefficients b plus and b minus are paired. So they're like the Dirchley-Neumann data, or more properly, like the scattering data. They're sort of Properly like the scattering data. They're sort of paired. And in fact, B minus is functionally related to B plus. And in this particular case, H is a type of scattering operator. And it actually is really a Hilbert transform. Okay, so in other words, I specify B plus, the paired linear, the paired leading coefficient B minus is its Hilbert transform. And the pair of these guys are the leading coefficients of an actual global solution. And again, Global solution. And again, all up to finite rank errors. Okay. What are our Z2 harmonic spinners? These guys that we were talking about. Well, they're missing the Cauchy data. So that was exactly what I'm saying. It's an over-determined problem. I'm demanding that the Dirichlet and Neumann data both vanish. Okay, and this is why they're so rare. Okay, so basic question: do they ever exist? And so let me just say a few words about existence. Let me just say a few words about existence. So, one is that in for three manifolds, actually, I forget what context they did it. For three manifolds, there's an existential proof. So, there's a proof of existence without having any idea what it looks like. So, existence via actually it's a spectral flow argument. And this was done by Alexander Dewan and Thomas Walpuski. And Thomas Walpuski. And I could be forgetting this, could be on a four-manifold. Let me not answer, but maybe somebody remembers. So for a three-manifold, there may be existence. On a two-manifold, there's all of these quadratic differentials. These holomorphic quadratic differentials. These holomorphic quadratic differentials I've talked about before. So there's a very rich supply of them. It's finite-dimensional, but on any Riemann surface, you know exactly what these sort of objects are. Okay. On a four-manifold, well, let's take the simplest four-manifold we know, C2. And what I can look at are, and forgive me, when I was talking about, so I made a big goof before, when I was talking about Riemann surfaces, I should have been talking about Z DZ. Talking about z dz squared and then its square root, which is the thing that we're kind of interested in, is root z times dz, not root z dz squared. So, forgive me, that was an error before. Okay, so I'm talking about just differentials, abelian differentials, but they have a square root coefficient. Notice that square root, I mean, that's exactly like one of these initial roots, r to the one-half. So, in C2, for example, if I have, you know, complex coordinates z and w, I can take, you know, for example, root z dz, or I can take. Z dz, or I can take the square root of z times w times, well, you know, I can take, you know, root w dz plus root z dw, or I can take, you know, various types of things like this, and I can give various other examples. Unfortunately, what I do not know is an explicit example in three-dimensional manifolds. There is a sort of a local example, and this was done by Taubs. It's a very clever argument, and somehow it's very. A very clever argument, and somehow it's very special, but it seems impossible to form. So it seems like a very rigid class of examples. So he looked exactly on R3, and he looked at omegas, which were of the form du, where u is a function, right? And he looked at u's of the form r to the gamma times some, let's say, function a of theta, where theta is an s2. Now the branching set, this set gamma, is sort of going to be a set of rays coming out of the origin. Rays coming out of the origin. So, you know, A is a function on S2 minus a collection of points, P1 through P2K. Turns out I need an even number of them to have the monodromy condition satisfied. And I want A to be, well, I'd like this whole thing to be harmonic. I'd like u to be harmonic, which means that I want A to be an eigenfunction of the Laplacian. So I want Laplacian of A is equal to lambda A. And well, there's lots of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, but I'm going to put two provisos on them. But I'm going to put two provisos on them. One is that they have to be only existing in the component of here, and they're sections of this R line bundle. Okay. And then I want their leading coefficients to vanish. Okay. So I want the leading coefficients to vanish. And it turns out that he's able to do this in some extremely special cases. Okay, where you have a symmetry group to play with, and he's able to show that these leading coefficients do vanish. So let's just say that without worrying about these leading coefficients, So, let's just say that without worrying about these leading coefficients vanishing, no matter the configuration of points there, you always get lots of solutions. You get all a complete basis of eigenfunctions. But finding eigenfunctions with leading coefficients vanish is very rare. Okay, well, let me finally talk about the linearization. And let me sort of finally say that the problem that you'd like to study, since I'm really short on time, you want to study is. Is, well, suppose I have this curve. Suppose I perturb off in the direction of some vector field V. Okay, so I'm saying, suppose I have a deformation in my curve. When will I be able to find a new family of zetharmonic spinners as I sort of move along there? Okay, so a way to say that is suppose I take a family of curves, gamma sub epsilon, which roughly looks like gamma plus epsilon v in local coordinates or exponentiating v. That's our exponentiating v along gamma. Okay. One thing I could do is I could take a family of diffeomorphisms. I could take f sub epsilon m to m and f sub epsilon of gamma is equal to gamma sub epsilon. So I can just sort of take a family of diffeomorphisms and use it to pull the whole story back to a fixed singular set gamma. That's obviously a little bit nicer. And so suppose I have a family of gamma sub epsilons and psi sub epsilons. Epsilons and psi sub epsilons. Notice I'm not varying the metric right now, and I'll maybe have a moment to explain why. What that would correspond to is actually taking the Dirac operator acting on, so let me just take f epsilon pullback of size of epsilon, and I want these all to equal zero. So this would be sort of what a deformation would look like. If I take d by d epsilon did epsilon equals zero, I'm going to get the following thing. I'm going to get d of essentially. Following thing. I'm going to get d of essentially the lead derivative of this psi in the direction of the variation vector field plus psi dot. So deformations infinitesimally would correspond to solutions of this form. Here, this psi dot, remember all of these psi sub epsilons look like r to the one half. They're vanishing. So psi dot should look like r to the one half. This guy, on the other hand, well, psi is looking like a plus A plus, well, I'm going to use complex notation. So I'm going to set z is equal to r e to the i theta. These are, you know, in the normal to gamma. I'm just going to use a complex coordinate z instead of two real coordinates. And I can write psi is equal to a plus times root z and a minus times root z bar plus high order terms. And it turns out then the l of v of psi I get by taking the derivative. of a plus root z plus epsilon v and a minus root z bar plus epsilon v bar plus high order terms. And this is going to have the form one half. Then there's going to be an a plus v divided by root z, a minus v bar divided by root z bar plus autographs. Okay, so finally, let me set in this language. I'm going to set the following scenario. So I'm going to take the operator D, okay, and I want to look at D as a mapping on the space where it has an infinite dimensional null space. So I'm going to take the kernel of D, I'm going to take a psi, and I'm going to take phi, forgive me, and I'm going to take its boundary values. I'm going to take its leading coefficients. So in, let's say, L. So, in let's say L2 of gamma plus L2 of gamma, I'm going to take the leading coefficients of phi, and this is like the Calderon projector, or this is like the range of the Calderon projector. I'm going to get the space of all possible leading coefficients. It's the graph of the Hilbert transform. And so this is, in some sense, you know, what this linearization problem is asking is I'd like to find elements whose boundary values, well, elements that look like L V of psi. Elements that look like Lv of Psi plus Psi dot, right? And whose boundary values lie in this subspace here. That's kind of what I'm after. Okay. And well, if I look at the range of L of V of psi, so psi is my fixed guy and V varies. And I'm just about to finish up. So psi is fixed and V varies. The range of L V of psi is some other big infinite dimensional space. It's the set of things that look Dimensional space. It's the set of things that look like this. And it turns out it looks suggestively right there. So the theorem that one wants to prove to show that this is a well-posed problem is to say that the range of this mapping here, as I let V vary for a fixed psi, is essentially transverse to the Calderom subspace. Okay, so in other words, I want to choose a boundary condition t and Boundary condition T, and T is going to somehow be related to Psi. And I think, in the interest of time, I'm not going to write this down explicitly. T is going to be explicitly cooked up so that L of B of Psi is identically zero for all V. Okay, so it's going to be some boundary operator which kills this subspace here. And I want to show that restricted to this subspace, it's going to be Fred Holm or invertible. Okay, and you can write down this T sub psi quite explicitly. And then the theorem. Explicitly. And then the theorem is that this Dirac operator and this boundary operator, T sub Psi, this is an elliptic boundary problem. Okay, so this is an application of the edge operator machinery. And then the second theorem to accompany this, and this is again in the case where I have not just smooth curves, is that the kernel of Curves is that the kernel of this linearization, so this is the linearized deformation problem, excuse me, the index of this linearized deformation problem. In fact, in this case is equal to zero. Both the kernel and the co-kernel are identified. You can show a very natural equivalence to the kernel of this boundary problem. Okay, so the index in this particular case is zero. Now, let me just say in a word, what we're interested in doing, and we don't have the full story yet, is what happens when you have a graph. And so you need analogs of the Hilbert transform that I talked about. And this is actually some sort of quantum Dirac operator on the graph. So the Hilbert transform, this is going to give the relationship between the leading coefficients. And you need to set up the mapping properties in a more delicate way than I'd been able to do before. Been able to do before, and this is stemming out of my older work with Pierre and Paolo and Eric Leichdam, for example: the mapping properties and trying to find the exact domains of these operators and then eventually compute the index. And so it turns out that you can do all of this. I don't have a good formula for what the index is, but generically, when you're moving these points, you're going to have negative index. So, you know, the good news is that in this particular case, allowing yourself to Particular case, allowing yourself to break apart these graphs is going to give you sort of a, you know, what that's going to say is that keeping a graph-like behavior is a very rare thing. So, this first theorem says that keeping the circle is actually kind of generic, but keeping this, keeping the vertices is going to be very non-generic. Okay, let me stop there and forgive me for going over. Great. Oh, beautiful. Thanks so much. Oh, beautiful. Thanks so much, Rafe. Speak on behalf of everybody. That was gorgeous. Instead of just me launching into questions, let me ask. I have a question. Yeah. So I think I asked this at the Monster seminar too, but so if instead of looking at it as a map between spaces with different weights, you were to look at it as a map between spaces of the same weight. A map between spaces of the same weight, then it really would be like the stuff we did with Paolo and Eric. This infinite dimensional space of solutions that is happening right in the middle of the initial interval is the same thing we had with the signature operator. And the regularity theory you mentioned is also what we ended up proving for the signature operator. Signature operator. Yeah, no, that's exactly right. Yeah, so I guess my question is: why is it that you're looking at it as a map between spaces with different weights instead of as a map between spaces of the same weight? Yeah, I mean, almost certainly you could formulate it in the other way. I think that in terms of how I'm sort of setting up the nonlinear problem, the non-linear deformation problem, this way is a little bit more natural, but I'm not convinced of that. It could probably be done either way. So, in particular, Zachary, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. Ahead. Go ahead. In particular, when you talk about the boundary problem, when you bring in this t sub psi, how do you make a boundary problem if you're not thinking about it as an operator between operating spaces of the same weight? So in reality, you are. If you look at it, how I'm doing. So I really, you know, what you're formulating, I mean, so, you know, you're right, I'm wrong. Okay, that's all I wanted. That's all you wanted to know. I think, you know, the reality is that I'm really using. The reality is that I'm really using that kind of formalism. I'd set this up in a slightly different way, but you know, you're right, that that's really what's going on underneath the hood. Okay. I think that's a raised hand, isn't it? Siki, go ahead. Yes. So could you repeat that? How can you define this T psi? Okay, so this T sub psi is, okay, so if I have a phi and it's going to have leading coefficients b plus and b minus, and this is, you know. minus and this is you know um e to the minus i the over two e to the plus i thade over two times r to the minus one half and the special guys that we're trying to kill are these things which look like a plus v divided by root z and a minus v bar divided by root z bar so here's what tp psi is so tp sub psi of phi is the following so let me see if i get this right um so i'm going to take a minus times A minus times A minus conjugate times B plus, right, minus A plus times B minus conjugate. I guess that's right. So, you know, if B plus and B minus are given by this formula, this would look like A minus conjugate A plus B minus A plus times A minus B bar conjugate, and that equals zero. So this is just kind of a stupid numerical trick. I mean, it's a clever numerical trick. I mean, it's a clever numerical trick, which is a boundary condition which exactly kills things of this form. Okay, so that's the boundary condition, right? And kind of the miracle is that it's an elliptic boundary condition. You know, it's exactly the right sort of thing. And so again, looking at this picture sort of inside, you know, this pairs, you know, these L2 of the boundary, L2 of gamma plus L2 of gamma, I have the Calderon subspace, the range of B. And it turns out that, you know, there's this natural. Turns out that there's this natural boundary condition which kills this subspace here. This is the range of this L sub V and restricted to this subspace, it's spread home. And that's exactly what we need. Okay, so there's an analog of this in the graph case, but it's sort of much harder to describe. Okay, thank you. So this This so this your your line bundle i it's defined in the complement of the singular set right that's exactly right excuse me the line bundle i yeah is on the complement of the of this uh graph and you said that you have holonomy z2 when you go around yeah one of these things right so in the case of the figure eight what does it mean and in the What does it mean and in dimension two? So in dimension, oh, in dimension, you have always co-dimension one, right? Yeah, so the point, no, it's co-dimension two, right? That's exactly the point. Okay, then I don't know. The point is in dimension two, you have points, and then you have, you know, then it's like the square root of z singularity. So you want to think of this as O is modeled by square root of Z in the normal bundle. It's behaving like that. So in the case, so suppose that you have a figure eight in three dimensions. Yeah. Okay. How do you? Yeah. Okay, how do you do the holonomy in this case? No, because you could go through one of the holes in the eight and come out through the other. Well, no, I mean, because you have, I mean, the point is what you're looking at is pi one of m minus gamma, and you're looking for a representation of that to z2. So you pick a curve and you get the. So, I mean, once you have gamma, then you want to say whatever you get out of that when you have a representation. You get out of that when you have a representation, yeah. So, whatever you get out of that, you know, and so you want representations which on these generators are non-trivial, okay. And you know, in you know, in reasonable cases, you can find such things. Okay, what happens if you somehow go to the so if you you could fix a connection actually in this line bundle I, which is flat, and then uh and work everything out on on the double cover that you get from the connection because then you. Double cover that you get from the connection because then you have a double cover. Yeah, you could, you, um, so I don't know exactly. I mean, that, that, uh, uh, somehow, yeah, I mean, so, so in some sense, you know, so there were certainly a number of attempts and some successful to sort of try to understand some of this analysis just by passing to a double cover. You know, and you can't do that in general, in particular when you're on the graph, but uh, but um, you can do some, you know, you can do some cases like that. Know you can do some cases like that. So, for example, the model case you can almost certainly understand by that trick. You know, and just take a double cover around again. One more thing: if you go back to what Pierre said about, you know, instead of dropping the degree, I mean, the order of the weight, if you keep the same weight, then the behavior is actually somewhat different. Now, don't you recover some sort of Fred Hom behavior because? No, because no, it's exactly the same thing because, you know, Because, no, it's exactly the same thing because, you know, in order to well, so the way you wrote it, it would be that you take the operator and multiply it by R, and then you get an actual edge operator. Yes, but you know, you're still going to be in a situation where if you have a weight below minus one half, then it's going to be infinite dimensional null space. And if you have a weight above minus one half, then it's going to have an infinite dimensional co-kernel. So you can't get away from that. Right, but. Away from that, right? But so sorry, sorry, but I think what you showed was that when you think of it as being on the same weight, that the model operator is injective on its minimal domain and surjective on its maximal domain. And so you're, you know, what you have is that any Fredholm domain would be one which is transverse to this B, range of B. Yeah, thanks. I mean, that's really the right way to say that is that the maximal domain is one where you have. Say that is that the maximal domain is one where you have this infinite-dimensional null space, and the minimal domain is one where you have an infinite-dimensional code kernel. And that's very much just like the Laplacian on the dip, you know, on a manifolded boundary. You know, you have that same kind of setup. And you want to find a domain in between, which is well-behaved. And so this boundary problem is a well-behaved problem. So it's specifying exactly what happens to this sort of the Cauchy data. It's choosing. It's choosing a Lagrange, but it's choosing a subspace that's sort of right halfway in between minimal and maximal domain. I'm very sorry. I think I'm going to have to interrupt for order for us to start scheduled time, but I'll just remind that we do have after the talks, we are going to switch over to this discussion video game gather town place that we can go to and talk. So there's a which, can I just say informally, I've been using it, really sucks. Using it really sucks, but it's still better than Zoom. Better than Zoom, yeah. But let's be warned that it sucks and
