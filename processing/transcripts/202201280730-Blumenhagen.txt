Thank you. Thank you, Robert, for the nice introduction. And of course, a big thank to Mariana, Michela, and Urine for organizing this nice workshop here. Actually, it's the first month workshop I've ever been, so it's really nice. I watch out of my window, I can almost see the mountains, and that's indeed true, but it's only the Alps. Okay, so I want to report on some recent work together with the postdoc at the Max Planck Institute, Niccolo Cribiori, and it's about has quite a massive. And it's about has quite a mathematical title, just a shortcut title, called K-theory in cobodism. And this is, so to say, thoughts that we developed when we were trying to understand and to read more carefully this cobodism paper by McNamara and Cumrum. So, the upshot is the take-a-home message is that we think that K-theory and cobodisms are essentially two sides of the same coin and they Sides of the same coin and they belong together. Roughly speaking, K-theory is the open string story, and cobordism is the closed string story. Okay, so let me start. So we heard from Miguel that this nice conjecture, so this one of the best tested or believed in conjectures that there should be no global symmetries in quantum gravity. And indeed, if one seems to detect one, To detect one, it actually needs to be broken or gauged to be consistent with quantum gravity. So, there are two ways. So, for continuous symmetry, that is maybe easier to think about. This means in the first case here that if we have a current, say, that is preserved, a gauging means that, of course, that we can write it as a derivative of some field strength. This is the gauged situation, and the broken situation is simply that the current is not preserved anymore. So, that there's something. not preserved anymore so that there's something appearing on the right hand side here and as these two people explained to us a non-vanishing or the conjecture is that a non-vanishing cobalt group whenever you detect it detect it is a source of the global symmetry and thus needs to be nullified eventually so it should either be broken or eventually gauged and in fact in their paper they mostly discuss the case when the symmetry is gauged and of course the Is gauged. And of course, the point is: where should I start? With cobaltism group should I start? In principle, I don't know from the very beginning what is the right cobaltism group I should consider. And also, what is quantum gravity? What structure of manifolds should I consider? So I start somewhere with something that hopefully comes close to the eventual probes and group, some QB tilde, and from there I then have to start sort of a bottom-up approach. Have to start sort of a bottom-up approach. So, I need some intuition of how to see what objects need to be, what objects I in addition need to introduce in order to either gauge it or break it. And in this paper, they discussed many examples. I mean, the mathematicians have means to compute these coordinates and groups. And since in string theory, in particular in superstring theory, we always deal with theories with fermions. The theories with fermions. So, the right cobaltism groups. So, a good starting point for cobaltism groups is the cobalt groups of spin manifolds. I will define cobaltism groups in a moment. So, to start with spin structures or spin C structures, if we have charged fermions. And I said, then these people here discussed many examples because these things are often on vanishing. And then the question is, okay, so what kind of defect or what kind of defect? What kind of defect, or what kind of object on the right-hand side can break it, or how can I gauge it? Yeah, and gauging is very familiar in all our spring-theory examples because we know, of course, many gauge fields. In the 10-dimensional theories, all the Ramor fields, for instance, the P-form fields are, of course, gauge fields. Okay, so what is this? Of course, I cannot give you a precise mathematical definition. That would be too much, and time is not perfect. Much and time is not permitting it, but just to give you an intuition. So, if we have a spin cobalt class, so let me just expand an example. These are would be equivalence classes of n-dimensional spin manifolds. So, everything is now in the realm of spin manifolds, where we say that two manifolds are equivalent if we find a one-dimensional higher manifold that connects the two, which means that the boundary of this intermediate manifold is literally. Is literally m plus n bice, then I change the orientation. That's the contention here. But this is very general. So, I mean, even this manifold in between can have holes, can be of completely arbitrary topology, so to say. So, this is a very rough topological classification of manifolds. That should be clear. And then for these manifolds, you can show you define equivalence classes of manifolds and then you. Manifolds, and then you can define an addition of them, which is just the disjoint union of them, the co-bodies group of the disjoint union. And this is why it's called a group. This makes it a group. And let me just mention that these groups have also appeared recently when computing these non-perturbative Day-Freed anomalies. There's a nice paper by Venyaki and Iguel on that. Okay, so breaking this symmetry now means that we introduce defects. Introduce defects. This is what McNamara and Waffa were proposing, such that the right-hand side is not vanishing. So, in other words, these defects, of course, have a certain co-dimension, and it's precisely such. So, if you think about the dimensions, so this picture correctly gives you the dimension. So, if I have a manifold of a certain dimension, then of course, the manifold that I would introduce that allows me to connect it to something else, this W, has one. Else, this w has one dimension higher, and this defect then has one dimension less than m. So it's like in this drawing, it's a point. So this you can see from here. So you can think of these defects as brains, as brains, even though it was not always called brains in that paper. Also, speaking of breaking, there was a nice relation to the Fischler-Suskant mechanism pointed out by the Midrid group. Out by the mid-rate group here. So that would be the breaking. So then the question is: so if I have a Kubotten group that is non-vanishing, can I identify a defect such that then this putting this here at the end of omega of W, then with this extra defect, then the Kubolsen group is trivial. That's the question. Or you can gauge the symmetry. This is maybe more familiar to all of us. To all of us. So, in this case, you would say that: okay, so you introduce a gauge field, which can be a higher p-form field, for instance, and then you define something like a new cobalt group, where you also not only consider manifolds like we did before, but also these gauge fields, like chirps or bundles of them. And then you make it like this, so that you have a gauge field, and then the derivative of the gauge field is the conserved current. Conserved current, and you can also have other objects that you might not have identified a priori. So, these are just the manifolds that you are starting with, which carry a discrete symmetry group. But maybe you can also identify defects that are also charged under that gauge symmetry. And then these together, they can be, so to say, considered as the current on the right-hand side of this gauging. So, in this case, if these are brains, so in this case, If these are brains, so in this case, the brains would be sort of of the same dimension, or at least the transversal space would be of the same dimension as the manifold in the cobordism group. Okay. And these currents that you have. Can I ask a question? Yes. So just very quickly, the way you explain it now, it seems that it's only one combination that gets sketched and then another one needs to be broken. Yes. Yes. In general, that you cannot gauge everything that there is. You can gauge both. I mean, this depends. Well, we have a bottom-up approach. So, this we don't know a priori. So, we start somewhere. And in principle, you could just forget about the defects and just try to gauge the symmetry. This works. This could work. But maybe you're missing some extra ingredients that we have in string theory more often. And this is what I will explain next, that there is a nice mathematical relation that tells you what kind of DV. Relation that tells you what kind of defects you could also introduce here. And if you now gauge, say, one of one symmetry of this kind, yeah, then it can happen. Two things can happen. So either, of course, it's gauged, so it's not a problem anymore. The global symmetry is now gauged. So there is no problem with that. On the other hand side, you see, if you have a global symmetry that describes you here, that results. Describes you here that results here from the spin cobalt group, and maybe a global symmetry that comes from the defects. This is precise situation that we will have. Then, if it's a linear combination of the two, actually, that is gauged, so both objects couple to the same field, then you see the conservation, the initial conservation, say, of one of these charges is, so to say, broken by this linear combination because you can carry, say, part of the global symmetry from here to the. Part of the global symmetry from here to the other side. So the only thing that matters here is the sum of the two things. Then we say that global symmetries that were initially there are co-killed. This is how Magnum-RI and WAFA were describing it. Now, you'll see in a moment what I mean by that. Okay, so at start. Okay, so our initial point, say we take the same coupons and groups as were. Cobortism groups that as were considered in that paper, the spin cobordism groups. There are many cases where this is non-vanishing, and luckily, the mathematicians have computed this. So, here's the list of non-vanishing cobordism groups. So, this is the dimension of the manifolds we are considering. So, this is just zero dimensional. So, this is just the point. Here's the because we are looking at oriented manifolds, the sort of oriented point. And then at dimension one, so we have. So we have an S1 as the generator of this. So we have a Z2 group first of all, and the generator is S1, where the fermion is periodic if you transport it around the S1 and so on. Look here, for instance, at dimension 4, we have a full Z symmetry, and the generator of that is K3. That is all known. And similar for spin C structure, the non-vanishing cobodism groups have also been. Vanishing cobodism have also been computed. All odd ones are vanishing in this case, and they are only factors of z. So there are no z2 factors, but there can be multiple z factors. So look, for instance, here at dimension two, you find the projective plane, and you can also define cobordism invariance. So these are topological invariants that do not change if you move in a certain cobordism class. Class. So, and these are partially known. And for spin C, this is, for instance, just the channel class, the first channel class. And for dimension four, it's the top class and the first channel class square and so on. So these are known. And here you have a list of generators. So these two we were computing in our paper, and we didn't find them in the literature. But we think that this is a basis. So what we are seeking here now. So, what we are seeking here now to extend our picture of Magna Mara and Wafa is: so, what are the cobodism classes of the defects actually? So, the defects came in addition, but we think that they carry their own global charges by themselves. And we know that in spring theory, many symmetries are gauged via Ramoramorpi formed. So, the question is: how is this described in more detail and how do the D-brains actually enter? So, and how far? So, and how far can one develop this picture without relying on string theory? So, this is the whole idea of the Swampden program: that we get our intuition from string theory, but then we move away from it and formulate everything in terms of cooperation conjectures. And maybe we can derive similar structures then in string theory and then have an argument for a string lamppost picture, for instance. The string lamppost principle. So, is there sort of a bottom-up approach that allows you to do that? Sort of a bottom-up approach that allows you just to start with coordinate classes and then generate structures that we also see in string theory. So, our key observation is, and there was a longer story to that, of course, D-brains are classified by K-theory. This is, you know, since the work of Witten. And these are often also classes like Z2 and Z. So we think that they generate their own global symmetries. And then it's an old question whether the K-theory charge, if it Whether the K-theory charge, if it's not a gauge charge, as for the Morphie, must the K-theory charge be cancelled on a compact space? And there was a pro-brain argument by Ranger and subsequent work. I'm not discussing this here now in detail. I just wanted to mention that this is what I will tell you is closely related to this old question. And when we were looking at this, so we looked a bit in the math literature and we made a little observation, and indeed. Observation and indeed, when you look at the math literature, there exists an integrated mathematical relation between K-theory and co-bortisms. So, for the mathematicians, what I tell you now here is more or less well-known stuff. So, for instance, what made us curious is, so if you look at the tables of the classification of the p-brains, which are classified by certain orthogonal K-theory groups, like given here. Don't worry. Here. Don't worry about the tilde. This is the reduced K-theory group, but don't worry now for the moment. So, what you find is a list that looks very similar to the cobaltism groups, so Z, Z2, Z2, and in fact is precisely the same factors. The only difference is that certain multiplicities are different. So here, the multiplicity of every factor is one. And if you look at my old table here, you see it's the same factors, only here is a multiplicity. Same factors, only here is a multiplicity too. And it's very similar for the unitary K-theory groups and the cobaltism on the spin C manifolds. So here all factors are Z. Of course, we have precisely for type 2B the D-brains. So this is the transversal space to the D-brains. So we have precisely the D-brains that are classified by this K-theory group. So D9, D7, D5, D3. Groups, so d9, d7, d5, d3, and d1. So there is an obvious relation between the spin cobordism groups and these k-theory groups. That's obvious, yeah. And so how could that be? So at least a heuristic argument would go maybe like this. So d-brains can be viewed in two ways. As it's explicit in their CFT description or tree-loop channel equivalence. So you can think of d-brains as endpoints of open strings. Think of d-brains as endpoints of open strings. This is the old Pochinsky picture. Then you have massless gauge fields, and K-theory is nothing else than classifying the equivalence classes of vector bundles on manifolds read by the D-brains. And if you find a non-vanishing group, that's an obstruction for the decay of the brain to the vacuum. So that's a really stable configuration. But you can also look at the brain from the tree channel, and then these are objects that can emit closed strings. So they couple to graviton, dilaton, and p-forms. Graviton, dilaton, and p-forms. So you can think of these also, as we know, as solitronic supergravity solutions that also have an obstruction to decay to the vacuum. Maybe it's a bit too naive argument because you can also have other, not just d-brains, principles, you can also have other objects that might carry the same remote charge, for instance, as a d-brain. And indeed, these matter probably, but this is just an idea, not naive idea. So the suggestion would be that sort of for sufficiently many stacked d-brains, this. For sufficiently many stacked D-brains, this abstraction can also be detected by a non-vanishing cobaltism group. Hey, could I ask a question? Quick question. So, the omega spin that you're having here are supposed to be the same ones that would be used for space-time topological charges? Yes. So, you're identifying the two of them. It's just a heuristic argument. I'm not literally identifying. I know a certain place where I probably can identify it. This is for the D7 brains, where we know that if you. Where we know that if you're stacking the seven brains or PQ7 brains, that you literally get a back reactor P1. And this is precisely the general robotism group. In general, I would rather think of these other geometric objects that also carry the same or more charge STP. So you're imagining that maybe the two of them are related because stacks of brains can have strong gravitational pack reaction. That's true. For the seven brains, that's definitely the case. And then the two are, I think, are related. Two are, I think, are related. Sorry, but for seven brains, you typically get a P1, while the generator of that Bordesian group is a T2 with periodic spin structure. So these seem like different classes. No, no, I'm not talking about the... No, no, I mean, I'm talking about the brains that carry the same charge, the same, if I gauge the symmetry, which carry the same gauge charge at the corresponding cobalt group. And that would be a D7 brain that is related to omega 2 of spin 7. But that's not. That's not the brain that kills omega. Not the brain that kills omega, that kills omega one spin. That is, but we are not, we are not breaking the symmetry, we are gauging it. So, you have to think about different co-dimensions of brains. We are gauging it. So, the copy of the same one are more fields. Okay, maybe I wait a bit. Thanks. Yeah. I forgot, but maybe I have these formulas here. Okay, so here the codimens were less, but if you would now gauge it, unfortunately, I didn't write it. Unfortunately, I didn't write it like here. I didn't write what this thing is. But here, of course, you would write an object which has the same co-dimension as the dimension of this generator here for the spin. Otherwise, it would be a mismatch of dimensions. So if you want to get it. So, if you want to get, let me see. So, if you want to gauge, what do you want to engage? So, you want to gauge omega 2. So, for omega 2, so this would be a two form, a two form. So, you need here, so you need a one form here. So, you need a one form gauge field. So, which means a zero form potential, a zero form potential. And it's precisely these seven brains that couple magnetically to the zero form potential in type 2b. In type 2b. This is only what I mean. But we're talking about discrete charges here, right? So we are talking about, yeah, discrete charges. I mean, stacks of brains. For instance, engaging the charge in omega 2 would mean that you're not allowed to compactify the theory on a supersymmetric T2. Right? You would need to introduce a defect. And that's not the case in useful string theories, right? I mean, the defects usually of a codiment. The defects usually of a codimension one less, this I would use to break the symmetry and not to gauge it. Yeah, okay, maybe we can talk later. Yeah, maybe we can talk later. I think other people were also confused by that, but for me to add this for the ETR, but okay. It's just the counting of dimensions. Maybe you see it when I have more examples, when I show you examples. More examples, then I'll show you examples. Maybe then it's more obvious. Okay, so I think I have to urry up, probably. Uh, so this was my argument that the two should be related, and now comes the mathematical theorem. And indeed, this goes under the name of Atiya Bot-Shapiro, homomorphism. Indeed, what these people argued, I mean, I'm still learning, so I'm also not an expert on all this deep mathematics, but they managed to formulate a precise relation among the cobordism groups and the corresponding k-theory groups. And they say there exists a ring homomorphism, the Atiya-Botshapiro homomorphism, that maps, for instance, the Koboisen groups with spin C structure into the ordinary K-theory groups, unitary ones, and the spin and the Kubolism group with spin structure into the orthogonal K-theory groups. So these we associate usually with the type one string, and these we usually associate with the type. This we usually associate with the type 2 to B string or with maybe F theory. Yeah, and this map is given when we restrict it to fixed grade. It's given by the TOT by the TOT class of the manifold here. And an explicit definition of this map is also known in this case for spin. This is for spin C, and for spin, it's given by a generalization of the Roof genus. So this is precisely known. The mathematicians know what is, it's topological invariance, and by default, of course, these are. And by default, of course, these are also cobodism invariants. Otherwise, it wouldn't work. And this has been generalized by Hopkins and Horvey. First of all, to even allow, so to say, to define more and more general objects, we know, for instance, for K-theory that you also define not just the K-groups on Sn, but also on more general manifolds like K3 or Calabriau. So you have an argument here. So, you have an argument here, and you can also define cobaltism groups, which also allow you an extra second argument x here, where our former definition can be recovered by choosing x to be a point. So this theorem, okay, so then you find, okay, if you're now sorry, forget. So, okay, so this is just a homomorphism. So, this is reflecting the fact that here we often have more factors. Have more factors than we see here, but they're still the same groups. So we can just divide by the kernel, and then we have an isomorphism. And this, even this isomorphism has been generalized by Hopkins and Horvey, and it's a generalization of a classic theorem from the 60s by Connor and Floyd that allow you also to put this extra label X here, that you're also working on fixed manifold. And the corresponding cobaltism groups are defined now not just as being manifold. No, not just as being manifolds that are cool equivalent, but it's a manifold together with a map to the fixed space. So you have you choose your fixed space X, and then you look at equivalence classes of manifolds together with a map from M to X that are equivalent if you can find a one-dimension higher manifold that connects two of these guys. And also, of course, the restriction of this map H on M gives you F and the. On M gives you F, and the restriction of H on M gives G. So it's a more general class of equivalence classes. And now the whole construction also depends on X. And this isomorphism even extends to this case. And this has not been exploited so far, exploited in string theory literature. So this would be interesting to do. And we're also not doing it. I just wanted to mention that. Okay, so now let me explain what I mean by gauging. So we discussed gauging. So, we discussed gauging and not so much the breaking of the symmetry. So, I give you a very concrete example. So, the way I want to make a point: consider the type 1 string. So, the d-brains in the type 1 string are classified by the orthogonal k-theory classes. And clearly, I mean, if we have n equals 0 mod4, so then we are talking about d9, d5, and d1 break. And D1 brains. These clearly correspond to the usual DP brains that we have in the type 1 string. And then we have an associated P-form gauge symmetry here, the Cp plus 1 form. Thus we expect, of course, also the corresponding cobalism groups, not to be broken, but to be gauged. So the question now is, can one do the gauging with as little input as possible from string theory? So like in a bottom-up approach. And here I would like to discuss just the pedagogical. Would like to discuss just a pedagogical example where I consider now the isomorphism of the K-theory group KO4. So I'm looking with n equal to 4 here. So I'm talking about D5 brains now and the isomorphisms to omega 4 spin. And the form that is gauged here is the C6 form. This is we know. So I'm saying that because there is this isomorphism, it's natural to assume It's natural to assume that the six-form couples to both defects classified by here, this happened to be the five brains, as well as backgrounds that are classified by omega four spin. So we want to gauge omega four spin. So this is z valued. We know the generator is k3. Okay, of course, in computing, that just is naive. Starting Kubotism, there were no p-forms. Clearly, and then there exists a C-valued obstruction. This is what we detect here, signaling that K3 is not a topological consistent solution here. And this is indeed what we know. And so due to the ABS map, the natural candidate for the global current is in this case just alpha 4. So it's just the Kubolism invariant. It's just the object that gives the map from the Kubolis. from the from k from uh from the kubozin groups to k-theory so this is the this is actually the the only um um kubolism invariant that exists in this case okay so so we gauge it now i might have okay now this is sorry this is the current this is the this is the z-value current here and now we gauge it by introducing um by introducing a two-form gauge field that has a That has a three-form field strength so that df3 can be equal to j4. And the right-hand side can also be written as the Point to Yagen class if I want. This is the same example that was, by the way, also discussed in the paper by McNamara and Waffa. Okay, so we are led now to consider gauge cobaltism groups. Forget about the brains for the moment. They are not there yet. So we have introduced gauge fields. So we should rather compute the total. So, we should rather compute. So, to trivialize the cobaltism group, we should compute this cobaltism group. So, with structure spin and with this extra gauge field. And of course, we have to tell the mathematicians that we have this Bianchi identity. And to do this, this means, of course, if I integrate it, that P1 is trivial. So, I have to compute this thing with the constraint that we only allow spinning manifolds that have vanishing points. Allow spinning manifolds that have vanishing points, the eigen class. And luckily, such a thing has been considered already by the mathematicians, and these are called string cobordism groups. This is precisely the definition of the string cobordism groups, and they have also been computed. And they are also listed in the paper by Magnamara and Wafa. So here's the list. So the good thing, as you first see, so the thing, as we said, so if we impose this constraint here, if we gauge it, the If we gauge it, the former Z obstruction is gone. So we have a zero now at the entry four. But note, this is highlighted it in red. There's now there's a change. So these are the same as we had before, but here's a change. So now instead of a contribution here, we have a contribution here at n equal three. You have a Z twenty-four, if it happens to exist here. And the generator is just an S3 threaded by some three-form flux. A threaded by some three-form flux. Well, here I should better say F3-form flux. So, this is usually often done in the heterotic string here. Okay, this is what we sort of expected. And we get another obstruction here. Come back later. Okay, now I add brains. Okay, so I can do more in the gauging. Okay, first of all, okay, now we have indeed co-killed as I told you already, the initial global symmetry that was recited. Initial global symmetry that was residing in here. Because now, with this extension by gauging, we find that this is zero. But we did it sort of in a very brutal way by just restricting to manifolds that have satisfied VBR and P identity. And now we add five brands. So we think we can add five brands because we have this nice map. This could be seen as an argument, a mathematical argument, not using string theory, so to say, that we also have defects that are charged under the same gauge field. Under the same gauge field, because we have a map of the K-theory group, the relation of the K-theory group and the Kubolism group. So we introduce D5 brains. And the D5 brains, if you now do the counting, are coupled to the same Z2 form, as you can see from here, right? So a D5 brain is described, so a localized D5 brain, so it's localized in four dimensions. So I describe the charge. I describe the charge as this delta four log supported on the six-dimensional five-point. So this is a four-form. So it has the same degree as the thing that we are trying to gauge from the cobaltism group. This is why these belong together. This is what Miguel was asking about. And in general, there could be, of course, also antibrains. And of course, we don't know a priori what is the relative normalization between the two. We don't know. So I introduced the F. Now, yeah, so I introduced here a factor k we could fix it by spring theory. In string theory, you're saying this would k is 24. Yeah, so this relative normalization is 24, and then you would have the usual tadpole cancellation condition for d5 brains on a K3 manifold. Very familiar, I think. In type 1 string, in the type 1 string. Okay, now we could define, we're not doing it in mathematically precise. not doing it in a mathematically precise way, but it's natural now to define similar as before by adding, so to say, to the structure that we allow also the d5 brains here. So we gauge it, we have spin, and we add the d5 brains and we impose the trivialization of this Bianchi identity. So we require that the integral over the left-hand side is zero, which gives us a certain relation between the number of brains and the first point-year class of the manifold. This is what we mean. Of the manifold, this is what we mean by this, even though we have not redefined it in a probably mathematically precise way. We also don't know how to compute them, we didn't compute it. But this should now lead to the trivialization of both the global symmetries that reside from the cobodism group, which is a factor of Z. But of course, the brains themselves, they also have an alternative K-theory group, so they also carry a Z V. So they also carry a z-valued global symmetry. So I have two global symmetries now in the game: the one from the cobordisms and the one from the k-theory. And as I said, so I can, of course, I can, with this tadpole, I can say one unit from here, I can map to k units of here. So I can exchange a unit of from the cobolisms to k units of brains. And the other way around. But what I can't do, I can't exchange. I can't exchange one brain here for a contribution from the cobaltism. This I can't do if k is larger than two. If k is larger than one. So I can only do this in packages of k. So what this means is that the zk global symmetry is still not broken. Sorry, still not broken by this condition. This is still left as a global symmetry. This is what we think, at least. Think at least. So we will have a map. But if you now look precisely how this map acts, a global ZK symmetry is not co-killed. Okay. So let me just see what I had here. So what I could do now, one way of saying it, so I could associate sort of also a co-bodism class of the defect brain. This is nothing else by definition than the K-theory group. And I could ask what is the fate of this discrete global ZK symmetry that still survives here. And there's a good candidate for this because in this intermediate step, I found precisely this group omega 3 when I only gauge it, but not thinking about the brains that are present. If I only gauge it without the brains, I found this Z to the 24 factor. And this Z24 is precisely the same as. Precisely the same as. So, if I choose K to be 24, I have the same groups here, and they could just pair up, so to say, and give this breaking of this coupordism group. So these leftover Z24 global symmetry coming from the D5 band that I cannot switch, so to say, cannot trade against a contribution from the cobaltism group. These have just then the right dimensions. Dimensions, so to say, in order to break the global symmetry coming from this k-theory group. So if you now turn the logic around, so we think we propose that the existence of the Z24, this intermediate Kubolism group, allows you to fix this number K, the relative normalization in the tapo cancellation condition without relying, without using. Condition without relying without using string theory. So, the cobaltism groups themselves know about it if you interpret it correctly. So, in summary, turning the logic around, we propose that omega 3 spin u1. So, this is the string, the string co-boys and groups, determines the relative normalization and the tempo cancellation condition. And this is just a known value from string theory. A K3 carries the charge of twenty-fourty-five brains, and we think that this is not an accident. Brains, and we think that this is not an accident. And of course, I should say, so we're doing bottom-up, so we have to find the rules how we interpret all these non-trivial Kubodism groups. I think it's not that it's completely clear how to interpret them. So we start somewhere. We have this idea of the Kubodism conjecture. And now from here, from this perspective, we have to build up and try to build up again the full string theory and eventually arrive at what we call the quantum gravity structure. The quantum gravity structure that has to be eventually. So, we are proposing here steps, starting somewhere, steps towards approaching the convolution groups of the full quantum gravity theory. And this is consistent with the string lamppost principle. So we derived it. We gave an argument why we should think that you could derive this factor of 24 just from cobordisms without relying on string theory. And then string theory, of course, satisfies it. So this is consistent with a string lamp post principle. system with a string lamp post principle okay so this was just a trivial not this was just a simple example and then we were looking at other cases in particular um the spin c groups and here the upshot is that this have a nice relation to f theory okay so let me just quickly go through that so this prototypical example so it's a prototypical example um let me say Um, let me say, okay, this example that we discussed generalizes now also to F-theory. So, in this case, all K-theory classes, all the odd ones, were zero, so all the even ones are equal to z and are gauged. This is what we know. We have all the variable Ramor-Ramor forms present in type IIB. And the todd classes, as being the invariants, are the natural currents as candidates for the global currents. Well, of course, here new issues appear related to the proliferance of Z factors in the higher cobordism classes. I'll come to that in a moment. Okay, so as a simplest example is to look at omega 2, the structure spin C. So if you write down the Tadbo cancellation condition for that, so this is equivalent to the K-theory groups of D7 brains, sorry. And this is precisely, if you now look at the generator of all. If you now look at the generator of omega 2 spin C, this was P1. So this gives you precisely the usual F-theory relation. Yeah, where this is the cobaltism invariant. So in some sense, the cobaltism invariants seem to know about this nice F-theory way of cancelling tadpoles, if you want. Of course, here the interpretation is really like the back reaction that I was mentioning. So here you could think of the P1 as the back reaction of 24 PQ7 grains. This is we know. Q7 brains. This is we know now. This is the usual argument for F theory. And so if we generalize our argument about this factor K24 that also appears here, we should compute something like omega 1 spin C with the gauged zero form. And this should be equal to C24. We didn't check that. We didn't know how to compute this. This is just a proposal. Now, if we are correct, then this should be the case. So if somebody knows the means how to compute things. Somebody knows the means how to compute such things would be very nice. Okay, this continues. So let's look, for instance, at omega 6. Here we have D3 brains. Of course, we know in F-theory, I mean, there is also a D3-brain type of cancellation condition. So this tells you that the number of D3 brains is given by the Euler characteristic of the Calavier fourfold. And if you split this up into contributions from the base and the fiber, so you find this relation here, this is well known. This relation here, this is well known, and here we realize: okay, so this would be the TOT class. The first factor is precisely the TOT class. So we get an extra contribution from the second generator of the second generator of this class. We had the todd class and C1 to the third. Note that we don't have C3. C3. We don't have C3. C3 is not a co-border invariant. Yeah, so we don't have C3. And nicely, Z3 also doesn't appear here. So it's precisely the two cobordism invariants that appear here. Again, I think we think that is not an accident. And so why is that happening? So we think that this is related to the fact that actually here we are dealing with seven brains that are read. We are doing F-theory. So we have seven brains and that these seven brains induce the curvature of the base. The curvature of the base at D3 treadbow. So we don't have a pure model of just D3 planes or all three planes. If you would have had such a model, we think that this term would be gone. So we think that the appearance of the tot class, that only the tot class appears, is precisely for the case of the bad reacted pure O3 planes in this case. But since we have also O7 and the wrapping factor, we think that this might be the reason why these two factors appear here. It's just an interpretation here. It's just an interpretation. Of course, we don't know for sure. We just want to interpret and learn from the co-borders and conjecture what does it tell us? What kind of information does it contain? So in the paper, we have considered many more examples, a couple more, just mentioning one. If you give me two more minutes, Robert. So we have considered also the breaking of symmetries, and here in particular, in the type 1 setting, we have this omega spin equal to Z2. To Z2 with a generator in S1 with periodic fermions. Of course, here, I know in the paper by McNamara and Wafa, this was proposed. They did it in the type 2B setup, and then they argued that this is cancelled by 07 planes. Of course, here we would have interesting new candidates for that. And in 07 planes, in the type 1 string is always strange because we have already 09 planes. Or nine planes. So, the natural candidate here would be the non-BPSD7 brains that we have in type 1. So, we again only proposed that in the type 1 picture, so that this omega 1, this generoid, just can be broken by the presence of a defect at the end here by non-BPSD7 brain. But for this to be true, one should have that the boundary. Should have that the boundary of this hemisphere. So, the boundary of the hemisphere by itself is, of course, is not this one, it's S1 with antipyriotic boundary conditions. So, we need that by adding this D7 head brain, that really changes this behavior and makes that the boundary of the full right-hand side is really the periodic S1. So, in other words, the presence of the non-BPSD7 grain should change the spin structure of the fermion when transported around the S1. Transported around the S1. Unfortunately, we were not able to show that or to find it in the literature, but our proposal would be correct if this could be shown. This is still an open-end now argument. But it would be nice. It would be very natural. Okay, so let me conclude. So it's a difficult topic, I understand. And we are still in the infancy of understanding what's going on, but I think there is a very deep relation going on here. And I think Relation going on here. And I think that, roughly speaking, what K-theory was for the brains, the co-bordisms are for string backgrounds, closed string backgrounds. They play a similar role and they actually belong together. Okay, so the correspondence of K-the-Kuberism classes provides the mathematic to approach eventually a vanishing Koopalism group in quantum gravity. We have to start with things that we can compute or the mathematicians have computed. Mathematicians have computed. So we start from a bottom-up perspective and just start with geometric cobaltism groups because these are the ones that can be computed. And I told you that the cancellation of initially global symmetries can occur via gauging and breaking, including defect brains. I argued that at least for D-brains, of course, there might be other defects, but for the D-brains, the K-theory classes could be thought of as the co-bodism glasses of the defects. And that the gauging And that the gauging leads to the tetball cancellation conditions. At least some of them look very familiar to us from our Orientifold in F-theory constructions. I agree there are still many open questions. For instance, we don't know yet what is the correct generalization to type 2A and M-theory. So what I discussed is just type 2B or F-theory and type 1. We don't know to explicitly compute these classes that naturally occur, like when we have a gauging and also introduce defects at the same time. Also, introduce defects at the same time. And it would be nice. So, I only showed you one piece maybe of information that can be read off from a non-vanishing cobaltism group, this factor 24 and the tadpole cancellation condition. So, can this be generalized? So, can we really just start with cobaltism at some end and then build up full topological information that is contained in the 10-dimensional or 11 or 12-dimensional, and if you think about F-theory, temporal cancellation conditions. Temporal cancellation conditions. But I warn you, I mean, it's all topological. Of course, we are only talking about topological things, rough topological classifications. That's all we do. I think we're done for the talk. Now we've already overrun for five minutes. So maybe we can just take a couple of urgent and short questions. David? Yes. Thank you very much, Ralph, for the nice talk and nice work. So a quick Nice work. So, a quick question. The Bianke identities that you consider and the way you can solve them involve the somehow the alpha prime corrected part of it, right? So, so these terms you had with the churn classes and so on. I mean, so it's not the standard minus HF for geometric flux or something, it's next order, right? Sorry, what was the answer? Sorry, yes, I think so, yeah. So, explain you So, yeah, so in the right string, you would think that this is alpha prime corrected. Yes, I agree with what you say. Yes. But if this given a topological obstruction, then the topological obstruction is there, I would say. Yes. But can you see the zero for all the terms already? Because somehow you didn't write them. I mean, the H flux contribution. So you want to turn on also non-trivial H flux, so to say, from the very beginning in your background. This is what you're. In your background, this is what you're saying. Yeah. Well, I was wondering actually whether this was precisely your 24 in a sense. I haven't thought about it. So let's say it again. So what do we what you would like to add here? Well minus HF1. Okay. That you mean okay. Okay, so I think David is right. So the the when you have a Bianca identity, what that means is that the gate Identity. What that means is that the K3 kind of thing is the boundary of not just, let's say, a three-sphere, but a three-sphere with Nebuchadnezzar and resource flux, right? So that's the kind of thing. For instance, if you have 12 units of Nebuchadnezzar and resource flux, this is half a K3, which is something that features in a paper with it anyway. I think the value of K that you were having there, Ralph, can have many values. We have string compactifications where it can have value zero. For instance, this happens in the For instance, this happens in the rank one 9D string theories. And if you go to 6D and equals 1 models, I believe it can have many values as well. Like you can have many B fields and there's like green shorts and momentary cancellation. And sometimes the value of K that you get for the trace R squared term can have many values. But for K3, I mean, K3 is the generator here of the Kuboism group, right? So what I'm writing here is. K3 is often not the generator, right? So for instance, in this case, as you So, for instance, in this case, as you were saying, if you have a K3, the generator is actually something like a, it's the generator of the supergravity group, right? But there can often be other, like more, more singular. Okay, for instance, in type 1 string theory, the generator is actually a sphere with one unit of instant, okay? And as you're saying, K3 is coordinated to 24 of those somehow. But that's not the generator. Often not the generator. Often other generators. Sometimes it can be. Okay, so uranium assignment would be the same. So we have the, I mean, in type one, we have the equation, we have the Bianchi identity df3 tilde is equal to trace av h r right plus plot plus yeah, plus extra contributions coming from five brains or from gauge d9 brains. This is the Bianchi identity. Is this the Bianchi identity? Okay, I'm in type one, I'm not in type two B, right? And so this is the trace R Vetch R term. Yes. And this is the contribution from localized D5 brains. So I'm ignoring here gauge flux on D9 brains. This one I don't see.
