So, I guess symplectic topologists will find this talk very boring. And anyway, I would like also to please interrupt me as much as necessary. I don't really know if there is something I should zoom in and explain more. Please, please tell me the ideas that this is useful to some people who don't already know all of this. Okay, so maybe I'll first give some basics on age principles because that's quite useful in all of this. I will talk about flexible construction mostly. So, the idea there is that you will start from some fiber bundle, total space. Total space X projection pi on some manifold B. This is a locally trivial fiber bundle. And if you have some integer, positive integer K, then you have the Kjet bundle associated. So this consists of all Kjet, the total spaces, all K-jets of local sections of Of this bundle X. So, S here is defined on some neighborhood of X up X. This is a Gromov's notation for some neighborhood that can change with time, if necessary. And this is a section, and you look at k jets of this section, meaning you only remember from them their first k derivatives, and this is sort of independent on. And this is sort of independent on having same first k derivative is something that's independent on charts that you might put near x and near s of x in x. Let me know if I have to say more about all this. Otherwise, I just continue. Please, please interrupt me. Okay. And so you have. Sorry. Sorry, X is a point of what? X. Very good. Thank you. X is a point in B. You're right. This is counterintuitive, perhaps. I should use little B, perhaps. Okay. And so, for instance, if you look at the one jet, that's the main thing. That's the main thing we look at. The one jet of a local section, you can think of it as the point X itself in B, its image through the section in X, the fiber over a little X, and the differential of the section at X, okay, which is a map from tangent space to the basis at X. At x to tangent space to s of x at x. Okay. And so if you look at, we'll be interested in sections of this kjet bundle. So that I denote by capital Gamma. And inside the set of all possible sections, you have Sections you have so-called holonomic sections, and holonomic sections of the k-j bundles are sections which are of the type F is everywhere the kjet of some section that I write now. Maybe I should use the same letter as before, little s. Little s. So you have a fixed section now of your bundle X and you look at everywhere at its KJ expansion and you get a global section of the Kjet bundle. That's a so-called holonomic section. Of course, every section is at a point, if you like, if I look at the value of F. Value of F at a point, it will be a kjet at this point of some section, but that depends on this point. Here, the specificity is that it's a unique section for all points. And then also what you what you we are interested now in what's a relation, a relation of order k. Is simply a subset, just a subset of some Xk. And when you have a subset like this, you can now talk about sections of this relation. These are just sections of the k-j bundle. The kz bundle whose value is entirely in the relation. I'll give examples of relation later. I just need this terminology right now. And among these sections here, you have so-called holonomic sections of the relation, which are just holonomic. The holonomic sections of the k-j bundle whose value is entirely in the relation, and then you also have so-called solutions of the relation, and these are just collections of sections. Collection of sections of the initial bundle X such that whose k-jet expansion is a section of the relation, necessarily a holonomic section of the relation. Okay, so you have so these are sections, these are holonomic sections, and these are solutions. And of course, there is a bijection between holonomic sections of Between holonomic sections of R and solutions of the relation, you just from a solution, you take its KJ expansion and you get a holonomic section. And from a holonomic section, you look at only its first order, its zero order part, and you get the solution. Okay. And And so maybe I just now give another definition. So you say that a relation satisfies the H principle if any form. Any formal solution can be different among formal solutions. So, Fs for formal solution into the k-jet expansion of a genuine solution can be deformed so among formal solutions. Formal solution to a holonomic section of okay, so that's the that's the so-called H principle and the parametric. So this is so maybe I can make some kind of Can make some kind of stupid potato-like picture where you have a so I have the sections of the relation, I have the holonomic sections of the relations. I draw purposedly a few connected components, so whenever I start from some section here, I can always deform it. Here, I can always deform it. I can find a path. It means finding a path of solutions to a holonomic section. And so you say that this version of the H principle, it tells you that whenever you are in a connected component, a path-connected component of the space of the space of of um of uh you have you you of um sorry whenever you have a um a uh a formal solution it can be formed here and it's it's that tells you that on the level of connected component the inclusion here of the space of holonomic section is uh is a subjective map right so whenever you have a connected component of solution of sections you have in fact Sections, you have in fact it contains a connected component of holonomic sections. Okay. Excuse me, I missed what a formal solution is. Formal solution. Yeah, maybe I didn't. Formal solution is a section of the relation. I should give examples very soon, I feel. I should have maybe started from. I should have maybe started from examples. Okay, let me finish this definition. And you say that it satisfies the each principle. You have also the idea of satisfying the parametric each principle. And if here, what you have is that you have this. That you have this bijection now, you have a if you have a bijection between the connected components of holonomic sections and ordinary sections or formal solutions, and then you have this is a bijection. And then you also have for each and for each connected or for corresponding connected components right now they are in bijection you have bijections between The homotopy groups So we also say this another way to say this is that this inclusion from holonomic section to section is a weak homotopy equivalence, or in fact it's a homotopy equivalence. Okay, so that's so okay. I should really go into examples. So historically, the first examples were the relation of immersions or submersions. And here, what you look at is so you look at one jets of, in fact, functions. So, or you can think of them as sorry. Sorry, so here f is defined on some open neighborhood of x in some manifold, say m and goes to another manifold n. So if you like to come, the bundle here behind is m cross n projection onto the first factor m. The first factor m. So you look at the first jet of such function and you require the differential of this function, which is a map from tangent bundle at x to m to tangent bundle at f of x to n to be either injective for immersions or surjective for submersions. You could also require that it has a minimal rank. You fix maybe some integer and you require that it has a minimal rank. I'll explain why I look at minimal rank and not fixed rank in a second. So this is the initial thing. So if you like here, a genuine solution, a solution is an immersion. A solution is an immersion or a submersion from M to N and the formal solution. This is rather a bundle map from T M to T N. So this is, it covers some smooth map from M to N. You have no clue of what this smooth map is. Could be even constant if it suits you. But what you need is that it's fiber-wise injected. That it's fiber-wise, injective, or subjective. And so, the H principle, if it holds, it will tell you that whenever you have something like this, you can deform it among fiber-wise injective or surjective bundle maps. Subjective bundle maps to the differential of an immersion or a submersion. That maybe clarifies a bit all the definitions. Something that's more interesting for us is the relation, the symplectic relation. So I should say the exact symplectic relation. This is a relation whose solutions are exactly. Is a relation whose solutions are exact symplectic structure. You could also, if you prefer, you could also look at symplectic structure in a fixed cohomology class, but let's define this. So, here what you will look at is one jet of one force on my ambient manifold M. So, I look at the cotentative. So I look at the cotangent bundle, I look at one jet of local one forms, and I require that the differential of this one form at X is non-degenerate. It's a two-form on the tangent bundle to M at X, and you require that, if you like, it induces. It's as in the previous, as Kevin stoke, it's a non-degenerate two-form, and this is you can, of course, the differential here of alpha is, of course, contained in the information of the first jet, because the first jet, you know, all the derivative, the partial derivatives of alpha. And here, this is the skew symmetrization of all the partial derivatives. So, this makes sense. And here, again, what you have is that a solution. Will be an exact symplectic form on your manifold. Of course, you need your manifold to be even-dimensional, otherwise, this can never happen. Otherwise, this is empty. Okay. And a formal solution. You can, in a sense, formal solution corresponds to non-degenerate, global non-degenerate two-form. Not necessarily closed in. When you have a global solution, you sort of project the first order part. The first order part, you skew symmetrize it and you obtain a non-degenerate two form. And this is the same. This is equivalent. So this is not a really one-one correspondence, this double arrow here. It's in a vague sense. And this also corresponds to almost complex structure on the tangent band of N. Okay. And so here, if it satisfies this, the H principle is satisfied, it would mean that whenever you have a non-degenerate two form, you can deform it into an exact symplectic form. And so, of course, this cannot happen on closed manifold. That's why usually you, but it always happens on. But it always happens on open manifold, as we've seen. And there is another relation that's interesting for us. It's the relation contact, the contact relation. And this is a bit similar, same flavor. You look at one jets, sorry, one jets of local one forms. On your manifold, this manifold is odd-dimensional. Odd dimensional and you require alpha at x exterior with d alpha at x to the maximal possible power that this should be a volume form on Txm. So, in particular, it means that the dimension of the manifold is 2n plus 1. 2n plus 1 and again it's it's it's again you have a solution is a contact contact form and a formal solution you can you can think again of a formal solution You can think again of a formal solution a bit in the same way. You skew symmetrize the first derivative of alpha as a per alpha with a two form, beta. There are some questions? No? And such that alpha which beta to the power n is a volume form on m. Okay, this is here. I'm talking about co-iented contact forms, co-oriented formal solutions. And of course, if beta is by any chance the differential of alpha, then you have a genuine contact form. But in general, the idea is that you try to deform this. That you try to deform this to get some pair like this, such that beta will be the differential of alpha. So the idea of, you know, when you have a formal solution, it's really something that's in the realm of topology, while a genuine solution, you are in global analysis. You need some differential equation somehow that has to be solved. And so Gromov's H there is a the first H principle is Gromov. This is basically his thesis, but there is a whole, he wrote, of course, this whole book, Partial Differential Relation Devoted to H principle. But he proved that whenever you have a relation of a certain type, Relation of a certain type, it satisfies the parametric H principle. And the certain time is it should be open and it should be invariant. So I'll explain. Satisfies the parametric H principle provided it is on an open manifold. So open manifold means each connected component is either non-compact or compact but with a non-empty boundary. So that's So that's a crucial, crucial hypothesis. But any manifold minus a point is, any connected manifold minus a point is an open manifold, for instance. So open means that it's this just means that it's an open subset. So as a subset. Of the manifold xk, it should be an open subset, and you can check that all the previous relations here were open, in fact, because being a being an immersion or submersion is an open condition here. Being injective or surjective, if it's true for a jet, it's true for any jet sufficiently close. Any jet sufficiently close to itself. Same thing for the symplectic relation. Here, you require that this is non-degenerate. This is the smart thing, that you define it on one form and not on two forms. And here again, being a volume form will remain true for sufficiently small, sufficiently close one tenths. One jet. And then invariant, this is invariance. So meaning that any relation that's defined in a natural way somehow will be invariant. Here, the idea is that any isotopy of the base. Of the basis. So, here I'm sorry, there is a discrepancy between my B. I should have called my B before M perhaps, but any isotopy of B. So an isotopy of B is just a smooth family of diffeomorphisms of B which starts at the identity. The identity and this will lift to an isotopy of X, right? So you have some kind of commutative diagram. I have phi T bar perhaps from X to X that projects onto phi T from B to B. To be and you want the main thing is that you want that if the isotopy is stationary on some open set, means that some open set is not is the isotopy is just fixed, is the identity, then the lift has the same property. Okay, that's a very important thing. And when you have a lift like this, you can also lift to the kjet bundle. So maybe I should write this like this. So, maybe I should write this like this. Right. And you want that this lift here preserves, maps the relation into itself. And this is basically the case everywhere here. Whenever you have a natural action here, if you have an isotopy of the If you have an isotopy of the source manifold M here, you can lift it to the bundle M cross N, which is the underlying bundle here, just the identity on M and it will preserve being injective or surjective because it amounts to pre-composing the differential with the differential of. Differential with the differential of the isotopy. So being injective or surjective is preserved. Here, same thing: you can pull back one forms and you know that the differential and the pullback commute. So being non-degenerate will be preserved. Same thing here. Okay, so all these relations that I described before are open and invariant. Are open and invariant. And so they satisfy the parametric H principle, provided you have an open manifold, which is the crucial hypothesis. And when it's not open, it's a lot more complicated. Okay. Are there questions or comments? Nothing. Okay, so maybe I'll go to the next thing I wanted to talk about is the age principle for contact structures. So of course you have a H principle for contact structures on open manifold, but this is an H principle for contact structure on closed manifold. Structure on closed manifold, which is due to Borman, Eliasberg, and Murphy. And so having defined what's a compact structure, so I have a 2n plus 1 dimensional manifold. I have, say, hyperplane distribution. I suppose it's defined as the kernel of a one form. You don't need that. It can be locally defined like this only. It does not need to be co-orientable. But anyway, locally, it's always the case and you require alpha, which the exterior power, the exterior derivative of alpha to the maximal possible power, and this should be non-vanishing. So and V for non-vanishing and uh maybe I can give some some examples So in dimension three you have there is a first so So I will use both x, y, z Cartesian coordinates and r theta z cylindrical coordinates to describe this contact structure. And the first one, which is maybe the standard, well, it's a standard contact structure. I guess there are several standard contact structures, but. contact structure but alpha is dz plus r square d theta this is the same as dz plus one half x dy minus y dx this is the the standard Louisville form on on R two. Lu will form on R2. And then you have another so-called over-twisted structure, I'll explain, which is in cylindrical coordinates, it's cos R dz plus R sin R d theta. Okay. So I it will be. So it will be a bit hard for me to draw this like this, but let me draw. This is the this is a sort of disc, maybe disk of radius, the two disc in R3, z equals zero of radius pi centered at the origin. So this is. Centered at the origin, so this is the origin. So, both contact structures are dz at the origin. So, you have the horizontal, the contact distribution is the horizontal, and both contain the vector d over dr. They are sort of radial, like this, but then they rotate around radial directions. Radial direction. So that's what you see here. What happens is that when you move, when R increases, then you increase the component, the Z component. So you have the vector D over D theta, which is like this. And these, here is the z-axis. And what you see is that you rotate the distribution around as you move in this direction, you start rotating this distribution. So I don't know what have I written. Oh, it's negative. Okay, so I guess I should with this. I don't know if I can draw this. Let me try or maybe not try. Or maybe not try. So it's supposed to do something like this as you move along. But what you see is that they both do this somehow, in fact. But what you see here, sorry, this is not what I meant to do. What you see here is that you move and you rotate and you'll never be completely vertical in this. Completely vertical in this picture, you'll rotate and you're vertical at infinity somehow. While in this one, what you see is that you rotate quite fast. So here, when R gets to when R increases until pi, at pi, what you have is minus one here and zero. So you again get dz equals zero. So you again get the horizontal. Horizontal plane here. So that's for the other one. You rotate much fast. Maybe this one. Maybe you rotate much faster. And at some point you get really vertical. I don't know how to really, well, this is. And you get back to horizontal as you reach here radius pi. Okay. And when you have a disk like this, for which, so it means that this disk here, d2 pi, has this property that it is tangent to the contact structure at the point of its boundary. So psi over twisted, which is the kernel of this alpha. Alpha over twisted is at a point Z here is equal to the tangent space to this disk for all Z in the boundary of this disk. Of this disc. Okay. And such a disk is called an over-twisted disk. And this xi over twist. Disc ψ overtwisted is an overtwisted contact structure because it has an over-twisted disk. And when there is no over-twisted disk, you say that the contact structure is tight. And the standard contact structure is tight. This is a result. This is a result of Bennekin, it's not an obvious result at all. And so, tight structure, they, of course, to be a compact structure, it really means that the distribution is highly non-integrable. In particular, you can easily show with this condition here that you have no leave to this distribution except in dimension n, the largest possible. Dimension n, the largest possible dimension for leaves, meaning leaves in the general sense of sub-manifold whose tangent space is entirely in the distribution is n. Okay, so in dimension three, it's one. And here you see indeed you have leaves. These are these radial directions. Here are leaves of your contact structures. You have plenty of one-dimensional leaf. That's not the problem. But you see that here around a leaf, the Here around a leaf, the contact structure is forced to rotate. That's how it's sort of torn apart potential candidates, leaves. And when it's tight, it rotates very, very slowly. And when it's over twisted, it rotates quite fast. Okay, that's the maybe very rough interpretation. And so, so So, the existence of compact structure, it was proven in dimension three. It was proven in the 70s by Martine and Lutz that you can always construct contact structures on three-dimensional manifolds. And then Benekin noticed that you have two types of He noticed that at least the H principle fails on S3, meaning in the sense that the parametric H principle fails on S3, in the sense that you can have two contact structures which are formally homotopic, but not genuinely homotopic. And maybe there is an observation that I should make that this is quite important that for contact structures on closed manifold being Homotopic. So you have a family of contact structures joining the two contact structures you're interested in implies that they are in fact isotopic or contactomorphic, diffeomorphic, if you like. So you can find an isotopy of your ambient manifold that brings one contact structure. Manifold that brings one contact structures to the any of these contact structures to the initial one. And this is this is Gray's theorem. This is some Moser theorem for contact structures so the theorem. So the theorem that Broman, Elias Locke and Murphy proved, I think in 14 or probably before, but is that if you have any odd-dimensional manifold And you have a they even proved something even more than the parametric H principle. They proved some relative and parametric H principle. So you are given also a closed subset, just a closed subset of M and you are given a formal A formal contact structure, I suppose, co-orientable, but you don't need this formal contact structure on M and you assume it's genuine. So meaning beta is d alpha on some neighborhood of A. Some neighborhood of A Then you can assume that this formal contact structure is homotopic among formal contact structures to a genuine. Genuine contact structures. And you even have homotopy to a genuine contact structure and relative to A, meaning that the homotopy is just stationary on a neighborhood of A. And you have, you even have. And you have you even have a so that's that's one thing um and if you know if you restrict to the the to to over twisted compact structures you even have a full H principle so meaning parametric and relative and for this you need to extend the definition of of what's an over twisted Of what's an over-twisted convex structure. Here I gave a definition that's very three-dimensional. You have this two-disc, and the boundary here is the tension space to the two-disc is equal to the contact structure on the boundary. And in higher dimension, it was for a long time, it was not clear how you extend this notion to higher dimension. To higher dimension. And but it was done by in this paper and it was later discovered also that there are many ways to characterize this notion of overtwisted in higher dimension. And maybe I'll just state the simplest possible simplest to understand version. Version. So you will say that contact manifold M ψ is over twisted if it admits an overtwisted model and maybe Over-twisted model means an embedding of a in fact of a product of an over-twisted tool disk with a large symplectic with a large symplectic even dimensional. Symplectic even-dimensional disk. So it's really this. So you have an open neighborhood of D2, maybe D2 pi, open neighborhood in R3 here, cross some disk of dimension two and minus two and of large radius. Large radius. Difficulty is that we don't know how large it, but there is a minimal of radius. And there you put the kernel of the over-twisted contact structure that I defined previously. And you add standard Liuville form. So this is the one half of sum over I Xi D Yi minus Yi dxi standard unit form on R to n minus two. So this is from one to n minus one. An embedding you want an embedded. An embedding, you want an embedding of this into an xi, meaning a contact embedding, right? I want the push forward of the contact distribution to be mapped onto xi. This is not the first, there was another, there was a previous definition by Nieder Kruger of plastic Stuffer, which is Which is a different thing. There are definitions in terms of loose gendre knots or open book decompositions. There are lots of characters of use, very useful geometric characterization of this overtwistedness. And when you have this, when you have this condition, then you have a full, there is a There is a full contact aid principle. Maybe I won't state precisely because I think I'm doing very, oh my God, it's a catastrophe with time. I'm doing extremely poorly with time. So if you restrict to these overtwisted contexts. Contact structure, you have a full H principle and full means parametric, so same homotopy groups of spaces of formal and genuine solution, so parametric and relative. And if you have something already there on some open, on some closed subset, then you can make everything stash in there. And there is even from this full H principle, you also get an H principle on foliated manifolds. If you have a foliated manifold and you have on each leaf And you have on each leaf an almost contact structure, then you can deform this whole structure into a genuine contact foliation, and all leaves will be over-twisted. Okay, so that's just I'm doing half of my talks now. So I wanted to mention also another result of Result of Eliasburg and Murphy, which talks about symplectic cobodisms. Okay. So, what's a symplectic cobordism? So, you have basically a cobordism. So you have basically a cobordism, you have something like this. So you have this is typically denoted by, this is a W, you have a left-hand boundary and a right-hand boundary, D minus and D plus, delta minus and delta plus. And you assume that you have a symplectic structure on this W, and you also assume that this symplectic structure restricted on a neighborhood of the plus boundary is exact. And same thing on the negative. And same thing on the negative boundary. So you have a primitive there. And when you have a primitive, you always have a Louville vector field, which is defined by this relation, z plus or minus omega should be lambda plus minus, right? This is, of course, because omega is non-degenerate, you have a unique solution for z plus minus for any one form. Plus minus for any one form here on the right, and you require this Louville vector field to be everywhere transverse to the boundary, and it should be pointing inward on the left boundary, on del minus, and outward on the right boundary. So this is Z minus and Z plus. And of course, when you have something like When you have something like this, because this z plus minus is transverse to the boundary, it induces a contact structure then. So you have psi plus or minus, which is the kernel of lambda plus or minus, is a contact structure. This is easy to see. Easy to see. Wherever, when you have a Louville vector field, it will induce a contact structure on any hypersurface that's transverse to it. Disease is, in fact, a transversally contact vector field. And, okay. So, there is a you can so you there is a special case of this where you have. Case of this, where you have so this is a symplectic cobordism, you have also the notion of Louville cobordism. That's when omega is globally exact. It's globally exact and induces this and you have the same thing, right? So the global Louville vector field is pointing inward. Is pointing inward on the left and outward on the right, and induces their four contact structures there. And so the theorem tells you that whenever you start from contacts, if you are given here contact structures here, and you have to assume certain things, first of all, you need these two bonds. These two boundary components to be non-empty. That's a very fundamental hypothesis. And if you are given contact structures here and there, and you have to assume that this contact structure is always over twisted. And this one needs to be over twisted only in dimension four, otherwise it can be anything. And you have to assume that you have something like already a formal. like already a formal a formal uh symplectic structure which is a non-degenerate two form and sorry my god um i i i don't know i have these notifications um so you have this non-degenerate two form here and and which is compatible with the whole thing there you can then you can deform this non-degenerate two form into a a loop A Louville, the differential of a Louville form. So this is so you have W of dimension at least for you are given sorry on each bar. On each boundary component, you are given a contact structure, and you are given omega non-degenerate. And you assume that, of course, this omega is compatible. So it's already symplectic near the boundary with Louisville vector field pointing. Louville vector field pointing as it should and induces inducing these contact structures. And you have to assume that, of course, are both non-empty and ψ minus is over twisted. If you didn't need this hypothesis, it would be grand because you could build symplectic structure in many places. So it's a very fundamental. And this psi plus is also over twisted if n is two. And the conclusion is that then you can find a new village. A new will form. So meaning the lambda is a symplectic structure which is compatible with everything and which is in the same homotopy class of whose differential is in the same homotopy class as as As the initial non-regenerated tool for okay, I don't know if there are questions. I guess my time is up, so I haven't talked at all about the construction of locally conformed syntactic structure, but Gael will do that. But it was one hour plus epsilon. I mean, you can use epsilon. So maybe I can state this. State this, or maybe I can answer at least the question, the relation between deforming foliations and having leaf-wise locally conformal symplectic structure. So maybe this is the So maybe this is the H principle for maybe I can state this at least structures so LCS is for locally conformal symplectic and this is due to myself and Gary And here the situation is this: you have a two n-dimensional closed manifold. You have eta is a closed non-exact one form. And you have a non-degenerate two form, and there you can find lambda such that the eta lambda, the twisted the Ramcohomology in the direction of this closed form, is a non-degenerate. Is a non-degenerate two form. So it's a locally conformal symplectic structure, an exact one. In fact, you can choose you can choose the cohomology class in this twisted theorem cohomology. And you can assume, of course, this is homotopic to omega A and so on. So Should I say why it's related to deforming foliations into contact structure? Do you think I have time for that? Yes, okay, great. So observation is this that That suppose you have a you are on an odd-dimensional manifold and you have a codimension one foliation and you assume it's co-orientable. So the tangent distribution is given by the kernel of some non-vanishing one form. So then because it's a the kernel being The kernel being totally completely integrable means that alpha which its differential is zero, it's a zero tree form that's equivalent. And when you write this, this is equivalent to saying that d alpha is eta which alpha for some one form. eta and uh this this this of course this eta is not well defined because alpha you can you can multiply alpha by some non-vanishing function and you get another defining form but eta will will will will then change you add the differential of the logarithm of this or in fact no no no you add the differential Oh, or in fact, no, no, no, you add the differential of this non-vanishing function. So, the cohomology, in fact, you can check that this eta is leafwise closed. And the leafwise cohomology class is, in fact, well defined, independent on the choice of different. Independent on the choice of defining one form. Okay. So that, in fact, in each leaf, you are, you have a closed one form. And so now you're interested in, you would like to, you know, there is this book confoliation by Liashberg and Thurston, and in there, they prove a lot of very nice thing in dimension three. They prove that whenever you have a three-dimensional dimensional closed three-dimensional manifold and you have a codimension two foliation then you can always you're interested in trying to to approximate or deform this foliation into a contact structure and so they prove that you can almost any foliation there is just this exception of s1 plus s2 with foliation by S2 with foliation by by by S2s. Except for that one, you can always approximate, C0 approximate by a contact structure. And they also prove that you can also approximate is just, okay, it's not exactly the same as deforming. Deforming is you would have a path of distribution. And there is a very interesting type of such path. Very interesting type of such path, which are just the linear paths. And for linear paths, they exist under, you need more assumptions on your foliation. Approximate is more flexible. For deforming, you need your foliation to have some enough holonomy. And enough holonomy somehow is enough loops on which this integrate into. integrate into a non-zero thing because this thing is maybe i should explain that the geometric interpretation of this eta is that if you integrate eta along a loop in your leaf so you have a leaf you have a loop here gamma and you integrate eta and you get the logarithm of the whole i hope the sign is right again i i don't know gael if you agree with this Know, Gael, if you agree with this, I think that's correct. You get the logarithm of the linear holonomy of the foliation along this loop. So there is a, so if this, sorry. So if you know that there is a, if I look at the transversal here, this loop induces a germ of diffeomorphism. A germ of diffeomorphism from this transversal to itself, and you look at the derivative of this germ at the point here at, say, zero. And the logarithm is the integral of this one form. So it's really a measure of whether. So when the holonomy is contracting, this integral is negative, and when it's expanding, it's positive. Okay. And when you have enough loops where the integral is non-zero, then you can linearly deform your foliation into a contact structure. That's one thing. And they also prove that when you are sufficient, when your foliation is in addition taut, meaning that there are many characterizations of tautness, but in particular, the simplest topological is that you have 20. That you have through any leaves, you can find a closed transverse loop. So, typically, this excludes having rape components, but not only. And when your foliation is taut, any sufficiently close contact structure will be, in fact, tight. And so, that's why this is this. That's why this type of question is interesting because there is this H principle for the twisted contact structure, but for tight contact structure, it's a lot more rigid and it's not easy to construct tight contact structure. And there are many manifolds on which you have a single tight contact structures, for instance. And the idea is that if you deform somehow, if you... Is that if you deform somehow, if you remember this idea that tightness, you have to rotate along integral curves of your distribution, but very, very slowly. And the idea is that if you deform a foliation and you're sufficiently close to a foliation, that's what you do. You deform your foliation very, very slowly somehow. And so, a way to construct tight contact structure would be through this deformation of foliations, of at least taut foliations. Foliations of at least taut foliation because this intuition is true with taut foliation. And so, the first observation is that indeed in higher dimension, you get something similar. If you have a defining form for your foliation, and you take some one form here, lambda, and you look at this linear deformation, so t is some real parameter here. And this is lambda is a one form, and call this alpha t. And you wonder under which condition this alpha t is a contact form. So you have to investigate this form, d alpha t to the power n, right? My manifold is dimension 2n plus 1. And what you see is that here what you get is basically the first or Order of t is t to the power n, and you get alpha w in fact d eta lambda to the power n plus something of order o of t n plus one. So it means that if this when this thing is non-vanishing, If this thing is non-vanishing, then for sufficiently small, strictly positive t, this thing will be also non-vanishing and then a contact structure. And this being non-vanishing is the same as, because alpha defines the foliation, it's the same as saying that, sorry, I really want to get rid of this. Okay, great. It means that. It means that along the leaves, this thing should be non-vanishing. And this is saying that this is a locally conformal, this d eta lambda itself is a locally conformal symplectic structure along the leaves. Okay. But of course, you don't know if you have a given almost contact, almost all see, okay, sorry. I guess I stop here.
