Take it away. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me to speak and to have this nice conference. And yeah, I'm sorry that from India I could not attend a large number of talks, but whatever I attended, I really enjoyed it. And so let me begin. Let me begin. I hope everyone can hear me and stop me if I miss something. Okay. So I am going to be talking about R module Tom Spectra. It's something which I have been interested for right from my PhD days. And let me just start straight away. So the beginning of the story. The beginning of the story starts from the classical case of Tom spectra, which people have been talking about in this conference. So suppose G is the co-limit of the space of homotopy equivalences of Sn. This of course is the union of components of Q S naught corresponding to maps of degree plus minus one and here. Yeah, so the so that space has a monoid structure, so you can make a classifying space out of it. It's a it's in fact a liquid loop space, and the space BG is the classifying space of spherical figuration. So these are the virtual ones of dimension zero. So the classical tom spectrum functor. Spectrum functor is it goes something like this. You start with the category of spaces over V G and you go to a suitable model for the category of spectra. So this is something which people are talking about throughout this conference. And today I will be talking about this from a slightly different angle. So the Tom spectra. So, the TOM spectra is useful in many respects. So, for my lecture today, the thing which I will be talking about is the usefulness of this functor from the point of view of link structure and structured ring spectrum. So, that is the viewpoint which I will be studying today. So, from that From that viewpoint, one of the properties is that it is shown to preserve homotopy cooling. That comes from the you could even work it out with peer bundles and so on. But another useful fact, which is which I just mentioned in the previous slide, that one of the most useful facts is. One of the most useful facts is that this functor enjoys good multiplicative. So, I think this was carefully proved. The first thing in the literature where it was carefully done is the book of Louis May and Steinberg. What does this mean? So, if I have two spaces over Vg, so we have F from X to V G and G. X to Vg and G from Y to V G and we denote by X cross G the composite X cross Y to V G cross V G to V G using the multiplication of V. And then one has a natural equivalence, the form spectrum of F cross G is equivalent to THF dash T H. So the Louis May Steinberger's book Lewis Space Teinberger's book at that time they don't really have a symmetric monoidal smash product. So the way they prove it is up to a contractable up to a contractable choice. So that's why we have this. But nevertheless, they could talk about O algebras in spectra from their point of view. And the mark just from Mark just from why this is useful in structured ring spectra is because of this fact too that you have a action of the linear isometries operad on the space Bg and if you have a operad which such that you have an operad map from O to L then the TOM spectrum functor carries O spaces over V G so O spaces over V G is defined analogous so you Defined analog. So you think of O. So if you have a operator O which maps to L, you use the linear isometries operate action on Bg to get a O action on Bg. So Bg becomes an O algebra and O spaces over Bg are basically O algebras with an O algebra map from the space to Bg. From the space to B. That's a lot of words, but basically, this is the crux of the matter: is that the Trong spectrum counter carries O spaces over Vg to O algebra spectra. And so if you are in the simplest case, which is the A infinity case, and A infinity spaces over V G can again be related by. Can again be related by equivalence to having a root space over V. That means you have a space which is omega of some y and you have a y to the to v square d and the loops on that is a loop phase over b so as a consequence the torn spectra of loop spaces over b g have an a have a ring Over Bg have an A have a ring structure. And of course, the point number two tells you a larger collection of examples. So as far as I know, I think this is the first way of proving constructing ring spectra, like all the ring spectra, all the ring spectra, like Mu or MO and things like that, they were all proved to be. That they were all proved to be commutative ring spectra using this theorem of Lewis-Neynstein. Or people knew this theorem from before. Okay. So this is our this is the kind of thing which interests. So so another topic which I which I was interested in here is topological Hopshield homology. Topological Hochschield homology, which you can define for any ring spectrum. So the natural definition of topological Hochschield homology is via the cyclic bar construction, which I have put in the slide. So the topological Hochshield homology is the realization of the cyclic bar construction. So very in very short, I can say that the cyclic bar construction is a simplicity. Construction is a simplicial spectrum which sends this bracket K to A mash over. Okay, so there should not be any R here and it's a typo. So because this is the this is just the topological Hoxha homology without any module structure. So later on we will have this module structure. So we will have R here. So for this slide R is the R is the sphere state. So it's just A going through A smash over A plus one time. And the phase maps are induced by the multiplications in A, except so you have to multiply two consecutive factors, except the last phase map where you multiply the last factor and put it in the beginning. And put it in the beginning, so that's why it's called the cyclic bar construction, which gives it the structure of a cyclic state. So, this is the usual definition of Foxhield homology, and the simplicial version gives you the definition of topological coxshield homology for ring spectra. And yeah, and the degeneracy maps are just by input. By inclusion of the unit at various so the observation is that you can define it over any symmetric monoidal category and you could do it for example for topological spaces. So if you have a topological group you can talk about the cyclic market. So it's going to be analogous the symmetric monoidal structure there is Symmetric monoidal structure, there is a product, and you could do the same thing. And there, this cyclic bar construction is homotopy equivalent to the three loop space of Vg. So that's one of the theorems which must prove. You can actually, you can project out the first, you can project out. The first the you can project out the last factor and that would give you a map in map onto Bg and the fiber is equivalent to the loops of Bg and if G is a group it becomes equivalent to G and then you can compare it with the corresponding fibrillation for the PC one can show this well the reason why I'm saying this is that if you saying this is that if you have a symmetric monoidal structure then you are then you can take then you take the symmetric cyclic bar construction to the cyclic bar construction if you have a symmetric monoidal functor between two symmetric monoidal categories and one such functor is the suspension spectrum so it takes the cyclic bar construction to the cyclic bar construction and then it suggests this result Then it suggests this result: CHH of sigma infinity of omega x is equivalent to the CHH of the P loop step. Because if you take the cycling bar construction of omega x, just the couple of lines before would say that that's going to give you the free loop space worker. But of course, But of course, one has to prove this and you have to. So first of all, you realize that just by defining the cyclic bar construction, you don't get something which is homotopy invariant. So you have to look at cofibrant preconditions and you have to check all those verifications and then you can prove this. Okay, so I will just say that. Okay, so now because as I said before, this Tom spectrum is also the Tom spectrum is also good with green structure. So the multiplicative properties of the Tom spectrum will imply that the Tom spectrum. imply that the Tom spectrum would also commute with the cyclic purpose. So the first thing is that if you have a map from y to b square g and you take the loops of the map, then this pH of zeta is a ring system. This is something which I commented before and that comes from the operated action of the spectrum. And the multiplicative properties of the atomic spectrum in The static properties of the Tom spectrum implies that it would relate the cyclic work construction to the cyclic work. So you would get this. And then you can identify the cyclic bar construction with the free loop space. And then you have this equivalence on free loop space. So if you have a free loop space of something which is a topological group. Topological group, then the P-loop space splits as a product, and that's what that's the equivalence over here. So, once you use all that, then you get this theorem of Bloomberg, Cohen, and Schlipky. It says that there is a that the topological Hawkshield homology of a form spectrum of a loop map can again be written. Can again be written as a forms spectrum. And the map corresponding to that is the one which is written below. It's written as L eta of F. So how does that? You take the free loop space of Y and you apply L on the map F. If you apply L on the map F, that gets you to the free loop space of A square G and then you apply the And then you apply the equivalence of the free loop space. So you get B squared G cross Bg and then you go to Bg cross Bg by this map eta comma identity. So what is the map eta? Well eta is like pre-composing with the off map. So eta goes from S3 to S2. And now this B squared is an infinite loop space. So you can write it as Write it as omega 2 B4G and then omega 2 B4G is maps from S2 to P to B4G. And now you can pre-compose with ETA. So you get maps from S3 to B4G and that's Bg. So that's the map ETA. And then you use the multiplication. Then you use some artificial okay. Well, that looks like something there's a lot of things to do, but I think apart from being a very satisfying result, this also is very useful from the point of view of computers. Because see, what you would need to do is suppose you want to calculate THH of something which you which you know is a tom spectrum so what what what would you need to do you you would need to break up this so so it's a tom spectrum as omega h so it's uh so there is a y to p square g and there's a tom spectrum so what would you need to do you would you would want to break up this p loop space of y using homotopy collimates and so on Using homotopy collimates and so on. And then, so if you break it up, if you can break it up into small pieces and whose form spectra you can calculate, perhaps, then using that you can calculate at least the homotopy groups of this form. So, from the point of view of computations, also, this is quite useful. This is quite useful. And later on in this lecture, I will talk about some of the computations and I will tell you how this, what kind of role this thing plays. So the proof of this theorem, you see, as I said in the other equivalence, sigma infinity h h of sigma infinity of omega x, you would have to verify a lot of these cofi. Verify a lot of these ofi-gramc conditions. And what helps. So, in this paper, what they actually do is they use some kind of model for topological spaces, which converts E-infinity spaces to commutative monoids. So, there are ways of doing that. And one such method is given by I-space. Is given by I space. So this proof actually uses a model for toss where commutative monoids correspond to input. That's what I'm that's what I wanted to say. So one such model is given by I space. So that's what I'm going to use in this lecture. So let me just briefly tell what I spaces are. So I is the category whose objects are the Whose objects are the finite set n and the morphisms are the injectiveness. So so you have the so if you take morphisms from n to n you get the symmetric and now this joint union makes i into a symmetric monitorial category and the category of i spaces consists of functors x from i X from I to top this this has a the I equivalences are given like this at a mass from X to Y is called an I equivalence if it induces a weak equivalence on homotopy collimit with respect to I. So the homotopic collimit is written as X H I Now, if you use this disjoint union structure on I, which makes I into a symmetric monoidal category, this induces a symmetric monoidal convolution product on I space given by x box cross y n is the co-limit of n1 disjoint union n2 to n. Joint union n2 to n x n 1 for y n so this this category i this yes so this so this gives you a symmetric monoidal structure on IT okay and Okay, and there is this theorem of Sagave and Shrickfu. So, there are many different model category structures on I spaces. And this is one of so one of the model category structures give you a symmetric monadal spillane equivalence between I spaces and stop. I spaces and top. So on the left, you have co limit and the right you have constant. And this induces a quillan equivalence between commutative I monoids and E infinity space. But for but to really get to commutative I monoids versus E infinity spaces, you need to relate the various other model structures on top. Structures on top I, which I will not go into that discussion, but it's all there in the paper of Sarga Variantship. So let me go ahead. So the next thing is a model of this PG in I spaces is kind of easy to give. You send N to B G. N to V G N, the classifying space of G N and this becomes the commutative one idea because under this joint is here you can make you can look at the can look at the map from G n cross g n to g n plus n so and if you look at the homotopy pole limit b i g limit b i g h i you get back b g up to v g treated as so yeah diagi is the homotopic collimate of the functor b i g and as i said this functor b i g is a commutative i monoid and this induces the And this induces an action of the barrett acclaims of the red on this on this homotopic column, which makes it an infinity. So whenever you have this commutative I monoid and you take the homotopical limit respect to I, you get an action of this. And the trick which makes the argument work is Make the argument work is the so one thing I should say about I spaces is that it's very it's a it's a space which is somehow it's it's a category which somehow built to construct the suspension spectrum into symmetric spectra. So if you think of the symmetric monoidal structure on symmetric spectra, the smash product, it's also defined in an analogous way. In an analogous way, where you have using the symmetry groups, and you take the left-known extension. That very similar to the symmetric Model structure on IC. So it's not a surprise that the symmetric spectra appears here. So we write SP sigma for the category of symmetric spectra. And then the classical Tom's. And then the classic classical TOM spectrum is equivalent to a composite of these two functors. You have a functor T from I spaces over VID to S T sigma. And then there is a functor R, which is different from the one which we had in the previous slide, which goes from topological spaces over to homotopy collimit of BIG to I spaces over. So why I spend Why I spent some time talking about this because it motivates what we will do with our module. So, the trick is for our module, we will have this similar construction of d i g, but their g will be replaced by the units of the of the in of the of the ring spectrum. And other, the rest of the story is. The rest of the story is similar. You can define a T from I spaces over VIG to symmetric spectrum, but if you take values in R module and you have a functor from the topological spaces over Vg to I spaces over VI. So now let me shift my attention to the R module. So let R be a ring spectrum. Then the space of unit is the class has this universal property that homotopy classes of maps from X to G L 1 R is the unit in R0 of X. To define that it's easy, you just have to look at omega infinity of R. omega infinity of r and you look at the components which correspond to the units of pi zero of r you can do that and this gl1 r becomes this homotopy pullback and from here it follows that first of all this gl1r yeah it follows that this pi n of gl1r is the same as pi n The same as pi n of r if n is bigger than 0 and pi 0 of r cross if n is equal to 0. And if you take the sphere spectrum, then this dl1 of the sphere spectrum is same as the space Bg which I was talking. So if R is a R is a spectrum with Is a spectrum with greater multiplicative structure. Some of the multiplicative structure is positive onto G L 1 R. So, if R is a E infinity ring spectrum, then the G L one R becomes an E infinity space. So, I mean, what happens in the in omega infinity r is that it is an E infinity ring space. So, it has two in E infinity structure. So, so the one Structure. So the one coming from the multiplication on R endows an infinity structure on GL1. So you get an unit spectrum, little G L1R whose 0S whose 0S space is GL1R. So this is an analogy to commutative rings because in commutative rings, you have a isomorphism that A isomorphism that if you have a home from G to K cross, it is the same as ring maps from the group ring to K. So you have an analogous adjunction in E infinity ring spectra. There's a homotopy category of E infinity spaces and homotopy category of infinity spectra. This G L1 plays the role of G here and the left adjoint. And the left adjoint is the suspension spectrum function. So you have, so if you take the suspension spectrum of an infinity space X and you take home to a infinity ring spectrum R, homotopy classes of maps, that will be the same as maps, infinity maps from X to G L 1. That's worth. Well, we use it in one case. We use it in one case here in the sense that if I look at the co unit here, co-unit will give me a map from an infinity ring spectrum map from sigma infinity plus dl1r to r and this makes this r a sigma infinity plus dl1r model right. Right, so now the R module Tom spectrum. So, R module Tom Spectra, it appeared in this paper by five authors, Ando, Bloomberg, Kepler, Hopkins, and Red. And it is a functor from topological space over VGL1R to R module and they. And they actually defined it in two different ways. They defined it separately for the case of E infinity objects over BGL1R and separate and also in the general case, but there are two definitions. So if you have an E infinity map from E infinity map to BGL1R, so that map to BGL1R. So that is equivalent to a spectrum over suspension of BL1R. And so what you have to do is you take the homotopy fiber of F and then you have a co-fiber sequence as is written here, GL1R to C to X to suspension G L1. So P is the homotopy fiber of the membrane and the map F goes from X map F goes from X to confidential G L1. So the Tom spectrum of F is defined as the homotopy pushout in the category of E infinity ring spectra of this. So sigma infinity plus G L 1 R to R, which we have from that junction that's an infinity map. Then you have this because G L 1 R to P that is the map of spectra. So if A map of spectra. So if go, if you apply omega infinity and then use sigma infinity plus, that gives you a map of E infinity spectra. So it's a homotopy push out in the category of infinity spectra. And we know the formula for this. This is nothing but the derived mesh product as moduled over sigma infinity plus L1R. So the Tom spectrum here is sigma infinity plus. is sigma infinity plus omega infinity p derived smash product that's why the l come over sigma infinity plus l1 r r and this actually motivates the next definition which works for general for the general case so the difference in the general case is that you you want to take so then you don't have an e infinity map so you will only have a map map so you will only have a map ordinary map from x to pgl1r and there you you can take the homotopy fiber of course and you will only get this sigma infinity when you take this sigma infinity thing you only get a sigma infinity plus gl1 r module so what so what do we get here so now if you have a general map beta from x to dgl1r X2 DGL1R and C is the homotopy pull gas given like this. So this so once you so if you accept that this GL1R is like a topological group, this P becomes a GL1R space. And what I really want to say is that sigma infinity plus P is a sigma infinity plus GL1R module and the Thompson module and the Tom spectrum is defined like this sigma infinity plus T smash over sigma infinity plus L1 R R and in the case of the sphere spectrum the mass zeta classifies a spherical vibration over X and in this case the Tom spectrum is equivalent to the classifier classical Tom spectrum associated to a spherical fibrillation. To a spherical fibre. Okay. So let me just. So that's the definition of the TOM spectrum, but one has to, but you see, there are some things which one has to make a good sense of. I mean, this G L1R and the module structure of sigma infinity plus T over sigma infinity plus G L one. But let us accept that and go ahead. But let us accept that and go ahead for the time being, and I will tell you what is involved in that in a little bit. And come to this, which says that this homotopy groups of the Tom spectrum is like a twisted R homology theory. Why do I say that? So if you look at a if you look at a map from X to G L1 R, which is null homotopy. One R which is null homotopy, then the Tom spectrum is homotopic to odd meshing, but there is also there is but it's homotopic to this, there is a choice of H3 values over. Okay, so the identification of th of theta with R depends on the choice of homotopy. So if you have two different homotopies. Two different homotopies, then that would give you a map from suspension of X to Pgl1R, which by adjunction is a homotopy class from X to C L1R and hence a unit in R0 of X. So, and that is the unit which will relate the two identities. So, this is the idea which. So this is the idea which can be used to define twisted R homology. So if you write x equal to union of alpha u alpha, this is an open cover with contractable open set. So this map zeta will give a one pocycle on X with coefficients in the sheet, which takes an open set to the units in R0 of V. And after passing to a refinement, this zeta will. This zeta will define units over u alpha intersection u beta, which satisfies a closed poseycle condition on super intersection. So that is why I say that this is a so so that is why this homotopy group gives you the twisted R homology. The homotopy groups of the Tom spectrum are the twisted R homology groups. In fact, this In fact, this you can you can so this so if you look at the unit spectrum for k-theory from there you can realize twisted k-theory as as an example of this of twisted k homology as an example of homotopy. So that so that is true. So so this So, this Tom homotopy groups of the Tom spectrum can be fairly called twisted R homology. So, for over suspension, this carries forward the kind of argument in the previous slide. So, now this is let us be a bit more careful about this. So, if you have x equal to suspension of y, then you can write as a write x as a union of two cones with whose intersection. cones with whose intersection is one. So this is the homotopy pushout. And the TOM spectra will preserve homotopy pushout so you will get a homotopy push out of TOM. So here I am using this to the power zeta notation instead of TH and Zeta to make the space clear here. So we have a homotopy push out of tom spectra like this and we have now the identification. So this Identification. So, these are contractible because it's copies of the cone. So, their term spectra is just R. And because the map from Y to V G L 1 R factors to copies of the phone, it is null homotopic. So, you have a identification y zeta to r smash y plus. But you see, there are two ways in which it is null homotopy. Two ways in which it is null homotopy. which it is null homotopy. So if you uh so the so if you write this y zeta is equivalent to r smash y plus and this the cone of y zeta is r on both the corners, then to figure out this map from r smash y plus to r in both the cases it depends on what null homotopy you choose. So you may choose the null homotopy to come from the from the come from the left from the upper row then then the map is just r smash y plus to r which projects out the copy of y so y goes to point so y plus goes to f naught and that map but then the left map comes from the unit because this this suspension of y to vgl1r VGL1R gives you a map from homotopy class from Y to G L1R, which is the other one comes from the and on TOM spectra you get this myarviatory sequence and you get a so if you want to calculate homotopy groups of TOM spectra you have this map pi star R smash Y plus which is really R homology of Y to pi star R directs some pi star Pi star r direction pi star r one of them is the is the mass which potions out y the other one is you multiply by the unit u and then push it out and how does the unit u act on r square y it acts via this inclusion so the r zero of y cross is inside r zero of y which you can relate to home from r zero of y to r zero using the zero and using that you get this action of the heat okay so that is that and using this we can make some elementary calculation so if x is s1 which is a suspension of course and then you have a that gives you a map from s1 to bgl1r gives you a map zeta in the units in pi 0 of r and Phi zero of r and then this Tom spectrum of this zeta hat is nothing but the cofiber of one minus zeta. So you see to specialize even further to the PID k-theory spectrum and you write zeta to be 1 minus p and what you get is this COM spectrum is k mod p. Similarly, you can do with S3 and you write theta equal to P and the analogous argument will again give you the mod P k theory. So these are some elementary constructions. But another interesting case is, so again, let me go back to the previous slide. So you see here this, so you can, so this. So, you can so this co-fiber of one minus zeta, what is what is it as an R module? So, as an R module, it is just taking the potion by this element one minus zeta. So, you see, in this way, we can construct potions as Tom spectrum. So, R mod X, so the definition of quotient is given here. So, if X is an element of pi star R, the quotient R mod X is the cofiber of. mod x is the cofiber of this composite and if you have a bunch of elements x1 x2 xk then you can define the quotient r mod x1 x2 xk as this smash product r mod x1 smash r or you could also there's an equivalent way if you have iterated iterated so you first push and out x1 and The potion out X1, and then you look at X2. So, R-mode suspension. So, you get a map, X2 will induce some suspension of R mod X1 to R mod X1, and then you take the cofibers. So, you take iterated cofibers also. So, this is the portion by finitely many elements, and we have a computation of the portions. The portions as torn vector. So, this is a computation of portions as torn vector. So, if you have xi inside pi 2i of r, this is because of the structure of the unitary group. So, if you have, if you take xi belongs to pi 2i of r, then that then there is a map theta from the what zeta from SE. Zeta from Suk plus 1 to G L one R such that the tom spectrum of zeta is r mod x 1 x 2 x k. So, you see that if you have to portion by k elements, you need suk plus 1. So, if it is, of course, if it is periodic, then you can drop the condition on the degree of the exile. You can take xi to be anything. take xi to be anything in pi star on and this uh so this this is a kind of systematic uh result but you could do it even for other lead groups it's not this kind of thing you can do it it uses some kind something so the the lee group is not a suspension but you could you could get maps from suspensions of certain varieties Of certain varieties inside the league. And using that gives you some units which recovers Xi forum. So another comment to make here is that if you this even works for this kind of computation would even give you results for twisted k theory. So the expression, if you think for people who are familiar. Are familiar with the computations of free state K homology. So, if you have a if you look at simply connected Lie groups, the twisted K homology has some some Z mod some integer tensor some exterior algebra. So so if you have this portion so whenever when you whenever you when you are so all although I am taking R mod X1 X2 XK if you have something like x1 x2 xk if you have something like k theory and you are potentially out k element after the first element you will always get something which is not a regular element so when you are potentianting out something which is not a regular element you will get an exterior algebra factor of so this you can even interpret twisted way homology at least from for the for su k plus one you could get it from this One, you could get it from this result, okay? So, I have to tell you a little bit about how to construct this TOM spectrum as a functor with the desired properties. So, what one needs to do is the following. So, you have to find a good model for GL1R so that you get a model for this vibration, GL1R to EVL1R to BGL1. And then G L one and then you have a map from X to B G and the then you have to give a pullback P you have to give it a right action of length. So the model should be good good enough to do this one two and C so then the three can be defined by some kind of two-sided bar construction because see what you have to do is sigma infinity plus C mash L. plus C mesh L sigma infinity plus G L one R and this once you have this module thing then you can the derived mesh product you can just define it using two-sided work okay so so the five authors and those bloomberg gebner hopkins and rest they have carried out this in the framework of infinity categories and also in the case of And also, in the case of model categories, so they have done it using some for the model category one they have done using something called L1 spaces, but we have used I spaces and we have carried this out. And in that in I spaces, we also have proved the multiplicative, useful multiplicative properties of the constant. So, again, S P sigma denotes. Again, S P sigma denotes the category of symmetric spectra. And as I said before, I spaces are good for symmetric spectra. So you have this Planet junction and the suspension spectrum is S i of X. N is just given by S nash X. And look, the omega infinity, the analog of that is that you just take omega n of E n at the level n. Of E n at the level n. And if R is a commutative ring spectrum, this omega I R is a commutative, strictly commutative I space model of the infinity space or the omega infinity R. So here I should have mentioned that strictly commutative I-space model in the sense of the multiplication of R, not the additives. So the multiplication goes from E n smash E. Multiplication goes from E n smash E m to E m plus n. So that will give you the omega i en plus omega i em to omega i e n okay and then you can define the unit size space L1 IR as the union of path components which goes to the unit under the map to pi 0 omega n Rn to Pi 0. n R n to pi 0 of R and because you are going to the units that's preserved by the multiplication so it follows that G L 1 I R is a commutative I know and so again this G L 1 I R which is the homotopy full limit is an algebra over the barite level okay so using this definition of G L 1 I R we can define We can define the I species like this. You can do the because it's strictly commutative, now you can just take the simplicial constructions of the classifying space and of EG and BG. You can just remake that construction using the two-sided bar construction in five spaces and you get a commutative I-monoid BIGL1IR and you get a model for the fibration. The model for the fibration and then we get that we can write BGL1R as this and EGL1R as VIL1IR HI and then this BGL1R is an E infinity space supporting the action of the paradigm operator and then the Tom spectrum now as so remember even in the case of the classical Tom spectrum it's the composition of functors Composition of functors of the two functions. So the first functor, I have not. So the functor from I spaces is something which is quite clear. You go from top i V I G to U, you go to top I G U I G this is like a pullback. So this is the u takes F from X to V I G to the pullback in I say and then you apply this two-sided bar construction as I said and you go As I said, and you go to this sp sigma r and the first functor I have not said anything about even in the previous case, so I will just not mention it, but it it is something which is good for proving multi-primitive form. That's all so then we can show that the Tom spectrum functor enjoys good multiplicative properties as I said before. I said before. So the Tom spectrum functor is lax monoidal. And when you take the cofibrant replacement, these are actually stable equivalent. P of F mash T of G to T of F cross T. And if you have an operat which is augmented over the Barrett echelace operat, then T carries O algebras over Bg H I to O algebras in symmetry. Two O algebras in symmetric spectrum in R model symmetric spectrum. So again, from the multiplicative, similar to the classical story, from the multiplicative properties of the TOM spectra, we learned that the TOM spectrum of A infinity algebras over BGL1R, that is loop maps to BGL1R, have R A infinity R algebra. So I just wrote it like this instead of Wrote it like this instead of R and I should just say R L symmetric spectra. Okay, so if you think of, let me just do this particular case, explain this. So if you want to look at the S1 case and you take zeta to be 1 minus P, so then you want to look at the obstructions to make this zeta a loop. So you have this S2 suspension zeta b2. Suspension zeta B2 L1P L1KP and you want to extend it to CP infinity for the loops of CP infinity there. And then the obstructions are all zero because the cohomology of this CP infinity comma S2, they are all concentrated in even degrees and the homotopy groups of this B squared GL1KP is also concentrated in even degrees. So the obstructions are all zero. So you can get this extension. are all zero so you can get this extension so that means that this k mod p becomes a k p algebra so analogous argument works with x equal to s un and r even periodic spectrum so it constructs this finite portions as a infinity r n okay so then the next thing is the topological hochield homology of r module top spectra Of R module term spectra. So again, you take f from y to z square t and zeta equal to omega f so that this p h of zeta is an r algebra. And then you we have an analogous result for the r algebra topological oxygen homology. So there is an equivalent pH of L eta F and L eta F is the one which is written here. It's the same story which translates to. Which translates to this case. Okay. So now this is, so I'll just end by talking about a couple of calculations. So if you look at this mod P k theory case, so x equal to S1, R equal to P addicury, and zeta equal to 1 minus P, then the tom spectrum of zeta is K mod P. So, okay, there is a loop missing here. Yeah, okay, there is a loop missing here, but so the obstructions of writing to zeta as a loop map vanish as we have seen. So this, so if you can compute the free loop space of Cp infinity, C P infinity again has a commutative monoid structure. So it's again S1 cross C p infinity. So this loop space of free loop space of C p infinity has this nice decomposition. So this leads to computation because This leads to computation because we can now look at so S1 plus CP infinity. We can analyze this is a simple enough space for us to make computations of homotopy groups. And this is something which I did a while back. So for odd prime p, you have this computation pi m of h h k mod p is you get this z mod p infinity to the power i. infinity to the power i and i actually depends on the choice of this extension f which is an integer between 1 and 3 okay and the other case which i was talking about x equal to s u n you write s u n as the loop space of v s u n and and in this case to make the th calculation we actually have to assume that x1 x2 xn minus 1 is a regular x2xn minus 1 is a regular thickness with 5 star r, which is not a very strong assumption because a lot of interesting cases come in over there. So here the phi loop space of B A C O N actually has this thing. So phi loop space of B G is E G crossover G A G, G acting on itself by conjugation. So you can write it like this and this can It like this, and this can be broken up using a simplicial structure on G mod G C mod G. So, in the case of S U N acting on itself by conjugation, potion out by SUN, this becomes actually a simplex. And so from the simplex, you can break this free loop space into simpler parts. And from there, we have this calculation. This calculation. So, this is joint work with two click through for each k greater than or equal to one and r of p local spectrum, and you have this thing about e p is large enough. Then you have ring structures on r mod x1 x2 xn minus 1 such that this homotopy groups are pi star r mod x1 infinity xn minus 1 infinity. One infinity x and minus one infinity to the power of so there are so many interesting examples of this theorem. You can, for example, take the modava e theory and you can take xi to be the polynomial generator and then the label and the prime t and then the quotient is the moda va k. Modawa K theory spectrum, and this would give you a calculation of pH age of k theory over the Modaba E theory. Thank you, and that's where I stop. Okay, thank you, Samik. Are there any questions from the participants? Any questions from the participants in Oaxaca for Sam? Uh, first Omar has a question. Yes, uh, so on that last slide, uh, I was a little bit confused about the dependence on K of the left-hand side. You're saying as long as K satisfies that inequality, there is some ring structure on the quotient for which you get this K on the right-hand side? Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying. There is a And see there is a reach on that question for which you get this calculation of that's very cool. Thank you. Any other questions in Oaxaca? Okay, do we have any questions from the virtual world? I guess I can ask. Oh, sorry, please. Go ahead. No, no, I think, yeah, just feel free to speak up. Yeah, you mentioned that you can interpret this construction of tone structure as twisted spectra over space. So I was wondering if you, so to say, can turn this around if you have certain covered. This around if you have certain code cycles, can you find a classifying map for these? So the co-cycles have to take values in this unit to get to this Tom spectrum. Otherwise, you would have to look at the proper classifying space. Proper classifying space, and if that has it would be the post-war be classified by that. And in this case, the classifying space of that of the thing which classifies the units is this VGL1R. So you would need the procycle to be of that specific form. Okay. Okay. And the reason why I mentioned twisted K-theory is fortunately the twisting in K-theory is like rank bundles and plus minus one. And there it actually comes from the units in case. Okay. Thanks. Can I ask? I mean, if we Glacier Angelteit also made some computations of topological either Hochschule homology or cohomology, where the additive results. Homology where the additive result depended on the A infinity structure. How are your results related to those of Anglotite? Yeah, so they are similar, but Angelwhite had a different kind of formulation. He showed that, so he was starting from the being stuff. So, in this regular portion case, he has. He has he was looking at the multiplication and he showed that if some something about the level two multiplication is invertible, then he had a calculation in this. And in the other case with the K theory, it is we get same results, but he has a different kind of condition. And I have a different kind of condition. And I don't know, I have not thought about how to match them up. Not thought about how to match them up. But yeah. But he has he has something called so he so he has constructed this skeletal filtration of THA using the so using so which works for a n spectrum so he has so he was looking at stashes associated. Stashes associate and he had this skeletal tweeter, and from there, so so so he was so for the k-theory case, we have our results are exactly similar, but for this, so but but his skeletal filtration and the extent and the condition on the extensions which I was getting, I don't know how to match them. That's the that's the correct answer. And in this case, in the regular quotient case, Regular quotient case is his condition which was about some invertibility of this two-fold multiplication, which I cannot see from my point of view. Maybe a related question. So, you talked about A infinity structures. So, can you upgrade this in some cases? I mean, if you think, for instance, H. I mean, if you think, for instance, Hd as being a quotient of little Ku or something, where you actually know that you have an E infinity structure, do you see this on the TOM spectral world? HZ as a portion of little KU. Yeah, so yeah, I haven't thought about eight z as a portion of everything KU, but but But I mean yeah, I haven't thought about that what that calculation would be. But what I what I'm thinking is that if you have like it's just what I'm thinking right now that one would have to invert a lot more. No, a little case. No, of little k you may have been just invert one k yeah yeah i i guess i guess it would be possible to do calculations there i think this will be possible so so with uh here but oh okay so the so the issue there would be um yeah so the issue issue there would Yeah, so the issue there would be: you could take, yeah, I think it would be possible to do that because it's a degree two class, so you could work with S3 and to do that. So it would be possible to do that, I think. Thanks for that point. Any more questions from either Oaxaca or Zoom? Okay, well, let's thank Samek again.
