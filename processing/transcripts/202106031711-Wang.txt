Who's going to speak about coherently amplifying photon production from vacuum with a dense cloud of accelerating photodetectors? Okay, so thank you, Laura, and thanks to the organizers for this wonderful workshop and for giving me the opportunity to present here. In my talk, I'm going to discuss different methods to amplify photon production from vacuum. Production from vacuum. I'm also going to talk about proposals for experimental realizations in lab. The works are carried out by myself and Miles Branco and other collaborators. So first, let's take a look at a specific case of vacuum photon production with accelerating detectors, the Arnold effect, which predicts that uniformly accelerating detectors in Minkowski vacuum with their thermal state. Vacuum with the thermal state. For the case of a linear acceleration, the thermal state observed by the detector would have its temperature proportional to the acceleration. However, in order to observe a detectable temperature, you need extremely high acceleration value, which is enabled to be carried out nowadays. And so the other method. So the other method to explore the vacuum photon production is to have a detector doing circular acceleration instead. In this case, the detector will see an effective thermal state where the temperature depends on the frequency of the circular motion. My own interest has been focused on finding new methods to carry out experiments to observe vacuum photon production with non-inertial detectors. And so in my proposal, I'm going to in my proposal I'm going to consider oscillatory mechanical oscillating detectors. So one advantage of having an oscillating detector is that it's easier to excite detectors to high frequency mechanical motion. And the other advantage is that in contrast to a uniformly accelerating detector, for oscillating detector you can easily place it inside a cavity. Place it inside the cavity. And the former studies have shown that if the resonance condition that the sum of the cavity frequency plus the frequency of the detector's internal degrees of freedom equals to the central mass frequency of the detector, there would be a great enhancement to the vacuum photon production rate. Another method to enhance the vacuum photon production rate. the marking photon production rate is to increase the effective coupling between the cavity and the detector. So for example, in experiment, the detector and cavity can be coupled through a capacitor so that the coupling can be increased by increasing the area of the capacitance. Another method to increase effective coupling is to increase the detector's number. So if we have a if we have a single detector coupled to cavity with coupling strength lambda, then if we have n detectors, it's effectively the same as having one detector with the coupling strength to be squared n times bigger than the original coupling strength. Okay, so before going to details, let's take a look at the proposed Let's take a look at the proposed experiment for analog and the realization of non-inertial detectors inside microwave cavities. So the first analog models the detector as an oscillator, and the second analog models the detector as a two-level system. These two analogs are not perfect because the detectors are just coupled to the cavity and not located inside. And not located inside the cavity. So the third scheme has overcome this problem by having a large number of detectors located within the cavity and the large number of detectors would enhance the photon production rate. One thing worth to mention is that in all these three schemes, we do three schemes, we have mechanical motion of the detector. So first, let's take a look at the system of the cavity and the detector modeled as an oscillator. So we apply single mode approximation to the cavity's photon field with a field denoted by creation annihilation operators A dagger A. And we have a point-like detector which locates near the center of the cavity. Which locates near the center of the cavity and with the center of mass doing oscillatory motion. The detector's internal degree of freedom is modeled as a quantum harmonic oscillator with bare frequency omega zero. And the oscillator is described by creation annihilation operators B and B DAG. So the detector's internal degree of freedom is linear coupled to the cavity field. The Hamiltonian of the whole system in left frame is described like this. The d tau by dt terms are Lorentz factors, which induced due to the motion of the detector. So by doing Taylor expansion to these time-dependent terms and getting rid of higher-order terms, we obtain a Hamiltonian like this. We can go to the interaction picture and do rotating wave approximation and Rotating wave approximation under resonance condition that the sum of the cavity frequency and the renormalized detector frequency equals to the central mass frequency of a detector. And we get, then we obtain a simplified approximation Hamiltonian like this. This Hamiltonian, it happens to be identical to the Hamiltonian that describes the non-degenerate parametric amplification process. Amplification process. So, in this process, a pump photon is downconverted by a nonlinear medium into a signal and idle photon. While the frequencies of signal and eidel photon add up to the frequency of the pump photon. And in the vacuum photon production case, the central mass oscillation of the detector plays the role of the pump, while the cavity is the pressure of the pressure Role of the pump, while the cavity and the detector's modes respectively play the role of the signal and other modes. So because the cavity and detector are unavoidable coupled to their environment, we need to use a quantum Langevin equation to include the damping term. Here, we have assumed the damping to be gamma for both the cavity and detector. For simplicity, For simplicity, so if we assume that the cavity detector system are starting from their vacuum state initially, after the parametric amplification process and including the environmental noise, the system would finally arrive at a steady state and a Gaussian state as well. So, the advantage of a Gaussian state is that you can describe a Gaussian state with first and second order moments. If we assume that If we assume the environmental temperature to be equal to zero, the first moments A and B would be zero. Also, in a long time limit, the average cavity photon number and the average detector photon number would be the same, would be a function of the parameter eta, where eta is defined by a ratio of the coupling over a damping. So it is obvious. So it is obvious from this function that the average photon number would increase would start from zero when eta is zero and increase all the way until eta reaches the critical value one half. After eta exceeds the critical value, this term would be negative, which does not make any sense. And we call this regime parametric instability regime. Instability regime. And this is a consequence of the fact that we treat a detector's internal degrees of freedom as harmonic oscillator. So the cavity and detector system would finally arrive at a two-mode Gaussian state, and the entanglement between the cavity mode and detector mode would be described by logarithm. logarithm the logarithmic negativity which is a function of eta again so this graph shows that the entanglement would increase from zero all the all the way to its maximum value one while eta increases from zero to its critical value. On the other hand, since we have the expectation value of a, a squared and a dex squared equals zero, x squared equals zero. This indicates that we have a zero mean and secularly symmetric state in phase space, which means that we have an effective thermal state where the temperature is a function of the cavity frequency and the parameter eta. This graph shows that the temperature would increase from zero to infinity when eta increases from zero to the critical value. So this is not Critical value. So, this is not surprising because our approach breaks down when it comes to its critical value. Okay, so let's take a look at the analog of the cavity detector system we were talking about. So in this analog, the left center conductor with the ground plane forms the microwave cavity and this plays a role of the cavity. plays a role of the cavity. On the other hand, the right-hand center conductor with the ground plane forms another microwave cavity, and this plays a role of the detector. The cavity and detector are coupled through a so-called silicon film bulk acoustic resonator, which we call F-bar for acronym. So if we drive the F-bar to make it oscillate, Oscillate. So then the coupling between the cavity and detector would also get an oscillating term, and this would play the role of the central mass motion of the detector. With achievable parameters in lab, the maximum acceleration we will get is 10 to 10 meters per second squared, and the maximum velocity we get is 1 meter per second. This indicates that we are. This indicates that we are in a non-relativistic regime, but still it's possible to detect photon production from vacuum. So this is the simplified Hamiltonian of this analog system. Here, A1 and A2 are annihilation operators for the two lowest modes in the system. And the lambda 1, 2 is the coupling between is the coupling between the two modes. So the lambda 1, 2 is proportional to the length of the F bar as long as it is much smaller than the length of the cavity. And in order to measure the cavity detector system, we are going to attach two transmission lines at both ends of the system. And these two transmission lines would And these two transmission lines would induce dissipation gamma C and gamma D, which means that in a long time limit, the cavity and detector system would come to a detailed balance. And we would have photon production rate, which is proportional to the coupling and a function of dissipation rate. So for achievable parameters, the maximum photon production The maximum photon production rate we obtain is a thousand per second, which is detectable in lab. Good. So I was talking about modeling the detector as a harmonic oscillator, but we can also model the detector as a two-level system. So in this analog, instead of having a microwave cavity, we would have two Josephine junctions. We would have two Josephine junctions to analog the detector, and it is again capacitively coupled to the cavities through the F-bar. So with resonance condition and with achievable parameters, the photon per production rate we can obtain is a thousand per second, which is again detectable. So these two analogs I was talking about. I was talking about they are a little unsatisfying because we have a detector lying outside the cavity, not within the cavity. So next, I'm going to talk about the realization with detectors lie inside the cavity. In this scheme, we have a three-dimensional cavity with a membrane located near the center of the cavity. Center of the cavity, and we have more than one two-level system defects located inside the membrane. So, when a membrane is drived, the two-level system detectors will start doing oscillatory motion. The Hamiltonian of the cavity and detector system is like this. It is actually the same as the Hamiltonian of a driven Dickie model. So, by doing tele expansions to time-dependent By doing Taylor expansions to time-dependent terms, go into the interaction picture, and do rotating wave approximation again, we can get a simplified Hamiltonian like this. If we apply host and Prima-Kov transformation to this Hamiltonian, the spin operators would be mapped onto creation and annihilation operators, and we would recover this Hamiltonian for non-degenerate parametric amplification process. Parametric amplification process. Remember that for this Hamiltonian, when the coupling exceeds some limit, we will go into the parametric instability regime. But this time, with the detector model, there's two-level systems, things would be different. In this case, when a detector number is below some critical limit, the system limit, the system would be normal phase and when the detector number exceeds the critical limit, we would go into a so-called inverted lasing phase. And in this phase, the photon production rate from vacuum would be greatly enhanced. Okay, so again, because of unavoidable coupling to the environment, we need to use the Lindbread master equation to include the dissipation. To include the dissipation of cavity and local detectors. So the cavity and detector system's Hilbert space would increase exponentially with the number of the detector. And so if we want to solve this numerically, we can only solve up to around 20 detectors case. But we do have much more than one detector, so we are going to try. So we are going to try some approximate solutions. But this time we don't have a Gaussian state. So we are going to try the cumulant expansion process. We first try the widely used third-order cumulant approximation, which writes the third moment as the multiplication of the second moment and the first moment. However, the results from The results from this Q, the third-order cumulant approach matches well with the numerical result in the long-term limit, but doesn't do so well in the progress. So we try fourth-order cumulant instead, where we expand the operator sigma z in terms of this and substitute. And we end up with two extra terms. end up with two extra terms comparing to the third order cumulant. And this graph compares the results obtained from fourth order cumulant, which is solid line, with the results obtained from obtained numerically, which is dashed line. We can see that the results fit very well in a long time limit and also reasonably well at the peak. So the first cumulative method also indicates that Method also indicates that we have a critical detector number. When the detector number is less than n critical, we are in a normal phase regime. And when detected number exceeds n critical, we are in the inverted lasing regime. This graph shows the case of inverted lasing regime. This regime is characterized by having a burst of peak before. Before it finally goes to a steady state. The force cumulant approach also gives analytical results at the limit that n is much less than n critical or n is much bigger than n critical. So the difference, the main difference is that you have an n critical here in denominator. And for realistic system, we always have n critical much bigger than one. n critical much bigger than one, so that we expect the average photon number to grow much faster with n in this inverted lasing regime comparing to in normal phase regime. So how to explain the difference? And the reason behind the inverted lasing is very is very similar to to it for super radius. It is because the It is because of the collective behavior of an ensemble of N2 level systems interacting with a single mode would greatly enhance the photon production rate. Okay, so now let's look at a possible realization of the cavity detector system I was talking about. So this proposal is mainly based on a nature physics paper published in 2018. Published in 2018. In this paper, they were focusing on using MV centers in a diamond lab to observe super radiant. Our proposal needs some modifications. So first, instead of a thick diamond slab, we are going to use a thinner diamond membrane. And also, we need to induce resonant flexural vibrations in a membrane. And the most important thing is that. And the most important thing is that while this paper is focused on observing super radius, we are focused on observing inverted lasing, which is photon production from vacuum. You have five minutes left. Thank you, great. Okay, so with achievable parameters in experiments, so the critical number of detector we need is the order of 10 to 17. 17 and the number of detectors achieved in this paper is the order of 10 to 16, which is not very far from the number of detectors we need. So one thing worth to emphasize here is that we do need the number of detectors to be in inverted lasing phase regime. Because as shown from here, if we are in If we are in a normal phase regime, the average photon number would be the order of 10 to minus 26 times the number of detectors. And since the number of detectors is less than the order of 10 to 17, which means this would be less than 10 to minus 9, which means the photon production rate is not observable. observable. Well, in the inverted lasing regime, the average photon number is the order of 10 to a 9 times the number of detectors. And since the number of detectors is bigger than this, which means that we would have an order of more than 10 to the 8 cavity photon numbers, and that would definitely be detectable. Would definitely be detectable. So, I had been kept talking about super radiant burst and inverted lasing. So, what is the difference between them? For super radiance, so it's mainly the exchange or say transform of energy from the two-level system to the cavity system. cavity system and so the Hamiltonian for super radians it counter rotating terms dominate and for inverted lasing case it's like um it's like the cavity and the detector modes are both excited from their ground state simultaneously and in this case the corotating terms dominate for a Hamiltonian when Another thing interesting to take a look is that since in writing lathe in regime, we have a peak, or say we have peaks before the state finally goes steady. And the first peak is always bigger than the steady state. So it might be easier to observe the burst. To observe the burst rather than to observe the steady state. Okay, so finally, I'm going to show what is the photon state produced from cavity vacuum. So this graph shows the final factor, which is the red dot of the photon state. This tells us the variance of the photon number. And the yellow line, which is the entanglement. Which is the entanglement between the cavity mode and detect mode. As we can see from here, the entanglement, although very small, is still non-zero. This is very important because in real experiment, we need to distinguish photon production from vacuum, distinguished from photon fuel production from other resources. And this green line shows the average cavity focus. Shows the average cavity photon number with respect to time. So I have made a short video of the weakness function of the photon state produced. So as you can see here, it starts from vacuum state and then gradually forms a relatively steady state, which is like a ruin. And the weakness function for thermal state should be function for thermal state should be looks like this. So obviously we do not get a thermal state for this case. This is not surprising because we don't have a uniformly accelerating detector. So the conclusion is we can enhance the vacuum photon production rate by place detector inside a cavity and increase the effective cavity in between cavity and detector. We already have the analog for the accelerating detectors. For the accelerating detectors using microwave cavity or Joseph junction. However, in these analogs, the detectors are not contained within the cavity. So we make some progress by going to the actual non-inertial detectors realization, where we utilize the collective behavior of an example of N2 level systems to enhance photon production from vacuum. The states we obtain are not thermal, and the MV centers in diamond MV centers in diamond membrane can be served as accelerating photon detectors. So finally, I would like to talk about something we are going to do for next step. So instead of having oscillating detectors inside a cavity, we are going to have a cloud of two-level systems and it can be atoms or something else uniformly accelerating in mean cost. Uniformly accelerating in Minkowski vacuum. And we hope that the collective behavior of detectors would help us to enhance the probability to observe the unroll effect. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Let's thank Huey for the very good presentation. And we've got time for one or two quick questions. Yep, Rob? Yeah, hi, thanks. Quite an interesting talk. So what is it? Like you had that video of the Vigner function, which I thought was quite interesting. So like what is it that's making it do that? And can you engineer other kinds of structures? Structures? Sorry, I don't quite understand what you mean. Well, I mean, it produces this circle and stabilizes, but I could imagine it doing, you know, multiple rings or distorted rings. Like, how do you engineer this kind of thing to get a desired shape of the Wigner function? Well, to be honest, we originally want to observe a thermal state, so we didn't design for anything. It's just We didn't design for anything, it's just what it comes out to be. Okay, so you don't yet know how you could manage to do that at this stage. Is that right? No. Okay, all right. I guess Tim probably has a comment on that. I see his hand. Okay, Tim? No, not specifically on that, but on this slide you have up. You have up. I was just wondering, so you emphasise the importance of the entanglement, but how would you observe the entanglement in this situation? You mean how big is the entanglement? No, I mean how would you measure it? How would measure it? And it's a little similar to this case, like to have two transmission lines and connected. Transmission lines and connected to a system and the outcome can interfere with each other. Sorry, I haven't thought carefully about this. It's okay. It's just you emphasized that it was important to that that entanglement was important in differentiating this from other effects. So I just wondered what you would do in the lab to What you would do in the lab to do that differentiation. Thank you. Okay, if there are no more questions, then let's thank Huay again. And we can move on to the discussion period.
