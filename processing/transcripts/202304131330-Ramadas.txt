Okay, so yeah, I should like start off by apologizing for being the only person talking about 1D dynamics, pretty far removed from the like center of math of the conference. So sorry about that, but here's what I've got. So the project that I'm going to talk about is an application of a degeneration technique to make a connection between two Between two open questions about irreducibility of parameter spaces in one-dimensional dynamics. And this is work that I did a year ago, pretty much on the nose at MSRI special semester in complex dynamics. Okay, so I'll start by like recalling what the Gleason polynomial is. So if you fix a non-negative integer n, the nth Guessan polynomial is a polynomial in one variable c. In one variable C with rational coefficients whose roots are exactly the centers of the period n components of the Mandelbrot set. In other words, the roots of the n-Hui's polynomial are the set of C such that under Z squared plus C, zero, the critical point zero is in an n-periodic cycle. And I'll use diagrams like this to specify like combinatorial portraits for what critical points are doing under 1D dynamics. Are you doing under 1D dynamics with critical points being labeled in red? So that'll be my schematic for the rest of the talk. So here are some of the first few Lascon polynomials. The first one is just G1 of C is C. Its root is the Z squared dynamical system. G2 is also degree one in C. It has one root, that's the basilica. And G3 is degree three. Its roots are the rabbit-co-rabbit airplane. The rabbit-co-rabbit airplane. And the roots of the Gleason polynomials, sorry, the degrees of the Gleason polynomials grow very rapidly in N. So the 19th Gleason polynomial has approximately like 260,000 terms. It's an open question, and it's been open, I think, since like the 80s of whether the Gleason polynomial is irreducible over Q for all n. And there's some like N. And there's some like work in like positive characteristic by Goxell both white parry. And experimentally, this is like pretty recent, a group at Oklahoma State University, Doyle, Feely, and Telben, have established that for n up to 20, the nth Poisson polynomial is irreducible, and in fact, the Galois group is the full symmetric group in that range. But apart But apart from that, it's still wide open, the general case. So the roots of the Griecan polynomial are exactly the conjugacy classes of quadratic polynomials that have an n-periodic critical point. And if I want to think of them as rational maps, what's a certain condition, these are the conjugacy classes of quadratic rational maps that have one fixed critical point and one anchor. Critical point and one n-periodic critical point. So these are quadratic rational maps that are post-critically finite with this specified critical portrait of like fixed critical point and periodic critical point. And there's this general heuristic that if you, you know, a general degree d rational map has 2d minus 2 critical points, and there's a 2d minus 2 dimensional moduli space. Dimensional moduli space of rational maps of degree d, and as you impose conditions on critical points, you cut down the dimension by one. So, you know, we impose conditions on all of the critical points of this rational map. So we expect and get a finite set of points, and the set as a whole is defined over Q. Okay, so here is a like slight relaxation of the condition. So here we're Relaxation of the condition. So here we're requiring one critical point to be fixed and one critical point to be n-periodic. If we relax it in the opposite direction and now require like one critical point to be n-periodic, but we don't require a fixed critical point. So now we're not asking for quadratic polynomials. We're just asking for all quadratic rational maps that have an n-periodic critical point. For this reason, we get a one-parameter family. There's one critical point that since There's one critical point that's constrained and one that's unconstrained. So there's an affine algebraic curve or a punctured nodal Riemann surface that parametrizes conjugacy classes of quadratic rational maps that have an n-periodic vertical point. And part one is exactly, again, the quadratic polynomial families that squared plus C. So part one is just a complex line. Here is a picture. Here is a picture. So, per n is related to the end-quiescent polynomial in a very concrete way, and here's how to think about it. So, Miller gave this nice realization of the space of quadratic rational maps up to conjugacy. There's a nice identification with C2. And under this identification, the polynomial slice is a vertical line. And for every n, per n is some curve in here. And what I've drawn, here's what I've done. And what I've drawn, here's what I've drawn for part three. It's a pretty, you know, it's a schematic picture, but it's kind of not too misleading. It is actually a nodal rational cubic. That point of self-intersection of part three is the quadratic rational map that has two critical points in the same three cycle. And as you leave this point on part three along one branch, then one is a critical point comes out of the three cycle. And as you leave, comes out of the three cycle and as you leave it on another branch the other critical point comes out of the three cycle. Sorry. All right and where I was going is the relationship with the Gleason polynomial. So if you are on for three then you have a three periodic critical point. If you're on the polynomial slice then you have a fixed critical point. So if you're on the intersection you have both your polynomial with an n-periodic critical point. That is you are a root of the third recent polynomial. So more generally So, more generally, the intersection between and the polynomial slice exactly consists of the roots of the n-tri-Gleason polynomial. And the Gleason polynomial is named after Andrew Gleason, who showed that the roots of the Gleason polynomial are simple. In other words, this intersection is always transverse. Okay, questions or comments? Okay. Okay. Okay, so it's an open question. Is per n connected for all n? And this is the analog of the open question about the nth Gleason polynomial there. The question is, is it irreducible over Q for all n? And this, again, is kind of a dynamical question. If for given n, per n were disconnected, then for that n, there would be. Then, for that end, there would be some discrete dynamical invariant that distinguishes all of the maps in one connected component from the maps in the others. And some discrete dynamical invariant that we don't yet know about. So, it would be really interesting, I think, if per n were disconnected for some n. And it's not known. So, some related connectedness results for analogs of per n. For analogs of per n. So there are lots of one-parameter families of rational maps where all but one critical point has been constrained in some way. So for example, the locus of cubic polynomials with n periodic critical point is also a one-parameter family. And African P showed that this is connected always for all n. And Booth, FC, and Cook showed that the family of, on the one hand, cubic polynomials at Hand cubic polynomials as well as on the other hand quadratic rational maps that have a critical point that after n steps maps into to a fixed point. This one parameter family has a connected parameter space. So these two results are pretty much the state of the art in terms of connectedness results for parameter spaces of rational maps that have that are defined by That are defined by imposing critical orbit conditions. And the result that I want to talk about today is an implicate, a strictly one-way implication between the two open questions that I just posed. So if for given n, the n-leasome polynomial is irreducible over q, then for that n, per n is irreducible over c, which implies that it is connected. implies that it is connected. And as a corollary based on the Doyle-Feely-Tovin experiments for the Quaison polynomial, we can conclude that per n is connected for n up to 20. And I believe before this, connectedness of per n was known, again, via computer algebra systems, for n up to about 10. Okay, so maybe this is a good time for me to pause for questions, I guess. For questions, I guess. When do you say experiments? That's an actual proof or just some numerics? So, you know, I think it is an actual proof, meaning I think that like magma, they ask magma knows how to calculate Galois groups of polynomials. And so I believe it is not numeric, but I don't actually know how it works. Okay, so I don't, I'm not gonna like, you know, try to pretend that I think that definitely if connectedness of per n is established, it will be like a via this. I don't know. You know, people have people are actively working on connectedness of per n from like independent ways. And irreducibility of equation seems just a Of the basin seem is just a seems like a really hard question, and I don't know whether it will be settled anytime soon. What I want to focus on for the rest of the talk is to give a sketch of the proof of this because it uses a degeneration technique. And in particular, it uses some moduli spaces on, like the space of point configurations on the Riemann sphere, moduli spaces that I think are. Spaces that I think are have a potential for wider applicability in the study of rational dynamics. Yes. I don't think so. But I don't. I mean, I don't know. So the gender diet media looks at it. I think. I think no one will go out of their way and say, I conjecture this. I think it would be very surprising if a disconnected example were found, but I mean that doesn't really say that's you know, like I'm surprised all the time, you know, which is the same thing. No, no, this is a one-way implementation. I'm sorry, I can't deposit. I'm just like blanking. Okay, so if for N is yes, yeah. That's true. Yeah, I mean, just by, I mean, nothing like more than what I'm saying here is true. It's not true that if for a given n, par n is connected, then for that n, what the Gleason is, it would explain. For that end, that is not. I have no like you say you don't have a proof, you don't have an example because you say you don't have a proof. I don't have a proof of what? If there n is reducible over C, you don't... Oh, I don't have a proof that. Yes, so I don't have a proof that connectedness of per n would imply connectedness of Poisson, but maybe it does. Yes, thank you. Yep. Yes, thank you. Yep. Okay, so my plan for the rest of the talk is to just to give an outline of the proof and kind of highlight the step which is kind of a little bit new in this work, namely, it is a kind of new way of finding a smooth point on a compactification of part n. Of per n that has q coordinates. So that's the kind of step of the proof that I want to really focus. Okay. Oh, maybe, is that, can I move on? Like, are there more questions? Okay. So step one is in Milner's original paper talking about the space of all quadratic rational maps, he proved that if you Proved that if you look at, so this is a schematic of the C2 of quadratic rational mass. In red, we have the line at infinity in CP2. And Milner showed that all the intersections between part n and the polynomial slice happen in the finite part of C2. Basically, part n does not pass through this one point. Like, that's the fact that we're going to use. And as a completely straightforward, And as a completely straightforward consequence of this, we can conclude: if for given n, the nth Gleason polynomial is irreducible over q, then for that n, per n is also irreducible over q. Because if per n split over q, then each of the equations would restrict to give you a non-trivial factor of q. Trivial factor of the Nth Pleaessen polynomial, non-trivial because it's not like the root is not going through the line at infinity. So a factorization of per n would give a non-trivial factorization of n Pleaisson. I'm just gonna like be optimistic, I guess. Something is up in the scene, so you can go. Okay. Okay, so if for given n, per n is irreducible over q, then for that n, sorry, if for given n, the nth Gleason is irreducible over q, then for that n, per n is irreducible over q, but that's a lot weaker than being irreducible over c. And so the thing that I'm going to spend the most time on is this last step of going from irreducibility over Q to irreducibility over C. Just if you know that the Guessabinom was irreducible over any extension of Q, then you would see boiling to like the speed. Okay. Okay, next up. Totally general fact. If you have a variety that's irreducible over Q, and that variety has a smooth point with Q coordinates, then it is automatically forced to be irreducible over C. Because if it's irreducible over Q, but what For Q, but splits over some field extension, then the Galois group acts transitively on the set of irreducible components. Any smooth point is fixed by, sorry, any Q rational point is fixed by the Galois action, so it has to be on all of the irreducible components, but a smooth point can be on at most one irreducible component. So that is y. And here is an illustrative non-example. If I look at x squared plus y squared equals zero, it's irreducible over q, but breaks up. Over q, but breaks up if you add, if you adjoin i. And the only point with q coordinates is the origin, which is manifestly singular. Okay, so now our next step is to find a smooth point on per n with q coordinates. If we can find a smooth point on per n with q coordinates, then if per n Coordinates, then if per n is irreducible over q, then it's forced to be irreducible over c, and so we get the implication that we want starting from irreducibility of Houston. Okay, so if we could find the smooth point on a curve n with q coordinates, that would complete the proof. And in this Epstein, in Cook's proof of irreducibility of this analog of part n, so like the prefixed family of Fixed family of rational maps and qubit polynomials. This was kind of the strategy that they used. They found a smooth Q rational point. The difference between what they did and what I'm going to illustrate is their smooth Q rational point was kind of just there in the parameter space in coordinates. Whereas here, there's a major obstacle to finding a smooth q rational point in coordinates. And here's what it is. Coordinate. And here's what it is. So the uniform boundedness conjecture in arithmetic dynamics would imply that for large n, per n just does not have any q rational points. So that's saying that for large n, we don't expect rational points in the finite part of this picture on per n. At the line at infinity, there are at least two q rational points on Um, Q rational points on the compactification of there just are. But like all of the points at infinity for a large n are highly singular, and in particular, these two are also highly singular. So Stimson studied the singularities, and there are many smooth branches that come together, but there are many. These are not smooth points. So, of course, in theory, one would say, okay, let's start off with one of these rational points at infinity and blow up until we separate branches. Up until we separate branches. And then for each branch, like once you separate it, ask, does it have Q coordinates on the exceptional devicer? But like, there's, I don't know a systematic way of doing this for all n. So instead, we're going to kind of take a more intrinsic perspective. We'll take per n out of the C2 parameter space and think about it intrinsically. So, you know, if So, you know, if we just take it out, we separate these branches. Each of these branches at infinity corresponds to a puncture of per n. So it corresponds to a special one-parameter degeneration of quadratic rational maps. And along that entire one-parameter degeneration, the quadratic map that's degenerating has an n-periodic critical cycle. And what we're really going to do is we're going to. To do is we're going to keep track of the combinatorics of how the n-periodic critical cycle degenerates as the map degenerates as we go to the puncture and ask using this, does this puncture intrinsically have q coordinates or not? So that is the strategy. Okay, so more concretely, we've taken per n Per n out of the C2 of quadratic rational maps, we're going to embed it inside a very high-dimensional variety. So there's this variety that I'm going to call H, H reherwitz, because it's a Hurwitz space. So fix N, and there's a space H, which parametrizes degree two maps from P one to P one, together with a lot of marked points. With a lot of mark points. So I'm going to have mark points A1, A2, all the way up to AN. And A1 is required to be a critical point of the map S. And I'm going to mark the images of A1 up through AN, and I'm going to call them suggestively, the image of A1 is called A2 prime, not A2. It's just some other marked point, but I'm calling it A2 prime very suggestively. Prime, very suggestively, the image of A2, I'm calling it A3 prime, etc., all the way up to the image of AM, I'm calling it A1 prime. And for important bookkeeping reasons, we also need to mark the other critical point of this map. So like A1 is required to be critical point, but every degree two rational map has two critical points. We also map the other. It's really important to do this because this is what allows us to track degenerations within H well. H well. Okay, and so now that we've done the suggested naming, if we had a point in H where like the mark points A1 through AN were equal to the mark points A1 prime to AN prime. So like if each AI were equal to AI prime, then I would exactly have a quadratic rational map with an n-periodic critical point. So what I want to kind of do is take this very high. Is take this very high-dimensional parameter space and impose the condition there that each of the AIs equals each of the AI primes. And once I do that, I've actually got per n. Almost on the nose, but not quite. But the difference is not important. Okay, so to formalize this, what we do, oh, maybe I should make one more comment, which is that this parameter space parametrizes all of this quadratic rational maps of this data. Quadratic rational maps of this data up to equivalence, but the equivalence is independent changes of coordinates on the source and the target we want. So these are somehow like intrinsically non-dynamical maps. Iteration is not well defined. But if the AI is equal to the AI primes, then that allows us to identify the source and the target P1. So, like, once we can do this, our maths will become dynamical. So, on a smaller dimensional locus. On a smaller dimensional locus inside H, we have dynamical maps, but not in H. Okay, so to formalize I want AI to be equal to AI prime, what we introduce is the space M0N. So this is a smooth, complex manifold slash quasi-projective algebraic variety that parametrizes n tuples of distinct mark points on P1 up to change of coordinates by Mobius transformations on. Coordinates by Mobius transformations on P1, of just simultaneously moving them around by Mobius transformations. And now, if you have a point of H, well, it's a map together with all of these marked points. So I can pick out the configuration of n marked points, namely A1 through AN, and I can pick out the A1 prime through AN prime. And this gives me two different configurations of n distinct points on P1, and it gives me And it gives me two holomorphic maps from H to M0N. So there's one map that picks out the AIs, and there's another map that picks out the AI fronts. And if I have a point in H on which these two maps agree, that is, it goes to the same point in M0N under these two maps, that's exactly saying that the AIs are equal to the AI points. So the equalizer in So the equalizer in H of these two maps is, again, and this is like slightly technical, is birationally equivalent to per n. And this construction is kind of due partly to Cook, partly to Epstein, and was used by Harinaka Cook and Firstovakan Selinger to sort of talk about connectedness and contractability of these transcendental covers of Per-N that live inside Titan. Of per n that live inside type spaces, the deformation space of per n. So, sorry, what do you mean by birational morphism from one to the other, which is birational? Yeah, not quite, but I mean, both there's a, they're both defined over q and the birational equivalence is defined over q. Like, you know, per n has some singularities that this equalizer doesn't. This equalizer is missing some points that per n has, but it's just. Some points that per n has, but it's just like very, it's very minimal differences. There are some PCF maps that are not an equalizer. Finite. Okay. So the really nice thing about this picture, I'm going to go back to. This picture, I'm going to go back for a second, is that all the Hurwitz phase H and N0N both admit really nice compactifications that allow you to go to infinity and study what's happening very combinatorially. Study the geometry of what's going on as you approach infinity very combinatorially. And these maps extend to well-defined maps and well-behaved maps on compact mutations. Have you asked on compact mutations? So let me like talk a little bit about compact. Oops. Okay, so first let's go with the simpler moduli space. So M0N is configurations of n distinct points on P1. This is a non-compact space because we're requiring the points to be distinct. And as you go to infinity and M0n, what wants to happen is that the point configurations want to become distinct. Point configurations like want to become degenerate, points want to come together, and there's a way of reinterpreting this as saying P1 wants to degenerate into a more like nodal Riemann surface. So there's a way of very coherently interpreting what's going on as you go to infinity in M0N as P1 is degenerating, and at infinity, what you get is a degenerate Riemann surface, a nodal tree of P1. Surface, a nodal tree of P1s. I'm sorry, I always, like everyone does this, they apologize for their picture. Each of these spheres is supposed to represent a P1. The touching points are supposed to be simple transverse nodes. Like I know that they look tangent, but they shouldn't be. But I only have two dimensions here. But what you get at infinity is a degenerate tree of Riemann spheres with distinct smooth marked points. So your configuration manages to be a configuration. Configuration manages to be a configuration, nice, but the Riemann surface is forced to degenerate. And one of these things is called a stable curve. Okay, in the Hurwitz space, a similar thing happens. A point in the Hurwitz space is, you know, a P1 with marked points together with a degree to map to a P1 with marked points. Again, this is a non-compact space, but as you go to Non-compact space, but as you go to infinity in this space, the P1s degenerate. But because all along the degeneration, there's a map from the top P1 to the bottom P1, this forces the degeneration on the top and on the bottom to be very compatible. And so when you get to the boundary, when you get to infinity, what you get is a nodal tree of P1s. A nodal tree of P1s with a configuration of marked points together with a map to a nodal P1 with a configuration of marked points. And in some, like there's a list of nice technical conditions that I'm not going to get into that this nodal tree and map satisfies. So for example, there's no P1 over here that has a constant map downstairs. And this map has fixed degrees. So what I'm trying to depict over here, you know, kind of imperfectly, is this P1 is mapping with degree two. This P1 is mapping with degree two down here. This P1 is mapping with degree two down here, and each of these is mapping with degree one down here, each of these is mapping with degree one down here, etc. And the mark point on this degeneration again map as expanded, though A5 maps to A1 prime because it did still all along, etc. So the map has the same combinatorics at infinity. A1 is still a critical point, X is still. Is still a critical point, X is still a critical point, so critical points go to critical points, critical points degenerate to critical points, etc. Okay, so maybe I should pause for questions at this point. Okay. And the really nice thing is that we have these natural maps. Is that we had these natural maps between these non-compact moduli spaces. We compactified them, and the maps extend to holomorphic/slash regular maps of compactifications. And as we'll see, they also have like very nice local properties at infinity. So here's an example of like one point in H bar for, and we're doing the n equals 5 case. So this is a particular nodal tree of p1s with a Nodal tree of P1s with its map to a nodal tree of P1s. I have one map to N05 that picks out what are these mark points, what's A1 prime through A5 prime. And there's a systematic way of doing this, but the stable curve that you get is, I don't care about Y, so Y kind of goes away. And now if I want, there's a stability. There's a stability condition that I haven't told you about, but for example, it means that I can't have a P1 that's just attached to two other P1s and with no one points on it. That would not be allowed. So if I just forgot why, I wouldn't have something stable. But the stable thing that I get is this tree of P1s here with like 2, 5, 3, 4, 1, just like I have here, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1. And similarly, what I want to do is I want to take What I want to do is, I want to take this tree of p1s, forget x, and get something stable. So, just something with a1, a2, up through a5, and what I get is this. So, like, there's an a3. So, really, this P1 is this P1 and um And there's an A1, A4, and an A2, A5 here. Yeah, sorry. So this P1 is this one, and A5 has kind of moved over here. A3 has moved over here, and A1, A4 are here. You can ignore all of that, but there's a systematic way of doing this, going from the combinatorial diagram over there. Going from the combinatorial diagram over there to get a stable tree of P1s and know where all of the mark points go. And once we do this, we can ask: well, do we actually get the same configuration of the AIs and the AI primes? And in this particular example, in the example I've drawn, you do. Both on this side and on this side. So here I have the AI primes and here I have the AIs. I have a tree of P1s. I have a tree of P1s with two leaves and something in the middle. On the leaves, I have two and five on one side, one and four on the other side, and on the middle P1, I have a tree. So this particular point of H bar that's at infinity maps to the same point at infinity in M0N bar, the compactification of M0N. So it is in the equalizer of the two maps. Of the two maps. So, this is kind of represents something that may or may not be in the closure of per n. Okay, so we've compactified our spaces and we have the equalizer of the two maps. It contains a compactification of per n, but it also has irreducible components that are just at infinity. So, there's some junk as well. As well. So combinatorially, we can ask: what's the equalizer? But then we also have to say, well, if you have something in the equalizer, is it actually a legitimate degeneration of dynamical quadratic rational maps, or is it junk? In a paper with Rob Silversmith, we kind of use Harris and Mumford's really nice technology and local coordinates on compactification of H bar to scale. To develop some techniques for how to find some points at infinity. So, actually, find points that are in the closure of per n. So, first find points that are in the equalizer and then systematically ask, is this or is this not in the closure of per n? So, here's this example that we've been following is in the equalizer, but due to computations that I'm not going to Computations that I'm not going to show you, we can establish that it's not in the closure of per five. Okay, but you can also, these local computations that you can use to say, is this in the closure of per five or not, will also tell you, is this a smooth point of the closure or not. So, the local computations are really powerful and can establish smoothness. And I'm actually hoping to give a you know, a brief sketch of how to use. Brief sketch of how to use this to establish smoothness. Okay, so here's like a similar example of a point in H bar. Commentorx tells us it's just not in the equalizer of the two maps because I get a different configuration on the top and on the bottom once I do this process. Okay, and here is an example that I am going to want to pay attention to because I want to generalize this. So this So, this map between trees of P1 actually represents something that's in the compactification of power 5. So, this represents a special degeneration of quadratic rational mass that in the limit gives you a picture like this. So, on top, I have A2 mass to A3. And then, so like, if I look at what is the order of the mark points. Order of the marked points in the chain, I get one and two on a leaf, five, four, three, and here, two, I get like one and two, five, four, three. So it's the same configuration on the top and on the bottom. And you kind of, like for those who are familiar with like hubbard trees and the mandibrod set, we want to think about this as an analog of the period. The period of the quadratic polynomial that is the five-periodic analog of the airplane. So it's the leftmost five-periodic point in the Mandelbroth set, and its Hubbard tree is like, you know, here is the critical point maxed to the critical value, max here, max here, max here, max here. Really, like to be more consistent with the mantlebot set picture, it should be reflected like this. Reflect it like this, but like critical point, that's your critical value. That's to the end, that's your master. That's that. Like this commentator should remind you of that. Okay. Okay, so proposition, this exact picture generalizes to all for all n. So this represents a smooth q rational point that's in the closure. That's in the closure of per n. So, this, and just from the existence of this smooth point with Q coordinates, we can conclude that irreducibility of Q implies irreducibility of C, and this establishes the result, linking irreducibility of Gleason to connectedness of part n. So, this, yeah, so this would finish that. And it, the And the technique appears to generalize reasonably, like you can use it to find Q rational points on other smooth Q rational points on other analogs. Okay, so I'm not going to have time to do the smoothness computation, but I think I do have to have time to just say, like, why is it Q rational? It's Q rational because I only need to use rational numbers to describe this picture. Like, all of the picture. Like all of the all of the P1s over here have all but one of the P1s have only three points that are special. So to specify the cross ratio, to specify the complex structure, I don't need to specify anything. I can just assume that there's 0, 1, and infinity. This P1 has four points. So I need to specify a cross ratio to be like, okay, A1 and X and these two nodes, what is the relative position? What is the relative position? But I have a degree two map from this p1 to this p1 that sends these two points to the same point, and that's that has these two as critical points. So if I sort of change coordinates to have this be infinity, 0 and 1, then the math is the squaring math, and this is forced to be minus 1. So the cross ratio of these four points is just forced to be minus 1 by the existence of the math. So kind of from what this So, kind of from what this picture represents and not kind of in global coordinates, we conclude that this is a Q rational point of the compactification of Vern. Okay, and I don't have time for the smoothness computation, but the really nice thing about these moduli spaces is you can establish smoothness combinatorially as Combinatorially, as well. You can look, you can write down local equations. Like this is technology developed by Harrison Mumberg when they were constructing the compactification of the Hurwitz space. You can really look at the two maps in very nice local coordinates, and the maps look nice, and you just the smoothness comes out combinatorially. And I will stop there. Thank you very much. Thank you.
