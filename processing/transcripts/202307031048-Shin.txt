Maybe I'll treat you two different mutations. So this is very simplified version of the illustration. So some mutations may contribute to develop a certain disease like colon cancer. And then actually then we may think about use the same treatment to the group of people who share the same genetic. The same genetic mutations. So, different groups with different genetic mutations may take the different treatment to cure the disease. So, actually, the genetic mutations are all over the whole genome, and as you might know, as you know, actually, most of the Actually, most of the DNA reasons are non-coding reasons. So actually, those non-coding mutations may not directly regulate the transcription of gene into mRNA. So we want to see the actually epigenomic. Actually, epigenomic profiles of those mutations and see how those mutations may change the RNA expression and in turn make changes in the changes in the development of disease at the end. So there are many epigenomic features we can consider, and among the many, what I'm going to focus on today is I'm going to focus on today is the protein binding to DNA. So here actually, here is the protein DNA binding illustration. You see on this slide, right? So actually thousands of proteins may float in human body cells and transcription factors. Vectors that recognize specific DNA sequences and bind to DNA, and that those proteins may control the radial amount of the mRNA. So in the previous talk that Danak gave, so he gave a good review on this part. So I'm going to skip this. So, and actually the thing I care about is how genetic mutations may change the binding affinity. So, here you see the previous illustration, the mutation G and actually the blue transcription factor CGT tends to recognize this sequence pattern CGT and you see the binding. And you see the binding, right? And the mutation T changed from mutation T is here. And you see that CGT parent is not here anymore, and transcription vector binding is disrupted. So actually, it is not actually doable to do. It is not actually doable to do the experiments for our combination of between proteins and mutations to find out the genetic mutation that may change the transcription factor binding. And actually usually the biologist want have a very long list of the transcription factors they want to invest. Want to invest, they consider, and they have so many general mutations they want to investigate. And the combination of the two is very, the number of the combination of the two is very large. So actually, what I'm going to do is to do the quantitative evaluation of the mutational influence on the DNA transcription. On the DNA transcription vector binding in a numerical way. So we can, I can give, I can predict which mutations are highly likely to change the binding of the transcription factors and which transcription factors play a key role in the disease mechanism. So here actually there are some computational and statistical tools that do the test to tell which single nucleotide polymorphism and polymorphism actually are likely to change the transcription factor DNA binding. But even though there are about About 15 to 20 percent of the mutations in the genome are indels. There are no statistical tools that evaluate the impact of the indels on the transcription vector binding. So this work is to develop the statistical test to find the protein DNA binding change of index, which means that the which means that identify which indels that change change the are likely to change the protein DNA binding. So and the insertion and deletion as you see here that those are the mutations that are a chunk of the nucleotides are added or dropped. So and actually the And actually, the test to be developed works for any length of the insertion or deletion mutations. And it is easily scalable for large mutation data as well. So actually, the goal of this research is to provide biologists to do the experiment short-lived. Experiment short list of mutations and transcription factors that are worth for further investigation. So for this test, we need some input. One is a multiple library. So we are using some publicly available library. So that's what we are going to use. And another one, so we also need Uh so we also needed uh mutation data as an input, indel mutation data as an input. So uh so so this is the description of the notational description of the approach. So here we have the numerical representation of the motif which we call position probability matrix and it consists it is a matrix of size 4 of size 4 by L. And we another input I mentioned is the indel sequence. So we need the reference sequence and mutating sequence which we denote by Y and YA. And the difference between Y and YA is denoted as YC, which is a contrastive sequence. So Y is the longer sequence between the reference and the mutated sequence and YA is the shortest sequence. T sequence and YA is the shortest sequence. So we consider the first route markup chain model for the neural background DNA sequence modeling. So this model has two components, two parameter components. One is the prior probability and the other is the transition probability. Transition probability, which are denoted as pi 0 and A 0. And we can actually get the binding score, which tells us the binding affinity for each of the sequence pairs. So this CY is the binding score for the sequence Y and YA is the binding score for the shorter sequence, which is YA. And once we get this And once we get this score, we can get the p-value that corresponds to each of the score. And they are PLY0 and PSY08. And based on these two p-values, we can have the test statistic that tells us the binding of interchange driven by the genetic mutations. Genetic mutations. So, this is our test statistic, and this to get the kind of the test statistic for the binding change score, we actually double the tail probability of this distribution of the test statistic. So, this is how we construct the statistical test to construct at least This is how we can construct a statistical test to do the binding changer insertion and deletion mutations. Actually, a practical challenge is to get the distribution of this get the p-value of this test and we use the encryption sampling algorithm. The input sampling algorithm to speed up the process, and the real challenge was to get the design a nice improtence distribution. So, this is the imprintance distribution of Y given starting position S. The idea is to put more weight on the contrasting sequence corresponding part to draw sequences with higher. With a higher score difference due to this contrast in sequence part. So, from the simulation studies, we make sure that the test controls the type 1 error well and it's powerful. So, let me skip this simulation studies. So, actually, the whole point of this simulation study is to make sure the test is doing. Is doing a good job in terms of type on error control and do the powerful tests. And let me get to that real data analysis part. So we got the nearly 6,000 somatic indels in the samples of the AML patients. And those mutations are collected from the inanzo regions. And we see that the indels we collected. The indels we collected range from, I mean, the contrast and sequence of those indels ranges from 1 to 54, 57. And we apply this approach to this indel data, and we use this MYC motif, which is an important transcription factor for EML. And we also consider the negative controls and And actually, we ran the test and we identified seven indelations that are found to be changing the boutique match, I mean the binding affinity change. So here you see that GAAG is a good match to this tip, but with this deleted, this G deleted motive match gets The rotiv match gets worse, you see the AG is mismatched, right? So, of course, this further validation, one way we did it is to find the nearest genes and some nearest genes, CART A, CNF114, and LONEX1, are differentially expressed between AMA tumors and tumor cells. So that's a pretty So that's pretty much it for my research. In the future, actually, we can do this, we can extend this research work in various directions. One way is to integrate with the single cell ATX or single cell RNA-seq data and to better predict the functional targets of those data. Um um mutations. Okay. So uh that's that's it. Thank you. Okay, we have some time, a couple of questions. Uh sir, yeah, nice talk. Uh what's the response variable? Is it the expression of the targeting or response variable? Yes, yeah, what's the response variable in your model? Uh in my model. Actually uh so this uh for this work we For this work, we have the input, right? We have input, the motifs, and the mutation data are our input data, right? And we are actually scoring the binding affinity. And so, those scores you can view as the kind of the variable we care about. Okay, and the scores come from chips and data. So, score is actually. So score is actually based on is made based on comparison between the motif, I mean the position probability using the position probability metrics and the genetic sequence. So we didn't take ChIPSIC as an input data. This is more for when biologists want to actually do kind of force. Do kind of for screening, for screening out, and then they can dig out some transcription vectors that they consider important, then they can do some TIPSIC experiments. Okay, so this is purely sequence-based. Is that any way of incorporating experiment data with TIPSIC data? Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, so I think the uh so this uh what I uh what I uh think this is good for is for screening. So For screening. So we start with a large number of transcription factors and narrow down to some potential transcription factors that are potentially important for disease mechanism. And then at that level, like TIPSIC data may be integrated to answer the question. Yeah, so I was wondering a similar question where there is a gap paper SVM, there's a defined. Backpaper SVM, there's a deep find where you train a model on chipsy, and then you do this in silicone mutagenesis. And then you want to see whether the mutation has a large effect given to expect in silicone. It sounds like it's very similar, except for the fact that you're using the existing PWM, whereas the Debye CNN-based model, they're actually learning the PWM from the data. And then they post up the silicone mutation. The silver core analysis. Yeah, I think we can improve this work by considering. So, actually, that's what I did for the real data analysis. Actually, I didn't use the public PPM data, but I actually got the tip, getting tip from using the TIPSIC data from the ENCODE experiment. So, I think this approach can be improved by Can be improved by getting the people with higher specificity. How do you evaluate? The second question is: how do you evaluate your prediction since there's not much standard? Okay, yeah, yeah, that's a good question. So, actually, what we did for this real data analysis is to use this SAC2 and CT4 as negative controls. So, those are important for Are important for these immunary stem cells, but they are not actually expressed in chemical cell lines. So, this one are the negative controls that my collaborator Jiang Xiu suggested. So, what we found is that we found that some indels are found to change the binding of the MIC. They are found to change the MIC binding. To change the MIC binding, but none of the indels that we investigated for this study actually are bound to change the binding of those transcription vectors. Last question for Jason. So, I just want to clarify: based on the previous two questions, I feel like maybe you're talking about different things because the previous two questions about prediction. About prediction of binding changes, even sequence changes. But I think your method is not doing that. Instead, you are assessing, trying to assess the significance of the contribution of each, I think, each insertion decision with the binding. So it seems to me that you are doing a statistical test and inference problem instead of doing a prediction problem. There is some connection, but I think fundamentally there are different things. Fundamentally, there are different things. And I feel like for your task, whether the motifs were known from the database or getting or obtained from the new data, your method should still work, right? So that's my understanding. Just try to offer my question is also about assessing the statistical significance, right? But then you can learn in the multi from the data itself. So it's a two-step. Whereas it seems like right now, what you Right now, what you presented is the second step where you can use the existing PWMs, where you still need to assess the statistical significance. Just want to reclarify. But I feel like in the prediction setting, when people say feature importance, even though it's about some importance property of features, I would like to say that in that setting you use the shaft value as we have seen from the previous talk. As we have seen from the previous talk, it is not directly equivalent, as in this way, to p-value calculation. Because in that setting, you may not have the same null distribution to talk about what is statistical significance. And I think in her setting, she made it explicit what a null distribution is. Okay, so I think there are topics. And we can discuss after half the time. Discussion after Club's own talks. And then maybe for time, let's move on to the next speaker.
