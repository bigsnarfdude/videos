Wonderful. Okay, again, so let's just maybe up a little bit. So, yes, you know, thank you everyone for attending my talk and a special thank you to the organizers for having me here and just organizing it. I think we can all, I'm going to speak for everyone when I say this, that this was awesome. And we all want to do it again. So you guys better get on top of it. Like maybe like next year again, maybe in like the winter time, we can all go skiing or something. You know, just put in little seeds of thoughts out there. Oh. Oh, uh, so I'm going to be speaking about solicitation systems and topological recursion, arguably joint work with my wonderful advisor, Stephen Ryan. Before I begin, you know, I want to just acknowledge that the land where I do my work and play is the University of Saskatchewan, which is Treaty 6 territory, homeland of the MÃ©tis, and where I am presenting right now on the UBC Okanagan campus is the unceded territory of the Salik Okanagan people. So I wish to pay respect to the First Nations people. To pay respects to the First Nations people who call these lands home. So, you know, I'm going to be sliding through this and trying to make sure that I'm on pace with where my actual thing slides. At one point, I had slides, but they exploded. So here we are. So the overview of this talk, I'm going to just quickly talk about Higgs bundles. I'm going to talk about just quick introductions to topological recursion and then a bit of the overlap of topological recursion and Higgs bundles that already exist. And Higgs bundles that already exist in the literature. And then, kind of the generalization of it to twisted Higgs bundles and the direction that I'm looking at things at the moment. And then if there's excess time, I'll just keep talking and write. So, you know, to begin, Aigs bundles, you know, we know them, we love them. They're right there in the title of the conference, but introduced by Hitchin, these are the solutions of the self. Are the solutions of the self-dual dimensionally reduced Yang-Mills equations? And so, you know, it's to me a let's say kind of ordinary Higgs bundle on a Riemann surface X is going to be this pair E phi. Use a holomorphic vector bundle by this holomorphic section of N D tensor K called the Higgs field. But, you know, I'm talking about twisted things, so I also just want to be aware, you know, introduce the L-twisted Higgs model. So same kind of idea, this pair E phi. This pair E is a cell holomorphic vector bundle, but now phi is a section of end E tensor with L. So this twist by L, it's just some other holomorphic line bundle. And, you know, the usual kind of thing one wants to do is study the moduli space. And, you know, maybe at various times, people have alluded to the stability. I'm just going to say it outright. For those in the back, you know, we have the slope stability where, you know, as we're going to look at. You know, as we're going to look at five invariant sub-bundles, and their degree divided by rank needs to be less than the degree divided by rank of the bundle E. And I say this, you know, I include this in particular just because, again, we could have just, instead of thinking about K, could have thought about L. So we're all good to try and attack a moduli space of twisted Higgs bundles. And, you know, just because I will sometimes talk about normal or ordinary Higgs bundles, I don't. Or ordinary Higgs bundle. You got to be careful saying words like normal or regular. God bless you. In before we think that I'm adding some kind of extra condition. So whenever I'm talking about an ordinary Higgs bundle, I'm going to need to consider the genus being equal to or greater than two. So my main object of interest is going to be the moduli space of Higgs bundles. So stable degree D Higgs bundles modded out by conjugation. And if I And if I write a little L in the top of M, I just mean that I have L ex listed bundles. So, all right. You know, the moduli space comes equipped with this map, the Hitchin map. It's going to take some class of Higgs bundles to the spectral data. And the kind of my best attempt at a MathKel. Of my best attempt at a MathKel B is going to denote the Hitchin base. So, you know, to a Higgs bundle, I can define the spectral curve. I'm going to just look at the determinants of eta minus pi star of phi, where that is equal to zero. You know, eta is my topological section on the total space. And, you know, in principle, this kind of extends into some polynomial looking thing where these. Polynomial looking thing where these AIs are exactly the spectral data. So, you know, some facts that we know and love about the moduli space in the even L generic L twisted case, you know, this, sorry, yes. It's the, it's, so the teleological section, so it's like, it's this section from like total space of L to like the pullback. Pullback of that, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so you know, even in the kind of more general case, M is still, you know, fibered by some possibly singular tori, which are Jacobians of the spectral curve. But, you know, in particular, when I have ordinary Higgs bundles, you know, we have that this space is hypercalar and that the dimension of the base is equal to the dimension of the fiber. Is equal to the dimension of the fibers. Maybe seems like an odd thing to really point out, but that's going to be relevant when I talk about the twisted, when I talk about how topological recursion relates in the twisted setting. So, you know, I promised a couple pictures to people. So here's my cute little picture of, you know, how it looks. There's some locust where my donut is kind of pinched. It kind of looks like two cornucopias stuck together instead of a nice fulsome donut. So, you know, you know, we don't. So, you know, we don't need, you know, I'm not trying to talk too hard about Higgs bundles and all that jazz. So let's change slightly to introduce topological recursion. So, you know, this was introduced by Chekhov, Einar, and Arentin. This was somehow, you know, related to computing these asymptotic expansions in random matrix theory. You know, in principle, what it is, is we're assigning some family of multi-different. Some family of multi-differentials, these Wgns, to you know, what we call a local spectral curve, which is to say, you know, it's really given by some kind of function of a y and x looking like a polynomial in x with coefficients that are some function, sorry, polynomial in y with some coefficients that are functions of x with the extra condition. Well, one does not need to add this extra condition, but I'm going to just also ask that they only have simple ramification points. They only have simple ramification points. So only two sheets can come together at a time. I have this. I don't want some kind of three things coming together. That's bad. I only want, I'm going to have something like this. I only want two to come together at any point in time. I'll, you know, I'll say right now, it is possible to define topological recursion for the situation where you have non-simple ramification points. I just don't know that that has been, that that case has been generalized to the Higgs bundles. So I'm just going to only consider simple ramification points. And so, you know, whenever I talk about topological recursion, at least, you know, in the ordinary sense, and then we'll see in the kind of more generalized sense, the picture is kind of something like this. You know, I have my base. In this case, it's P1. In this case, it's P1, and I have the spectral curve, which is like living inside of the cotangent bundle. And there are some ramification points, and around ramification points, there is some involution of the sheets. And somehow, this is the picture of where things live. What's going to largely be important is S, S and K of S. It's a little bit less clear in the It's a little bit less clear in the generic, in the like the ordinary topological regression case, you know, the let's say the need for the information of P1, but that's going to become evident as I talk about the twisted case. So I'm going to need to, you know, kind of before anything is choose a symplectic basis. I am actually missing something, so hold on. I need to pick some basis cycles that are symplectic, just to say that like the A cycles don't intersect, the B cycles don't intersect, and the A's, the kind of the corresponding A's only intersect the corresponding B's. And maybe like softly, pictorially, if I have this like nice shape with two holes, I maybe want something like a cycle and a cycle and a cycle and a cycle. And a cycle in a cycle, I certainly do not want to pick a cycle that goes like crazy all around and hits things. Yes. But you said, so in the case that you did the show, it was just an example, or you always consider like a linear solution for the cover of P1. So in the case of ordinary topological recursion, they're always dealing with covers of P1. Okay, so that's. With covers of P1. Okay, so the base curve here in the spectral correspondence will be P1, and then the spectral curve is our. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Just want to connect for that with an example that. Oh, no, no, certainly, certainly. It's quite just because you put it GP dam, the genus of the spectral variable. Oh, yeah, yeah, you know what? That's just because later, so you know, the oh no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, sure. So, so, yeah, and we're picking the. So, so yeah, and we're picking this syntax basis, and this is really just to define a particular part of the recursion. So, you know, I said we assign this family of differentials, so they go by several names. I have opted for in our durant differentials. So, there's some collection of meromorphic sections on n powers of ks. And so, they're defined as follows. We have this, you know, I should say recursively as follows. We have this initial data, which is. We have this initial data, which is W01 and W02. So, W01 is kind of in principle a meromorphic one form. You know, there's a bit of freedom for the choice here. People will often, the kind of canonical choice is either actually zero or y dx. If I understand this choice largely has to do with what type of enumerative object you're trying to relate to how much. Relate topological recursion to. And then W02 is just this object called the Bergwin kernel or the second canonical differential. It's this fundamental bi-differential defined on S. And that's really why we needed to pick these cycles. It satisfies some properties, but it's not, the only real important property we need to know is that it is symmetric. And so from this, we can define. Can define the Wgns for 2G minus 2 plus n equal to bigger than 0 with this equation. So, you know, my Wg n plus 1, I'm going to sum over P inside of R. So R is my ramification divisor. So I'm going to sum over all ramification points. I'm going to look at the residue of this object that I'm denoting as K of P. K of p. This is the so-called like recursion kernel, and then I have in the brackets, so you know, the g and n plus one is given in terms of g minus one, n plus two, and then this sum where I've like partitioning g and n in a certain sense. You know, it's a little bit unruly. The exact form of it is not super important. So, you know, pictorially, we have this kind of nice picture. We have this kind of nice picture, like the kind of spirit of how the equation looks is we have, you know, we can think that we have some surface with genus G and N boundaries. And this recursive equation, what it's kind of doing is looking at like pair of pen type decompositions, you know, where we'll, let's say, treat, you know, I'm thinking of this object as kind of like my kernel. Is kind of like my kernel. And so, you know, I've gone down one genus and gone up two holes. No, we've gone, no, right, because it was n plus one and n plus two. So I've gone down one whole, let's start one like genus, but up one boundary. And then on the other side with the sum, I've kind of partitioned the boundary and the genus into two pieces. Yes. Pieces. Yes. I don't know that, like, I mean, how do you decide with the property of your of your I mean, the status of the contact and I mean, how do you decide to split it like the I think that you know I think that like this pitch. Know, I think that like this picture is less of I'm hard. So maybe like a bit of like ambiguity is like of G and the fact that we have a government surface. As far as I understand, like these pictures are less about me taking my actual surface and doing like the hard decomposition of it, as it is this is like a schematic way of thinking about how the equations work. So, like this thing on the left-hand side is not, you know, this isn't my spectral curve or anything. Spectral curve or anything. It's not my P1 either. This is just like a pictorial way of thinking about how the equations work. This is a very fair question, and I've like, for example, if the components were like stable curves, that would have given like a motivation for having an equation like that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is like an interesting thought. And I've like kind of delved around some of the literature to see if there was such a thing. No, I'm just. Oh, yeah, no, I was saying this is a wonderful observation. Yeah, so like I guess that the point is like somehow this pair of pants is spiritually being associated to the recursion kernel. So I guess it's kind of like a pair of pants for each ramification point. Again, I'm not like, I don't know that there's an actual association. I'm going to dig in and the next time we all meet in Whistler to ski, I'll let you know. Whistler to ski, I'll let you know. If it gets set a third time, it has to happen. That's just how the universe works. Okay, so some properties of these WGNs. So there are poles at only the ramification points. These stable differentials are odd, but kind of the most important one is the symmetry. And it's definitely not self-evident at all that there's a symmetry. Evident at all that there's a symmetric, but it does come purely from the fact that this object B is symmetric, and then doing some brute force computations to show to prove that they're symmetric in general. Like symmetric in the coordinates, like they're symmetric differentials. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's, there's, sorry, yeah, like they're they're like they're like multi-differentials. There's no no wedge. Yeah, yeah, like like this, this is not like wedge to the end. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, hey, you know, properties, and you know, like, you know, maybe we want to know why is this interesting? Who really cares? That's a great question. There are a couple of cool reasons. So, you know, on the one hand, there's a lot of work done to show that these are related to various enumerative, you know, things in energy geometry, like many interesting invariants. And these all come from choices of the spectral curve and W01. You know, of the ones, let's say that I can feel most comfortable writing down and saying, oh, sorry, hold on, I lost the view there. So, you know, the choice of spectral curve, y squared minus x, you know, this like airy curve, which is of like, you know, great interest to people, somehow computes like Witten-Konsevich intersection numbers. I don't really know how they do it, but people love topologic recursion exactly for that reason. Another example, which you know, studied in Which you know, studied in a lot of capacities is like its relation to various types of Hurwitz numbers. And this all has to do with a spectral curve that's something of the form like y minus x e to the minus x, this kind of like Lambert spectral curve. And I think like as you, it's like another parameter that you can introduce. It's maybe like x e to the minus tx or so, which let you kind of compute higher Hurwitz numbers, possibly with like an extra condition added somewhere. A condition added somewhere because you've just constructed this familiar form, yeah. So, to you know, I've not like built intensely on the numerative side, but you know, the idea is like there, you know, associated to these forms, there is some, there are these functions called the free energies, and like they're, you know, they're defined in such a way where like, you know, some number, like some like. Some number, like some appropriate amount of derivatives of the free energies will produce these Wgns. And it's actually these, this collection of free energies somehow produces like a generating series for these invariants. You know, these are like fair and reasonable questions. The numerative size is a little bit less what I'm attempting. Size a little bit less what I'm attacking. There are many people asking questions about this stuff already. So, another reason why topological recursion is interesting is there's this procedure of taking the spectral curve using, producing these anard-Durantin differentials and producing a WKB solution for some Schrodinger-like differential equation called the spectral curve. And, you know, like very, let's say very roughly speaking. Very, let's say, very roughly speaking, you know, if my spectral curve is given by the zero locus of some function of x, y, there's this map, you know, this kind of canonical quantization where we're going to send, you know, our coordinates to operators. You know, so x hat, x, and y go to like x hat, y hat, you know, multiplication by x and our h bar d dx. Then there's some correction terms. And, you know, so in a very like general case, and I maybe should have, you know. You know, put down the name for this. You know, for all of this, there's this paper, you know, Bouchard Eynard. I think this one's called Reconstructing WKB from Topological Recursion, where kind of in this like ordinary topological recursion case, they go through and produce some kind of criteria for which the spectral curve needs to satisfy, and then they. Satisfy, and then they prove that there is some fairly canonical way to construct a differential equation. And so the point is, so somehow from the spectral curve, you get a differential equation, and then you can produce a WKB solution, which is kind of roughly speaking like the exponential. And then you sum over k equals to 2g minus 2 plus n. There's some h-bar to some factor. There's some h-bar to some factor, and then you're integrating some linear combination of all of the wgns that have the same 2g minus 2 plus n. And so this, you know, this is, you know, kind of each one of those is like producing the kind of, you know, the like sequential pieces of the WKB solution. But it's like a multi-how many integrals signed to it. The number of integrals will be related to how whatever order of four, whatever order of differential the w k needs to be. Because you know, like, you know, you have some, some, something like, you know, k is equal to one would be something like g equals. G equals one, n equals one, or g equals zero, n equals three. And so one, one, you have, you know, that that's just like, you know, something in like dz. So you just need to integrate that once, but then the zero, three, you need to integrate that three times. But the point is, like, those two pieces combine to form one of the like one component of the. Component of the WKKB, you know, the let's say the like S1 of WKB, and then like k equals to two maybe has like three pieces or something, however, we can like split 2G minus 2 plus n. You know, I'm being like purposely not super rigorous here. As I've heard, this is a more colloquial style talk, and I don't have to be too hard with things. Okay, so you know, so without like delving. Without like delving into any aggressive computations, or so, you know, this is what, you know, again, TR is this set of multi-differentials. And, you know, in its original setting, there are two very interesting ways that we can utilize it. Okay, now I should be good and pause and ask if there are questions, although I have gotten some wonderful questions already. Otherwise, I'm going to keep going. Great. So, okay, I've thrown around the word spectral query. Around the word spectral curve a lot in many cases. And we could just ask what happens if I try to use a Hitchin spectral curve. From the Higgs bundle side, take a Higgs bundle, produce a spectral curve. Topological recursion side, take a spectral curve, produce some WGNs. Kind of makes sense that I could think about what if I start with the Higgs bundle, produce a spectral curve, and then use that to compute the WGNs. You know, I'm being a little bit particular in saying here that the Higgs bundle, we really. In saying here that you know, the Higgs model we really get like a more global object because I can think about this as being over any Riemann surface, you know, and I'm going to get something where the ramification points are some kind of like relevant global data. They are the zeros of the spectral curve of the characteristic polynomial. Whereas like in the topological recursion situation, you know, that's kind of like thinking of like local, you know, the hedges. You know, the hidden spectral curve maybe on like local charts. And in that case, we're like purely thinking locally. So, somehow, where those ramification points are have no like real global meaning. So, it's just a question of, you know, can I do this with some global data instead? And, you know, can we do it? And so, you know, it turns out, yes, and this is this work of Dimitrus, you know, Dimitrisku Malase, where they defined topological recursion for Hitchen spectral curves. But again, you know, only these typical ramification points. Again, you know, only stable ramification points. We're now, you know, the pictures changed in kind of like the following capacity, where you know, I maybe changed one more, you know, one or two more letters than is necessary. But the point is, like, before, you know, we had S sitting over P1, and we were really had this map was X. You know, it was somehow like it was just filling the role as like some way to give coordinates to the spectral curve. And we're going to replace that with our spectral. And we're going to replace that with our spectral curve just sitting over a Riemann surface. Again, this is the ordinary case, so genus equal to bigger than two. And we're going to replace this coordinate map with our projection. I'm going to ask what happens when we do topological recursion here. And so, you know, kind of, you know, to like save writing out the equation. Again, the point is that actually, you know, we can just effectively define everything to be the same way. The same way. We're going to, the Bergman kernel, this object is something that's well defined on a spectral curve. We have a couple of, there's maybe a couple of extra considerations we have to think about, like maybe we're, you know, we need to be wary of how we're defining integration, but we can nicely define all of these things. And the equation really And you know, the equation really just ends up being exactly what I had before, but where somehow the components are more global components. But the important thing to note is that even though I have these global components, the WGNs in principle still only rely on something very local. All they really care about are the residues. So it's more like objectively global. So it's now more like objectively globally defined, but somehow the information still really is only centralized around local data. Nothing. Like, if there's like a, yeah, as I think about it, I actually should have introduced a third type of G, like, maybe like I should. Type of G, like maybe like I should have called it G hat or something, or like let me put a little hat on it. The G here is a is like not related to the genus of any particular thing. It's just, okay, or as far as I understand, it's not related to any particular curve that you are starting with. It's just counting in a particular way. Whether or not the G and the N were chosen specifically to align with the nice geometric picture, I'm not sure, but no, yeah, you can certainly produce. Not sure, but no, yeah. You can certainly produce for any spectral curve, like a collection of these things. So, okay. So, you know, this work of Dimitris Kumlase, they've like said, yeah, we can totally do this. You know, let's slam Higgs bundles and topological curves together and see what we get. And so, you know, how has this been studied? Two capacities. So, Dimitrescu-Malase was really interested in this quantum curve pick. Was really interested in this quantum curve picture, you know, and its possible relationship to quantization of Hitchin systems. So they have like several papers where they talk about this act of like formally quantizing the, sorry, of like formally producing this quantum, these quantum curves. And this is where, again, this kind of problem of being a little bit more global comes in, because somehow, you know, when you just had the coordinate system, the Had the coordinate system, the single kind of coordinate system over P1, you know, there's like a reasonable way to talk about having an operator, but when you have collections of coordinates over the whole Riemann surface, you have to be a little bit more careful. But so they have several papers talking about defining quantum curves and relating it to the quantization of Higgin systems. And then, you know, relevant to what Andy spoke about, they have some theorems about how certain limits. Theorems about how certain limits agree with other types of quantizations. The other type of relationship is kind of between topological recursion and the geometry of the moduli space. And this was kind of, as far as I have encountered, kind of attacked by three groups. It was Bregli-Huang, Bertola, Krodkin, and Chamano, Wong, Norbury, Swaddle, and Tavakol. Tavacol. And so, in various capacities, they were interested in looking at how these WGNs relate to different geometric facts about the moduli space. So I'm going to focus on Brayley Huang and what their result is, because this was kind of a reasonable starting point for asking what, you know. Starting point for asking what information can we get from something twisted. So I'm addressing particular this paper of theirs, Special Kaler Geometry of Hitchin Systems and Topological Recursions. And a kind of like main result of their paper is that the special Kaler metric on the Hitchin base could be computed using the G equals zero Wgns. I won't delve too much into the Kaler geometry of the moduli space, but as was mentioned. Modulized space, as was mentioned before, it is hypercalor. There's some metric that we want to understand, you know, as again, kind of showcasing Angie's talk. And there's this means with which we can understand the hypercalor metric using the semi-flat metric, and that metric is obtained from a metric on the fibers and a special Kalar metric on the base. And so, somehow, you know, their motivation, and I say this to suggest their motivation, their motivation was trying to be. Motivation. Their motivation was trying to be, it was really like, can we trying to understand the hyperkalometric or the special Kala metric to gain some insights on the hyperkalometric? So their kind of main theorem, let's say, is the following, that some number of, you know, any combination of different derivatives of the period matrix of S is related to integrals of the Wgns where G. Wg n's where g is equal to zero. And so these derivatives are partials with respect to coordinates on the base, and we're integrating over these, you know, some of these symplectic bases. And kind of, you know, the interesting, you know, so on their side of things, you know, certainly this tells you about the period matrix. There's a way to relate the period matrix to the special Kaler metric. You know, that's great. But the kind of interesting But the kind of interpretation that I'm going to roll with for now to, as I, you know, in the twisted case, is that what this is kind of saying is that the data of a single spectral curve is enough to understand information of nearby spectral curves. In the following sense, that we can get every derivative of tau, and so somehow we can compute the Taylor series. So at least locally around a spectral curve, we get information of the period matrix. We get information of the period matrix of nearby spectral curves. So, one spectral curve plus topological recursion gives you some information about other spectral curves. And so, you know, before I get to the next section, questions about the kind of already existing literature. Okay, so, you know, I can ask about what happens if I think about an electristic. Think about an L-twisted Hitchens ventral curve instead. You know, with anything here like specific to the ordinary Higgs bundle case. And, you know, I just want to, you know, a kind of like motivating thought for why this might be interesting is, you know, when I have just K, you know, this recursion kernel is kind of like roughly speaking, this like KS dual tensor KS object. And these WGNs are, you know, some kind of section of KS to the N. Of ks to the n. But if I consider l instead, l is going to really come into play in the denominator of this kp. When I have l, my etas are now, you know, valued in pi star of l that kind of restrict that to s. And now somehow my kp's are living in this, you know, pullback of l restricted to s, dual tensor ks world. To S dual tensor KS world. And so somehow that means that when I look at these WGNs, assuming that I defined everything the same way, I just blindly changed L to K, I actually see that there's a piece that was missing or suppressed in the K case. So kind of even here, that's like an interesting thought of like, well, maybe there's some more information that we can gain when we let our, when we consider a different line bundle. And so, you know. And so, you know, in this case, you know, I'm just thinking the kind of picture now just changes where everything's kind of the same, but S is inside of the total space of my line bundle. So, you know, one of the goals of my work was to try and reproduce in some capacity the Beregli-Huang result, but in the twisted setting. So, okay, I mean, you know, I should say that, you know, obviously there's, you know, a hiccup in the vein of. A hiccup in the vein of, you know, like their major pursuit was to understand the hyperkalar metric in some capacity. There is no hyperkillar metric in the non-twisted case, but this fact of being able to understand nearby spectral curves from a single spectral curve is, I think, sufficiently interesting and a reasonable way to validate the idea of a topological recursion for twisted. Recursion for twisted Higgs bundles. I could just define the L and say, define a twisted topological recursion and say, here you go, enjoy, but I should validate that it's reasonable in some capacity. So that way that I will validate it is by showing that it satisfies a similar result. So, okay, you know, there are a couple of problems that have to be overcome. So say in the first one, you know, when I have my normal, my ordinary Higgs bundles, I had that the dimension of the base was the dimension of the. That the dimension of the base was the dimension of the Jacobians with the dimension of the fibers. When I'm thinking about line bundles with degree bigger than degree of k, actually, the base is larger in dimension. And so, you know, one of the, you know, a part of this construction and idea of Bregue Huang is that the base is being thought of as like deformations of the spectral curve. So I can't really, I can't, you know, think about the whole base as being deformations. So we got to somehow. As being deformation. So we got to somehow find something to suitably call the deformations. So, you know, kind of skipping lots of the deformation theory here, but if we study the deformation theory of the L-twisted moduli space, we find that the tangent space at a spectral line bundle of the Jacobian of S is this space, you know, H1x summing i equals 0 to r minus 1 of L to the minus. equals zero to r minus one of l to the minus i and i can share duality this to this other space you know and this space i'll say you know you know this you know i'm summing i equals zero to r minus one you know h0 x li tensor k it you know it it looks you know somewhat similar to the hidden base in a capacity it's twisted maybe not quite you know full in its components but we can actually map this into the hidgen base with a choice of section Base with a choice of section. So I'm going to pick some section in k dual tensor L away from zero, and I'm going to multiply elements by this section. And what this is going to do is going to give me some sub-variety b tilde of s. So this will be some space, some sub-variety inside of the Hitchin base, which is going to be governing the deformations. And so, you know, I'm going. And so, you know, I'm going to call the, you know, one could maybe argue whether it should be either this set or its image inside of the hitching base, but we're going to call this at the effective hitching base. This is like playing the role of some sub-variety or some space that is related to deformations of the spectral curve and is like particularly like equidimensional and such. So, you know, an example, if I think about rank two Go-Higgs bundles on P1, you know, Bundles on P1, you know, the dimension of the moduli space, you know, let's say as given by Nitsure, is the rank squared times the degree of the line bundle plus one. So in this case, you know, two squared times two plus one is nine. The hitching base is, you know, O2, H0 of O2 plus H0 of O4, pretty much like C8. So the dimension of the fiber, well, that has to be the total space minus the dimension of the base. So it's only one. The dimension of the base, so it's only one. It's like very clearly, it's not equidimensional. But if we look at our effective base here, you know, this is H0 of O minus two, and then H0 of O minus two tensor of O2. This is just C. Well, that's one that aligns with the dimension of the fibers. And so, you know, in this particular case, let's say there's like an interesting way that we can choose, you know, S. And this is not like a generic way of choosing it in any capacity, but. Choosing it in any capacity, but you know, in this case, we could, you know, our S needs to be something inside of O4. So, you know, we're trying to pick some kind of quadratic vector field. So we can actually, you know, for choices of S's, we can actually pick other cohiggs bundles and we can use those as the map into the Hitchin base. So, you know, we could do something like pick another Higgs bundle and look at some, you know, it. You know, it scaled by some C. And so inside of the total space, not total space, inside of the Hitchen base, there's some like sub-variety which is governing the deformations of the spectral curve. So, okay, you know, we have sufficiently a space to talk about deformations. You know, from our, you know, as we kind of continue along, you know, from our S, we can define a meromorphic one, one form, which is going to be the, you know, we're going to take the totological section on the total space, and we're going to pull it to an object on K of S. And, you know, in the usual topological recursion case, like this works out being fine, you know, we're pulling this like, you know, canonical section. Canonical section to k of s. And this is why we ended up with this object, let's say, like y dx in the ordinary case. We have to be a little bit more care, you know, a little bit more careful here. So we can use this capital theta, arguably, to define coordinates on this B effective, right? I'm going to, you know, I have this simple action basis, which I'm going to like refine my choice ever so slightly so that. Refine my choice ever so slightly so that it's not intersecting. So that isn't. Yeah, no, sorry. I guess, yeah, here I'm going to like, you know, pick it in a way that I'm not intersecting ramification points. Then I'm going to define some singular coordinates. I should probably want it to not intersect zeros of S as well. But either way, I can define some set of coordinates on the base. So, you know, my problem of not having a space to think. Having a space to think about my deformations, that's fine. I now have a space be effective, and I have some coordinates on it that are given by information of S. So, you know, now I need a nice coordinate system to work on. One could say arguably you don't, but it would be very helpful to have a nice coordinate system. And, you know, in the K case, when S is inside of this cotangent bundle, this is natural, nice Darboux coordinates. But, you know, in general, if I have some. Have some line bundle, maybe don't have such a nice canonical coordinate system. And actually, I'll say that this work of Chai Manu Wong and his collaborators, or their collaborators, I should say, they are studying really this case of when S is living in some kind of symplectic space. So they kind of have these Darboux coordinates for free. So, you know, how am I going to generate these coordinates and be mindful of time at the same time? Is I'm going to use S. Use S. So, you know, associated to S is this divisor on X, which is the zeros of S. And what I'm going to do is kind of view, try to view this problem in the language of B geometry, not like 2B, which came up a lot. This is like a little B that's a little bit curly. So I'm going to view this in the language of B geometry. And so that's to say that, you know, I'm going to have the same kind of picture before, you know, my spectral curve sitting over X, but now there's like a There's like a defined codimension one hypersurface and that lifts to S by the projection. And what this all means is that I'm thinking about objects where my vector fields look like, if my hypersurface is defined by the coordinate x1 equals to zero locally, I have vector fields that are x1 partial one. X1 partial one, and then everything else is just normal derivatives. And my cotangent bundle looks like you know dx1 over dx, and then everything else is just usual dx1s. I mean, we saw a similar kind of thought when people were talking about Higgs bundles on, well, like, you know, P1 with punctures, that, you know, what I'm doing here is kind of internalizing the ramifications. I want to do this, you know, partially because I'm starting with. Partially because I'm starting with, you know, when I have my Higgs bundles on L, I'm kind of asking that they are nice and holomorphic. And I don't want to make this association, which is kind of largely being done to get a set of B Darbou coordinates. I don't want to make this association and like introduce poles into the actual Higgs field, into the actual, let's say, like chunky part of the Higgs field. I want to just eat it inside how I'm representing L in terms of. How I'm representing L in terms of K. And so, you know, particularly nice, there's, you know, on, I should have said the canonical one form on the B cotangent bundle, but just particularly what this does is this gives me a nice coordinate system on the cotangent bundle. And again, you know, in this case, you know, I'm not going to have the extra sum. It's really just going to be my canonical one form is going from, let's say, y dx to y dx over x. To y dx over x, which is, you know, again, when we've talked about Higgs bundles on p1 with functions, we've had like phi having this dx over x component. So, okay, you know, this gives us this nice coordinate system. So this, like, you know, let's say softly solves the problem that we had of, you know, we needed a place to do, we needed a space to talk about deformations, and we needed a way to compute things nicely. Compute things nicely. And so, what I'm going to do is define these twisted differentials. I'm going to say specifically associated to S. So, these are going to be meromorphic sections of now, you know, Ks with respect to Z. So these are multi-B differentials. And I'm going to define them as follows. You know, arguably, I might have still said that W01 can kind of freely be whatever you want it to be. But I'm just going to kind of somewhat specifically say that it's going to be y dx over x. X, W02 is going to be this symmetrized B Bergman kernel. And by that, all I mean is, you know, when I have introduced this B geometry, my forms are now going from, you know, I'm going from some things that look like, you know, DX or DZ, however we want to say it, something like DZ over Z. And so I have to be a little bit wary, like, you know, arguably if B were symmetric initially. Initially, I have to be careful when one of the two coordinates is close to, so you know, these poles, I'll say, these like one over z really have to do with zeros of s. So whatever one of the coordinates of b is like close to a zero of s, I might have something that's like, you know, dz1 over z1, dz2, which is not arguably symmetric. And so I'm just going to kind of Symmetric, and so I'm just going to kind of forcibly symmetrize it. So, away from zeros of s, it looks like effectively exactly the same, and near to zeros of s, I've just added this symmetry. And this is important because w02 being symmetric carries symmetry throughout the entire set of wgns. And then I'm just going to define the wgn plus ones to just be exactly as I defined them before. So the only Before. So, the only real change here is that these are now B objects. So, they look exactly, in spirit, they look exactly as did the original ones. I've just, or any time one of my Z's is close to zero of S in like a local coordinate system there, instead of like DZI, I'll have a DZI divided by ZI as like a formal object. And so, the important And so, the important thing here is that, you know, the way that I've defined this, and you know, we can, you know, I can get into the gritty details of it, but the important thing is that, you know, nothing changed in how I define the recursion itself. So information is still purely centered around ramification points. And choices were made to particularly keep that in mind, which is to say, I made sure to keep everything away from Z. So my Z. So, my zeros do not interact with either the cycles or the ramification points. You know, this obviously rules out some choices of S, but dimensionally, it's perfectly fine to push things away. And so what that means is that the set of properties that the original topological recursion differential satisfied, those all entirely relied on the Entirely relied on the properties of W01 and W02 and the formulation of the recursion. And so my W02, my W02 satisfies the same properties and the heart of the recursion, which is to say the only important piece is information around ramifications, that's also been preserved. So somehow all of these differentials, these new class of differentials, satisfy New class of differentials satisfy the same properties. And you know, a kind of particularly important property is this variational formula. So, you know, there's some, I can think of like a particular type of variation. And if I vary the WGNs, this is actually related to integrating a W G n plus one. And so the fact that they satisfy the collective of a suite of properties, I said before, things like, you know, Of properties, I said before, things like you know, poles at ramification points, symmetric, odd, all that jazz, together with this twisted variational formula. Actually, if I may be so bold to put my last name, initial there, I was able to actually show that in this twisted case, we get the same type of result. So, you know, these partial I's now, I can, you know, in more specificness, this was related to this, to these lambdas that I talked about. To these lambdas that I talked about some number of minutes ago, these kind of like singular coordinates. And so everything, you know, the kind of case employees that everything worked if I just push this into the L picture and then pick an S and push that into the KZ picture. So, you know, the same kind of interpretation happens is that, you know, the data of one spectral curve sees nearby spectral curves. But the important thing here is that this Is that this holds for all of my choices of L with degree L bigger than K and all of my compatible choices of S, where by compatible, I just mean I'm not, zeros aren't intersecting cycles and zeros aren't intersecting ramification points. Now, arguably, this is where I stopped writing because I thought I might get here, but if I needed more time, I would. I have four minutes. So I'm just going to like say something quick, which is, you know. Something quick, which is, you know, I'm here, like, this is great, it holds for everything. But, you know, what I've not talked about is what happens when I change things. Like, I'm not going to address what happens when I like move around in choices of line bundles, but you know, that that's also like a fair thought to have. But what about moving around in S? This is still something that I'm somewhat, you know, something that I'm definitely still working on, but. Definitely still working on, but to sketch a picture of kind of where I'm at now, you know, we have this S inside of, we're picking S's inside of this space. So, what I can actually think about is a bundle over this space, you know, part of my horrible writing quickly, which is actually, you know, I'll think about it fibered by the hitch and base. And so at every point, you know, I'll have whatever, some lovely copy of. Some lovely copy of the hitch and base. I'll draw three. And so, you know, in each copy of the hitch and base, so you know, I've picked a Higgs bundle and I'm like asking myself about different choices of S. So there's a section in here that kind of comes for free. I'll use the brown. You know, this section is just like the spectral data of S. Of S. But then also inside each of these spaces, there's some distinguished sub-variety. You know, there's like a fiber sub-bundle, which I'm going to maybe denote like this and like this, and let's say like this, where these are all copies of BS. B S, right? You know, I've picked an S and I've like used that to map into the Hase. And so, you know, the kind of like, let's say, like end thought, a couple of questions is something like, you know, I mean, I talked about that there were only so many, there were some choices of S that I can't pick. So, you know, like, you know, a choice of the, you know, knowing where the ramification points are and of Knowing where the ramification points are and of the cycles is going to like cut out some locus in the bottom where, like, these are like bad S's, because these will give me too much singular data at the same time. So, away from those S's, I have a section inside of S, you know, inside of the fibers, you know, which is going to be kind of corresponding to where like I think about the, I've zero deformed things. Zeroly deformed things. And, you know, it will hit. I'm going to just whoop, ignore that zero entirely because that's obviously a bad point. But I could kind of maybe ask a different question, which is like, you know, how if I drew a, if I had a section that was defined away from a particular locus on the bottom, is that, you know, can that define for me the data that I built around? You know, if I've purposely avoided. You know, if I've purposely avoided some S's, can I use that information to pick out a set of cycles or determine where ramification points are? All that jazz. So, this is just some like current work of trying to understand how this all varies as I vary S. Okay, I'm going to end with my one minute left. I need to be a good mathematician who does not go over time on his talks, even though I guess I arguably did. But thank you very much for your attention. But thank you very much for your attention. I invite all kinds of questions. I invite all like the questions that make me look good. So I was going to say thanks, Chris, for the very nice talk. And yeah, I guess we'll open it up for questions if anyone has questions. Just chuck it back there. I might have missed it, but when you were talking about the topological recursion, you centered it on the branch points of the cover. Is there a way to flip the analysis to poles if you have them? And what topological data does this form, would this formula then associate to a puncture? That's like a really interesting question. A really interesting question. I don't, so you know, I guess, like, are you suggesting? I'm, you know, I think there's maybe some relation. Zeros and poles are not that different. Oh, sorry, sorry. You mean of like the twisted case or like the so just for my own clarity, so you know, the in its formulation, it cares about ramification points. But are you talking about the ramification points or when I was like, Are you talking about the ramification points, or when I was like introducing polls? I'm talking already in this very in this first case. If the analysis can be centered, let's say, on poles of the cover rather than on ramification points. I don't know, but that that's an interesting thought. Can I say that to you? Thank you. That's not exactly true. It's not what we were saying, but this is all the case where L has bigger. So S has zero. This is the case where L has degree less than J. You still don't look at S in the section, it's not L will be able to fall so zero. It's not default, but it's just the best object. Any other questions? So, if I understood right, what you told us was mostly about the genus zero part of the topological recursion. In the beginning, you mentioned that the higher genus part in some context has to do with WKB, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The higher genus pieces compute like the further. Compute like the further down, the kind of in the WKB, the pieces that have the higher powers of H. Right, right. So I've scrolled too far. I don't know where it is. So for ordinary Higgs bundles, I can imagine some story about WKV. Is there any analogous kind of interpretation for the higher part of the topological recursion in this twisted situation? So, okay. So, okay, I'm gonna say two things on that. So, on the level of this result of Breglia Huayne, let's say. So let's say they only computed or their result had only to do with the G equals zero. So, you know, Breglia has conjectured that the higher Gs in that case, you know, compute the correction or. Compute the like correction or related to like the corrections that come into play when you're, I guess, relating the semi-flat metric to the hypercalor metric. On the side of, let's say, just quantum curves and stuff, there is like a fulsome treatment by Dimitrasku Milase for producing the WKB solution in the context of. SL2 Higgs bundles that possibly have poles as well. So, like, it's, you know, I've maybe like disjointed your question into two things, but again, so yeah, the variational things and like integrating the w g n's with like, let's say g equals one or two, but like kind of all of them together, that information, it's conjectured to be related to the corrections that come with the sentence. That comes with the semi-flat metric to the hypercaler. And then, if it's a question about WKB, yeah, in the ordinary case of SL2 and SL2 with poles, Tim Trasu-Milase have shown that you can sufficiently produce a WKB solution. You have to be a little bit maybe careful about what is it, like a harder solution to. Their quantum curves are like modules of differential operators. So I guess there is on. Operator, so I guess, like, there is on each core, each like special, they have some kind of special type of coordinate chart. You know, on maybe on each coordinate chart, you can do do this and maybe how it pieces together. I'm not 100% sure, but yeah, it, it, you know, I hope that some linear combination of what I have said is a sufficient answer for you. Okay, thank you. So, I guess we can hold questions. So, I guess we can hold questions for coffee time. Let's thank the speaker, Chris, one more time.
