So great. Thank you very much, Mark, and thanks to all the organisers for putting together this programme and actually even remembering who I am far less inviting, but very kindly. So I'm going to talk about some work that I got into more or less by accident as a result of some other work I was doing where Some other work I was doing where we thought we just needed to pose up a small technical lemma and then everything would be fine. And then the small technical lemma ended up turning into a big brand application and hiring the postdoc for Jesus GoProso and three plus year study of anisotropic maximum systems. I'm afraid there are not going to be really any DAEs in this. Really, any DAEs in this. But I I'll do my best to try to make it not completely boring to people who might be interested in DAEs. Okay. Right. Don't know which one I meant to press. Down arrow, I guess. Down arrow goes to the next slide. Right now, sure. Or up. Maybe up. Okay. Okay, then. So it was down here. Okay, so the slides are a little bit busy, so I'm going to kind of read us through them generally. So we're going to be thinking about the Maxwell equation in a fairly general domain in R3. So omega is going to be a domain in R3 with a lit shit boundary. It could be bounded, it could be unbounded. Bounded, it could be unbounded. Typically, we're thinking of it being unbounded. That's the case we find interesting. It might be stereo domain, it might have several different directions of escape to infinity. The only really important thing is that spin-shift system. And in this domain, we want to think about the Maxwell system. Now, I've written, since this is speaking on pencils, I've tried to write On pencils, I've tried to write the pencil associated with the Maxwell system. So the pencil associated with the Maxwell system, so it's an operator value-analytic function called spectral plan omega. It acts on a pair of three-vector value functions E and H, which were only a small amount of lying, we should call the electric and magnetic fields. Fields and the way it acts is given by this expression here. So sigma is conductivity, so it's going to be a non-negative tensor value function. Usually it will tend to zero, well it's usually it will be compactly supportive, but all we really require so that it tends to zero is affinity. This is just a curl operator that you learned about. I learned about undergraduates. And this curl zero is the operator associated with curl by putting an n cross C boundary condition on the boundary omega if it has one. So I can go into more details about those boundary conditions if anyone really needs to know. Epsilon and mu are also tensor-valued functions. Tensor-valued functions, permittivity and permeability. And we'll assume that these two approach constant values of infinity. So by constant values, the constant positive multiples of the identity, elsewhere they're allowed to be tensor values. So these are the hypotheses here. The tensile and mu are bounded above and below, bounded below by strictly positive. Below by strictly positive one, it's contact segments about the above planets and on the left. In general, there will be regions where it's smaller or skewed. So this is our max for the pencil. And one thing you can realise if you look at the max with a pencil in all its horrible details here is that you can clean it up a bit. So if you put just the If you put just the operator with that sigma in the top left-hand corner into a qi-2 log operator matrix there, and then keep the I-curl and the i-curl zero together in an operator A, which will then be self-joined. And then W is going to be this thing here. So the maximum pencil has this form. So it's a linear, linear in the spectrum parameter. Parameter operator pencil, and indeed it's somehow most trivial kind linear operator pencil because this weight operating here W is positive, it's bounded in the imperturbable. So this is really just an operator problem in the skies. Okay, so what can we say then about the spectrum of this pencil? Well The well, the crudest estimate that you would get would be by looking at the associated numerical range. So you look at the numerical range of this pencil here and you find that the numerical range is just a horizontal strip in a complex plane consisting of Baldos omega, whose imaginary part is created weakly to this task. To this negative number here. This number is Qmax is this thing here. So it's essentially the sigma hit on either side by minus a half power plant. So that's the crudest approximation. That's the simplest answer I could give to the question about title where is the spectrum lies in this strictly complex way. Strictly complex thing. This is going to be our first idea of where the spectrum lies. So I should follow this layer. Oh no, it's not shaky as I thought. I thought it was going to call over Jupiter. Hmm. Okay, so that's the complex omega plane and And that's in the numerical range, and the spectrum lines in here, and that point there is minus five cubits. That's the simplest and crudest estimate of where the spectrum lies. It doesn't depend in any way on this domain omega, it just is calculated from the coefficients of the theory. From the coefficients of computer expressions. So that's our first and goodest idea of where the spectrum lies for Maxwell. Let's see what about the other object whose name appeared entitled, which was the Druid or N system. So one of the things about Maxwell systems, as I've just been reminded of the Isaac Newton Institute a couple of weeks ago by Matt from KSTL, is that actually the Uh these branches here uh exhibit uh frequency dependent response, so these really actually depend on your response. One of the models for dealing with this is the so-called druidal event system. Let's have a look at what's going on with drupal events. So I've tried to simplify it as much as possible to make it less horrendous for. And a less horrendous for talk after lunch in a nice location like this or sets many things that can equal to one. So this is now what we get to that. It's this way for just become an identity. So that's what's going on over here. So we've got an extra term here that we need to tell you about. Before that was zero. And then the term that was conductivity before has also got changed. Have changed. These two terms, this one, this one, you can see they've now got poles. So gamma m and gamma E are coupled positive constants, so these two terms have now got poles in the complex plane. And theta E and theta M, these are now scalar-valued, bounded positive functions. Now one of the secondary effects in Northern Europe. I've said here one, I'll link it to one actually. So this pencil that's written here turns out to be the first sure complement of this companion operator. So this operator here is acting six vectors. This thing here will now be acting on twelve vectors. thing here will now be acting on 12 vectors. So each block here is the size of that base. So this is the first your complement of this companion operator. So that block there, that A, is this thing here which is off-diagonal term L B which appears consists of the theta E M there and there Then there the B matrix has got these two scalar parameters, gamma E and gamma F in K. When I say that this L of omega is the first short confident of that companion operator, what I mean precisely is this. L of omega is A of this omega minus it's often called Divided by two operations. Bordered by two copies. And this term here, that's Maxwell with conductivity zero. So that's the self-adjoint Maxwell with conductivity zero and the permeability of the conductivity of the rocket. And again, what you can do, having realised that place is the first sure component of that companion operator, is you can. Companion operator is you can ask, Joe, where's the spectrum of that companion operator? The spectrum of that companion operator is also contained in its closed numerical range. And where's that? Well, it turns out that the important thing here is how big the imaginary part of this thing is. So everything here is self-adjointed part of minus ID here. So that's so that the minus ID thing. So the minus I d gives us the max of gamma E and gamma m, which gives us the minus that gives us the lower boundary magic polynomial. So we cover thanks to the fact that the spectrum of the shore components contain the spectrum and the motor similar enclosure, a similar convex boring horizontal strip enclosure for spectrum of truly. Spectrum of true dilutions. I mean, I'd say that this is a boring enclosure, but of course, it requires one to be able to check them to realise this relationship between these things in order to make that cleaner and easy as it is. The obvious question is, can we do it again? But I think that before we do that, I might choose a picture. No, comments are on the slide. So, first of all, I should comment on what I mean by the closed numerical range. So, the closed numerical range of an operator of our function bear omega is a set of all omega for which there's some sequence of unit vectors such that these in a product is 10. Such for internet products tends to sooner. Okay, so that's what we mean by the numerical range for an operator non-completed function. But the things I was showing you in the previous slide, this is just the usual closure of the numerical range which is taken, because this operator volume function is linear. But for more general operator volume functions, this could be quite nasty and it might come back quite a bit. So that's what we've seen. We've also got convexity again because of linearity. I haven't said anything about the distinction between the different kinds of spectrum. So, can we distinguish the essential spectrum from the eigenvalues? I'd really like to do that. I'd really like to do that because actually, that's kind of how we got into math. So, we needed to know about the essential spectrum for this other project we were working on, diverse problems for our pax resistance. What if we decide we want to do numerics and we approximate this? Where's the spectral pollution going to land? Because there's going to be spectral pollution, right? You can never get away with that spectral pollution. There's no free lunch. So, for the Drudeler-Enz system, so Drudeler-Enz remember had that rational dependence on omega. So, this thing is not linear anomic at all, it's rational anomaly. So, this thing is not convex, but it turns out kind of viable. Kind of by many compact, it's not too hard to get better estimates of it. Max, surprisingly, is actually harder than document. But I will give you some very specific advice, and then they say. And then um the essential spectrum, I'll also show you where that lies, um but the proofs of this are really hard and technical and so I won't I won't show you those proofs. Okay, so here are some pictures for where the spectrum lies for maximum. I should perhaps tell you what the problem it is that we're solving. Problem is that we're solving. So, if you've got to do new metrics, you have to have a problem to do the new metrics. So, I need to tell you what the coefficients are, what the domain omega is, right? So, this problem here, omega is a little bit more. Semi-infinite wave bag with a rectangular cross-section. Epsilon mu1 and now conductivity sigma is a function of three variables. Well, it's actually equal to one if that x1 is less than one and zero otherwise. So there's a little conductive chunk at the start of the waveguide, and then after that, it's just free space. And the boundary conditions on the boundary of the wave type are tangential components of the electric field per C. So, right, so the reason, of course, for choosing this. The reason, of course, for choosing this example is you can actually solve it by separation of variables. So let me show you what's going on. So the red is the essential spectrum. You'll see that it's covering the real axis except the gap around zero. You'll see there is actually a red dot at zero. Is that a question? Yeah, maybe I didn't get it. Do you assume boundedness of your spatial domain? What we get is. What we got is generally unpound. And uh how do you know that uh the spectrum is discomplete? Well it isn't in general. It isn't. So the red stuff is essential spectrum. It's not the scope. So so this is the essential spectrum here. There's also a point of essential spectrum there which is actually an eigenvalue of infinite mass. An eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. There's a point of essential spectrum here, which is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. And there's another point here at minus a half i, which, what's that? So this stage, if you don't look, the blue stuff, that's that's uh point spectrum, that's eigenvalues, finite multiplicity, you know, boring normal discrete spectrum. Discrete spectrum. And the thing that you notice about this, at this stage, we're ignoring the yellow shading. So the first thing you'll notice about this is that the eigenvalues all stay within the yellow shaded region and you never go down beyond minus a half i. Now over here for this problem, Q max, remember, came from the biggest value of sigma, epsilon is one, so Q max came from the biggest value of sigma, which is one. Value of sigma, which is one, and so the width of this strip here comes down to minus i. Here, this picture, only configuration to minus half i, except for one point, only this one, at minus i. Something really strange is going on there. This is a picture, this is a plot by Salvina Berkeley, who's here in the audience, of level curves of Level curves of bounds where the dissolving of the Maxwell gets regions basically inside this numerical range but outside the spectrum. So inside this kind of bottom half. And now what's this? So if we look at this picture here, it looks as Look at this picture here. It looks as if these two things here are straight lines. The boundaries of these yellow regions are straight lines in the CDs. Actually, they're not. If you zoom in a bit and choose a different scaling, but these things are not straight lines and we know what the equation scales are. So the yellow stuff, yellow shading comes from the variance and the feeling that we have to show it. So this yellow stuff is going to be our best. This yellow stuff is going to be our better bound for the where the spectrum of the Massolear system. So it's essentially half the width of what you get from the numerical range, except in one place where it needs to be a bit bigger, which is heat. So next slide. What about Droodler X? So for Droodler X, you get a different eigenvalue. You let me actually click back. So for Maxo, you see you get these families of eigenvalues. You get these families of eigenvalues lying along curves, which, as their real parts march off to infinity, their imaginary parts go to minus half, which tells you that in some sense there are yellow bands, but it's impossible. For Drudler n's, on the other hand, it's okay, that doesn't happen. So for Drudler n's, when in the real parts the eigenvalues go to infinity, the imaginary parts go to 300k. Parts go to zero. But you go to zero like one over the three parts squared if I've got that. And here you get a funny extra little red dots of essential spectrum sitting outside here. What are those? And there are some other things here. We still have this half half-width phenomenon, and we still have extra stuff here called. Just stop here or imagine the axis sticking out from the bottom of some sort of screen. So now I'm going to tell you what the equations for some of those regions are. So let's do Maxwell first. So this is paper with Sabina Chasewood Cast. Jason Kustian Tretler, which appeared earlier this year. There's a Max Pencil, and where does the spectrum lie? Well, according to this theorem, spectrum either lies on the section of the imaginary axis going down to q max, or if you've got a point in the essential spect in the essential spectrum. The spectrum either lies on the imaginary axis going down to Q max, or if it's not purely imaginary, then first of all, it lies in the strip of half the width, which is what we support. And secondly, it satisfies this inequality of the real power squared minus three times the imaginary part squared plus its constant times the modulus of the imaginary part squared. Not just of the imaginary part greater than or equal to some weird number r. R is determined entirely by the geometry of the domain omega. So this is the first time that you're seeing the geometry of the domain omega curve. It's in that constant R. What's I? Well here's the R partwood constant outside. It is if we don't expect this self-adjoint operator, a curl curve. Self-adjoint operator, a curl curve zero, restricted to divergence between fields. That will always be fitted in the radio zero. Many problems will be strictly positive. It's strictly positive for waveguides, for instance. For waveguides with any finite number of cylindrical lens, it's strictly positive even for region between two, infinite region between two plates. But it's zero if you think about it in the area of domain or if you think about it. Think about it in theory of domain, or if you think about all that. Okay, so the reason that we saw those gaps around zero, the reason that we didn't see any spectrum around zero in those pictures, apart from the one red infinite multiplicity dot at zero itself, was because for the example there, r is positive, check that r is positive, cannot satisfy this inequality. Cannot satisfy this inequality with only zero. It's not small. That's why you get a gap, don't see it. Okay, there's another remark here. Where it's big enough, the pure imaginary spectrum is isolated from the rest of the spectrum to actually satisfy the spectrum. Now proving that, well, we've already got that, but proving this is actually relatively straightforward. You could even probably do two minutes at the end if you'd like to see that. This part is more involved, that's about each and a half of calculation rather than volume. So here's the remarks about where it comes from. So the Maxwell is essentially an operator of this form, and what you were really looking at in the previous slide is operators of this form. Not saying this was known before, we had to prove it. We have to prove it. There's the R. It's there. It's this reduced minimum modulus of the operator B, which in the maximum case is curl zero and B expressive in terms of that other operating control. Right, what about central spectrum? Because if you do numerics, you know that central spectrum is trouble. Not just because it's not clear whether you're going to capture numerically or not, but because you think it's central spectrum, you don't want that. That's kind of the thing that gives the spectral pollution. That's how you get all sorts of artifacts, faced. Artifacts, fake eigenvalues. So we got interested in this, as I've said, because I was working with my late colleague Robert Brighton at PostgreCon, who had to examine for inverse problem for Maxwell systems. We could easily calculate the essential spectrum for a Maxwell system if we were discovering on the period. In fact, on the paper you can find in the literature. Any sort of generality was worked on by Atti Lassis in 1998, which dealt with bounded domains only. So we started working on this eventually with Giovanni Berti Pisa, sorry, Genova, and Ian would generate. It's on the central spectrum. So here's a very, very, very busy slide. I'll take you through as generally as you can a busy slide. So now I'm going to start introducing some hypotheses of the equations. So I want the permeability and the permeability to approach And the permeability to approach scalar values with positive constants of infinity allow the conductivity to go to zero. If Omic is not infinite, you can go look up Mark Lasse's paper. Actually, the way we formulate this in our paper also works for that case too. So, the essential spectrum of the Maxwell system is a union of two parts. So, the first part is It's got a couple of projections on either side, I'll tell you what they are in a minute. But this is the compression of the operator, operator value function of multiplication by this tensor here. So this is a multiplication operator, analytic, quadratic, and spectral parameters. Quadratic and spectral parameter, and then it's been compressed, and we need to know about its essential spectrum. This will essentially not depend on what's happening with infinity, this directly depends on the coefficients. And what's happening with infinity is already dealt with by these hypotheses. So this is something that the numerics should treat well if your numerics can do finitely many problems. Can do finitely problems, which maybe we can, maybe we can't. And then you've got a second part, which is the essential spectrum value of a constant coefficient quadratic pencil. And I'll tell you what that constant coefficient quadratic pencil is. So the constant coefficient quadratic pencil is this one. So remember, this is just a constant, this is just a constant. And this is even in And this is even in H dip0, so divergence free fields. So this curl u inverse curl zero, given that this is a scalar constant, I can take this at the slide, this is actually just Laplacian here. So if you can calculate the essential spectrum of your vector Laplacian in the domain omega, and that will depend only on the geometry of your domain omega. Of your domain omega, then you can calculate what this is. This is now somehow we're regarding this as classical. So this peak delta, this is projection onto the orthogonal quantum of the divergence of green fields. So this is coping with the divergence of three fields. And this which has the projection once they have no compounds of divergence of Realism. Component wheels coming to everything else. And the interesting thing is that all the essential points of the essential spectrum are either purely real or purely imaginary. There's nothing else. There's no essential spectrum lying on exotic curves like you're doing in face of stuff. It's all either purely real or purely imaginary. Story is different for Drupal Regiments. That's. That's the truth. I guess maybe you need the condition on how quickly hepsinon converges to slow. It can be as slow as you like, yeah. Just needs to be uniform in direction. So given an epsilon, there exists an R slash for all mod x greater than R, etc., etc. No, you don't need any greater. You don't need any rate of comparisons. Can I ask another question since we've interrupted? The spectrum that you displayed earlier was determined entirely through separation of variables, no numerics? That's right, yes. I mean, there were some numerics to solve the transcendental equations. Yeah, okay. I have to say it's mathematical geometry or even put with the concept. Okay, so let me try and explain why the proof is technical. Try and explain why the proof is technical and therefore why I'm not going to show you the proof. First of all, if you know about calculating the essential spectrum of shredding in operators, you know that you can change the potential in a shredding operator of a compact set and the essential spectrum doesn't change. That's true. This is not true for maximum. We can change the epsilon and the sigma, not the epsilon and the sigma, we can change those arbitrarily small. Arbitrarily small open set, we will change the essential spectrum. One change that bit will change that. Okay, that's the first thing. This means things like glass money composition don't really work anymore. Hammett tried to characterize the essential spectrum by cutting the domain into two pieces, matching across the boundaries of some maximum version of telephoto. Maxwell version and technical to models. Okay, um, now what we can do is we can still use sure complements. So this is the sure complement associated, the first sure complement associated with the Maxwell system. Okay, so it's still got all its fully variable coefficients that I haven't done anything to yet. And what I can do with that is I can now split that, not according to the electric and the fields, but According to the elements of the composition, so I can split this in yeah, so see what I've done here is I've written it. So here you've got bit that's bordered by projections P delta, here you've got bordered by I minus P delta, and here you've got the off diagonal, where the I minus P delta and the P delta are there. P Delta and the P Delta are on the right and left, and there's an additional compact. That top right hand red corner, the algorithm D2 is compact thanks to these hypotheses. So calculating the essential spectrum, you can throw it away. This is great, okay, because now you have got a triangular block operator matrix, and you think, I am. Matrix, and we think I know how to calculate the spectrum of a triangular block of matrix. It is the union of the spectra of that blocks is this one is that one and this one, once you've thrown away some compact bits, will become that one. Yeah, that doesn't work for a central sketch. It's very easy to write down a plot. Block two by two, triangular cooperator for which that decomposition doesn't work. What's the easiest one we can do? Well, let's do L2 of Z and let's do the unilateral shift operator, which is all ones on the sub diagonal. Okay, so. Okay, so we know what the essential spectrum of that is, it's the unit circle. But if you look at the essential spectrum of that bit, or the essential spectrum of that bit, you get the unit disc. And this is zero. So you need to go away and convince yourself for the Maxwell system, you can get away with it. You really can decompose the essential spectrum. G2 and O is the essential spectrum. It's the union of the essential spectrum of the two blocks. And the thing that makes it one is the fact that this bottom block B has a property means J self-adjointness, which you already see here in the form of. So J self-adjointness means I get the adjoint of this thing by changing I to minus light I. Now let's think about that other thing, the compressed multiplication exit. So if you know about spectral pollution, then you will not be at all surprised that there exist examples. That there exist examples for which this multiplication operator is invertible, but this compressed multiplication operator isn't invertible. That just affects the spectral collision. I mean, I'm not sure if it's proper to have the spectral collision here because it's not like P delta was just invented by us as a result of choosing some substandard numerical scheme. P-delta instead of. Scheme, P delta instead of its mathematical right. Anyway, this is essentially the same problem. So how can we try to understand what's the spectrum of this compressed multiplication operator? So when we wrote this paper, we kind of felt that part of the job was done as a result of having that decomposition, but actually dealing with this part turned. This dealing with this part turns out to be a huge thing that indeed I'm going to propose really dealing with this and any sort of generalities. So you can do some messing around with this P delta is one minus projection onto H div zero, the divergence of the flows. And you can prove that the spectrum of this is equal to the spectrum of this div coefficient GRAD operator. So this Grad operators. So this second order partial differential operator acting from H10 to H minus 1. This is H10 dot, by the way. So therefore Levi space, which means it's the completion of CC infinity functions in just the H1 semi-norm, which by the Caliabda-Nirenberg inequality means that, for example, if you're working in RV, the L. Now V the elements that are in there would be an L6, but not generally an L2. So we don't tend to see it fast enough necessarily to be connected. Okay, so what can we say about the spectrum of this thing? So the obvious thing to do, first of all, is to do is to go back to your example and see if you can actually calculate that for a concrete case. Concrete case. So here's our waveguide partitioned off the conducted bit at the start. This is a weird guy. Because it's all weird for sure. No, no, no, there's we just at the beginning we were confused by omega being zero one times zero two times zero infinity and then sigma depends on x one less than one, which is always true, which is always true if that ordering was correct. Ah, but on your slides it is different. Yeah. Exactly. Thank you. But now on the slides, but the slide doesn't your example case in the slide doesn't. Your examples of this light doesn't look affected. Don't worry about it. Yeah, it should be infinity here, right? Trouble when they're going to put the talks online later. Okay, so so you've gone through a calculation. So how do you do the calculation? So, how do you do the calculation? So, part of this calculation you can do immediately without thinking. So, why is it that omega equals zero is neither wouldn't be wrong? Answer, well, if I could, what we get equals zero this term is wrong. So, now let me take, let me look at the set outside this applause of sigma. So, look out here. Take a C0 infinity, C C infinity function out here. Okay, take its. Here, okay, take its gradient, whatever that is. It will be careful if this thing here because it's supported by outside support of that, and this is zero because omega is zero, and this then after zero gets gone. So, omega equals zero is an eigenvalue of the infinite multiplicity. Omega equals minus i is an eigenvalue multiplicity by taking a CC in terms of the functions that go here. Step there. Then, the question is: how do you get? Quickly, how do you get minus i 2? And that's complicated, unfortunately. Okay, so the way that you get minus i over 2 is you sit down and you think, well, suppose I was trying to solve the equation from the rad u equals zero along the gap. So I would try to solve it from here, and I would try to solve it from here, and then I try to match across the boundary between them. And what would be my matching condition across the boundary? So my matching condition across the boundary would be obviously that I want u to be continuous, but I'd also want p times the normal derivative of u to be continuous. But because p changes sign when I choose this minus i over 2, so when I choose minus i over 2 here as my value, then logical factor of minus i, this coefficient takes a value minus 1 on one side and plus 1 on the other. So if you're thinking you've got exactly the opposite Thinking you've got exactly the opposite of the matching condition you would have if you were just taking the Laplacian and introducing an artificial cut. What this is saying is that you want to take the diriglitin back from the left, take the dirtlighten Neumann back from the right, not add them and hopefully find something occur, but subtract them and find something occurring. And find something compared. When you subtract them, they're both pseudo-differential operators of order one with the same principal symbol. So a lot of stuff cancels. And you can look back not so many years ago, around about 2010, there was a paper called, I think it was David Krashiric. And were you the other author, Petter? No. So they did an example in which they just took two. Example in which they just took two identical rectangles, glued them together, put the p equals one there and minus one there. In that case, you know, essentially the data with the other mark is cancelled completely by symmetry and everything sort of symmetry. So, this is why this minus i over 2, which is literally the arithmetic mean of these two, comes as Now, you can also do this using biosingular sequences. So, you can find the eigenfunctions associated with the sum of the director math, and work out the biosingular sequences called Maxwell's system, which are written down here. So, when you write this down in terms of the eigenfunctions of the reduced Laplace cross-section, the cross-section is rectangular, it doesn't have to be. It doesn't have to be rectangular. I mean, this could even honestly be a manifold. It would just be looking at the classical Trammy operator in the manifold. What you see here is that as you go up the spectrum in the transverse operator, so as you go to the higher eigenvalues in the transverse direction, the functions that you get decay rapidly, more rapidly, as you move away from the Rapidly as you move away from the interface. So, what you get is you get a bicycular sequence of almost eigenfunctions that concentrate exponentially close to the interface between the conductive and the non-conductive regions. Post-doc Alexis Lefken Menko told me that physicists referred to these sorts of functions as black hole modes, because they're radio. Okay, because they're radiate out so little that you basically don't see them. Okay, so I'm over time. Tim to mention your problems anymore. I think we should certainly mention your problems. So we have time for discussion too. Do we want to st is this your last? The next slide would can't be the last one. It's the one with no problems. Okay, do you want to stop here? We'll take some questions on it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Well, part of it.
