For a lot of reasons. The first one is that this problem uses very basic tools and also very visual. And the other one is that I find about this problem here. Maybe four years ago when I started, I was just starting my PhD, and this is related. This is related with the perpetratorium, and this event is about classical results. And where when a let's start. Oh, something happened with the something this thing moves a little bit. Sorry about that. Oh, yeah, I don't know what's happening. Okay, let's start again. We will start. We will start talking about words and graphs, then these concepts. Then I'll recall the turbulent and I will define these objects, nerves of point partitions. And finally, we will talk about the problem. This problem is about bipartite graphs. Okay, words and graphs. If we have a graph, we will say that this graph is representable if Graph is core representable if there exists a word with alphabet in the set of vertices such that the letters X and Y alternating in the word W if and only if the pair X and Y is an edge in the set of edges of G. And we say that this word represents G and this word is called a word representant for G. If we have a graph that it's word representable, but the word Word representable, but the word have exactly k copies of every letter. This will be a k word representable graph, right? For example, here we have this graph to the left. And if we look at the edge one and two, and we look at the ones and twos here in the world, and we forget about the other numbers, we find an alternating sequence here. The same happened if. The same happens if we focus on the H23 and we forget about the other letters in the word. We have an alternating sequence, but the pair one and four is not an edge in our graph. Then if we look at these letters here, we have that this is not an alternating sequence, the same for the one and three. And then this is a graph, and this is the Then this is a graph, and this is the word that represents this graph. In this case, two words represents this graph. These graphs were defined by Sergei Kitaev. And if you want to know a little bit more about these subjects, this book is really good. But in this talk, we will use a little bit definite. Use a little bit different definition, right? We will say that a graph is generally representable if there exists a word, again, without alphabet in the set of vertices, such that an edge belongs to this, a pair belongs to the set of edges, if and only if there exists an alternating subword with length d plus two. There is a big difference with that exactly. That exactly these letters x and y, and we'll say that this word is the general D-word representant for G. For example, here in this graph, if we look at the H2 and 3, and we forget about the other numbers, the other letters here, we have an alternating sub-sequence. In this case, the alternating sub-sequence have length 4d plus 2. This is a two-word representation. This is a two-word representant for this graph. But for example, look at this other edge here. We have the edge two, six. And if we look at the twos and six in this word and we forget about the other letter, this is not an alternating sequence, but there is a sub-sequence that have exactly length four, right? This is the main difference between this definition and the Sergei's definition. Sergei's definition. Okay. In this talk, I will say sometimes the representable and the representant for G in order to that this talk will be more easy. A few results is that, for example, in the case of the definition, the surrogates definition, not every graph is K-world representable, but it's easy to see that in this definition. That in this definition, every graph is generally representable, right? For some D. This is a fair result, but not every graph can be obtained in every D, right? For example, these graphs here are not two representable graphs. You cannot obtain this in a word that use for. For a subsequence of length four, then it's interesting to ask, it's a natural question: what is the minimum D that we need in order to represent these graphs as a word, right? And what is the minimum length? It's important to say that for a specific graph, maybe there are a lot of different words that represents this graph, but what is the minimum length for this graph? About what is the minimum length for these words? That is another interesting question. Then let me recall the Torbert theorem. I say that I already know that all of you know this theorem very well, but this theorem said that if you have a set of points in Rd with a lot of points, when a lot of points means at least d plus one times r minus one plus one points. times r minus one plus one points then there is a partition such that into r part such that if you take take the convex hole of the different parts you have a these different convex holes have no empty intersection right a quick example if you have 10 points on the plane this theorem guarantees that there exists a four partition such that if you take the Partition such that if you take the convex all of the parts, all these convex have no empty intersection. Let me define also, I will glue together all this stuff for the main problem, but let me define the nerves. If you have a family of convex sets, you will construct the nerve of this family in the following way. You put a vertex for every one of the convexes and The convexes, and if two of them have no empty intersection, you put an edge between the corresponding vertices. If three of them have no empty intersection, you will put a full triangle and so on. You will obtain a simplicial complex like this one. And this is the simplicial complex associated to that family of convex sets. This is the nerve of that family. But again, in this talk, we will modify, we will use a little bit different. Use a little bit different definition for nerves. We start with a set of points. We assign to this set a partition. And if we have this pair, the set and the partition, we can assign a nerve for that. We can induce a nerve because you take the convex hull of the different parts and you obtain a nerve in the same way, right? Then with this idea, With this idea, we can rephrase the Turbert theorem. The Turbert theorem in this philosophy says that if you have a lot of points, there is a partition such that you can obtain the R minus one simplex. Then the R minus one simplex is obtained is D Turbert for every D, right? That is the rephrase of the Turbert theorem in this philosophy. Some interesting questions. Some interesting questions are what other simplicial complexes satisfy this property, right? What other simplicial complexes arise as NERPs when we have enough points? What is the minimum dimension in order to do that? And how many points we will require, how many points we need that our set have in order to. Or set have in order to obtain a partition that indoes these things, some notation. We will say that these kind of simplicial complex are deterred, if we can obtain it. And the minimum number that points that we need to have, the set, it's the Twerbert number for this implicit complex in dimension D, and it's the node. It's the node like that. It's easy to see that not every simplicial complex is d-to-verse for every d you can you can check this very easily. We are in dimension one. Every nerve that we can obtain have the one skeleton of this nerve is an intersection graph. And no, every graph is an intersection graph. Then you can obtain every simplicial complex in every. Every simplicial complex in every dimension, also by Helly, if we have three elements that have intersection by pairs, we will have a full triangle. We cannot obtain simply complex without Carnita empty triangles, right? Then all this philosophy was born in this paper by Jesus de Loera and the By Jesus de Lobera and Deborah Liberos and two of their students, Thomas and Dominic. Jesus de Lobera talked about this problem four years ago, and that's the reason why I think that this problem is interesting. They prove in this paper that graphs as the trees and the cycles are deterred for every dimension greater or equal to two. Every dimension greater or equal to two, they give some bones and they give some constructions, right? But in this paper, they ask about other families. First, they ask if there's a complex that you cannot obtain as an ERF in every dimension, right? Also, they ask about bipartite graphs. What happened with bipartite? Exactly, that is the problem that we will talk about today. Recall this graph. I already said that this graph is not too representable. There's not a word for this graph. This is also a bipartite graph. And if you play a little bit with this, you can prove easily that this is not too terrible. That this is not too terrible. You can imagine that all your points are lying in a circle, and you can obtain this graph. It's a little bit easy to check that. But we obtained this theorem here. This theorem said that if for every bipartite, there is a D, there is a dimension such that you can obtain that graph as a nerve, right? That graph is d-turb. Wrap is detur. I will talk about the proof. The proof uses, as I already said, only basic tools, only basic stuff, and it's very visual. Then you start with your favorite bipartite graph, this one, for example. And there is a word that preps. And there is a word that represents this bypart in some dimension, for example, this word here. The technique that Deborah and Jesus use in this paper that I'm talking about was something like they have a set of points, they use the Erdo-Schecker theorem that says that if you have a Theorem that says that if you have a set of points, really, really big, you can find points in convex position, a subset in convex position, and they construct in this set the bipartisan the graph, and then they extend the coloring to the other points in that way that the graph remains as an error. That is exactly the idea that I will follow, but first imagine that this. Imagine that these points are in R3, right? Then I will use Erdos Chekeres, but the multi-dimensional version by Grom van Cordo-Belanducci. And this version said that if you have, again, a lot of points, you can find a subset of these points, but this subset lie in a curve that is combinatorically equivalent to the moment curve, right? Then all the characteristics remain. The all the characteristics remain in this curve. And there is a way, if we forget about the other points, if we only focus on these points, there is a natural partition for these points that comes that arise for this word here, right? And now, a purely, if we take the convex all of, we can think this. The convex soul of we can think this partition as chromatic classes. If we take the convex hole of these different chromatic classes, we don't know anything about what NERP industries, what NERP this convex system does. But we have this theorem, Brienne's theorem, that says that if you have two set of points lying in the moment curve, you take the convex hole of A and B. This convex will be will have no empty intersection if and only if you can find a subsequence with length t plus two, right? And this is why we define the general words as we did. Then this, no, I sleep very well twice. Oh, okay. Okay, you don't know why I. Okay. Okay. Then we use this theorem in order to define our graphs. This graph is constructed in that way. Then these convex sets indoors exactly your favorite bipartite, but what about the other points? We need to extend the coloring. And a good thing about curves like this one is that we can think, we can end the resort this stuff. We can end the reserve this stuff, we can think as a line, we can, and we construct this world with some characteristics. First characteristic is that if we focus on the vertices and ABC vertices, we can see that all the orange points here, if we take the convex hole of the orange points in the interior of this convex hole, we only can Convex hole, we only can find points with red and green. And the red and green are related to vertices that are adjacent to the vertice A, right? The same happened here with the points with blue and the same with the points in purple. Then we can think that maybe if we color all the other points in this region with color orange, we can extend. Orange, we can extend the coloring in, and we will paint that as an herb. And this other with blue, and this other with purple, but we can we may have some things like this. We may have an intersection between the convex hole of the blues and the reds, and that implies that will imply that there is an edge between B and D, but that's not true. B and D, but that's not true. Then it's not too easy. The extension, that is also the bad thing about this technique that is very difficult to extend the coloring. But we use the Gale sickness condition and this thing that arises from that theorem that is. That theorem that is, if you have the moment group, if you put D points on the moment group, these points define a hyperplane, right? In R3, you put three points and the hyperplane, divide your combat, your curb into D plus one regions, and you know where these regions are. I mean, these hyper. I mean, this hyperplane H, defined two semi-spaces, H plus and H1. And the first region in the moment, like in, let's say, H plus, this one lies in H minus and so on, right? And if we color all the points, if we choose If we choose wisely where we need to put these points, we can let in one semi-space only points with color. We will use now the colors of the other part of the vertices. We can let only red points in these parts, and we color, we extend the coloring in this, we extend the coloring for all the We extend the column for all the points here with red, and we forget about this region and we continue doing this process exactly, exactly this process. Again, we divide now the other semi-space and so on and so on. And we extend our coloring in that such that we obtain exactly this bipartite as NERP, right? As NERP, right? Then that is the sketch of the proof for this theorem. And it is good to know that every bipartite graph can be obtained in some dimension, but there are other families of bipartites, of bipartite graphs that have more structure. Then the part of the extension is easier. And we can improve the bone. Can improve the bones, for example, for hypercubes and prisms. On some kind of prisms, we can obtain, for example, that prisms can be obtained in dimension four or greater than that. And some open questions about RS is what other families can be obtained using this technique because maybe we can use this technique. We can use this technique and other interesting thing is: can we characterize the one-turber simply cell complex? Can we say what needs to have this simply cell complex in order to be obtained as a one-turber nerves? What is the exact value for simply cell complex as trees, cycles, and the bipolar? Trees, cycles, and the bipartites, because we use the Erdosker's theorem, and that gives us a lot of points. That is not even close to the real bound, right, for this number. What is the computational complexity in order to determine if a point set in those specific simplicial complex bibliography? It's important to say that Florian and AMC, one of his students, they One of his students, they generalized these ideas and in this paper they define quick turbo complexes and it's a beautiful paper too. If you want to know a little bit more, and that's it. Thank you. Maybe for the characterization of one fervor complexes? Yeah, um so she said they had to be interval interface graphs. But do you know if they are oh that was a mistake? I was thinking about two turbo complexes. Yeah, yeah, this question is integral graph. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is a mistake. This is a two. Okay. Yeah, and in that sense, we have some things, we have some constructions. We have some constructions that if you have a specific graph, you can extend this coloring, but we don't have the characterization, the complete characterization. You said that it's not known that every complex is a deterrent for some D, right? Yeah, it's not the smallest example for which we know. The smallest example, we in the purpose of Florian and AMC, they give a construction that, for example, if you they this construction give you a bipartite graph that you cannot obtain this graph for some dimension for every dimension. But we don't know if there is a simplicial complex that you never can obtain. Thing but that one is not by particular what the construction the ncm yeah they construct uh their construction is is for bipartites you give uh you you choose a dimension and they construct a bipartite that you cannot obtain in that dimension but i don't know if that was all right so there is you said it there is no there isn't it is we don't know if there's a complex which we which is uh not representable Not representable. So, what's the smallest example which we don't know if it is or it's not? I don't know. I don't have an example that I think that is not the representable. That is the representation. That if I have an example. Every example you can write down, we can actually prove, but it just didn't. Okay. Okay. Oh, it it didn't. Yeah, it's okay. So for for this characterization. uh for for for this characterization still like do you think that uh it's it's possible like like uh it also could be computationally hard right yeah i think i think so you're you're talking about the two turbo simplicide complexes yeah we we think that that for example we have that if you take a um graph that is a free triangle graph and this graph you can prove that you can obtain it Graph, you can prove that you can obtain it in convex position. Then we have a way in order to extend this coloring, and we have that, for example, that kind of graphs can be obtained, but we don't know too much more about it. Then let's thank Antonio again.
