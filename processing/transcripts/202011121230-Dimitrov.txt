And he's speaking about arithmetic holonomicity and algebraic dynamics. Thank you very much. It is a great pleasure to be able to participate in this wonderful conference and workshop. I learned a lot from the previous talks. I hope my topic will fit into some of the themes presented at the workshop. I begin with the motivation. With a motivation from the field of algebraic dynamics that first got me to think about arithmetic rationality criteria of the kind that I will discuss. And then there is a more recent development which exposes a joint work with Frank Caligari and Yun Ching Tang for the second part around arithmetic holonomicity in the theory of G functions and an application. G functions and an application that I hope to outline. We consider the familiar setting from algebraic dynamics, where I take an iteration, an endomorphism of affine space, and that's a dynamical system of the s about the simplest non-trivial kind. We do not have a it does not extend to a projective space endomorphism, but it is given by polynomials in the coordinate. By polynomials in the coordinates. So, this is a polynomial map, and I consider a second coordinate, I'll call it lambda, that denotes a regular function, just again a morphism, or just a polynomial. And we ask for the growth behaviors of the height. This will be over a global field k. And we take any orbit, the intention is it should be pretty arbitrary, and just record the values of the coordinates. Just record the values of the coordinate lambda or the function lambda along the orbit. So we ask, how can this grow and also the sequence of degrees if it is not eventually periodic? And we start with a very obvious observation, just set theoretically. If you had an iteration set theoretical from Z D to the to Z D, let's see how the dimension will come into play in the bounce we can expect and or We can expect and/or improve. Just by the pigeonhole principle, this is the Northcott trivial bound. If the orbit is not essentially periodic, then just by arranging the orbit by increasing height, arranging points by a bounded height, noting that there are at most that many points of height at most these and of coordinates at most this, where I will use. And of coordinates at most this, where I will use the logarithmic height. Then we have a very obvious a priori bound. There is a dichotomy that either the orbit must be finite or the logarithmic height roughly grows at least like n to the power 1 over d in the sense of taking the Limpsoup along the orbit. I'd like to start here because this will bring, will also mention some interesting Mention some interesting work on this subject to which my criteria also relate. And the arithmetic criteria will enter in the following way. Instead of doing this set theoretically, we can just, so let's now give the map an algebraic structure. I have a polynomial in the variables. For simplicity here, I assume it takes z to the d to z to the d. And we reduce module of primes and do the same observation that the reduced orbit, well, it just It just acts on a finite set of cardinality, the number of FP points, mod p points. So it must be pre-periodic, and its pre-period and period are both bounded by this. And a very convenient way to use this is on the level of the generating function. Now, if lambda is another polynomial this time function to z, then the we We record our orbit history on a formal power series, which will be a generating function with integer coefficients in this case. And it has various mod P rationality conditions that the reduction mod P of this power series we have seen must be rational just by just by pigeonhole, but because we have a finite iteration on a finite set. And the degree of this rational function is at most p to the d. And here is a The D. And here is a criterion of this kind that will immediately lead a lower bound on the growth of the orbit. I think I, well, essentially all of this goes back to a short paper of Zanier from 1981, published in Actarithmetica. I actually have the reference below on my slides. Also, in the full generality, in higher dimension as well, I outline, I have a short preparation. A short preprint on archive with this criterion. It reads as follows: although Daniel considered the language of linear recurrent sequences, looking at the coefficients of the power series. But on the level of power series, it reads, we have f of x formal power series over a global field k. And for every place v at which we can reduce mod v, let's consider. mod v. Let's consider the degree of the reduction if the reduction is a rational function. And if the reduction does not exist or is not a rational function, I'll just take the convention that dv is just infinity. And then we have the criterion that this formal power series is in fact a rational power series just as soon as this inequality is fulfilled. Inequalities fulfilled. And now for this talk, the quantity on the right will be ubiquitous. And this is a standard notion of height for my power series. I'll call it the height of the power series. I use this subscript k just to keep the general case in mind, because, but maybe you want maybe it is good to restrict to the rational field q, then I will omit the index. Q, then I will omit the index. Just include the global function field case as well, where we have no ground field. And then the condition is this inequality on the residue of the finite fields, finite residue fields. It roughly says that if we have enough mod P rationality in a quantitative sense against the growth of the coefficients of the function, ultimately. Of the function, ultimately all comes down to the product formula in the global field, then the function is rational. In fact, this is obviously a characterization. The converse is trivial. So this completely characterizes the rational functions in an arithmetic way. The proof is a typical use of Ziggles lemma. And I'll just indicate quickly because the theme will recur in the more recent. In the more recent criteria, we can use m equations in m variables for these choices. And there was this parameter kappa in the criterion that will come from exactly Siegel's lemma as the Dirichlet exponent. And then we construct, this is typical transcendence extrapolation proof with auxiliary construction, with Typhoid and auxiliary construction, which is the approximate relation. We solve a linear system of We solve a linear system of equations for a polynomial q with integer coefficients and small height. We have degrees of p and q bounded by this and height bounded by that, and then extrapolate the coefficients using the mod p information. This is like the trivial Bezu bound in the projective space over the residue fields for all V, just the bound on the intersection multiplicity at zero by the total degree. And then we use the product formula. And then we use the product formula, and the details are quite easy. Again, here is the reference to the original paper. Actually, it's 1982. And I also mentioned that this is, in fact, the optimal version is not what I wrote. Following the generalization of the conjecture of Ruja on pseudo-polynomials, the shark version should delete somehow the parameter kappa that. The parameter kappa that I will not discuss, but that came artificially in Siegel's lemma. In the applications of the arithmetic colonistic theorem, this will be the key point, however, in the analogous setting that I'll turn to. And this is used, I think I sketched how this should imply a lower bound on the orbit growth for iterations of affine space because. Affine space because the iteration has a model as well as the lambda over the s integers for a finite set of places. S. The full height history is just controlled by just the vein height of the individual coordinates. The whole orbit is S integral. We have the prime number theorem that tells us exactly how much multiportionality we have. And you see the dimension occurring here because of as one over d in the exponent, because I know the reduction mod v is a rational function bounded of degree bounded by that. So this is ultimately how it enters. And finally, we get the following. The rationality criterion does much better, essentially improves the previous, the trivial counting bound by Northcott by an exponential. It turns out It follows that either our orbit recorded by the coordinate lambda, I mean by the observable, by the function lambda, is either piecewise and a polynomial. Piecewise means that the large enough n partition into finitely many arithmetic progressions, and on each of them, these coordinates is a polynomial in n. Or else we have this, where now notice that. This, where now notice that my height function was logarithmic, and I've taken the log of the logarithmic height on, and also I have included the individual lambda here. That is still not trivial from the North Coal boundary, just for the full orbit growth. So, this is the exponential improvement in particular. And all right, I think I repeated the last display. Did the last display. And also, I'll just mention that one can use a specialization argument to the global field to also get an implication from this arithmetic statement, this arithmetic method, to a purely algebraic statement about the growth of degrees. But in restricted situation, again, we must and then lambda is just a polynomial map. Then we Then we know that the sequence of these degrees, again, I think what makes it non-trivial is that I have first taken lambda and then composed with the nth iterate, is either eventually periodic or unbounded. And if it's unbounded, there is some explicit but horrible lower bound on the growth. So before I turn to the holonomicity. To the holonomicity versions of such criteria, I want to point out some related work by different methods that there is the theorem of UA that contains exactly this kind of bound on the degree, but for the full degree, there is no lambda involved. Involved. And it is, I think, more general that it applies not only to morphisms of affine space, but any endomorphism of an affine variety. And also, even for the Lie minf of the height, there is this work of Cantat and Mixier giving divergence of Li-minf if the sequence of degrees is not eventually periodic. And in the setting of rational Of rational megamorphic algebraic dynamics, where we have any dominant rational self-map of a quasi-projective variety, then again we have the same observation starting from Northcott on the Limb soup of this kind of growth. But this is for the full height and it does not include the lambda. The orbit is not sampled on a fixed The orbit is not sampled on a fixed function. You cannot look at just one coordinate. And I would like to point out that it seems this same bound, if you put lambda of fn of p, should be also fulfilled with exactly this gap of one over the dimension of x, just as soon as the orbit is not piecewise polynomial in n. And no, sorry, and that is, I apologize. And that is, I apologize that this is how it should read this. It's not quite right. I should have the orbit to be not a piecewise polynomial or mathematic progressions. And however, there is recent work that I'll indicate on the next slide that does show the positivity of this incomplete generality. And these are the references. I think, please correct me if I get it wrong, but I think there is no, so there is some explicit bound, but it's worse than one over the dimension of the variety. I think this should be expected. And there was the paper by Bell, Giocca, and Satyano in the case where F is an endomorphism by a pieric analytic method, as opposed to this one, which is spot P but. opposed to this one which is spot p but where p varies and i think in full generality and even more recent paper oh i apologize i um do not okay i think on the slides i sent you there i have updated the uh the publication the the full reference for this paper which is in the case of a rational self-map um now i turn to uh to more uh uh general criteria General criteria. And I will introduce the height, a bit of notation that I already mentioned. This is for any global field. And there is also another standard notion that I will call the tau. Tau of F is what remains of the height after you take account of all the convergence radii. So that means that the full height. that the full height will decompose into an analytic piece, so to speak, which will be just the log quas of one over the convergence radius of the power series. And so this would be the case if the coefficients were s integral for a set of places s. But in general, think of the logarithm series, for example. For example, the convergence regia are all one and the height is one by the prime number theorem. So, in general, there remains another part that is the true denominators part, true arithmetic part, if that makes sense, of the height. So, technically, it's defined by this formula that you first take a finite set of places, then you consider the same growth rate of the height, but after it's depleted, you remove the contribution. It's depleted, you remove the contributions from the finite set of places, and finally, you see how small can make that if by increasing the finite set of places. So, the moral of this is that tau is zero if the coefficients are s integer for a finite set of places, and the condition tau equal to zero should be read as a slightly weaker quantitative version of s integer coefficients. S integer coefficients appear in the most Celebrated classical rationality criterion, the one of Emil Borel that Dwork revised in his work on the congruence zeta function. He used it to prove the rationality of the zeta function of any variety over a finite field. And we will include this. So the first result on this will be And the result on this will be a refinement of the theorem of Borga and work, that also will be the sharp strengthening of the theorem from Andre's book, G functions and geometry. The brand work criterion will be the case where tau is equal to zero, essentially, as integer coefficients. And the improvement will be essentially Will be essentially by completely deleting the parameter kappa that was artificial and we saw earlier. But in this context, I will not include mod P conditions at all. I'll just limit the discussion to viadic analytic conditions. So as in the Broadwork criterion, the viadic conditions are that, well, we consider the largest radius of Meromorphy of the formal power series F. Power series f. We can do this for every place V of the global field, and that means that we can express f of x as a quotient of two convergent power series on the viadic disk of a given radius Rv. So I guess I should write, sorry, I should write Mv of F or M V is the largest such radius. And then the criterion for this For the first new theorem on this subject, but it is a sharp rationality criterion. It states that f is rational just as soon as this holds. The sum of all the logarithms of all the Meromorphic ADI is greater than this tau invariant that I introduced. So when the coefficients were s integer, the right-hand side is zero. The right-hand side is zero, and that's just a familiar condition of Borel and Ward that you have meromorphy on disks or poly disks whose product of radii strictly exceeds one. But so what improves, so this will be just a small improvement. After all, I will use Andre's own method, but show how a multivariable use of his methods allows to bypass Allows to bypass an artificial constant that he had. So his theorem had a weaker condition, certain absolute constant times this tau invariant. And this is sharp because conversely now for any collection of such radii of real numbers, there is a continuum, not just uncountably many, but in fact the cardinality is the continuum of. Cardinality is the continuum of a formal power series that are even convergent on those disks, and where this turns out an equality. So as soon as we have a strict inequality, we have a countably many unin fact, all of them are just rational functions. This is a complete characterization of rational functions. For the so sorry, thank you for the question. So in I should say, yes, I want to consider the radius of meromorphy. So the largest Rv is what we define to be MV of F. And the remainder, now I turn to holonomicity. And the results that follow are joint from In from a work in progress with Frank Caligari and Yoon Ching Tang. All possible errors in these examples. I hope everything is fine, but everything that is not fine is entirely my own responsibility. We have also filtered invariants that So, I define the invariant tau of f, but for any integer, we can consider a sequence of decreasing numbers by just looking at the string of, not the entire initial string of coefficients of the power series, but all coefficients in degrees between these two multiples of n. And then And then we will have an improvement of the criterion that is sometimes useful. Here are some examples. The polylogarithmic series have a tau invariant equal to k, but indeed this sequence of filtered invariants is strictly decreasing to zero. The tau r of the k-th poly logarithm series is just the asymptotic density of the primes up to n. Of the primes up to n that divide some number in the range that we use. And that range comes up in the ziggo lemma proof in a similar way to the proof I sketched of the first criterion. However, this modification will have tau equal to k for all k and r, so the sequence will not decrease. Not decrease. So we work in a more general setting that this follows Andre's approach that we can call simultaneous meromorphic uniformization. We don't, instead of asking for f of x to be meromorphic on a disk of a given radius, we will ask for both x. will ask for both x of z and f of x of z to be to be meromorphic on a disk in the z plane. And I will use a notation for the poly disk of radius Rv in this sense that it is an equalized polydisc. We take the same radius for all the coordinates and the obvious extension The obvious extension of my notation with these invariants in the multivariate setting using the total degree. And we look at the growth rate of the vector of coefficients of a bounded total degree. I apologize, I should follow the chat. Okay, there is nothing new. And here is the setting that we all remain. We all the remaining criteria are placed. We look at a radius for each place of V and a holomorphic mapping, that's just a convergent power series, for every place into C V to the D, it's from the D-dimensional poly disc with this normalization. That is all I ask of the map. Ask of the map, this is like a substitution, but it should be normalized to have a unit derivative at the origin. Otherwise, it has just transcendental coefficients. And also, we ask that it should be, and this is very important for the criterion, it should be trivial for all but finitely many v. X V of Z is just identity for all but finitely many V. I will call this an atelic template because I will be interested to feel the solutions. To fill the solutions of this template. And by that, I mean the solutions will be the formal power series in d variables with this property that when you do the substitution f of x of z at every place and then look at the z plane or in the dimensional polydisc, then we get a germ of a We get a germ of a Meromorphic function on that polydisc. But I also again stress that I allow this f of x of z to be meromorphic in z, but I insist, and that is will be a crucial restriction because Andre's method is more general, I insist x of z to be holomorphic in z. And then the basic problem will be to describe all the solutions. All the solutions of this for a given data. This is the starting datum, and then to find all the formal power series with these properties subject to denominator constraints. For example, on the invariance tau of f or the more precise denominator information for f. In this language, the rationality theorem is expressed like Like this. If we take, let's limit to dimension one here, and then we take x of z to be z at every place with some radius rv. And then all the formal solutions of this inequality, time invariance more than the sum of the logs of all the radii, precisely the rational power series. We complement this by dropping this restriction that the substitutions are all the identity. And now we can make any substitution which is holomorphic such that f of x of z is meromorphic at every place v. And now if this And then we also relax the condition a bit to the sum of the logs of all the radii, the total arithmetic degree that we have, to be strictly larger than the tau infinity filtered invariant. So this is the limit of all the tau r. If this is confusing, then just put tau of f here. That would be a special case. So the simplest version. So, the simplest version of the theorem states that such formal power series are necessarily definite power series. They are holonomic functions, and they are solutions of linear differential equations over the function field k of x. I state a special case of the main Delphantine criterion in Andre's book with the Maildin variant. With a mild invariant to the filtered invariant that I point out. And in our notation, I must stress it is very important to additionally assume the set of places in the criterion must be finite. Otherwise, actually, the proof breaks down. And it reads this way. Suppose we have these substitutions. Additionally, I will have a second piece. I will have a second bit of notation to denote the maximum SV of the absolute value of X on the disk, on the poly disk. So we suppose we have holomorphic mappings that send the poly disc of radius Rv to the poly disc of radius Sv. Of course, S must be at least R, just by Schwarz's lemma. And if X equals Z, then we have the equality. And then Um and Andre's Delphantine criterion gives um linear relationship over uh the uh function field. It states that if there is a parameter kappa that arises similarly in Sido's lemma, the slides actually, the extended slides indicate the full proof of this criterion taken from Andre's book. And if but I will just indicate But I will just indicate the choices of the parameters involved. If this holds for some kappa, then the template problem, simultaneous uniformization problem, has at most n minus one independent solutions over a function field. Again, it is a similar kind of inequality. Kind of inequality. If you like, it's also possible to include mod p conditions, reducing also the power series that some of the primes, like we had in the first criterion. The parameter. Sorry, yes? I missed what this tau k, when you have m functions for the tau, how does this mean? Yes, it is defined just by taking the totality of all the coefficients, the entire vector of the Mod x to the end truncations for all the power series that's pointing some huge projective space. And then we take the height. So it's defined in the same way. And I just want to convey the intuition for the parameters involved. This is how Andre. Involved. This is how Andre's inequality condition looks like. We will be interested to remove the dependence in kappa that completely obstructs applications. But the essential condition really is this, the absolutely essential positivity condition. Without it, we have just uncountably many formal solutions. With it, we have very easily just countably many formal solutions. Easily, just countably many formal solutions, and we would like to see some structure about them. The proof is by transcendence methods. We just like before, we use Siegel's lemma to construct an auxiliary linear form in the functions. Well, the Qi will be polynomials, and the combination, we just want to give an approximate linear relation, the combination will vanish highly at the origin, and the polynomial. And the polynomials will have heights bounded proportionally to kappa times h. Kappa will be the Digle exponent in the Zieger lemma, and the height of the vector of formal functions, fi. And then, of course, there will be a parameter, alpha, a parameter that will go to infinity, I mean the proportionality parameter. The degrees of the polynomials will be bounded by this, proportional to this. This proportional to this, and that is where this term will come from from the parameter count. But we can't really get rid of that kappa. It comes there is an optimal choice that it's a mess to equalize the two terms with kappa. And finally, this term will come from estimating the polynomials on the poly disk. Polydisc. So we need growth information both on the x of z as well as on the functions f of x. And then I have essentially the full indications of the proof on the next few slides. I think I should just leave, okay, just display Ziegler's lemma. The full statement works like this. We have a parameter. This. We have a parameter count. We have to solve that many linear equations in that many coefficients. And as soon as n exceeds the number of equations, we will have a solution. Then we make an additional, make this choice to get a bound on the height, and this is where kappa will come from. But and the guest But and the guest will be actually that is taken from Andrei's book. So let me for now move on to the proofs of the new part, the rationality criterion is a multivariate application of Andre's criterion. Again, here we take the Again, here we take the basic case where x of z is trivial. We introduce the auxiliary new variables, like in Roth's method, and that will improve the parameter count in Siegel's lemma. So I will denote the block of variables by this x. And out of the original univagate power series, we build a bunch actually. A bunch, actually, quite a few of them, super exponentially many of them, of new power series. The crucial point is to take the split variable, disjoint, disjoint variable product of f evaluated on products of pairs of monomials. So this ranges over a subset of pairwise disjoint pairs, i, j, of indices. Their number is clearly exponential in d squared and the And the crucial point is that it's super exponential indeed. Because if we take tau of a power of f, in just one variable, this increases and can get as large as the original tau plus a term like this. like this uh but um uh unless tau is equal to zero um but uh for disjoint variables uh we always have this if you take a new power series a power series in x1 multiplied by power series in x2 and so forth the tau never increases so uh additionally uh when we do uh change f of Change f of x to f of x times y, the height as well as the radii will scale by the same factor, completely proportionally by a factor of one half. So we have this as well. And then Andre's condition becomes the following. And we can now firstly take kappa to zero, that will kill this term, and then term and then we will take d to infinity and it will because m was super exponentially large in d and it will also kill this term and what survives is just the essential condition that we have proved already supplies rationality. But this was in the case where all the substitutions were just trivial x of z equal to z. x of z equals z. The proof also immediately shows the first part, the qualitative part of the holonomic theorem. Actually, that already follows from Andre's criterion because we can take sufficiently many derivatives in Andre's criterion that never changes the invariance tau or the height of the power series. And we can just kill the last. Kill the additional terms. We can take kappa to zero and then sufficiently many derivatives will make the third term in Andre's criterion also go to zero. However, we have the following quantitative estimate on the order of the differential equation. This is how it reads. Not only are the solutions of our problem, the formal power series. The formal power series F satisfying these substitutions and the latest conditions. Not only are they holonomic, but in fact, they satisfy a linear differential equation. I take the inhomogeneous form. There exists a differential operator L of order R minus one, such that L applied to F is just a polynomial, where, and the bound on R can be taken. Can be taken explicitly in terms of all the invariants that we have. As soon as R satisfies this inequality, then the rank of holonomicity will be bounded by, will be in fact smaller than R. And a variant will be if we restrict the denominator types. Restrict the denominator types more precisely. Let's consider rational coefficients for the power series. And suppose we have a real number s and an integer t such that all the coefficients when multiplied by the least common multiple of the integers up to s n and then raised to the tth power are s integral, where the finite set of places can be allowed to depend on f. We do not fix it in advance. In advance. So, this is the situation where tau is bounded by s times t, but we have a specific behavior for the denominators. Then, the version of the criterion states that the same condition entails a finite dimension, okay, dimension bound by this quantity on Quantity on the linear span of all the solutions. So they just range from not only they are holonomic, but the totality of them has a finite dimensional span. There are just essentially finitely many differential equations involved. The proof works similarly by By additional variables where we replace the original variety, that was the affine line, by the dth power, and we will take the asymptotic, the number of variables, to go to infinity. This time, we cannot use a superexponential number of new power series because that no longer applies. If x of z is not the trivial substitution, this will no longer be analytic on the disk of radius, the square root of r. The best we can do. The best we can do is to just take the disjoint variable products just of the power series and their derivatives. And that way we can generate exponentially many auxiliary solutions in d variables out of the original univariate polynomial. The key input is that when we take disjoint like split variables product like this. product like this, f of x times g of y, and the variables are disjoint, these two invariants, the height and the tau, will not increase. And the proof then works very similarly. Suppose for contradiction we have these derivatives are linearly independent over the function field k of x, and then And then for some R satisfying Andre's condition, then we will consider the R to the D new power series out of the original ones by just taking derivatives that does not change the invariants and multiplying in split in disjoint variable product. In this joint variable products. And then this choice of the substitution, just the Cartesian power of the invariant one. In this procedure, the term from Siegel's lemma, the kappa, will disappear if we let d to infinity, and then the resulting inequality is exactly the contradiction, is exactly the opposite of this. I will I wanted to stress that the proof involves crucially the holomorphy of X. We can and Andre's criterion is nonetheless more general. It applies to meromorphic substitutions as well. So this improvement is not always possible. So, this improvement is not always possible to just remove the parameter kappa in complete generality. There was a not obviously related paper by Zudilin in a journal basically in a different field, apparently, constructive approximation theory from a couple of years ago. And the title of the paper is Determinanto Approach to Irrationality, where he essentially gave a rationality. A rationality criterion of a similar kind. And this is a particular case of our setting. His criterion looks like this. We have a formal power series with rational coefficients. We suppose it is analytic, holomorphic on a slit plane, C minus this branch cut from minus infinity to minus R, but because of the Riemann map for that simply connected. For that simply connected domain that is explicit here, that condition is exactly equivalent to convergence when you make this substitution. So that places this in our setting. And also to suppose F has unit periodic radii, I mean convergent on the unit disk for all principes P, and finally that the total arithmetic degree, the sum of logs of all those radii, is bigger than three halves times the tau invariant. Three halves times the tau invariant. Then Zuli-Lim proves that f is a rational function. And there are examples like the logarithm series. For example, log of 1 plus x is not rational. It has to be holonomic because of the holonomic theor, and because tau of the power series A. Because tau of the power series f is equal to one, and that is smaller than log four. And this shows that there must we cannot have an algebraicity conclusion. In general, we can at best have holonomicity. And it remains an open problem to find the best constant in Zudin's criterion. It is somewhere between 1.5 and log 4. There is another case where we can solve the problem precisely, and that will be a similar criterion to Zudilin's to precisely describe which holonomic functions arise in a special case of this setting. Let me directly just Let me directly just take point out this case: take the prime 2 and this hypergeometric function that just reduces to essentially the arc sine function that has a toallic radius as high as four this combination. Although the arc sign, although If we so this is equivalent to taking this function and this is a holomic function, it satisfies a linear differential equation of order one inhomogeneous and with singularities only at zero, one and infinity. The two individual factors, this and this, have toadic radii as small as a quarter. Their product has a toadic radius as high as four, 16 times. As high as four, 16 times as big. And the Taylor series of the function has denominator type is. If we take the least common multiple of the first n denominators, it divides this. It is essentially this. And so does this function, modifying h by the substitution x over x minus one. So we are in a position to fully determine all functions with these properties. All functions with these properties. So I will just state another case where we have a precise characterization of the solution space. It states the following. We take a power series with rational coefficients such that it converges on the toadic disk of radius 4 and on the p-adic disk of unit radius. Second, If we take the nth coefficient multiplied by the least common multiple of the first two n plus one integers, we get an s integer where s can depend on the function f. And third, up to multiplying the power series by some polynomial, non-zero, there is a linear differential equation l of f equal to zero for some linear differential operator with singularities. Singularities close enough to either 0, 1, or infinity, which were the singularities for this function. Then any such function is just a rational linear combination with q of x combination of those three. We have a three-dimensional space of solutions with the basis given like this. There are not many cases where we can get an exact characterization. An exact characterization, and I think I should. All right, so my slides also include the proof outline of this, as well as the application to irrationality to adding zeta value that I did not have time to discuss. So it was with such applications in mind that this was These criteria are developed. I think I'm out of time at this point, so I should I want to thank everybody for your attention and the wonderful conference. Okay, feel free to unmute yourself and applaud. Some people are putting little hands at whatever that is. Yeah, that's cool. Are there any questions? Can you say how you're thinking world salts would relate to Sagnier's results and strength for Ruch's conjecture? Oh, the one I, yeah, if I go back, I think I can do it just like that on the first slide, basically, first few slides, are exactly of the same strength. Actually, I would say if you recall this paper, he had a constant like e to the, I think, three minus two root two, something like this. He proved that. Something like this. He proved that if we have a linear recurrent, sorry, if we have a sequence of integers such that the reduction mod P satisfies the linear recurrence relation mod P of length less than P and the growth rate was smaller than this, then the sequence satisfies a linear relation. A linear relation. So that, and if you optimize kappa in this display, it gives exactly the same constant. I would say this is the same result. As stated, the one variable proof optimizes to Daniel's quantitative result exactly. All improvements come from more variables. And similarly, in Andre's book, there is a related constant for. constant for uh i i stated um his uh sorry um his rationality theorem is stated under the conditions this some of the logs of meromorphic radii exceed basically the same kind of constant i wrote 12 but in fact he the optimal constant is i think x of 2 times that the same 3 minus 2 something like this Minus root two, something like this, times the tau vagant. But again, it is possible to mix the two types of criteria. If that is useful, I would be very happy to know if there are more applications if they come up useful for other things. You can add mod B conditions and the addictive analytic conditions. Viodic analytic conditions at the same time. Can I ask a question? Sure. Hi, I'm I'm you probably wouldn't, I don't know if this is a bad question or not, but I would be interested in actually trying to use this criteria or trying to apply it. So can it be, is it practical to try to make it effective? You gave an example on a function which was somehow already known and it was hypergeometric. What kind of format? But what kind of format of function do I need to actually try to make it effective? If I actually, I would really love to try to use this. Yeah, yeah. So I think you have in mind the holomystic criteria with oh yeah, the whole, yeah, sorry, sorry, I should jump ahead. Sorry. I had it in my head and about to teach in five minutes. So I'm just going. No, that's a great question. That's exactly what we try to do in some cases. There are potential applications. There are potential applications where, if you can describe completely the solution space, we just give semi-effective result with some dimension bound. But we really have a finite dimensional space and we can't describe it effectively. This is somehow, I apologize for the comparison, but I think it's a little similar to too easy to write, where you have a bound on the number of solutions, but finding them effective is hard by the method that you need some anchors, some extremely good. Anchors, some extremely good examples, like in Bombiegi's effective 2e method to start with. And this was just an example where the arc sign example or this hypergeometric case where it was possible. Yeah, because we have an excellent to addic radius in this case, and we started with three solutions that are real solutions, and they somehow are enough to bootstrap. To bootstrap to know solutions. You can find some indications on the slides that are posted on the workshop. But the short answer is we would very much love to do it in more interesting cases. Okay, thank you. But can you see it in some sense as just being a very general, like Polya-Carlson-type theorem, or something like this? Something like this is a lot. You mean again, are you interested referring to the holonomicity twist, not just rationality? I mean, you don't, yeah, you're getting logs and log one plus x and things like this. Yes, already in Zutilin, I think Zutilin's work was the first extension of this kind, because if you, yeah, we have seen that Holonewis. Yeah, we have seen that holonomicity holds even without this coefficient of 1.5, but then we really have holonomic solutions, not irrational. And we have a criterion for holonomicity up to a given order. That is what is used in the application to transcendence. We don't know the base constant here in this gap. But I don't know if we can apply the holonomicity criterion to orbit growth lower bounds in a similar way. Like irrationality, the irrationality criterion gives, for example, a height lower bound on holonomic functions. For example, the height must be positive if the function is not rational of the special form of some. Of the special form, some polynomial over 1 minus x to the power, I guess, cyclotomics product like that. I don't know if the whole domistic criterion has similar strength, stronger consequences. Are there other questions for Vessel? If not, If not, let's thank Vasiloon again. I've got to figure out how to stop recording. Somehow, I let's see. It's still recording right now. It's supposed to be a button. Let me see. Oh, wait a minute. Maybe. Oh, I see the button now. Okay. There we go. I was on the wrong page. It stopped. So let me go back. So let me go back into zoom.
