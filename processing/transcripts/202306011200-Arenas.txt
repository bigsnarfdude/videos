Well, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this workshop and everyone for coming to my talk. I am interested in a very general question that I think a lot of people are interested in, which is we start with a group G, then we find a nice classifying space. Classifying space for the group. So, nice can mean a lot of things. For instance, finite dimensional, if that's possible, compact, or with finitely many cells in each dimension, or up to a certain dimension. So, all of these things. So, all of these things are not always possible, but when they're possible, we would like to find a classifying space that satisfies them. The naive guess for a classifying space for a group is a presentation complex. So, you're very often given a group by a presentation. And the most naive thing to hope is that the presentation complex, so this is my notation for the presentation. Complex, so this is my notation for the presentation complex, is a KG1. Of course, this is not always the case. This is actually very often not the case because the classifying space, the presentation complex, is always a two-dimensional space, and most groups are not two-dimensional. And even if you have a group that is two-dimensional, who knows, like if you were given a bad presentation, it's not going to be a classifying space for the group, or if you were given the group in a way. The group, or if you were given the group in a way that has nothing to do with the presentation, who knows? Um, so the thing we know is that if this is a classifying space, then the group has to have comological dimension. So the group presented by P has comological dimension at most two. That's all we know. And there are nice classes of groups for which this happens, where we can. Of groups for which this happens, where we can use the presentation complex as a classifying space, and I'll talk a little bit more about that. So, I'm interested in a very concrete setting, which is the following. I want to look at quotients of the following form. So, here X is a non-positive accurate complex. So, Carolyn defined the other day cats here cube complexes. A non-positive EQ cube complex is the same as a cat serial cube complex, except that you don't ask for it to be simply connected. I won't go into the definition here carefully. I can tell you more about it if you want, but most of the people here probably know the definitions. Yeah, so. Yeah, so I want to look at these kinds of quotients. And I would like to be able to tell under certain conditions what's the nice classifying space. And also I want to know how well the dimension is determined by the dimension of the group that you started with. So if the dimension of X is, say, less or equal than N, is it going to be? Or equal time and is it going to be the case that the comological dimension of the quotient is less or equal than n. So maybe something to mention here is that these spaces are always spherical. So the dimension of this space is a bound for the comological dimension of its fundamental group. Of its fundamental group. Okay, before I actually get to that, I want to tell you about one of the classes of groups for which this naive guess is actually correct. So this is a small concession. Small concession theory. So, in the beginning, there was just small concession theory, and there was nothing else, but now people have come up and But now people have come up, and there's like 20 different versions of normal cancerization theory. So we need to add an adjective to make this precise. And this is classical. I don't know why everyone finds this so funny. Classical mock the ancient theory. So is that the one I know? I'm going to say yes. I learned that long ago, but there weren't that many. Probably yes. Probably, yes, yes. Well, okay, whatever you want to call it, the one that existed before all the other ones. The first two small concessions. Right. Okay, so what is this about? Morale, this is about looking at group presentations, looking at the radiations in the presentation, and measuring the overlaps between different radiators. Different reactors. And if these are very observable, then you have nice theorems and you can prove nice things about your groups and you're happy. Okay, so how do we make this precise? We need a good presentation. So all of the good presentations that I'm going to be discussing are finite, finite number of generators, finite number of relators. I want them to be symmetrized and sequiki reduce. So symmetrize means that if I add a reator, I also want to add its inverse and all of its cyclic permutations. And cyclicly reduced means that I don't want inverses. I cancel out all the inverses and I do this secretly. So I think of my word as being written as something like this in a circle. And I don't want to have these instances anywhere. I cancel them out. So that's the setting. So that's the setting. And then we can define a piece. So a piece in a presentation is going to be a sub word that arises in two distinct ways amongst oriators. Right, okay. So maybe this is not very clear what it means. It's not very clear what it means without an example, so let's do an example. So, I'm going to choose two words, two arbitrary words from the universe of all possible words. So, here are the words. Can anyone see a piece? No? Any pieces? So here's a piece. So that's a piece in our group presentation. Right. Okay. That's an example. And now we want to define something called small cancellation conditions. So there's a metric which is you don't see prime one over n. Prime one over n condition and this one states that if we have a piece P that appears in some reactor, then the length of the piece is very small in comparison to the length of the reactor. So the length of peak is less than one over n the length of peak. And one over n doing. So that's one condition. And then we have the non-metric version, which we call Cn. And these one says that no reactor is a concatenation of less than n pieces. Of less than n pieces. So, this is phrased maybe in a slightly strange way. Why am I phrasing it as a negation? But with the examples, it's going to become clear why. And yeah, so this example is not small conciliation in any nice way. Right, okay, so what are the examples? So let's start with the obvious ones. So if I have a free group, a presentation with A presentation with no reators. What's going to happen here? There are no reators, so there are no pieces. There are no pieces. And if there are no pieces, then just vacuum say have all the small cancerization conditions. So, a similar example is if I take just one generator and the power of that. So, here we also do not have any pieces. Because if we look at the reator, it looks like this. And all of the sacred conjugates are the same, so there are no two different reators. So, there are no two different reators in the presentation, even when you symmetrize it. So, there is no pieces. And therefore, again, we all have that all the conditions are satisfied. But it's not more than one way because it's the same, the same relation. Yes, that would be a piece. So, that's part of the reason why this is phrased as a negation. Why is this phrase as a negation because you could have no pieces? Right, okay. So, more interesting examples, a presentation for the fundamental group of a surface, say of genus 2. So, what are the pieces here? What are the pieces here? The pieces are each single letter in variation. So, all single letters. And nothing else, nothing longer than a single letter is a piece. So, this satisfies C prime one seven. Okay, and maybe this is a good moment to make a remark that I should have made before, which is that The C prime one over n condition implies the C n plus one condition. So if each piece is less than one over n, the length of the reator, you need at least one more piece to actually go all the way around. So here we also have C8. Okay, and another example. Say I have these three generators, and my radiation is Variation is. So, here, what are the pieces? We have T, A, A squared, V, and B squared, and all of the inverses also. And T satisfies the C six condition, but it does not satisfy the C prime one six condition. C prime one six condition and actually it doesn't even satisfy what is it it doesn't even satisfy c prime one over four because I can write this word as a concatenation of of these four variations so not even c prime one over four okay so those are some examples and i said that when the numbers are big enough uh we get good theorems so what kind of Uh, we get the theorems. So, what kind of theorems do we get? Okay, uh, let's see. Yes, what using function? Uh, no, well, maybe I said it in a bit of a wrong way, but okay, if you look at the If you look at the at how this reactor actually looks, like you see, um each reator, so you have these reators that are made up of two letters, and this shows that you cannot have the C prime one over n condition for anything bigger than four. Anything bigger than four because the length of this reactor is what six eight right okay so if a group G has a c prime one over six presentation then the following things happen so first of all the group is hyperbolic so this is a result of then And it also holds if instead of C prime one over six, we take C seven. The group is also co-compact accubiated. This is a result of WISE. Co-compact accubiator means that the group acts properly and co-compactly on a cat COQ domplex. And this is a thing a lot of people care about. Okay. Another thing that happens is that the presentation complex is a spherical, provided that none of the reators are proper powers. So, this is a result of Linden. And it also holds in the C6 case. So, this has some very nice consequences. Yes, it will be. Yeah, okay. So, nice consequences of this. In particular, the group is extortion-free. And obviously, we can say something stronger. We can say that the group has comological dimension at most two. Okay, so these are some theorems about small concentration groups. Let me just say one more thing that is. Is it too dull if I write here? No, I don't think so. Is it okay? I think it's not okay. It's not okay. It's okay. It's not okay. It's okay. So let me start this as a theorem because I don't want to be very precise. Random groups at low density have a C prime monoisix presentation. Yeah, so I don't want to get into this, but more it means that. This, but more it means that generically, for an adequate notion of generic, this is very common. It's a very common phenomenon to have that a group presentation is a small consideration. Okay, and then we just mentioned two general constructions that we have for producing this kind of groups. So we don't just have some random examples and some theorems that who knows what they are for. We have general ways of constructing these examples. Constructions. So one is a files. We can take any group presentation. And for any such presentation, okay, so my quantifiers, where do I put my quantifiers? For all n, there exists capital N. There exists capital L such that if I look at the presentation that I get from having the same generators and taking all of these relations to the nth power, the capital nth power. Okay. D satisfies C prime. C prime one over n, where this sign is different to this n. So let me say t. So this, the number of generators has nothing to do with the small cancellation condition. So that's one construction. So for all t? This is decent. Yeah, you told me how small concentration you wanted. How small concessation do you want it? No. And the other one is the RIPS construction. So it's a theorem of RIPS. So it says that for any finite represented group, you can produce a C prime one six group, so a group with a C prime one six presentation. That surjects onto Q with finitely generated current. So maybe it's not very clear what this theorem is saying, but it is saying that you get lots of examples with interesting properties. So you can take your finite represented group to have some property you're interested in, and you can often push this property to G via this rejection. And I can tell you more about this later, but it's not the purpose of this. Tell you more about this later, but it's not the purpose of this talk, so I'm not going to go into details. Um, I'm just going to say that since these are proper reators, this is not, um, the presentation is not going to be asterical. But in this case, it's of course not clear from the statement, but the presentation that you produce has no proper powers, so this is a spherical. You get an a spherical presentation, and this is. And this is going to be, I guess, important later. Okay. So this is the classical version of the theory. Now I want to tell you about the different version of the theory. Is everything clear so far? Am I forgetting anything? Okay, so here we go. Small consolation theory. Okay, so before we can tell you anything. So, before I can tell you anything really about what cubicle small concession theory is about, we have to kind of look back and ask yourself: what's a good presentation? So, what is a group presentation? So, a group presentation is the following thing. We have a bunch of generators and a bunch of creators, and we declare. And we declare that the group presented by this thing is the quotient of the free group on these things by the normal closure of the group generated by these radiators. So, this is something with a query to it. This is a definition. But this definition is actually giving us a group that comes in a very concrete way. That comes in a very concrete way. So, we're not combinatorial group theorists, we are geometric group theorists. So, we want to have an object that has this group as its fundamental group. And that's the presentation complex. So, the presentation complex, what is it? You take a bouquet of circles, which generator is labeled by the corresponding thing, and then you're mapping a collection of cycles into it. And each of these cycles is labeled by the corresponding reaction. And you look at the image in the bouquet of circles and you cone it off. And that's the presentation complex. And this thing has the fundamental group that we want. So the fundamental group of the presentation complex is exactly the quotient. So if I call this Vn. So, if I call this Vn, a bouquet of n circles by the fundamental groups of the cycles represented by the cycles. Right, okay, so we have a topological way of understanding the group presentation. When the cycles, when the radiators in the presentation are cyclically reduced, then these maps are going to. Use, then these maps are going to be immersions. Okay, so that's a good presentation. And what we do now is just kind of like take a step back and look at this object and what this subject is. So if you want to be very pedantic, this is a one-dimensional Q complex. And these are collections of one-dimensional Q complexes. So you forget that they are graphs or whatever, and you substitute everything in the definition. In the definition, so a cubicle presentation is what you get when you just substitute this bouquet of circles by an arbitrary cube complex and substitute these relations by arbitrary cube complexes that map nicely. Cube complexes that map nicely into the original one. So you write this as follows. So these maps here, you require them to be something called local isometries. It doesn't matter what that means. All that matters is that they are pi one injective. So I can define the fundamental group of this object. To be the quotient of the fundamental group of this thing by the images of the fundamental groups of these things. Because of this, because this is pi one injective, this is just the original group. And that's before we have a kind of presentation context. So we have a concrete way of understanding this thing. Right, so we have I'm going to abuse notation here, and I'm going to use this also to denote the code of space. So, this is the space we obtained by looking at X, and then looking at the images of each of these reators. So, this is my generator, and these are my reiters. You look at the images of the Y i's in X and you count them off. And that's the count of space. And it's the analog of a presentation complex in this setting. So, the fundamental group of X star is exactly this group that we have here. The disc group that we have here. Okay. So maybe this all seems very weird. Why are we doing this? That's the question that we ask now. What's the point of all this? Group presentations are already a complicated enough object. We already have enough problems trying to understand group presentations. So why on earth would you want to like Why on earth would you want to look at a generalization of this kind? What's the point? And the point is that you gain flexibility. You can get really nice cubicle presentations for objects that maybe don't have very nice usual presentations by sort of translating or transporting some of the complexity of the group from the reators to the generator. And that's something you can do because this object can be very complicated. But even if it's very complicated, But even if it's very complicated, you're in a very good position because it's a non-passitivity of geocomplex and you understand this geometry very well. Right, so that's kind of the reason why this is actually this is not pointless to study. Okay, so what are some examples? So for example, minus one is just a group presentation. Of one is just a group presentation. So, as we already said, this is a cube complex, these are cube complexes. I haven't told you what's a local isometry, but these are going to be locally symmetries. Immersions in particular of graphs are locally symmetries. So, this is an example. No matter the group presentation, this is always an example of a cubicle presentation. In this setting, we have an analog of a free group, which is going to be just a presentation. Which is going to be just a presentation with no reators, and this is just going to be the fundamental group of non-positivility of your compacts for your own. You're coning of the images of the YI's in X. I can write down a formula if you want. I don't know if that helps. I don't know if that helps. So, for instance, in this case, what are you doing? You're mapping the cycles according to the corresponding label. And once you have mapped it in here, you're coning it off. And you just do that in general. So you have some more general object that you're immersing into your complex, and you cone it off. Okay, so maybe. Okay, so maybe the examples are going to make it clearer. Yeah, so this is like a figure. Why is it called cubicle? Oh, because it's all like the base thing that you have is a cube complex. Yeah, so this is, oh, did I not say that? These are all cube complexes. Yeah, these are all cube complexes. The definition makes sense without adding any other hypothesis, but actually for the theorems, you will usually want to assume that everything is compact. Well, usually, you want to assume that everything is compact. This is compact, this is compact, and you have a finite number of variations. Some things work without those assumptions, but I'm not going to get into that. No. No. But it has like pyramids. Yeah. Right. Okay. So maybe a slightly more interesting example is if you take X and any covering space of X. So that's a curical presentation. If the covering space is finite degree, then what you're presenting is just a finite group. This is a strange way of presenting a finite group. But it's something you can do. If it's infinite degree, who knows what you're presenting? It can be something very complicated. But it's an example. But it's an example. And maybe a more interesting example is some arting groups. If you don't know what's an arting group, it doesn't matter. It's just an example. But if you do, so this is another example. Some arting groups have interesting cubicle presentations where the generator in the setting is going to be. Generator in the setting is going to be a solve complex of a rack, of a right-angled article, and the YI's are going to be cycles, a collection of cycles. So, this is an example where you're actually doing something here. Like you're translating some of the complexity of the arting group to the generator by taking this albedic complex. Okay, so those are some examples. So, those are some examples. I want to tell you about cubicle small tensivation theory. So, I have to tell you what's a piece. And I've given talks about this kind of thing many times before. And this is the point where everything fails. And I lose everyone in the audience. So, what I'm going to do now is that instead of just writing a definition, I'll give you an example. And hopefully, the example will just make it all very clear for you. It's all very clear for you. Is that an approach you never tried before? No, no. I mean, I give examples, but I also just give a definition and then it make. So the good thing is not to give the definition. Maybe I'll give the definition for people who might want it. But the example I think is more informative. Okay. So I'll start with just something that we are all very familiar with and understand very well. Understand very well. So take a book of two circles with this cycle mapping into it. So this is a presentation for the torus, right? And I can look at the universal cover of the torus, of the presentation complex for this. And this is a tiling of the Euclidean plane by squares. And these are labeled by the label. And these are labeled by the labels I originally have here. And then the pieces that I talked about in the beginning, you can interpret them as overlaps between different cells in here. So here, this is a piece. The same as saying overlap between two different words, over up between two different translates of the readers in the universal cover of the presentation context. So this is a piece. So, this is a piece. And that's all good and nice. This is also a piece in the cubical setting. This is also going to be a piece in the cubical setting of the theory. But now, what happens if instead of this, I take the following thing? Let's see if I can successfully make this picture. So, this is a strip, just a rectangular strip. Strip, just a rectangular strip. This is also a rectangular strip. So, this is the same thing as this. I just thicken it up. And I'm going to have basically the same variation. But how am I mapping this into here? Like this. Let's see if I can do it properly. So I'm mapping this cycle and to this boundary that I drew here. And this is again the torus. I just drew the torus in a very strange way. An exercise is to actually draw this and realize that this is the torus. So here it's very easy. You have the torus with this elevation. Here it's less obvious, but you can draw it. You can just draw the torus. The universal cover, what is it now? It's the same thing, except that I have thickened it up. So I have this. So, I have these strips here and the same levels. So, now what's the problem? I want this to still be up here. I want this to still be a piece, but it is not because these two cells are no longer intersecting each other, and that's kind of a problem. So, I want to think of this sort of rectangular part as being the same as the one skeleton that I originally have. So, I need a definition of piece where the intersection between a cell and a rectangle that is parallel to a different cell is again a piece. Okay, so this is going to be. This is going to be the notion of peace that I need. Either intersections between different translates of my reactions or intersections between a translate of a reaction and a rectangular strip. So let me write that down. So pieces are of two types. So they are either paths in intersections. In intersections between these YI's or paths in intersections between one of these and the carrier of a hyperplane. I haven't told you what that is, but you already know it's this thing. So a hyperplane is something that goes. Plane is something that goes like this, crossing all the squares in the same way. And the carrier of the hyperplane is this little neighborhood. So those are pieces. And now I can actually define small cancellation conditions. So we have a metric and a non-metric version of the theories in the classic. Version of the theories in the classical sense. So the cubical CN condition, what it is saying is that if P is a P is in some reactor, then Then the length of p is less than one over n the length of sigma for all sigma. So for all paths in your reator that are essential loops. So this is a okay, so that's the CN condition. Okay, so that's the CN condition and the non-metric version. Again, it says that no essential path, no essential loop is a concatenation or can be written as a concatenation of less than n pieces. So, those are the definitions. Again, again, as in the classical case, we have magic numbers that make good theorems happen. So, what are the numbers here? Yes, thank you. Thank you. I said one thing and wrote a different one. Yes, that's right. Okay. Okay, so what are the theorems? So we have a cubicle presentation. We're going to assume also that the fundamental group of X is hyperbolic. So this is actually a very reasonable hypothesis to have because if you think in the classical setting, we're working always over a book of circles. Always over a book of circles which has three fundamental groups and therefore hyperbolic fundamental groups. Okay, so if we have this, then the following things happen. So if x star satisfies the C prime one over 14 condition, then the fundamental group of the quotient is again hyperbolic. The quotient is again hyperbolic. And if x prime satisfies the C prime one over 20 condition, and you have a little bit more, so you need a technical condition here. And you need to assume that the reators are homotopy equivalent to cycles. Homotopy equivalent to cycles. So, if you have all of this, then the fundamental group of the quotient is co-compact accumulators. So, so far, we have an analogy with the classical small concession theory. We also have a version of the random statement that I said before. So, again, let me just state this very bigly. Let me just state this very vaguely. All right, so this is before I forget, this is all work of wise. And also, the definitions are work of wise. And this is a result of filtering wise. So random. Here we go, presentations. Here again. Here again, we are still under the assumption that the fundamental group of the generator is hyperbolic. So, random presentations are a small concession. So, I won't tell you exactly what number, what that means, but it does imply in particular that again the quotient is hyperbolic and compactly cubed. Maybe I should say, make this. Maybe I should say make this a little bit better at low densities. Okay, so so far so good with the analogy. Just as in the classical setting, we also have general constructions that work for cubical presentations. Very much perhaps just uh a few words you could say. Do they make a model for random or cubical contexts for that, or? I really don't want to say anything about this because I don't think I know it well enough to say anything correct or very adequate. It's pretty technical. The theorem is actually pretty technically stated, but some it's an analogy to the classical case. Okay. Right, so we have general constructions, general recipes for producing cubical presentations that are small concentration. So, constructions. And again, I'm not going to be very precise about this. It is possible to be more precise. And if you really care about this or are really interested, I can tell you exactly all the details, but not right now. So, one is the analogy to taking a presentation and taking proper powers. Presentation and taking proper powers of the radiations. So here I have a presentation. And what you can do is instead of taking proper powers, you do the analogous thing here, which is taking high enough finite degree covers. So you have the same generator. And for each of these, you take, let me write it like this. The corresponding cover of degree n for each of n, and this is going to be again let me put the quantifiers. This is going to be C prime 1 over n. Again, this is all assuming that I'm in the hyperbolic setting. Some of these things work in more generality, but one has to be very careful. And another construction. And another construction. So, this is a nice way for producing lots of examples of cubicle presentations that are small consensus, but generally you're going to have torsion here because you're taking finite degree covers. A general way of producing cubicle presentations that are torsion-free, or at least that there's no obvious reason for them not to be. Reason for them not to be is a cubic conversion of the RIPS construction. So again, you just start with any finally presented group and then exists a group that rejects onto Q with finite. That rejects into Q with finally generated kernel so that G has a cubicle presentation that satisfies the C prime one over n condition. This is just one variation of the RIPS construction. Many exist, but this is sort of the one that fits into this analogy. Yeah, and this gives you examples that are going to not have torsion, these are going to be torsion-free. Okay, so so far the analogy goes very well, or maybe I should say. We have lots of things that are the same in the classical and the cubical setting. The one thing that I have not spoken about is asphericity. So, maybe before I get into that, let me just say a few words of why this might be important, or why this is important. Might be important or why this is important. So we have produced a setting that seems to produce like many more examples than the classical small concentration setting, but it's actually not clear how many more. In the classical small concentration setting, we only get groups that have comological dimension at most two because of the fact that the presentation complex is a spherical if you're torsion free. So how do we know that we're doing anything more here? Maybe we're just doing something more complicated that produces the same. Something more complicated that produces the same kind of examples. So it's important to be able to determine what's the dimension of these groups so that we actually know if we have examples of more interesting things or more general things. So groups on high dimension are usually very poorly understood. Hyperbolic groups specifically are very poorly understood in high dimensions. And having examples to study is like the first thing that you need if you want to be able to say anything about them. And this is a way of trying. And this is a way of trying to get those examples. Okay, so astericity. We know what happens in the one-dimensional case. So there are two theorems here, I guess. If our generator in the cubicle presentation is just a bouquet of circles within the classical small conclusion setting and then the C6 condition. Implies asphericity as soon as the reactors are not proper powers. And as I said before, this is a theorem of the industry. Okay, the next thing you can do is replace the bouquet of circles by an arbitrary graph. By an arbitrary graph. And that theory actually has a name. It's called graphical small conclusion theory. It fits in the cubical setting, so it's the one-dimensional version of the cubical small conclusion theory. But it has been studied independently. It was defined before cubical small concentration theory. And it's a theorem of Gruber. So this is a graph. If you have the C6 condition and a condition. And a condition that they call reduced labels. So this generalizes having no proper powers in the presentation. If you have this condition, then the presentation complex is a spherical. So then x star is a spherical. Sorry, I think I'm writing too long. So this is a result of. So, this is a result of Grover. And in the C'16 case, which was done before, it's a result of, I guess, Gromo and OUBF. Okay, so this is all that was known, the one-dimensional case. What happens more in general? Okay, if we have a chemical presentation that satisfies the following conditions. So I want the C9 condition, and I want the presentation to be minimal. So, minimum is going to be the way you generalize no proper powers. So, it's the way that you avoid torsion in this attempt. And you satisfy that X is two-dimensional. So it's a two-dimensional cube complex. And each reaction is homotopy equivalent to a graph. So, again, here, two-dimensional, I mean it homotopy equivalent. Or motop equivalent. Then the count of space is the spherical. Okay, so this deals with the torsion free case, but we also care about the examples where we have possible torsion. Um so okay for me classifying spaces for families have already been defined. I'm not sure this language has been used, but I want to say I want to use this notation to denote the classifying space. For proper actions. So, this is the classifying spirits for families where your family is finite subgroups. So, this is a GCW complex with finite group stabilizers as finite cell stabilizers, and the fixed point sets of the finite subgroups are contractible. That's what it means. That's what it means. Okay, so we can prove a TRM also in a slightly more general setting. So again, if the presentation complex, if the cubicle presentation is C9, and now I want something called symmetries. Again, this is a technical condition. Again, this is a technical condition, but it just allows you to have torsion, but in a kind of controlled way. Again, I want X to be two-dimensional and the YI's to be homotopy equivalent to graphs. Then we have a quotient. Of the universal cover of the condof space that is classifying space for proper actions. If we also assume that the fundamental group of X satisfies a certain separability condition, a very weak condition. A very weak condition. We can actually say that. Okay, so in this setting, what we can conclude is that the cohomological dimension, the radical, the rational cohomological dimension of this group is less or equal than two. In T setting, what we can conclude is that the group The group is virtual iters-free, and that the virtual commodity dimension is at most two. So, these two results hinge on a technical theorem that has no restrictions on dimensions. So, the theorem is that if we have cubicle presentation that is minimal and satisfies the C9 condition, then the second homotopy group Group of the condo space is trivial. This has no restrictions, you don't need anything to be two-dimensional or graphs or anything. So, this is part of a program to show asphericity for cubicle presentations in all dimensions. And obviously, I'm not. And obviously, I'm not going to prove one by one that each homotopy group is trivial. I could make a career out of that, right, on paper for each homotopy group. Yes, no. So, this is the base case of a sort of induction, if you like. It's more complicated than that. But I'm going to say I'm not ready to commit to call this a theorem, but let's say in writing the URL case. The journal case. So, I'm either using statements to this, or you don't have any bounds on dimension on anything. And this is my talk. That's the end. Question? Yes. You talked about arts and groups as examples. About arting groups as examples of presentations. Does it for every art in groups? No. No, just for some characterization. I mean, yes, you have some technical conditions that you need. For instance, you need the graph, the underlying graph of the Solve Attic complex that you use to not be a joint, a non-trivial joint. Okay. There are other small conditions. Okay. And there are estimations for the The the capsule n of the construction one where you take the uh that one the construction uh blackboard. Yes, uh so this this depends on this this depends on the on the X that you start with and the Y's. N is explicit. Yes, N is explicit. If you know this, then N is explicit. Yes. And can we learn better than 14 and 20? That's a good question. Question. A work in progress with Jan Kellich and Weiss is that this holds for C13. So, no. No, this is a real generalization because the non-metric condition is much more general than the metric condition. So, there is no version of this theorem for a non-metric version of the theory. So, C13 is actually like a proper generalization. It's not just improving by one number, it's a different theorem. Yes. It's not at all clear that these numbers are optimal in any way. I can tell you that nine shows up because the cubicle version of Grindlinger-Sama, so of diagram classification, holds at C9. In the classical case, it holds at C6. It holds at V6, so I do still use it holds kind of a language. No, I'm not so smart. I'm very naive. So I just look at diagrams and show that they are no homotopic. Yeah, I do it by hand. The proof of the general case does not go by hand. Of the general case does not go by hand, you actually have to prove something else. But to prove that pi 2 is zero, you do it by hand, you just analyze these objects, and you have a lot of tools for doing so. I think that has a question. So, in the generalized version that you are working on, do you expect the DCD of the groups that you build up are not going to be bounded by two, but by? Yeah, so you would substitute the number by n. And also here, you would have the common logical dimension is. statement is going to be dependent and then the consequences is going to be like yeah you don't want this to be restricted to dimension principle no no yeah yeah and actually this is not at all clear from the setting but you will also get lower bounds in cohomological dimension from knowing the astericity statement which is very weird but it is the case here but that would be good because you will have like yeah yes uh Yes? Do you know if these two curves have a proper dimension to for less than or equal to proper dimension? Yeah, like which one is the proper dimension? Yeah, they need a model for E other bar of dimension two because these are these models are dimension two models. Yes, this is going to have dimension two. Okay. Yeah. And in the general case, it would be n. Okay, it would be n. Yeah. Okay. That's how you insert that you have to be selfish. Yes, yes. This does need an extra condition to prove that they are virtually torsion-free, but yes. Well, I guess we can thank MacRare and I think.
