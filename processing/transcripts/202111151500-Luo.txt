Okay, so thank you for the introduction. And it is a great honor for me to speak at such a conference in honor of Professor Kessman's 80th birthday. Okay, I think I first met Professor Kessman in my second year, 2017, in the AIM conference. And since then, he gave several helpful comments on basic functions and the On basic functions and the reductive monoids. Okay, so I would like to take this chance to thank you and happy birthday. Okay, okay, now let me start. Okay, so first let's review some classical topics. Okay, we have the well-known Riemann zeta function, which is first discovered by Euler, okay, for any real part of s bigger than one. Okay, and zeta s is defined to be the summation and from one to infinity of one over n s. Okay. Of 1 over ns. And he proved that the series is absolutely convergent and it admits the local global factorization. And later, Riemann discussed the following integral representation of the zeta function. So more precisely, you complete the original zeta function by the Archimedean factor. So it's pi to the power minus s over 2 times the Achimedian gamma factor s over 2. factor s over two. Okay. Then it can be written as the Molecular transform of the Jacobi theta function. And then in particular, the classical Poisson summation attached to the Jacobi's theta function provides you the Meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of the zeta function. Okay. Then Tate in his thesis developed such an idea. CDs developed such an idea systematically, okay, using harmonic analysis of the multiplicity group scheme acting on A1, okay, and deduce the Meromorphic continuation and the function equation for general HAC-L function. So there are mainly two ingredients. The first is the Schwarz space. Okay, you have the usual Schwartz-Bruha functions on affine line. Okay, and you can define them on the idyllic ring. And there is a Fourier transform acting on the Schross. From f on the straw space, okay. Then you form the following zeta integral for any f in the test function space, and here chi is a character, okay. You form the following zeta integral, then it is not hard to show that the zeta integral is absolutely convergent for real part of S sufficiently large. And moreover, when real part is large, you can prove that the zeta integral admits the local global factorization. Okay, more precisely if your test function is. More precisely, if your test function is a pure tensor, you can write it as a local global product. Okay, and for the local factor, you can prove that it is absolutely convergent for real part of S sufficiently large, and it admits a Meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane as a distribution on the alpha line, okay, or the temporary distribution. And the pose of such Meromorphic family of distribution is captured by the local L factor. L factor. Then we have the following functional equation after Meromorphic continuation. Okay, so the left-hand side is 1 minus s and the Fourier transform acting on your function. Okay, and integral against the chi inverse, this is proportional to chi s f chi p okay and up to a gamma factor. Okay, and moreover, if you take the L P to be the characteristic function of integers. P to be the characteristic function of integers if p is not Archimedean, and if you take it to be the Gaussian if p is Archimedean, okay, then you can prove that uh this function is stabilized under the Fourier transform action, okay. And for an unramified character, you can prove that the zeta integral exactly gives you the unramified L factor, okay. And furthermore, the global Poisson summation for the Fourier transform deduced the Meromorphic condition. Transform deduced the Meromorphic continuation and the functional equation for the global zeta integral, okay, which in particular deduced the Meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of the Hec L function. So here I would like to mention observation due to Guelphan Grave and Piety Shapiro in their book. Okay, they make the following simple observation. In case you have any question, feel free to tell me. Okay, they make the following observation. To stop me, okay. They make the following observation that as a distribution or say tempered distribution on Kp, okay, uh, indeed, the full transform of this distribution. Okay, you can view the character chi p twist by a unramified shift as minus one. Okay, you view that as a distribution, then it can be acted by the Fourier transform. Okay, then this distribution after Fourier transform is proportional to chi p inverse uh up to twist by minus s. Okay, and the proportion. S okay, and the proportional constant is given by the gamma factor. Okay, equivalently, equivalently, this identity can be explained as follows. Okay, we take the additive character of your local field Kp. Then, if you take the following regularized integral, in some sense, you take the Merlin transform of your additive character, okay, after suitable regularization. You can prove that this integral is convergent for a real part of S sufficiently small, and with a Meromorphic continuation to the whole. And with some meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane, okay, and it's equal to the gamma factor. Okay. So, my goal today is to try to talk about some more general stories in the framework of Lennon's factoriality conjecture. Okay, so roughly speaking, you can find that the local gamma factor exactly captures the Fourier transform kernel. Okay, then let's briefly review the learns functoriality. Okay, you fix To reality, okay, you fix a global field k. Okay, we fixed it to be number field, okay, g over k reductive. Um, and we fix rho here, L group, L G is the Lenin L group of G. Okay, you fix the homomorphism to G of V rho, okay. And you fix pi to be a caspied or automorphic representation of G then Lennon suggests that one should be able to define the That one should be able to define the global automorphic L-function. Okay, the ramified place need probably need a local Lenin's conjecture. Roughly speaking, when real part of S is sufficiently large, it should admit local global factorization. And he proved that the partial L function is absolutely convergent for real part of S sufficiently large. Then the functoriality conjecture of Lennon says that the global L function has a The global L function has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane with the following functional equation. Okay, so the left-hand side is L1 minus S pi check rho, and here is the global root number, okay. No, global root number, global epsilon factor, sorry, epsilon s pi rho times l s pi rho. Okay, here the global epsilon factor is not zero entirely in s okay, and such a conjecture is known for a special. Such a conjecture is known for a special list of G and rho, okay, and usually the known methods include the Tate method that we just mentioned, and later Glummer and Jeff K generalize the method of Tate to general GLN case and wrote the standard representation. And there are also methods known as the Rankin-Silver integrals, Lannard-Shahidi method, and the trace formula. So the focus, my focus today is that can we understand That can we understand the analytical properties of the global L-function and its local factors through harmonic analysis on G also related spherical varieties. So more precisely from the procedure of TCs, we find that there are mainly three ingredients. So first you need to define a suitable Schwarz space, then you need to define a suitable Fourier transform, and then you prove a Poisson summation attached to them. So, to generalize two general automorphic L functions, Brahman and Kashdam in 2000, they introduced a conjecture framework to establish the analytical properties of the global automorphic function and its local factors. So, the prototype of the proposal is the theory of Gutaman Jacquet for G's. J okay, for G equals G L N over any k central simple algebra and the row is a standard representation. Okay. Okay, so let's first briefly talk about the setup. Okay, we fix G over K to be a split reductive group. Okay. And we need to assume that there is a non-trivial precharacter, okay, from G to G M okay, playing the role of determinant. So for instance, if G is G O N, you just take sigma to be determinant. G is GON, you just take sigma to be determinant. And then let's assume that we fix rho, okay, to be an irreducible injective finite dimensional representation of the dual group of G, okay, which is irreducible injective with highest weight number row, okay, for convenience. Of course, later, um, Ngo shows that the assumptions can be relaxed, okay. You do not need to make so many assumptions, okay, it's not it's okay, okay, and uh, circularity is. Okay. And stacularities also suggest that such a framework can be generalized to more general G-alpha and spherical varieties. Okay. Okay. And following the paradigm question. Okay, following the paradigm of... I think steals for certain representation row, right? Not for all law, for generalization of circularities. Or for circularities? In the suggestion, it should be for any role. I mean, you only need to assume that G has non-trivial center, then that's enough. Yeah, but my knowledge is that you can only compute the row associated to for a particular variety, may not all row appears. Order appears. Well, we will see. Yeah, we will see. Okay, we'll see. Okay. Yeah, later we will see. Okay, let's keep your question later. Okay, then we will see. Okay. So any other question? Okay, so following the paradigm of TCDs, there are the following conjectural ingredients. Okay, you have some Schwarz space, okay, which contains smooth and competitive supportive functions on G, and it's contained in the And it's contained in the space of smooth functions on G. And then there's a Fourier transform intertwining the conjecture schwa space. And finally, and the most importantly, you need to prove a positive summation attached to it. In particular, in the case of Gudemann and J, the Schwarz space can be taken to be the usual Schwarz-Bruha functions on n-times and matrix. And the GRN has a very standard embedding into it. Very standard embedding into it. Okay. And then you have also have a very standard word transform. Okay. Okay. And the setup, just like the case of T series, okay, you just set the following zeta integral. Okay. So more precisely, you fix f to be a test function in your conjecture Schwarz space. And you fix phi pi p to be a matrix coefficient. Okay. The reason we choose the matrix coefficient here is that. We choose the matrix coefficient here is that we really use the fact that the space of matrix is G cross G spherical variety, and the models, I mean, the representation occurring there are of the form pi tensor pi check. And we said the following zeta integral, okay, Z S F Phi P. Okay, here's Fg integrated against matrix coefficient and twist by the determinant S plus and rho. Okay. And for And for geometric reasons, following the work of Bozier, English and Saclarides, you set the n rho to be rho b pairing with the namda rho. Okay, here namdev rho is the highest weight and the rho b is the half sum of positive roots. Okay, of course, in general, you can definitely take different shifts for n rho. Okay, they just differ by unramified shift, okay. Then you may wonder what are the expectations. Okay, so we have the following expectation for the description of Schwarz space. Okay, so you expect that the zeta integral you define there is absolutely convergent for real part of S sufficiently large, and it has a Meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane, and it's a holomorphic multiple of the local L factor. Okay, and for P and non-Archimedean plane. And for P, a non-Archimedean place, okay, you set the following set. Okay, you run over all the test function f, and you run over all the matrix coefficient, and you put a zeta integral. Based on your first assumption here, this is a holomorphic multiple of L function. So indeed, you expect that it is equal to L function times the following polynomial ring invariable q to the s and q to the minus s. Okay, here q is the cardinality of the residual field. Residual field, okay. And for PRT media, you expect that the theta integral is of exponential decay in any bounded vertical strip, okay, with possible poles removed, okay. Also a small neighborhood of the poles, okay. And the first property is that there exists some distinguished element in the spherical component of your conjecture Schwarz space, okay, such that Okay, such that the conjecture Fourier transform sends this is usually called the basic function. Okay, such that it sends the basic function to the basic function. And if you plug the zoonotical function into the zeta integral, you should just recover the unramified local L factor. And actually, in some sense, it can be viewed as a variant of the well-known Casmash-Leiger formula. Measure Lega formula, okay. And for rho equals the standard representation of GIN, okay, um all the properties listed above are known from the work of Godman and Jake and Jaque, okay, over Archimedia. Okay, and in particular, in the case of Godema and Jake, you can take the follow-up the basic function, okay, which is a variant of customer legal formula. Casimir Eiger formula for spherical Whittager function. Okay, you take it to be the characteristic function of the integer points of Mn. Then let's talk about what are the expectations for the local Fourier transform. Okay, so just similar to the case of TC, you expect that you have the following functional equation after my morphic continuation. Okay, so the left-hand side is zeta integral one minus s. Is zeta integral one minus s and the Fourier transform acting on your function? And here is matrix coefficient check. Okay, then it is proportional to the original zeta integral attached to f and the phi b okay up to a gamma function. Now it's not a standard gamma function, but I mean it's the raw gamma function. And the key point here is that indeed the Fourier transform should be captured by an invariant distribution on your reductive group G okay. Your reductive group G, okay, and in the sense that I mean its action on any irreducible admissible representation pi, okay, should give you the gamma factor, okay. So in other words, it is really a kind of generalization of the classical Fourier transform kernel, the Pi additive character, okay. And the more you expect that the Fourier transform extends to a unitary operator on the L2 space on On the L2 space on G up to some ramified tweets. And if you compose the Fourier transform twice, you should just get the identity operator. So these are the basic expectations. In particular, in the case of good manager K, you can just take the kernel function to be the additive character, okay, composed with trace, okay, then times determinant to the nth power. Okay. Okay. So, any questions so far? Can I make one comment? Don't you want to call them gamma factors then rather than gamma functions? Because in other in the theory of L functions, they're usually called gamma factors. I see. I see. Then let's just call it gamma factors. I mean, but it is usually called gamma factors. Okay, okay, no problem. In Archimedean, it will be a product of gamma functions, but I mean, it is just a common stylistic common. Just a comment, stylistic comment. I see. Okay, no problem. I will follow your suggestion. Okay. Excuse me. Do we always expect you I expect the existence of such a Schwartz function space associated to row, right? Do we always expect this is some k-points of some algebra varieties, or this could be something else? something else. We will talk about, let's keep your question later. Okay, we will see when we talk about the related geometry. Then let's talk about some preliminary analysis for local unramified situation. Indeed, for the unramified part, the Schwartz space actually admits a very simple description. So if you fix P to be a non-comedian place, indeed, you can prove that. And indeed, you can prove that the spherical component of your conjecture Schwarz space is generated by a single element, just the basic function that we just mentioned. And if you want to get a perfect functional equation, okay, so here you need to reparametrize your operator so that the action here really gives you the perfect functional equation. Here is really the local gamma factor. Then, indeed, you just take the inverse eigen transform of gamma minus s minus n rho and the. minus s minus n rho and here pi p and row check psi p okay here we view the gamma function as a rational function in sataki parameters of pi p okay and similarly um similarly for p Archimedean okay you can take the basic function as the inverse Harry-Schandler transform which is the Archimedean analog of Sadikian transform of the Archimedean unramified L function okay then can prove that after suitable unramified twist After suitable unramified twists, they can be plugged into the associable twist formula. Okay, now let me answer, partially answer your question. Okay, let's talk about some basic geometries attached to the structure space. So more precisely for any such pair, G and rho, following the work of Butcher, Arina, and the Winberg, okay, you can show that there exists an affine spherical embedding from G to another spherical. Another spherical variety, another spherical variety, okay, M rho. Okay, here M rho arises from the theory of reductive monoids, okay. And it is expected that the Schwarz space is connected with the geometry of the monoid. And in particular, the work of Bozier and Go and the Saclaridis shows that if you take the global model of your reductive monoid and take its IC function and localize, you can prove that indeed you. You can prove that indeed you just recovered the desired basic function. Okay. And of course, as you just said, that I mean, it's just a question that mentioned that you can ask similar question for more general spherical varieties. So more precisely, earlier work of Brownman Fingerberg, Gates Greek and Mirkovich, they show that if you take X to be the affine completion of GMO UP or GMO PP bracket. Or GMO PB bracket, here P is a parabolic subgroup of G. Okay. Then indeed they give a description, a similar description of the IC function there. And the question, circularity asks the following question, okay, is it possible to generalize the harmonic analysis like T C to a suitable category of affine spherical varieties? Okay, in particular for the reductive mono here, it can Reductive mono here, it can be viewed as a g cross g spherical variety. Okay, and in a recent work of Saclaridis and Wang, okay, they similarly describe the IC function for spherical variety such that its dual group is equal to the dual group of G. Okay, so I'm not gonna discuss too many details here. Okay, okay, so these are some basic geometries related to the struct space, okay. Related to the short space, okay. Then let's talk about the invariant distribution. That's one of the key ingredients in the proposal of Brown and Cashdown. Okay, so a natural question is how to construct such an invariant distribution, which after Mullen transform gives you the non-standard local gamma factor. Okay. Brahman and Karsten, in their work, they suggest a construction using algebraic integration. Construction using algebraic integration and some suitable datum on the Torre. And later Ngoh suggests that it should be constructed by a kind of generalization of the classical Henkel transform. And similarly, you can ask similar questions in finite field analog. Then, fortunately, this question has been resolved by the work of Chen and Go for G equals G L N. For G equals GRN, and by Charging Chen for D module setting and for almost all finite fields, okay. He needs to assume some bounds on the characteristic of P. Okay. And later, Lamont and Ladderlier, they proved the finite field analog over any finite fields anyway. But right today, let's focus on the Today, let's focus on the local field situation. Okay, so let's first outline some basic properties for the distribution kernel. Okay. It is suggested in their paper, okay, Brahman and Kashtan's paper, they suggest that indeed you can approximate the distribution by suitable distributions in the Bernstein center of G. Okay, so that for in particular, let's fix F to be non-Archimedean, okay? Okay, um. Okay, so let me first briefly remind you the definition of Bernstein center. Okay, it has the following equivalent characterizations. It can be identified as the endomorphism ring of the identity functor on the category of smooth representations of GF. It can also be identified as the space of invariant and essentially comparison distributions on GF. Here, a distribution is called essentially comparison. Distribution is called essentially comparison product if its confliction with test function is still a test function. Okay, and finally, it can also be regarded as the space of regular functions on the Bernstein variety. More precisely for a reductive group G, okay, the Bernstein variety attached to G is defined as follows. It's a destroyed union of infinitely many components of finite dimensional algebraic varieties. Each is parametrized by a pair. Parametrized by a pair, okay, M and sigma. Here, M is a La V of G, and the sigma is a caspidal representation of M. Okay, and here the corresponding component is given by M and chi twist by a twist twist action of sigma, okay, up to G conjugation invariant. Okay, here chi is an unramified character of M. In particular, you can prove that X M sigma here has a finite dimensional algebraic variety structure inherited from the Structure inherited from the unramified characters of M. Okay, then finding integer n, let's define the following slides in the group G. Okay, so we define g n to be g inside gf such that the determinant of g, okay, we take the absolute value norm, this is equal to q to the minus n. Okay, here q is the cardinality of the residual field, okay. Then we let uh five row pi n. five row psi n to be the kernel five row per psi okay cut out by the slice g n here okay um then a natural expectation here is that for each such slice okay if i rock the side n it should lies in the burnst and center okay and by the serial burns and center it should give you a regular function on the burnstead variety okay a regular function f phi rho pl acting on pi okay Possibly n acting on pi. Okay. Okay, so for each individual n, we have such a regular function, we can take its summation over all the integers n. Okay, so we define f of phi rho pi pi s to be the summation over n of f of phi rho pi n pi s. Then we expect that Lorentz series is convergent for real part of a summation small with a Meromorphic continuation to C and is equal to the And it's equal to the local gamma factor. Okay, a typical example again is the standard representation of GIN. Okay, you take Poseid, I mean find standard to be the Poseidon composed with trace. Okay, then indeed you can just prove that you take each slice of this distribution, indeed it lies in the Bernstein center of GRN. Okay. Another important observation of Bernstein is. important observation of Bernstein is that in his Harvard notes, okay, he observed that if you take the restriction of distribution to SLN, okay, it also lies in the center of SLN, okay. Okay, then following the observation of Bernstein, okay, in a drama work with Jang, okay, we try to give a pi-Kenkel transform, okay, motivated from the observation of Bernstein, okay, we construct a pi-henkel transform. We construct a pi-Henkel transform over any local field F of categories zero. It can be viewed as an analog of the classical Bayesian function. So more precisely, here you have the usual Schwarz-Bruha functions on matrix. Okay, you tensor with the space of matrix coefficient. Then you have a natural Fourier transform on the first variable and you take a contragradient to the second variable. Then you can integrate along the determinant, okay, which from fiber integration. which from fiber integration gives you a schwa space on f and here a schwa space on here's f cross sorry it's a table okay here's a schwa space on attached to pi check on f cross okay then there's an induced transform okay then um it's not hard to prove that this downstairs transform is well defined and moreover it is represented by a smooth function on f cross of a such that the operator can be represented by the convolution against a smooth function. By the convolution against a smooth function. And moreover, if you take the million version of this smooth function and after suitable regularization for the integral, it just gives you the gamma function. And the construction and regularization is not very hard. You just choose NECL to be any delta sequence tending to identity. And you convolve your kernel with such a delta sequence and integrate. sequence and integrate with the matrix coefficient and take the slide determinant g equals x. Then you can prove that such a construction for k pi pi psi is independent of the sequence you choose and the matrix coefficient you choose there. And the reason we care about such a construction is that, I mean, first, if you run such a local story, in some sense, in the spherical place, you just recover the work. Just recovered the work of Professor Kesman on Kessman-Schlegel formula. And more generally, you can also consider some higher-ranked case. The guiding philosophy is reflected in the theory of Pyrrho model. More precisely, for generic representations of pi, they can be realized on the same variety, Pn, model, UN. Here, Pn is the mybolic of GIN, and the UN is the uniform radical. But although they have the same underlying variety, And although they have the same underlying variety, they have different realizations of the Schwarz space and the Fourier operator captured by pi. Okay. Then I'm going to introduce my recent joint work with Jian and John on the standard representation of classical groups. So more precisely, we fix F to be a PIDF field. You can also take F to be a comedian field. Okay, later. We take G to be GM cross sp2n. SP2N and the representation row that we are considering is the standard representation of the dual group of G. Okay, so more precisely, the dual group of G is C cross cross SO2N plus 1. It has a standard embedding into GO2N plus 1. Then we give a full description of the star goes to the center. Which part of center? Star when you are embedding, do you check? Start when you are embedding GCHEC? Oh, this is scaling action. That's a good question. It's scaling action. Okay. Yeah. And we give a full description of the Schwarz space using the geometry of the corresponding monoid. And we give an explicit formula for the kernel. And it is the first case over local field after the work of Good Manager K. And I think it should not surprise you that it is based on the work of doubly method of Pier Tessi Shapio. Doubling method of Piotesis, Shapiro and Eralis, and the normalization on the local gamma factor from the work of Lapier and Ralis and the more recent works. So more precisely, let me first briefly remind you the doubling method from Pieta Si, Shapiro, and Ralis. You take F2n to be a simple additive space. Okay. Then the principle here is that there is embedding of sp2n cross sp2n into sp4n. sp2n into sp4n okay so sp4n is the sympoietic group attached to the following simpler space okay it's s s uh is f2n direct sum with f2n and this is the original simpler form direct sum with minus of the original simpler form okay and with that we take p okay to be the single parabolic in sp4n stabilizing the diagonal upper round gen okay so in particular you get a ziggle parabolic Ziggler parabolic and then Pietasi Shapiro and Raleigh's proved that here you have a natural embedding from sp2n cross sp2n into sp4n and sp4n has a natural projection to the flat variety okay sp4n modular single parabolic then they prove that it has a risky open dense image okay and the stabilizer is exactly equal to the diagonal embedding of sp2n into two copies of sp2n okay and Then, Kiatasi, Shapiro, and Rales are using the analytical properties of the intertwining operator attached to this induced model, okay, and establish the basic properties of the standard function of symplatic groups, okay. Okay, then in my joint work with N John and John, we observed that we have the following commutative diagram, we have the following diagram of it. Following diagram. So, more precisely, sp4n has a natural projection to the pre-flag variety, okay, XP. Okay, here XP is PP bracket module SP4N here, okay. And on the left-hand side, you have an open-dense Bruha cell, okay. MAB is the abolitionization of your Levi, okay. And on the left-hand side, you have a urban dense Bruha cell, okay. Omega is the longest wire element, okay, on the and on the right-hand side. And on the right-hand side, you have a double embedding from the work of Piatricius Shapiro and Ralis. And moreover, you can prove that both left-hand side and the right-hand side are Zariski open dense in XP. And the transition morphism between left-hand side and right-hand side, you can prove that it's given by a Perli transform. Then on the other hand, Um, then on the other hand, um, from the classical work of Pietro Shapiro and Rales, you are going to use the intertwining operators. Okay, so here it is observed by Brahman-Karshnon that intertwining operators on such the general principle series can be upgraded to a universal family, okay, with the normalization factor given by the geometry of XP. Okay, so a simple example is that you have the classical Fourier transform. You have the classical Fourier transform on A2 space. Okay. You have classical Fourier transform. On A2, you have, I mean, the point here is that A2 mod 0 can be identified with SL2 mod unipotent. Okay. So in particular, SA2 has a natural projection to the induced space from B to G. Okay, the principal series. Okay. Then the fluid transform upper stairs projects downstairs to the normalized into 20 operator. And recently, this formulation has been further studied by the work of Gates Xu and Leslie for G split, simple, and simply connected. Okay. And then following the suggestion of Brahman Kashsta for the harmonic analysis on the left-hand side, okay, on the open dense Blue House cell, okay, embed into XP, you can introduce the following flow transform. The following for a transform okay for any f which is a test function Rxp. Okay, you said the following regularized integral. Okay, so first you do an intertwining operator on such sections, then you compose with abelian generalized Fourier transform attached to some distribution eta. Here S is a section corresponding to the projection map from M to G M. Okay. And the distribution eta here It gives you some generalized abelian floured transform, okay. So, more precisely, if you take the regularized money inversion for this distribution, it just gives you such a product of gamma factor. So, here's gamma s minus 2n minus 1 over 2 chi pi times product i from 0 to n minus 1. Here's gamma 2s minus 2m plus 2i and chi-square pi psi. So, this factor really comes from the normalization of the intertwined. comes from the normalization of the intertwined operator. Then we prove that you can define such a naive definition of Schwarz space. Okay, you just take the Schwarz space to be cc infinity on xp and plus the Fourier transform acting on cycling infinity functions. Then you can prove that the Fourier transform stabilized the Fourier transform stabilized the structure space. Straw space and then you can prove that up to some correcting constant, okay, two to the power n times two n plus one. Okay, this Fourier operator extends to a unitary operator on L2 XP, okay. And if you compose the Fourier operator twice, okay, you just get the identity operator up to some constant, okay. And um, the third property is one of the most important property described in the describing the describing the um describing the geometric property of the schwa space is that we prove that a function f belongs to the schwa space if and only if f is right k finite and as a function in a okay uh such a function belongs to some schwa space on the affine line okay s minus pbs f cross okay for any fixed k inside your um uh maximum open Maximum open combat subgroup. Okay. So, what is S minus Pbs F cross? Let me briefly remind you here that roughly speaking, if you take the Molly inversion or Molly transform of this space of test functions, you just get the product of abelian gamma abelian L factors. Okay, here's L s plus n chi times i from 0 to n minus 1 and L 2s plus 2i chi square. And the importance of the And in particular, an important observation here is that although the definition of Schwarz space is pretty naive, okay, but it turns out that functions in the corresponding Schwarz space can be described by their asymptotic behavior near the singular locus. More precisely, if you take the affine completion of your variety XP, then actually you just increase one point of it. That's the only singular locus you have. Singular locus you have okay in particular, it's not hard to verify that the reductive monoid m rho attached to g rho in this setting, your g is gm cross sp2n, okay, and rho is the standard representation of the dual group. You can prove that indeed the reductive monoid in this case is exactly given by the affine compilation of xp. Okay, can you can you go back one page? I want to see your last statement that's this belongs. Last statement: that's that it belongs if and only if okay, yeah, yeah, it looks like a finite dimensional characterization, but actually the germ at the single locus is infinite dimensional. Yeah, I mentioned some stuff like this tomorrow in my talk, so it's interesting to me. Yeah, that's very nice. Thank you. Yeah, no problem, yeah. Any other question? Okay, let's go on. Okay. Okay, let's go on. Okay. I think I don't have much time left. Okay. Okay, then let's switch to the switch to the Fourier operator. Okay, so as we just said that you can do a transition from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, okay. Then the transition is given by clay transform. Okay. And you can compute the Jacobian of the Clay transform, okay, which is given by determinant H minus identity to a H minus identity to the power minus 2 and plus 1, okay, up to some constant. Okay. Then to define a corresponding S row gf, okay, we just simply pull back the functions xp to g okay. Simply do a pullback, okay. And do some shift is not very important, okay. And we define the following kernel function, okay, phi rho psi ah. Okay, this is the eta distribution that we have seen before, okay, and the inner variable is eight. And the inner variable is a times determined determinant h plus identity to n okay up to some extra factor here. Okay, and indeed the corresponding Fourier transform okay f rho pi okay acting on such function okay this is realized as convolution against such an invariant distribution okay from the expression here indeed you find that the distribution is invariant okay Then we verify that indeed the Fourier operator stabilizes the Schwarz base. Okay. And it extends to a unitary operator on L2GF. And if you compose the Fourier transform twice, you just get an identity. And if you take a closed slice in your group, you take GL to be element AH inside your GF, which is F crossed cross sp2n, okay, such that the norm of A is Q to the. Such that the norm of A is q to the minus l okay, you let chl to be the characteristic function of gl, then you can prove that you cut out the slice for your distribution phi ri, okay, which we denoted by phi r possi l indeed the distribution lies in the burns and center of gf okay. Then we prove that this distribution lies in the burns and center of gf. Okay, in particular, um for any irreducible admissible representation of gf um it acts on such It acts on such a distribution, gives you a regular function on the Bristol variety, which we denote by F L chi times of pi. Okay. Then if you do unremified tweaks for your character there and take the summation over L, then you can prove that the summation is convergent, okay, when real part of S is small, okay. And it admits a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane, okay. And moreover, you can prove that indeed the summation. And moreover, you can prove that indeed the summation gives you the gamma factor. And based on the work of Yamana, you can prove that indeed this raw space gives you the L factor. And based on the work of La Pier, Rales, Ikida, and Kokuhama, okay, you can prove that indeed, I mean, this is how we derive the fact that this factor indeed is a local Lennon's gamma factor. Okay. Okay, let me see how many times left. Okay, I think. Left, okay. I think I think 45 minutes. Okay, then let me just two slides. Okay, just two slides. Okay, then uh, let me briefly mention my joint work with Ngo. Okay, I think Ngo is also gonna talk about this on Wednesday. Okay, um, we propose a construction of the kernel distribution for any GRN, okay, attached to any row. Um, in particular, in the case of GR2, it is due to the work of Lauren Lafogue, okay. Of loneliness fork, okay. More precisely, if you let G to be GL2, okay, you fix any row, okay, from GL2C to GLNC. Okay, then if you restrict the row to the diagonal torus, you get a map from two-dimensional torus to n-dimensional torus. Then you can pass to its dual side, okay? You just get a map from here should be torus, or it's not A, it's GM to the n's power, okay. You get a map, I mean, a homomorphism. I mean, a homomorphism between torus from gm n copy to gm square. Okay, then very naively, you can push forward the standard flow transform on the torus, okay, to the downstairs two-dimensional torus, okay. Then learn a four give a candidate for the construction of the full kernel, okay. So more precisely model the convergence issue, you let AI to be the trace of wedge i. Okay, more precisely, um Okay, more precisely, these are just the standard fusion coordinates of your group the algebra of GO2. Okay, then he proposed that the kernel, okay, in trees and determinant, this is the corresponding torus distribution. Okay, you can also descend the torus distribution to the stamber heading base. Okay, then you do a Fourier transform on the Stanberg Hydrogen base. Then you insert one additional factor, then you do Fourier inversion back. Okay, you just get a kernel. Okay. Okay, you just get a kernel. Okay, this is what he proposed. And I myself verify that model conversion, modular convergence issue indeed, the construction gives you the correct kernel for symmetric square. In particular, it coincides with my drawing work with Jiang and Zhang. Also, following his paradigm, I also construct a corresponding kernel for GM cross-sp SO4. Okay, and you can verify that indeed it gives you. Verify that indeed it gives you the right kernel, okay. Uh, then uh, my drama work with NGO, we try to generalize um the construction to grn and even more generally that we prove, okay. We set G to G to be GRN, okay, and you fix any row from GRN to GRV row, okay. And the row check T, I mean, correspondingly, you restrict the morphism row to the diagonal torus, okay, then you get a map from n-dimensional torus. You get a map from n-dimensional torus to dimension row towards okay. Then you pass to a do side. Okay, here again, it's gm is not a okay. And similarly, you can push forward a standard for a kernel row or pi or no side composed with trace. Okay, you can do a push forward of this kernel to the n-dimensional towers. Then we propose such a candidate for the kernel. Okay, so model convergence issue, we let So model convergence issue, we let AI to be the Steinberg-Higgins coordinates of the Lie algebra of GLN. Okay. Then the right distribution in Steinberg-Hitching coordinates should be given by a similar construction. We descend the kernel on torus to the base, okay, and you do Fourier transform. Then you add some extra factor, then you do Fourier inversion back, okay. And what is the extra factor? So here, d alpha i Ai, here Ai is the summary of Hujing coordinates and alpha. Assembly of Hushing coordinates and alpha i can be viewed as a do variable for ai. This is a symmetric polynomial attached to variables ti such that here d alpha i trace of wedge i t okay is equal to the following polynomial. Okay, so here summation some index i in capital I n minus 2. Okay, here summation j from 1 to n minus 1 alpha i times trace of wedge i minus 2 t i okay. So this is QTI. Okay, so this is a very mysterious polynomial. Okay, we did it by some tedious computation, okay, and figure out such a construction model the convergence issue. Okay, and the key observation here is that indeed the construction should really have some micro-local nature, okay, which I don't think I have enough time to explain that. Okay, and finally, thank you for your attention and happy birthday to Professor Kesselman. Yeah.
