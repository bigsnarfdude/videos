Okay, so welcome to everybody. Again, good morning, good evening, or good afternoon, depending where you are. And we start today with Sumati Suria that will speak about growing a quantum discrete universe, Kausali. Sumati, please. Yes, I would like to thank the organizers for this opportunity to talk at this conference. Like all of you, I would have loved to be in the mountains. Of you, I would have loved to be in the mountains with you, but I'm also very grateful to be safely ensconced in my house at this fairly terrible time and yet be able to talk to all of you. So today I'll talk about how to grow a quantum discrete universe causally. Oh goodness, okay, I can't seem to, okay. And this is the outline of my talk. What I mean by the twin horns of quantum By the twin horns of quantum cosmology, are the following two questions, which is that of covariance related to the problem of time, as well as a measurement problem. These two problems are sitting on the tips of the horn, which is at the gateway to the bull temple in my city. And so, the way that I will try to resolve these questions or try to You know, try to talk about a resolution about these questions is in the first instance to take the histories approach to covariance in the problem of time. And in the second, for the measurement problem, to talk about the quantum measure. So let's ask the question about covariant observables in quantum cosmology. What could they be? And how do we define them in any meaningful way? And I'd like you to think of the following examples. One is the Think of the following examples. One is a bouncing cosmology. And if I had a bouncing cosmology with different epochs, then I would imagine that the number of epochs that I have or the space-time volume for any given epoch or for, you know, distribution of these space-time volumes would be something that's in fact fully covariantly defined. But of course, in order to know that a region is an epoch, you need the full evolution of space-time. So what I'm going to try to argue is that covariant observables need us to evolve. Observables need us to evolve the space-time fully to define for their definition. Another example is something like an initial condition, say a Hartle-Hawking type initial condition. You can't tell whether if you start off with the first diagram on the left, I think you can see my pointer. Well, I mean, this would be an initial condition, but you could have a second universe joining in, in which case this information isn't enough to define everything in the future. To define everything in the future, you would in fact have to restrict to histories which have this form. So, you really need to look at histories that have been fully evolved in order to ask covariant questions. And the natural choice of these kinds of things, covariant events are things that are based on past sets or future sets, if you like. And a specific example of that is the definition of a horizon in a space-time. Of a horizon in a space-time, which of course needs pass sets, it's defined with respect to pass of null infinity. And these are all covariantly defined. And as an example, something you might want to ask is, give me a measure on the set of cosmologies which have 10 black holes in them. Okay, that's a kind of covariant question you might be interested in asking. And so I want to suggest that there's a very close link between covariance and teleology. Link between covariance and teleology, I'm using it very loosely, not philosophically, but just simply that you want to run the space-time till the end. And in other words, covariant observables require a fully evolved space-time. And here's a quote from Aristotle who said that an acorn's intrinsic telos is to become a fully grown oak tree. And there will be some analogy to this in what follows. I hope you can, it will be apparent. And the question that we really want to ask are what are the covariant dipons of quantum cosmology? Covariant equals of quantum cosmology. And the second question related to the measurement problem is, of course, something that we all know, which is that we don't know how to isolate an observer in quantum cosmology. And in particular, we don't have a quantum theory of closed systems. And in this sense, this talk is completely non-operational. We're not talking about somebody working on a system. We really want to understand quantum mechanics from the whole or from the inside out. From the whole or from the inside out. And of course, this is very nicely described by Bell, who first, I guess, talked about these issues. And I find this quote very, very amusing. And in order to address this question, the approach is to use this quantum measure paradigm due to Saukin. And the idea is that rather than quantizing the phase space, the classical phase space, you quantize. The classical phase space, you quantize a classical stochastic theory, which is, of course, a measure theory. When it's written formally, when it's written mathematically explicitly, then it's a measure theory. And that measure theory is a triplet, which is that you come with a sample space, and you can think of it as a space of histories, and an event algebra that's generated along with a probability measure. So the idea is to quantize this object here, and in the process of quantization, you replace. And in the process of quantization, you replace the probability measure by what's called quantum measure, which I'll say a little bit about, unfortunately, only to the end, which basically gets realized in the history's Hilbert space. Again, I'll say a few words, I'll say something about that. And the observables within this framework are Bell's beables or the events in that algebra. And although we don't have a full-fledged interpretation of quantum measure theory, one principle which I believe will survive interpretation is the idea of preclusion, which is that if you have an event whose measure, whose quantum measure is zero, then that you can say, you can make a physical statement that that event doesn't happen. And the example that I want to take quickly is that of a random walk to keep it in mind. If you have the set of all infinite time You have the set of all infinite time parts in the random walk, say it starts from the origin, then the finite time event algebra is generated by all paths, finite time paths up to some time t. Say you take a path like this, and you look at all the possible paths that you can construct from here on. And that set is a set in the set of all infinite time paths. And you can use this to generate the so-called event. Generate the so-called event algebra. This is a cylinder set that you construct and you use it to construct finite time event algebra. But an example of one of these teleological questions that you might be interested in is the return event. You know, what is the probability for the particle to return? And this is, of course, of interest in a wide range of, you know, a wide range of physics. And something that we don't take, we just take for granted that we can always do this is that. Granted that we can always do this, is that in order to answer this question, you actually can't go just with the finite M event algebra. You have to run it to infinity, which means that you take these events and you basically construct what's called the sigma algebra, which is the union, you know, the countable unions and intersections rather than finite unions and intersections. All of that is a lot of detail, but all I want to say is that this is a picture to keep in mind, that you need to run it to infinity. And what you need to define it. And what you need to define the teleological event is to go to the full sigma algebra. So, now let me shift gear and say a few words about causal set quantum gravity. I'm hoping Fabe will say much more in her talk. All I need to say right now is that this is the model in which we will be realizing these questions. And it's basically, I'm going to even skip this slide and say that what we have is that we posit that. Is that we posit that the fine-grained structure of space-time is that of a causal set, which is basically a locally finite posset? And like Marius talked about two days ago, quantum superposition of graphs, these are quantum superpositions of causal sets, which are locally finite post-sets. So they're specific classes of graphs. And that's the kind of question you want to ask in the quantum theory. This is the first hypothesis, the second hypothesis is. Hypothesis, the second hypothesis has to do with a continuum approximation, but I will not have any time to go into it, and it's not directly relevant to what I have to say today. So, let's try to ask the question, how do you do quantum cosmology with causal sets? And this is the sequential growth paradigm due to Rydart and Sokin, which is a very beautiful idea, which is that you try to grow causal sets element by element. And the most natural starting point And the most natural starting point, which is the most natural initial condition that you can give, and the simplest one, is that you start off with a single element. There is one element with probability one. That's it. That's your initial condition. And then you start to grow it. And of course, this is generally a stochastic process. You grow it in a way that's causal. In other words, the new element that you add cannot be added to the past of the existing element. Added to the past of the existing element, it's either added to the future of the existing elements or some of the existing elements or is unrelated to them. So, when you do that, in the first stage, you get either this chain or you get an anti-chain. And then as you proceed further, you get more and more complicated things. And it's a very growth, there's a very rapid growth in the number of postets, super exponential growth. But of course, when you look at this, what I'm growing are labeled causal sets, which is why everything is colored in this pretty way. Everything is colored in this pretty way, and really, what I'm interested in is this very gray, uncolored object, which is to say that I'm interested in the fact that this one, this one, and this one. Hopefully, you can see my pointer when I do that. Yeah? Okay. These three post sets are in fact without the labels, they're the same postet. So, covariance is realized as label invariance. So, I would like to say something about that these three postets are, in fact, one and the same. In fact, one and the same. I erase all the color and I get this gray object. So I am interested in looking for label invariant objects. The classical sequential growth models of Rydap and Sorkin started off with asking the question, well, okay, you have this process of growth, but then maybe there are some physical principles that you can impose on this growth, which will simplify or give you some interesting dynamics, reduce climate. Dynamics, a reduced class of dynamics, which is physically interesting. And of course, you have causal evolution. You also have covariance in the sense that I described earlier, which is that these three causal sets, these three element causal sets, the probability of producing them either through this path, this path, or this path, should be the same. So that's what we mean by covariance. It's path independence. And then there's a condition of Bell causality, which is harder to describe quickly, but Is harder to describe quickly, but it's a sort of spectator independence. Which is that if you have an event that's a new element that's being added to the future of some existing elements, but not to the, is unrelated to another set, that spectator set should not affect the dynamics in an important way. The dynamics is also Markovian. And when you do this and you turn And when you do this and you churn in everything you know, put in all these conditions, you find out that what they found out was that at every stage, you can characterize the evolution by a single coupling constant. And in particular, I've written this Qn, which is basically telling you how to go from here to here. That's Q1. This is telling you how to go from here to here. That's Q2, and so on. So, in other words, adding an element that's unrelated to everything else, that's if you just know that probability. Just know that probability, then you can construct the entire dynamics from that. Okay, so this is a classical sequential growth dynamics. There's a particular example of transitive percolation, which is very simple, where you just have one particular, everything is characterized by one particular coupling constant. And that's, of course, much easier to study. What is very interesting is a certain renormalization group that they studied along with That they studied along with Denjo O'Connor and Xavier Martin, Javier Martin, and found that this transitive population looks like it's a fixed point of the evolution if the universe goes through bounces. Okay. All right. So what's important to us here, of course, is that we want to talk about the formal construction in order to be able to quantize the system. And for that, we need to phrase this in the measures. Phrase this in the language of measure theory. And this was done by Breitwold, Daucker, Garcia, Hinson, and Sorkian. And it's a very, again, a very lovely paper because it systematizes this entire study. And you can see immediately the analogy with quantum random walk, where you ask the question, well, you're generating. So, one of the things that you should remember is that what you're generating in this process is our label causal sets. Are labeled causal sets. And sorry, I think I went one too far. And what you want to ask is: just like you did for the random walk, how do you generate the algebra? And the algebra is generated by cylinder sets again, where now the cylinder sets, instead of talking about a path, which is specified up to a time t, you talk about an n-element causal set, a label causal set, like this one here. And any causal set. The any causal set, any labeled causal set which contains this will be in this cylinder set. So, the cylinder set is a set of all causal sets, which has these three elements as the first three elements, its first three elements. It's labeled, so they have to be the first three elements. Okay, so what this does is generate a finite time event algebra in the same way that it does in the random walk. And you now ask the question: well, what Now, ask the question: Well, what is the sample space? So, what's important here is that because of the growth process, you started off with one single element, you see immediately that the causal set you generate can only be past finite. You can't generate past infinite causal sets this way. So there's already an asymmetry in the time, which I, for one, am totally comfortable with. I like it. I think it's a good feature of this way of thinking about the evolution of cosmology. And this is your sample space that you begin with. So now you've got your event algebra, and then you can construct your probability measure on it for the classical sequential growth. And so this formalizes the entire thing. But of course, in order to construct covariant events, you need the infinite time. You need, like in the case of the teleological question in the random walk, you need to look at infinite time to construct the finite, the time of. The finite time of return or the event of return question that only belongs to the sigma algebra. So you need to go to the sigma algebra to define the covariant events. Now we're very lucky in classical probability theory, and we don't ever think about it as physicists, but in fact, this is very important that you have this Carathéodori Hahn extension theorem, which I think I should have also put in Kolmogorov, where μ extends to the full sigma algebra. To the full sigma algebra. If you have a probability measure, then it will extend apart from some minor little wiggles that you need to may have to do to the measure or to the algebra. And this is actually very important for covariance. In fact, it sort of implies covariance in the following way, because that means that you can put a measure onto the teleological events, and not only that, the teleological events which actually are covariantly defined. So, what are those? Are those? So, a covariant label invariant event algebra can be constructed by quotienting. So, in other words, I have an event and I say that it's a covariant event. So, it's an event, by the way, is a set within the sample space. And it's generated in this particular way, but think of it as a set in the sample space. If that set is such that every causal set that belongs to it also for every Also, for every causal set that belongs to it, if all its labelings, relabelings also belong to that set, then I will call that a covariant set. So you can do, you can quotient with respect to this and construct a covariant or label invariant event algebra. Examples of covariant events then are, for example, this originary event, which is basically saying that there is a single element and I can colored it red. And I've labeled it, colored it red, which is to the past of all other events. This is completely covariantly defined. There is no ambiguity or any kind of labeling that goes in. It is the unique element to the past of everything else. Another is the discrete analog of the bounce. And you can see why the bounce is interesting to those of us working in causal sets, because you can define it in a very simple way, and the simplest way to Way to do so is by this thing called a post, which is a single element, which is that orange element, which is which basically separates the causal set into its future and into its past. Everything is either to its future or to its past. And that post is like a bounce. And you can think of a bounce in cosmology like this and counting, for example, the number n that's there in the first bounce, before the first bounce. And that's a perfectly well-defined. That's a perfectly well-defined covariant observable. So, in other words, what we're saying is that covariant observables are covariant events in this covariant sigma algebra. Okay, so that's the framework. Another very important class of important algebra that is generated is via this the idea. Is via this, the idea of past sets, which are stems, which are analogues of past sets. And this is, if you like, so what I've drawn here is, you know, figuratively, a causal set, which is not labeled, but it has these two stems, past sets, which I've put in shaded with yellow. And these past sets have no labeling on them, but they're past sets in the same way that in the continuum, you can think of a past. In the continuum, you can think of a past set. And these past sets characterize. So, if I give you a causal set, which is not a labeled causal set, sorry, I should have made sure that what I'm talking about is an unlabeled causal set here, the unlabeled space of causal sets, then it's completely characterized by the stems that it has. So, all its past sets characterize a causal set. So, it's a very nice way to think about it. And the sigma algebra. The sigma algebra that you generate from the stem sets is covariant, and one could try to work with that instead. And there's some very nice work, recent work, by Faye and others. Sorry, there's a comma missing here. Faye and Stav, who's also in this conference on how to do this covariant evolution using stem sets. And they have some really nice results. But for now, I'm just going to use my labeled objects and try to see how far I can go with them. How far I can go with them. And so you are at 20 minutes. Okay, great. Thank you. So I have five minutes left, right? Okay. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So the next step is to quantize this classical measure space. And for that, we need to know what we mean by this history's Hilbert space. And again, a very nice paper, which I think is very ignored, but is a beautiful way in which you reconstruct a Hilbert space. You reconstruct a Hilbert space, things that people doing quantum mechanics love, but are sort of seem incompatible with a histories framework. But you use the histories in order to construct this Hilbert space. And the vector measure, so the quantum measure then is a vector measure, can be viewed as a vector measure, taking you from the algebra into the history syllable space. So this is a construction that you have. And now you have to ask the question, can you construct? To ask the question, can you construct a dynamics for this? And will that measure that you construct using a finite time event algebra, will that measure extend? Because ultimately, we want not only a quantum measure, we want a covariant quantum measure on those covariant observables. So for this, it turns out that you need, it's unlike the classical case, you have to have certain convergence conditions satisfied, which are much more complicated. So what we did was we asked the question. So, what we did was we asked the question: well, can we just do this within very simple models of complex, just complexifying the classical model? So rather than take the most general thing, which might be an operator in the Hilbert space, we look at complex, the complex case. And we studied this for the first time 11 years ago or earlier. And for the simplest model, and more recently, we have some results telling us some new things. Some new things. So these models basically, your Hilbert space is basically just the complex plane. So you've reduced, even though you have this huge, you know, this whole space of possible causal sets, you've reduced the Hilbert space down to just the complex plane. So it's much easier to study. And then you're asking to ask, well, in this class of dynamics, can you construct covariant events? Construct covariant events. And when you look at the simplest case, which is of complex percolation, which is really the analog of the transitive percolation where the one parameter is just being complexified, then it turns out that the question of extension is related to a collinearity condition. And you find that if you just take complex percolation, then you can't extend the measure. You can't extend the measure. In other words, in the most straightforward way, you cannot construct all possible covariant events. Although you might be able to do it for some, you can't construct them for all possible ones. So that was the result until much more recently. And this is work with Saf Zalel. And unfortunately, it's a very technical bit of work. And I'm just sort of summarizing the result, which is that we found that when Which is that we found that when you step away from this very simple model to slightly more complicated, but still within the class of complex sequential growth dynamics, where you have more coupling constants, one, at every stage, you allow there to be many more coupling constants, then you can find whole classes of dynamics which allow this extension. And here's a cute result, which Faye will know that I'm cheating when I say. Which they will know that I'm cheating when I say this. But if you looked at the originary question of, you know, this two slides back, this originary question, and you said, well, can I say something about that event? I can actually make a predictive, what I would call a predictive argument, which is that if for those dynamics for which this coupling constant is zero, then the originary event does not happen. So, in some very simple way, I can make a prediction in a covariant. Can make a prediction in a covariant theory in this covariant theory of causal set quantum gravity. So, just to summarize and what we want to do next, so what one should be doing next, I think that what this is, is a concrete framework to study covariant quantum cosmology. We do need to look for physically interesting dynamics beyond even the simple case of complex dynamics. Complex dynamics. Even within this class of complex dynamics, I think we haven't really studied enough about the set of precluded events to make it interesting physically, make it something that we can try to understand better. And finally, we have this question of are there more conditions that you need to study to simplify on your quantum dynamics? We know that we do, not all quantum dynamics will give you covariant dynamics, but are. Will give you covariant dynamics, but are there more conditions? In particular, we've ignored completely this quantum Bell causality. Will it be essential in what follows? So, thank you so much. I think I'm done. Thank you very much, Sumati. Thanks, Sumati. And now we're going to the question and we have already the first question from Anupam. Please. So, thanks. Thank you very much. It's very insightful talk, Sumati. So, I'm not an Sumati. So, I'm not an expert in this area, so maybe I'm asking a very simple question just for my own sake, perhaps. So, one thing which I was trying to understand: how would you recover the infrared aspects of space-time? Or is it even an appropriate question to ask in this context? Or maybe it's not, it's too immature to ask? I think that's right. So it's too immature. It's absolutely appropriate. We don't know. And that's one of the things that one would like to look for. That's one of the things that one would like to look for physically more interesting dynamics. Right now, the point is that the construction, what do we need for, we at least know what we need to make it covariant. And then you have the possibility of, you know, huge number of possible dynamics. How do you whittle them down? One of the nice things about the classical case and the renormalization group thing that I was discussing is that if you assume that the universe goes through bounces and you start off with some arbitrary And you start off with some arbitrary one of these sequential growth models, you know, with any one of these coupling constants, then you find that if you go for long enough, then there is a fixed point, and that fixed point turns out to be the simplest dynamics you have. And that simplest dynamics is transitive percolation. And although it's not really generating, really not strictly generating space-times, it has many features that are very nice about it. Features that are very nice about it, which are, which sort of share the sort of features of cosmology. You know, you have the sudden from a very small region, you have, it widens quickly, of course, for certain parameters, but nevertheless, it does. So transitive percolation is a nice fixed point. It could be that this is a kind of paradigm that we would look for even in the quantum case. But like you said, it's immature. We're still baby steps in that sense. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Okay, we have another question from Sugato. Please, Sugato. Hi, hi, Sumati. Hi, thanks. Thanks again for your talk. So again, it's very unfamiliar territory for me. But what I did not understand is what you called an event here. Is it like a collision between two particles or like a recording or sub-selection of one observation, or what is an event exactly? Or, what is an event exactly? Right. So, let me try to in this context. So, an event, event in the event algebra. So, let's forget covariance for now. Let's forget all that. Think about the random walk. What is an event in the random walk? An event is a set of all parts that come back to the origin, for example. Okay, that's the event. So, the event, so it's the language. So it's the language of measure theory. And we're not, I mean, I definitely wasn't familiar with this language from under, you know, from studying about it, only came to it much later, but this is just measure theory and how you talk about an event. So it is the event is of return. So then you have a probability of return. Okay, so that's the simplest case to think about this. Yeah. I see, I see, I see. So it's kind of event of a It's kind of an event of a history in some sense, but a specific one. Right. So, if you're now going to look at histories, if you're looking at space-times, then the kind of events that I would say are the events that have five bounces, right? I mean, give me the set of events, set of histories, set of space-times, which have undergo five bounces. That's my example of an event. And in the continuum, you might imagine, although it's really hard to formulate any. Although it's really hard to formulate anything precisely in the continuum, is a set of cosmologies which have 10 black holes in them, or you know, whatever 10 to the whatever number you want. And this, the probability of that event that you calculate, is that that computed from some kind of action or something or right. So yeah, so the measure in the classical sequential growth measure. So the whole point in this sequential growth paradigm is. Uh, sequential growth paradigm is that somehow it's a more fundamental dynamics, and that I think, and Faye's talk, Faye will tell us why causal sets, you know, in the intermediate region that there will be, you know, that so if you did have a causal set that looked like the continuum that emerged out of this, that looked like the continuum, then, you know, the Einstein-Hilbert action, all of that would be at a later epoch. But this is a At a later epoch, but this is at a more fundamental level that you're saying, what are the fundamental principles by which you can define these dynamics? So, of course, what you're asking is important. I mean, if you wanted to do a part sum over it, over causal sets and so on, that's one thing that you might be interested in doing. And okay, but that's, yeah, it'll take me too long to discuss it. No, that's fine. That's fine. Just to get an idea. Thanks. Okay, we have. Okay, we have time for a last question that is anupam. So, thanks, Sumati, for clarifying some of the things. So, just now, as you mentioned about the concept of event, so would you then consider that suppose of the universe started with from a singular region? Would you consider that to be an event? Or would you really consider that something, I mean, like bounce and bounce, and then again you come back to the bounce, some kind of cyclic universe. Let me just say that again. That really, what I have, and I'm going to try to go back to this picture, which when I say an originary event, I just don't mean the event, the element. The element is not the event. The event is the set of all causal sets or the set of all histories that share that property. You see, it's not a single. You see, it's not a single one. So there's no fixed causal structure. It's not like that. It's a set of all histories which share this one property. And the point is that that property has to be defined in a covariant way for you to have a covariant event. So it's not the event of the Big Bang. But for example, this on the left, I would say, is different from the one with the post, because here I would say, With the post, because here I would say, I mean, of course, here I haven't told you whether there'll be posts in the future, but here I'm actually specifying that the initial there's just one element that's to the past of every other element in the causal set, whereas that might not be true here. Okay, thank you very much, Sumati. Let's thank Sumati once again.
