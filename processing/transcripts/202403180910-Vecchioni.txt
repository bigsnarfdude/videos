About topology, chirality, and symmetry from primary to quaternary structure in DNA lattices, which is a mouthful, and all of those parts kind of come out through the talk. But I'm Simon Vegion with the Structural DNA Nanotechnology Laboratory at NYU, which is the group that was founded by Med Seaman. It's being run by Ruji Shaw, who's with us today. And I'm excited to talk to you guys today about DNA. DNA. So another sort of alternate title for the talk is just the design of composable DNA triangular tiles, sort of the parts that make them work, and what happens when you change them. So our lab has two main areas of research. We'd say like chemistry and shapes. So chemistry is sort of chemical reactions and different base pairing rules and sort of changing the way that DNA operates. And the other half is. And the other half is shapes. So, once you change the chemistry, making shapes very interesting. So, this is a topic about shapes. And so, I will go through a list of sort of the design parameters for 3D tiles. And we'll specifically focus on the Tensegerity triangle. And I'll show you kind of exactly what it is and how it works and sort of the structures that you can get out of it. And so, there's seven parameters that we'll modify. One is the primary structure, sort of the sugar stereochemistry. Sort of the sugar stereochemistry of the DNA. We'll talk about sticky ends, which are the things that hold tiles together when they form lattices. I will spend a good amount of time talking about DNA junctions and sort of the way that strands cross over in knotted or knotted tiles. We talk about the spacing between those junctions and then the spacing outside the junctions, and I'll show you what all of these things are. And then to talk about symmetry and asymmetry. And then to talk about symmetry and asymmetry, sort of what do we mean when we talk about something which is symmetric, and what does it mean to be an asymmetric daemon tile? And then finally, taking all those things, bundling it into one thing, and trying to get a DNA jigsaw puzzle. And maybe we'll get some insight, but maybe not. So we'll kind of talk about what we can learn from it. So, DNA molecule, you know, something we look at, and obviously all know what it is. I like to show this sort of space-filling model. Show this sort of space-filling model to convince you that, you know, unlike the ladder and stick model, it is actually a very densely packed molecule. When you make changes to it, you know, you kind of want to pay attention to its parts. So, what are the parts of DNA we have a charge back on? We have programmable base pairing, we have a direction of information propagation, and this lets DNA give you sort of cell assembly and one that you do sending various shapes. And so, the question that drives us in the lab and sort of why we're here today. In the lab, and sort of why we're here today talking about DNA: how do we program DNA to self-assemble into complex architectures, to build interesting lattices and topologies, and perform technological functions. So the way that we do that is we look at its structure. So here is a structural feature. It has 10 and a half base pairs per helical term. This is sort of the literature standard value. This is not always true. But that's sort of the twist of the DNA and then its function. And then its function. We can harness sticky ends, right? Which allow DNA to stick together in 1D chains and DNA organ and all of these sorts of things. What's the function? And so that's function, right? And so harnessing the structure and function relationship, we can then drive self-assembly. If you're a trivial shape, we can get more complicated than this. So I want to just define terms. So I talk a lot about junctions today, and so I want to show a picture of. Today. And so I want to show a picture of the DNA junction. This is what we call the J1 junction because it was the first junction that was invented by Ned back in 1982. I thought it was, yes, 1983. And so the features of this junction are that it is, you know, you have two double helices, so these blue strands, controls, the helical axis of strands. And you have one strand passing from one helix across into the other, and the other passes behind. Together and the other passes behind it. And so you have this forearm junction which binds two double helices together. And we can do a crossing sign on this. And you can argue that this is a positive crossing. It's a right-handed junction that gives us a composable design tool. And I'll talk a lot about what gives you different shapes of junctions throughout the talk. And it's worth pointing out that this was first built in 1982 by Ned Seaman at Albany at the time, and this sequence changed. Albany at the time. And the sequence GGAC has a particular stacking pattern. And pretty much today, this is still the primary sequence that's used in the DNA crossovers when you're designing it. So, you know, Ned was brilliant or lucky. One of the two picked the one that actually has the best fooling sort of structure, and this is what we use today. So you can get different shapes of these junctions, but the sequence is always GGKC across the crossover, and it is symmetric. Cross over here and it is symmetrical. So here's a slightly more complex object, right? And so this is defined as a triangular tile. It again has the same parts, so you have three junctions. Here it's zoomed out, so it's harder to see where the crossovers are actually happening, but I will assure you that in fact there are three forearm junctions bound into a single tile, and this is what. Into a single tile, and this is what we get this tessellating unit we would call a tensegerity triangle. It has sticky ends, which allow it to connect to neighboring tiles, and I'll show you a less diagrammatic or less high-level scheme. I'll actually show all the parts as we go forward. And then there's some amount of space between these junctions, right? And because DNA is a rotating molecule, as you increase or decrease the amount of space between junctions, the junctions rotate relative to one another, and you get different topologies. You hit different topologies and you get different shapes. So this tile obviously gives us 3D self-assembly. What's interesting is that something like this is only 126 nucleotides, that's like 40,000 atoms only in the structure. And yet, because of all these design parameters, you're able to get macroscopic objects that you can actually pick up and see under the microscope because of the way that it's all set up, right? So in this, the topology of this. In this, the topology of this very small tile allows you to do self-assembly at a large scale. So, again, here's our space-forward model, right? You can agree that it's very densely packed and sort of hard to engineer. And so, the question, again, how do we drive the self-assembly complex architectures? And so, one, we're going to identify the design features of these tiles. Because they self-assemble into crystals, the experimental part is, you know, we take a topology, we self-assemble it. If we get a crystal, we can solve the structure of that tile. Crystal, we can solve the structure of that tile by integrated fraction. And then, so we see what we've learned, we iterate, and then we extract some design models for going forward. So, and throughout the talk, you'll see the interplay between topology, chirality, and symmetry, and geometry coming back again and again as we change the small parts of the tile. So, jumping right in, this is a tense-egrady triangle. There's many ways to draw it. I like this one. I like this one because it kind of shows the curved nature and argues a graph is reminding me. Regardless, it's a diagram. And so you can argue that the object on the left is our diagrammatic representation of what it looks like on paper. The object on the right is the crystal structure of that same object. And so, you know, it looks like a triangle on paper. It's not actually a triangle, but it does have the topology of a triangle. And so the main design features, this center strand. Center strand has this curved arc as it travels around the DNA tile, and so you can track that arc. It forms a pseudo-closed shape. There are actually NICs, but we can ignore them and still. So it's worth noting that for most of the talk, this will have the threefold symmetry axis down the middle. So if I took this tile and I rotated it 120 degrees, I would see the exact same tile. And you can sort of use crystal structure. And so that gets us a crystallographic symmetry. It says a crystallographic symmetry that's not just translational, there's a rotation component. It has sticky ends, right? So this GA, it's an overhang, will bind to TC, and it will tessellate and rotate throughout to create large crystals. And each of these junctions in this particular version of a tile, you will agree, has a right-handed crossing. And it's harder to see if it's projectioning, but that's still the topology, not topology, chirality of that particular junction. Of that particular junction. So these things self-assemble into large lattices. They have rhombohedral symmetry, which means that you can sort of extract crystallographic parameters, but essentially you're always going to get this rhombohedral shaped box looked inside of your triangles. And when you don't, you've engineered something new. It's an axiom. It's usually an axilum. And we'll say, ah, which in your symmetry, what gave us this new symmetry, right? If I rotate this box 90 degrees on its side, you can agree that it is still rhombohedral in nature. Degree that it is still rhombohedral in nature. And this grows and grows and grows and grows until you see crystals that are actually shaped with this exact morphology because that's the shape of the crystal. So we have over the years, you know, the original motif was rhondohedral in nature. We've recently found that you can get hexagons, you can get cubic symmetry, trigonal symmetry, augmented skew symmetries. And you can get these heterochiral ones, you turn the left-handed and right-handed together. To each of the left-handed, right-handed together. And again, sort of the question: how do we get there? And why do these things form the way that we do? And I will make some arguments for why we're able to get these parameters. Not all of my arguments will be convincing. I think that's why we're here today. Why do these things work mathematically, not just observe and say what kind of accident? So that's something that we'll probably need to talk about. So I hope to convince you. And I also hope I don't convince you so we can have some more time. Convincing stuff. So, just a brief word on experiment because we are a chemistry laboratory. So, we design a particular tile. Whatever that tile looks like, we can change its various parameters. Ruji will synthesize it on the synthesizer in the lab reporter for a company. We'll form crystals, make these nice roundohedral crystals. So, you see rhondohedron here, crystal structures that cleave also rhondohedral. We send these crystals off to one of the national laboratories where we'll do X-ray diffraction. Where we'll do X-ray diffraction. We'll get some diffraction spots, which you can then analyze in various ways. You can solve your crystal structure. Again, this looks somewhat like a triangle. And then you iterate. And you just iterate and iterate and iterate until we get different design parameters out. A lot of the time you get absolutely nothing. And another appreciable fraction of the time you get something you didn't expect. I think that's really interesting. Ocean time here. Make it sound like, oh, you just, just, just, just. It depends on the person's stereotype. We have now gotten very good at growing crystals. So it takes from when you, the design is the longest part of the message. So when you get a DNA strain, you order it in maybe three days. You can purify the DNA, set up the crystals, depending on how energetically favorable the crystals can take. One day, it can take two weeks. So you wait for the crystal to grow. And then you have to wait for your schedule, the X-ray line. Schedule on the x-ray line, we usually get about once a month, so that's pretty fast. And if you know what the structure is, it's easy to solve. And if it's something new, then you spend some time and write a paper about it. So at best, if it's something new that we've never seen before, it could take us a couple months to figure it out. If it's something that we expected, the structure that we got, it could take us as short as two weeks. It's a great screening tool, certainly. So, primary. So, primary structure. First thing we'll talk about, and this, you know, you see it all the way through, but I don't know if this should go at the beginning or the end, so I put it at the beginning, but it affects everything else in the talk. But dDNA is mostly what we will talk about today, and that is sort of the standard sugar of life. This has particular handiness. You can see the crystal structure of the sugar points some particular way, and you get a tense-greged triangle out, right? We have We have synthesized L-DNA, which is the mirror image of the sugar. The sugar has a particular chirality, right? Because it's got chiral synonyms on the carbon. So you can get sort of the mirror image of the DNA. You get a mirror image of the sugar. And the tense-eggerity triangle that you get out is actually backwards, or the exact and anti-meric mirror. So the primary structure is flipped. So obviously, you know, it's a good check of comprehension that we actually got what we expected. Of comprehension, that we actually got what we expected, but the secondary structure is also flipped. So d DNA has a right-handed DNA helix, and L DNA has a left-handed thill helix. And at the tertiary level, you can look at the crossing signs of these junctions, and you can say that one is a positive crossing and one is a negative crossing. So topologically, they are the same. I mean, the linking number has a different sign on it, but otherwise it's topologically the same. It's just the mirror image. And so you can take any of the structures that we will talk about throughout the talk, and you can flip them. And they oftentimes work, sometimes they don't. And that leads to sort of an interesting question of why is L DNA harder to crystallize and why doesn't it work very well? So either there's something inherent about L DNA, and that's why life didn't use it, or it's very hard to get sort of L DNA sugars that are 100% enantiopure because life. Because life gives you the assurance. So we're not exactly sure about that, but this is. So that's the primary structure. The next design parameter, and this is sort of almost in order of discovery, is that if you take your sticky ends, there's two kinds of sticky ends that we'll talk about today: Watson-Crick, where your base pairs make sense, and non-Watson-Crick, where your base pairs are accidental. It's not what you tried to make, but you ended up with the base pairs. Ended up with a base pair that is not correct. So here we have GA will bind to TC perfectly, since G will bind to C, A will bind to T, and you get a very nice sticky end. If you experimentally were kind of asleep and you put the wrong strand in and now you have a switch sticky end, you no longer have a Watts and Crit sticky end, but lo and behold, you have a new crystal. So we'll talk about um how that works. And all of this work was done by Brandon Liu when he was an undergraduate in our lab, which is very um amazing and impressive. Amazing and impressive. A lot of the work that we'll talk about today. So, Watson Crick sticky ends, right? GC pairs, AT pairs, stacking is preserved. So the bases, when they cross that sticky end from one tile to another, the bases are still in the plane. The planes of the bases are not perturbed. And so the helices are sort of linear in nature. And you get these beautiful, nice, rubbed lattices. The crystals are actually shaped like the lattice, which is very cool. Shaped like the lattice, which is very cool. If you flip the sticky end, you have this A binding to C. That's not a base pair, there's only one hydrogen bond, G binds to T, that's a wobble base pair. It's barely a sort of workable base pair. And you get something that does not look romantic, right? And your crystals look very different. And you end up with something that is hexagonal symmetry space group P63. And it turns out that people have been looking at these sort of needle-shaped P63. Needle-shaped P63 crystals for about 15 years before Brandon came along and said, That's not a mistake. That's a new design. We should solve the structure of this object. And so we did, and we found something very interesting. So this is a case where a geometric parameter, which is the stacking of the DNA bases, affects the global symmetry of the system. So in the crystal structure of this object, the sort of perturbation. The sort of perturbation happens at the sticky end. You have these two base pairs that are not really base pairs. And so the DNA helix kind of buckles a little bit because the planes are not preserved. And so you get a bending effect of the sticky end. And for whatever reason, the junction also absorbs some of this change in stacking. So if you track the sort of change from sort of linear, so this red line is the overall sort of bending in the y direction. In the y-direction of a rhombohedral crystal, and as you go from one tile to the next tile, it is roughly linear. This repeats this pattern, so it stays in a straight line. You get a rhombohedral crystal. In this sort of non-Watson-Crick sticky end, you hit the junction and you get a 30-degree turn. And then you get to the sticky end where the bases are not paired, and you get another 30-degree turn. This continues to happen again and again, giving me the structure that is not actually linear. The double helices are actually bending all through the crystal. Are actually bending all through the crystal to give this very strange, interesting quaternary structure that is not locally designed, right? And so we argue that this is a case where the quaternary structure itself is chiral. So interestingly, the DNA is a right-handed helix, but you get these left-handed metahelices coming through the crystal structure. What is quaternary chirality? I don't know. It's a math definition that I think we need to come up with, right? That's not something people really talk about very much. So, and again, going back to primary structure, if I flip the sugar from D DNA to L DNA, I flip the chirality of that helix going through the structure, right? So the interplay between chirality, geometry, and symmetry is something that we'll see throughout the talk. So, the next thing, the next design parameter is the junctions. So, I will show you three junctions, and I will not show you how they work because Show you how they work because they actually depend on the topology of the tile, which is something we'll talk about a little later. But I showed you the J1 junction previously. There's 36 sequence combinations that you could use. Ned Seaman picked the one that he thought he wanted to use, and it was the one that actually has the best free energy. So you get a 136 chance of founding DNA nanotechnology properly, and again, that's pretty good odds. Pretty good luck if you picked the right one. So this is a right-handed junction. A right-handed junction. We took a look at it earlier. It is anti-parallel because at the crossover, the sort of polarity of the strands faces in the opposite direction. There is an L1 junction, which I will describe later. It has the same sequence, but the topology of the tile causes it to actually bend back on itself at the junction. It is locally parallel, and it is left-handed. It uses the same sequence, but I'll show you kind of how this works. And lastly, we have what we've been calling. Works. And lastly, we have what we've been calling the semi-junction, which is where you take one of the strands that's undergoing the crossover and you cut it. So this is somewhat similar, I think, to taking a Redemeister 2 move. I have to correct me if I'm wrong, where you take the endpoints of a Notoid and you slide it across a crossing. You sort of break the tension on the center of the triangle because you've now broken what was a matoid. And it turns out, you And it turns out, you have a tense-grity triangle, you have two tensegrity triangles, which are right-handed, and you have some sticky end in the middle between them, so all the tension is in the triangles themselves. If I take that connection point, there's sort of a tension release, and I slide it and I slide it and I slide it until it hits the junction of one of the triangles, I get a semi-junction. It's like taking the sticky end across the junction. If I slide it past the junction, I release the tension in the triangle, and all the tension is between the triangles, and I actually get the opposite junction. The opposite junction. So, why and how that works, I can't tell you, but maybe that's something we can talk about later over coffee. But again, I didn't tell you how it works. I just showed you what it was. So, chirality in this case is driven by topology. So, let's talk about topology. So, the main topological feature that we're interested in with tense-eggity triangles is the center strength, because this object folds back on itself. So, if you assume that Also, if you assume that this is a closed loop, which you can do synthetically, but we don't because it's a really painful, painful process, but it's pseudo-closed, this object, you can sort of look at the linking number. You can imagine that this is somewhat like DNA chain mail. You can look at it. And this is all dictated by the number of base pairs between the junctions. This is inside of the triangle, right? So if I take two tense-eggity triangles, right, again, drawn however you want to with them. However, you want to. The one on the left, you will agree if you count has 21 base pairs per side, right? And it's rotationally symmetric. So each one of these branches has 21 base pairs. That's the length of the tile. Two turns of DNA, perfectly flat as you sort of tessellate between triangles. Between the junctions, you have seven base pairs. So that is a third of the tile, takes a third of the base pairs, so this thing is not string. See, this thing is not strained. On the outside, you have seven base pairs, seven base pairs, quit, seven base pairs, two-thirds turn each time. So, this is a very happy structure, right? So, you have a standard DNA twist. You get rhombohedral crystals, you get this rhondohedral symmetry. If I have a tile which has 21 base pairs total, but I put eight base pairs between the junctions, now it's strained, right? And I don't let that number change. It's not a mobile junction, you can't, so this is a very artificially under-twisted helix, right? Helix, right? I'm taking eight base pairs, putting it where there should be seven, so the DNA kind of has a geometric strain on it. I have six base pairs on one side, so I'm right to sum that up. So it is an undertwisted DNA helix. The junction absorbs that twist, and we saw what happens when junctions begin to bend. You get P63 crystals which form hexagons, right? So I haven't changed the overall number of base pairs in the system, but what I have done is I've stressed a particular part of this triangle. Particular part of this triangle, and that gets me a new crystallographic symmetry. And this is something that propagates sort of over long range, even though it's the movement of just one single base pair. So again, this is an example of a change in symmetry as a result of a geometric feature. We took another tile, we scanned all the sort of numbers that you could. We found that 3 is a very odd number. Is a very odd number. So again, I have 21 base pairs between the junctions. I have three, or 21 base pairs in the total tile. I have three base pairs between the junctions. This is a one-third twist instead of a two-third twist. So nine on either side sums up to 21. I also get rhombohedral crystals, right? And I also have some crystal structure that I look at. But this thing is the opposite chirality at the tertiary structure. So the junction has flipped from J1. Has flipped from J1 to L1. I've changed the crossing sign of the DNA, and I have a left-handed triangle. So, and I'll go into this, I won't wave my hands at this, but this is an example where a tertiary chirality flips without changing the stereochemistry at the primary level. So, I didn't change the sugars, I didn't change the twist direction of the DNA, but I have changed the stacking order of the triangle. So, we found this to be very interesting, and so we looked sort of very deeply at this problem, and Natasha. Have this problem. And Natasha and her postdoc band have put a lot of effort into understanding why these things work. So I'll mostly show what we have thought about. So, you know, the structure of these two things is very different. They're both triangles, but only three base pairs at the center. You'd see almost no space, atomically speaking. It would be hard-pressed to put a water molecule in there. Whereas the tensivity triangle is very happy and there's plenty of space for salt and sugar. There's plenty of space for salt and sugar, not sugar, but salt and water, and that thing's very balanced. It's a very unstable structure. So, a note on DNA: we can look at the major groups and we can look at the minor groups. The major group is the longest distance from one base to the other, the minor group is the short distance. And so, if we look at, you know, I'm twisting the video like I have this narrow for minor and large, wide for major groove. So, if we look at the tensegrity triangle, it has this very nice groove pattern. If you go major groove, minor groove, it passes to major groove minor. Groove passes to major groove, minor, major, minor. The front and the back are just flipped relative to one another. When I look at this three-base pair triangle, that is no longer the case. So the center of this triangle is all one major groove. The outside are all minor grooves. And when I look at the triangle, I flip it over. I have the center is all one minor groove. So the minor grooves of all three Ulysses are pointing together, and I have major grooves on the outside. So this is a very odd structure. We did not expect to see this in our crystals. You will agree if we sort of project them down the helical axis that one is sort of not quite a mirror image of the other, but they are sort of the handedness is flipped. And so you can look at the way that the DNA, because it's still a right-handed helix, in order to make seven base pairs, you have about a 215-degree turn. To make three base pairs, you end up with about a 60-degree turn, right? About a 60-degree turn, right? So as I look at the topology of my center strand, making this 215 degrees, another 215 by the turn, you can track that strand as it winds around the helices, passes through a junction, and so you get three almost full loops. You have a linking number that is positive. This thing is sort of held together. It's very tight. We call it tensegrity. It's held together. If I look at this strand, it doesn't really cross anything else. There's no crossing. And if I look at it, And if I look at it, because of the way that the strands move, it never really links to anything. So this is a linking number of zero, that center strand. And this was very surprising to us, that something with the same number of junctions, the same number of total base pairs, would have a difference in the linking number this dress. So we had to kind of look into this and see what and why and how it works. So we look at the junctions. Again, the seven-base pair triangle gets you a right-handed junction, which is anti-parallel. The left-handed triangle gets you a parallel. The left-handed triangle gets a pre-base pair triangle, gets you a left-handed junction, which is parallel in nature, at least locally, you still get a triangle. So this is kind of an interesting result that we didn't expect when we started this experiment, just looking at the interjunction distances. So, just by staring at these crystal structures and trying to figure out how and why they formed, a folding mechanism suggested itself. Doesn't mean Itself. It doesn't mean that it's correct, but we know that this is sort of the most stable structure for a DNA junction. But given particular constraints, if it's not tied to something else, put it in water, it's going to bend and fold and wiggle a little bit. And so if you take this bottom arm and you pull it up, you end up with something that looks like an L1 junction, right? If I just grab this helix and I just twist about the junction point, I can make a parallel junction. And it doesn't like it because there's a sharp curve here. Here. But if you tie it in, because of the topology of the tile, then it's locked in place and you just end up with something that looks like. So again, this is something where you can fold it, get something that is strained. So we think that maybe because you have these three junctions which are imposing the topology on the tile, you're able to get a very unfavorable junction. So We came up with a rule of thirds. So we said that a tile, which is some integer number of velocity turns plus two-thirds, will give you a right-handed junction. So seven base pairs is should say two-thirds turns, right? So fix that. So two-thirds turns, one and two-thirds turns, two and two-thirds turns will always leave you writing at the junction. Something that has an integer. Something that has an integer, 0 greater, plus 1 third helical turn, so three base pairs, 13 base pairs, 24 base pairs, you get a left-handed troll. Anything that is some half member of turns, it's flat, it's topologically flat. And so you can't actually close the structure and you get something different. So half turns don't give you triangles. And full turns, so if I had 10 base pairs between junctions, 10 base pairs between junctions, I would not get a closed one-tooth at all. This thing is flat, it can't crystallize, you get nothing. Right, so this is what we trivially called the rule of thirds. This one-third is a slushing number, it's not actually exactly one-third, it's plus or minus like two or three basic thirds. But this roughly is what we're able to get out of that study. So I will show you the library that we created. We looked at all interjunction numbers between At all interjunction numbers between 3 and 28. So 3 and 7, you've already seen if I have 14, that's a 1 and 1 third term, left-handed. 1 and 2 thirds turns, I get a right-handed structure. 2 and 1 third, right, it's 24 base pairs, left-handed, and again, right-handed. So we were sort of happy to see that this rule of thirds worked, sort of no matter what the tile size is. As you start to get really big things, you end up getting. To get really big things, you end up getting bending in the helices, and it's really hard to see the structures. So, this 24 and 28 were kind of the largest structures you can see on X-ray. But the rule seems to hold for this particular problem. So the next thing that I'll talk about is the extra junction base pairs. The things outside the junctions. We'll talk about what's between. Here, these are not held together by a center strand. There's no sort of tension in the system. And so, this doesn't give you topology. This affects the crystal size. View topology, this affects the crystal symmetry. So here again, 21 base pairs, 7, 7, and 7, you get rhombohedral symmetry. If I have 7 base pairs, 7 base pairs, and I delete 1 on one side, this is no longer two full helical turns. So I'm just short of two helical turns. So again, when I have a twist perturbation that causes sort of strain on the DNA, the helices start to bend, your stochiens absorb it, junction absorbs it, lo and behold, you end up with... Lo and behold, you end up with a hexagonal structure. So, this is again a case where you impose a geometric twist change, the DNA finds a way to bend, absorb it, and conjunction however you want, and you get curvature in your unit. You can go the other way. So, instead of 21 base pairs, I can put 8, 7, and 9, giving me a total of 24. So, I've added a box. Of 24. So I've added about a quarter turn of DNA. And so instead of getting rho-behedral or hexagonal, I get these really weird crystals that we looked at. We weren't really sure what was going on here. The crystal structure is something that was really hard, but parsed. We weren't sure what we were looking at. So this is four tensegrity triangles. So I argued earlier that if I take tensegrity triangles and I tile them like this, they are flat relative to one another. You can look at a cube, one of the planes. You have a cube, one of the planes. This is not like that. So I have a tense equity triangle, I rotate a quarter turn. I take the next one, I rotate another quarter turn, and the next one after that is rotated this way. And so you can have this sort of recursive quarter turn object. You know, one is facing flat, this one's facing up, this is facing out of the board, this is facing down. There's no curvature, right? So these helices are relatively straight. Are relative to the straight, but as you start to put these things together into interesting unit cells, this extra quarter turn allows you to turn corners. You get very odd, confusing symmetries that you've kind of had to stare at for a long time. We don't have a great explanation other than the fact that you have a structure changed the rotation of the DNA. So instead of tessellating your You're meeting this diamond structure. Originally, we called this a mouth, but it's hard to publish a paper in which you say you have a crystal composed of little mouths. So we called it a diamond. It looked better on paper. Reviewers said that was fine. Again, predicting these things is really hard to do. So I can tell you what we got. I can't tell you why we got it. So a mathematical model that could tell you, based on triangle tile that you have, what is the symmetry? I think it would be a very useful. What is the symmetry? It would be a very useful thing. Right now we're just sort of iterate, iterate, iterate. And this example is something took a lot longer to figure out. So I will skip a few slides on that to keep us in time. So the next thing is to talk about asymmetry. So there's this idea in the field running for a long time that if you have a, this is your rhombohedral crystal, again, rhomohedral symmetry, you rotate this picture. Symmetry, you rotate this periodic unit, there's a three-fold axis. Each of these Ulysses is this thing. If you have a tile where the sequences are all unique, so each direction, the shape is the same, and it's symmetric in its shape, but the sequences themselves are asymmetric, you need 126 nucleotides to create the tile instead of 42. This is somehow asymmetric. And that's somewhat true, and it's somewhat not true. And this is something that we've been trying to challenge in the last couple years. What does it mean for Couple years is what does it mean for something to be symmetric? What does it mean for something to be dismantled? So, I'll show you the symmetric triangle again. I've looked at here is this bundle of repeating nucleotides. So, this is the crystallographic unit. 42 nucleotides, they're all unique. As you fill everything else in, these are identical to this, right? So, this is the crystallographic unit. In order to get this to form, I have three pink strands, three green strands, and one yellow strand. So, I have symmetric. Yellow strand. So I have symmetric sequences, but my strand ratio is asymmetric. If I have something where all the sequences are unique, I have seven different strands. This one, you will agree, has a different sequence from this one, which has a different sequence from this one. The center strand is not a three-fold regroup of the same sequence. So I have asymmetric sequences. The entire unit tessellates, but the strand ratio is symmetric. So there is some interplay between the information density that you're putting in the tile and the symmetry that you get out. The tile and the symmetry that you can get out. And I think there's something more fundamental here. I can't tell you what it is, but there's sort of how much information you can pack into a single object. And I'll show you we can try to pack as much as we want. So I'll show that done. So the crystals morphologically are the same. They have different space groups. Because this has a rotational component in the middle. So this aromahedral, this is considered translational or triclinic, but the structures are so more. So more. So, undergraduate in a group, Carol, for his thesis, decided how can we change the space outside the triangles, right? Why does it have to be a triangle? Can I not add some asymmetric component to it to make a lattice that's not fully gravedal? What if it's some sort of rectangular prism? What if it's so? Um, we did covalent linkages, where this is just an extension of one of the arms. You get a structure that looks something like this. That looks something like this. I don't know if it's pointing in the other direction. You can sort of rotate the structure and get the same thing out. And you get a lattice which is not isomorphic in all three directions. So I have a three-turn axis, sort of this rectangle. I have a two-turn axis. This looks a little more rhombohedral. And if you look at it, you can kind of convince yourself that this is sort of a more skewed rhombohedral prism. You can do this with linkers, right, that are sticky-ended. It doesn't have to be fused to the tile. It doesn't have to be fused to the tile. You can sort of program sort of different parts to stick between triangles. It doesn't always have to be a linker. You know, we've put octomers, we put different nucleic acid backbones. We can put fluorinated fauna as arabanoic nucleic acids. So modified backbones you can put in here and kind of look at their structure. So this sticky-ended version is great, but it's pretty much the same thing, right? So we made a library. Carol made 18 of these variations using These variations using one-turn and two-turn covalent or linked extensions. And this is just some of them that have different shapes to them. You will agree that all of these things still have a triangle topology at the center. This is held together by the tensegrity nature of this object, but whatever you put out here is kind of a small thing. And if you look at the lattices, you can rotate these and get the different output. These were kind of a really cool just way of Of a really cool just way of engineering different symmetry into our system. And I guess I should say not symmetry. These are all translational symmetry, but you get different long-range structures out of this. So the final thing that I want to talk about is connectivity. And so a question that we had about a year and a half ago was can we take something which is supposed to be asymmetric, that has translational symmetry, and can we give it Symmetry, and can we give it symmetry? We can have all the sequences that are unique. Here's an asymmetric tile where in every direction all of the sequences are different. Can we take this tile and give it non-trivial symmetry? And it turns out, yes, and it is punishingly difficult, but Carol was up to the task and he figured out how to do it. So typically, the sticky ends in an asymmetric tile will sort of go along the crystallographic axis left. Go along the crystallographic axis left to right, you know, this direction, this direction, this direction. So it's still just translating to get the next of the crystal. As you sort of get your next tile, you just kind of get the next one, right? A connect to A, so the green side connects all the way down, red sides connect all the way down, translational symmetry. And you will agree that in this tile, right, the top face is always green, right, the helices on the left side are always red. The helices on the left side are always red, and the helices on the right side are always blue. So this is what we would call an asymmetric DNA tile. If you wanted to get this thing to roll inside the crystal, you would have to rewire the sticky ends. So there's nothing preventing you from connecting this side to this side. You have a 5'N connecting to the 3'N over here. So this thing is possible to do. You could imagine something like this. If you try to Something like this. If you try to do this, it will not work. And the reason that we have found is if you have a jigsaw puzzle where you have pieces with some picture on it, you're trying to get to sort of rotate. If all your pieces are shaped the same, the jigsaw puzzle doesn't care what you want. I've shown you that, you know, sticky ends, you can tell them, go this way, go this way. Not a lot of correct sticky ends exist. If you mess this up, you just get a hexagon and it multiple, right? So it doesn't really care that you want A to connect to A, unless you give it a different. Today, unless you give it a different shape. So, what we had to do is we had to create a triangle which had different interjunction spacings on each of the edges. So, six base pairs, seven base pairs, eight base pairs. It's shaped as a scalar triangle to kind of really stress on the inside. We did the same thing on the outside. We changed all these distances five, six, six, seven, seven. So on each edge, I have a 20 base pair edge, a 21 base pair edge, 22 base pair edge. Two days of edge is this. So all of the edges are different shapes, so they have to roll to be able to crystallize at all. We had to change the length of the sticky end. So this is, you know, a GATC sticky end. This has three base pairs, so G, D, G, and C C C. This has a single base pair sticky end. All of these things needed to be in place. So, again, we had to pack a whole lot of geometric information into this tile to make it work like a jigsaw puzzle. And when we did, And when we did, crystal structure, yeah, I'm of a DNA tile, but the next tile is rotated. The tile after that is also rotated. And the symmetry is no longer trivial, it's not P1. I've taken all of the other things that we talked about today, the interjunction, extrajunction, different junction sequences, different sticky end length, reparity. I pack it all into one tile. I can take something that's supposed to be asymmetric or trivial, and I can get a new space component, right? So we wanted to prove that we weren't just making this up, so we added a heavy metal tag. This up, so we added a heavy metal tag, we put it in the triangle, and we can see these mercury ions are rolling through the crystal lattice. So, we were able to show this is actually the symmetry is not translational, it's a rotational component. We have a P3 space group. We found this to be very interesting, right? So, comparing those two lattices, this is the one that we saw before, well, the green is on the top of the red. Here, you can see red feeds into blue and feeds into green. Down here, red feeds into blue. To green. Down here, red feeds into blue feeds into green. Right, so we call this the tumbler, the crystal tumbler. The tile is rolling through the crystal, giving you globally, sort of if you squint, these look the same, but locally you've imparted more information, packed more into this. This is not the only way that you could do this. You can imagine connecting the long axis here. Before we connected these two, you connect the long axis. Again, playing all these tricks, packing as many different. All these tricks, packing as many different geometric asymmetries as you can one tile. First tile comes through, looks exactly what you would think. Tile is its own thing. So we've created a Sierpinski-looking triangle of triangles. So you notice all of the red edges are facing in, all of the green edges are facing out, and all of the blue are sort of tangent to the triangle. And if we look at this object, we say, what? What is this? Look at the crystal structure. It's really densely packed. It's hard to see. So you can kind of hide this center extra bits, kind of squint, delete. Obviously, this is not something you can really do, but if you try to find what are we actually looking at, you perform some surgery, this looks like a tensor triangle composed of other tensor-great triangles. But if we look at one of the triangles that we looked at earlier, the topology of this strand, if we assume that Of this strand, if we assume that this is continuous, actually has the same topology as a tensority triangle. I apologize for interrupting. Is Robert here? Robert Aaron? Sharon? Yeah, are you okay? Yeah? Do you need first aid or anything? No. Okay. Could you, is he able to step out for five minutes, Pliny? Yeah, thanks, Buddy. So obviously, this is not actually, you know, the crystal structure that we solved. It's actually much more complicated than that, but if you kind of cut parts out, you will agree that it kind of looks like this symmetric tensegrity triangle that we started with. So we were really tickled to see that you did take something as asymmetric as you can possibly design, and you end up. You can possibly design, and you end up with something that has the same exact space group, that tiles in the exact same way, just by sort of packing different geometric parameters into it. So, and this thing, I do not know what to make of it. I think it would be really interesting to model this, the linking number of the parts, and try to figure out how they're weaving and all those sorts of things. But that's the last crystal structure I'll show you. So, in sum, I I hope I've made some pass at convincing you that topology informs the chirality at the tertiary levels. As you change the triangle topology, you get different handedness of triangles. That when you change the geometry, so if you cause twist perturbations, if you strain the DNA in particular ways, you change the quaternary symmetry of the system, which I think is interesting for biological systems, which rely on these large global protein assemblies. You know, if you look at these strains, Assemblies. You know, if you look at these strain geometric components, you're going to get different proteins out. This is not a protein, but this is a large mapping one assembly. You could model it in the same way. The symmetry of the system informs topology, right? So I took something which just, you know, we packed all those modes of asymmetry in there, and I ended up with something that had the same, you know, if you squint, the same topology of our original system. So by adding symmetry or asymmetry, I can create new topological objects. Topological objects. And finally, that you can make composable lattices using parts that you can swap out and design and iterate. And that ultimately, in doing so, you can build a modular, molecular design language of DNA for shapes. That's kind of just shapes. Through design, build, test. See what we get. Look at the parameters. So, all of the work here was done by these students. All of the work here was done by these students, especially Carol, Brandon, and Jordan, who work very extensively on shapes in the lab. Our lab was founded by Ned Seaman and is now Marugi, UL, and Jim Canary. And Natasha is a very, very close collaborator of the lab, hoping to stay running. Collaborators and funding. And so thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to take questions.
