I just couldn't resist after last night's talk having a little chat with you. Sorry to interrupt from the online crowd, but the image is rotated 90 degrees for us. Is that true for you too? That's true for us. You're dealing with a tech Neanderthal here. All right. Actually, talking about Neanderthals. Actually, talking about Neanderthals, the story starts here about 3,000 to 4,000 years ago when a guy called O. Morris decided he was tired of the day job and in which he sort of drew, you know, he saw these patterns in his workplace. And he decided he'd actually record what he's Record what he said and sell them off as, but you couldn't make pictures in those days. So, all he had was a chisel and a hammer. So, he was able to chisel these petroglyphs on these big rocks. And it was a very lucrative business because a lot of people died early in those days, so they needed places to be buried. And where they were buried, especially if you were a king. Especially if you were a king or high up in the hierarchy, you were buried in a dolmen and in essentially a burial mound. And often these burial mounds were surrounded by these wonderful big stones. I don't know whether any of you have ever been to Newgrange in Ireland or many of these other megalithic sites, but it's quite remarkable. Look at the etchings. Etchings. The picture above is a first cousin of one of Stephen's favorites. This came to me from Eberhardt. And it's essentially a moderate Prandtl number convection pattern. And you can see there's lots of targets and spirals. And there's lots of straight patterns too, and chevrons where it zigzags in and out. And look, the same ideas. And look, the same ideas here. And the remarkable thing here is the distance, the local wave length here in these stone petroglyphs tends to be constant, which is something that we notice in these other patterns that we've been studying. So anyway, Omaris, on one of his outreach programs, they used to go to France. Programs. They used to go to France to get wine and bring back women. And he met Etienne Le Tombeau. And didn't he find that Etienne had a similar business? He was etching these big stones with exactly the same patterns on them. Incredible. And not only that, they later learned that these patterns Learned that these patterns were actually quite universal. They were found as far east as Turkey and as far west as south in South Africa and in places in South America. So how come this megalithic art, these burial stones, contain patterns which are quite universal. Which are quite universal. They consist of these spirals with these constant distances between the crest and chevrons and a lot of the defects that you see in natural patterns. I mean, these guys didn't talk to each other over these distances. So what was it? What was it that triggered all this megalithic iron? All this megalithic art with so much universality about it. Now, if you want to hear a plausible answer, I don't guarantee it's the right answer, but I believe it's a plausible answer, and you're willing to buy me some beer afterwards, I will tell you the story. But now I'm going to tell you a different story, and we're going to talk about And we're going to talk about a simpler class of patterns. Here, the class of patterns that we were talking about here had the property that the so-called Prandtl number was sort of moderate, whereas the patterns I'm going to talk about, essentially the Prandtl number is very large. And what that means is there's no goldstone modes. When you have an instability, an instability. you have an instability an instability that triggers some periodic pattern that you you don't get uh mean drift modes that you would get if the pantomime is low enough you see the viscosity is not strong enough to stop them so so it makes for a slightly more difficult situation uh so i'm dealing with basically stripe patterns and you can see the one in the fish here is um Fish here is it has this feature of roughly constant wavelength, but its direction is chosen really by the shape of the fish. Likewise, on the sand ripples, the direction is often chosen by the direction of the wind, prevailing winds. But on the other hand, on the old fingerprint, which essentially comes Which essentially comes from the fact that in your 10th week in your life as a fetus, the pads that are going to become the ends of your fingers and pads in your hands, they swell up into things called bolar pads. And then these things relax and the epidermis, being the outside layer of the skin, actually contracts, is under compression and wrinkles. And these wrinkles, so essentially. And these wrinkles, so essentially, you have a system which has translational and rotational invariance originally, and you break the translational invariance by creating these stripe patterns. But the directions, so you break it and there is a preferred wavelength, but the direction is chosen by local biases. On the tips of your fingers, the directions are more or less chosen. The directions are more or less chosen by the fact that you have creases and the nail furrow. Sort of that structure is sort of where the local biases for the directions of these things there. But because these natural patterns with stripes can occur in any direction, see the these natural patterns. These natural patterns tend to consist of patches of almost constant direction. And if you think of the pattern here, the wrinkle here, you could describe the deformation as a periodic function of some phase, theta, like it's k dot x. Okay, so the gradient of theta is what we would call the wave vector. Is what we would call the wave vector. Okay, it tells you the direction normal to the constant phase lines. And the amplitude tells you it's 2 pi over the wavelength. So you can see sort of those, those, the k, the local wave vector, changes slowly over distances very long compared to the actual wavelength. Compared to the actual wavelength. And we're going to exploit that. We're going to be talking about patterns far from onset, but with this characteristic that the inverse aspect ratio is small, namely the ratio of the wavelength to the overall macroscopic scale. So, like I say, these things. I say these things, because you have patches with different directions, these patches have to come together, and they come together usually in either line or point defects. For instance, on your finger, you can look and find this is a tri-radius. We're going to be calling a concave dislination shortly. And here's one of the loops. This will be related to the convex disclination. Here's another tri-ray. Here's another tri-radius. But of course, you see mostly ridge ends here. These are dislocations. And in fact, the forensic fingerprint is the relative location of the ridge ends. And that's what gets you in trouble if you've done something wrong and left a fingerprint. Okay, so now we go to the next. No, that's the wrong way. No, that's the wrong way. Right, so here's some pictures of various natural patterns. The one in the top left is a copolymer solution, and it has undergone an instability. And you can see here the different patches of almost constant wave vector. But then there are sudden changes in direction along these. Changes in direction along these lines. These are called phase grain boundaries. It's places where the phase suddenly changes in direction. And then there's other places like here. This is like what we call a concave distillation. Here's a blow-up of it. This is a concave distillation in the numerical calculation. This is one in a real experiment, convection. This is a beautiful. This is a beautiful one that Eberhard Vodenschatz gave me. He found it in one of his convection patterns. This is sort of this wonderful convex disclination, this loop here. And this is a fantastic one. This is two counterpropagating beams. And because essentially each creates the non-linear refractive index for the other. Your refractive index for the other, they can sort of interfere and create a pattern. And in those patterns, you actually find these universal defects. So the building blocks, the natural defects in two-dimensional patterns are the line defects, phase grain boundaries, okay, where the phase changes suddenly, and the point defects are concave. Defects are concave and convex dislinations. Everything else is made from them. Saddles, vortices, dislocations are kind of composites of these structures. So what we're going to try and do is come up with a sort of mathematical description of these things and And try to not only capture the bits where the patches where the wave vector is changing very slowly, but also these at these defects, both the line and the point defects. So basically, I've written it on the blackboard. We have a microscopic field W. Think of it like as, say, the temperature, the mid layer of a. The temperature of the mid layer of a convecting layer, or the deformation on the fingertip. And at a certain critical stress that's on the system, like maybe the temperature difference in the convection problem or some compression in elastic problems, there's a transition from striped From striped, I mean, from say the zero flat uniform state to striped patterns. And these striped patterns can be described by a periodic function. W is some f of theta, and you can calculate it. You actually stick it into the equations of motion, and you get a ordinary differential equation for f. It'll be non-linear, but you can look for periodic solutions in the form of a n. Solutions in the form of a n cos n theta. And the reason we use the take the thing is even is in any of those pictures, it didn't matter whether you label the phase theta equals 0, 2 pi, 4 pi, or 0 minus 2 pi, minus 4 pi. That was sort of irrelevant. And so that's going to be quite an important feature as we. Quite an important feature, as we have seen. Now, the defects essentially measure what? Let's go back. Let's go back one slide and take a look now. Yeah, let's take a look here in the convex dislination first. Let's take, actually, we only have to take a direction. We don't really have to take the vector here. And I'm going to go. And I'm going to go take it in an anti-clockwise direction around the defect. And I'm going to ask, I'll take it on one of these contours. I'm going to say, by what angle does it twist? And that angle is, you can see the twist goes around here. And then when it goes back here, there's no twist from here to here. So the twist is pi. So if we want to divide that by 2 pi. That by two pi that's like a spin, it's half. Okay, on the other hand, this guy says this is the theta equals zero, say theta equal two pi, and theta equal, then this would be theta equal minus two pi, this would have to be two pi. You see, when you get back here to this one, there's a discontinuity. You cannot, so the gradient of the phase around these Of the phase around these defects is not a vector field, it's a director field. So we have to work with director fields, and that turns out to be very important. So, and if you go around, say, on a contour like this, you can see you're twisting the other way in a clockwise direction, and it'll be minus pi. And so, his signature would be minus half. Now, what do these? Now, what are these twists? We can think of these twists as the change. If we think of the k, the wave vector k, our director k, as f and g, the two components, k cos phi, k sine phi, then phi is its angle. And it's a very easy calculation to show that. Calculation to show that the Jacobian of the map from physical space to order parameter space, order parameters are the k's, f and g are their components in two dimensions. It'll be f, g, and h in three. And that Jacobian essentially is related to the Gaussian curvature of the surface, the theta surface, because the Gaussian curvature of the theta surface is that lad. Curvature of the theta surface is that lad divided by essentially what? Kb squared. I have to get the dimensions right, but essentially one plus f squared plus g squared, one plus theta x squared plus theta y squared, and to the square. But it turns out in these patterns that the wavelength is almost constant everywhere, essentially that factor in the Gaussian curve. Essentially, that factor in the Gaussian curvature is not really important. It just changes the factor here. So, this is essentially the twist. What does it measure? It measures the concentration of Gaussian curvature, which condenses at the point defect. So, this is very important. Gaussian curvature. In fact, what will happen. In fact, what will happen in these patterns is if you start off with an initial distribution, an initial condition where the Gaussian curvature is widely distributed, what will happen is it first condenses onto these phase grain boundaries. And then as these phase grain boundaries straighten, it'll condense onto where the phase grain boundaries meet. And those are the point defects, the concave and convex distillation. Concave and convex dislinations. So the index, the topological index, measures essentially the concentration of Gaussian curvature. Now, you also can measure almost everywhere, k, of course, is the gradient of the phase. But there are places, like at the center of dislocations, where actually that's no longer true. So there's a voice. So there's a vorticity, and the vorticity of the wave vector field is localized. And that, for instance, so the circulation, okay, so it's like the circulation in a fluid, except k plays the role of velocity. It'll give you the jump in the phase as you go around. And if you go around a dislocation, that'll be two pass. Okay. So these. So, these are two indices that play a big role. This is the more important of the two. Okay, so now, where do we go from here? Okay, okay, these are the composite defects. You can see the concave and convex dislination above. If you put two of these together, you can make yourself a saddle. Now, it's very interesting. These guys are unstable. These guys are unstable in general in patterns. They only are stable very near onset. Near onset, the amplitude comes into play. Far from onset, the amplitude's all bit slaved to the phase gradient. Okay, so the a n's in that expression for the f of theta, they are all algebraically related. All algebraically related to each other and to k squared, the wave number squared. The target is a double x. If you put the two back to back, it's a vortex. If you put the two two, if you put together a saddle and a vortex here, you get a dislocation. So that's and a very important character which we'll Character which we'll meet many times, and you saw them in those earlier patterns, is this handle, this Vx pair. In fact, if your angle of bend at a phase grain boundary is too much, and it's too much here by about two degrees, okay, then this will split. This will split into two separate concave dislinations. Okay. And what it'll happen is the phase grain boundary will go unstable and go unstable and make a VX pair. So you can create from a vector field situation around a phase grain boundary, if the jump in the phase is too sharp, it'll create this little, what we call the nipple instability. And that is very important that these get created. Okay, so now we're going to try and derive the we've seen the relation between the microscopic field and the macroscopic field. Now we're going to derive a relation between for the evolution of the macroscopic coordinates. And now we... And now we don't have time. It would take several hours to go through all the calculations, and I'm not going to do it. I'm just going to give you the idea. The idea is we'll start off the gradient flow. We're working with the basic gradient flow, and so that means. flow. And so that means the microscopic field, its time derivative, is given by the variational derivative of some energy with respect to the field itself. And multiplying the variation across, we get this. Okay. Now, E is some function of all we require of it is that it's translation and rotation. And rotation invariant. And so, what we're going to do, since these guys now, instead of being constants, they're going to be slowly varying, these guys here will actually act like this. The original gradient with respect to the original coordinate will be the d by d theta, d theta by dx, and d theta by dy, and that'll be. B d y and that'll be k dot d theta. But then there's the slow change of the amplitudes because the wave vector is going to change slowly over the macroscopic distances. So this is this. So what you're going to do is you're going to expand that out by Taylor series. Okay. And it's going to give you a first term. Give you a first term, second term, and a third term. Okay, and then we're going to just average it, average the whole equation. So we get this on the left-hand side. We average each of these. And then that's our evolution equation. It's that simple. All right. Now, here's the remarkable fact. Fact. These energies, it turns out there's no epsilon term because essentially, because of periodicity and it just integrates out. But these guys turn out eventually to be universal. This guy is just like the strain energy of a blister, an elastic blister that you've blistered off a surface. Okay, so it's just the strain energy. It's in fact k squared. It's in fact k squared minus some preferred kb squared. That means it's like the slope of the blister, the slope of the hive, trying to reach a preferred slope and to match how much compression has been made so as to keep as isometric as possible, the deformation. So that's this guy. That's this guy. And this guy, you can see initially, it would have lots of terms in it. It would depend upon what the character of this guy is, the original microscopic feeling. Now, here's the magic thing. The magic thing is this, that when we look at this guy, he turns out to be just essentially, I'll show his structure in a minute, but he's basically k squared minus a preferred. k squared minus a preferred k squared. Okay? It's not in the original equation, but there is a preferred wave number. It's where this guy is actually maximum. So our, yes, where it's actually minimum, because these are negative or something. And so whereas amplitude is maximum. And that gives you this Kb squared, this preferred wavelength. wavelength. So this guy is roughly k squared minus kb squared all squared. It's like the strain energy. This guy has lots of terms in it. It would have terms like, because you're going to operate like you'd have this guy squared acting upon those amplitudes, but this guy acting upon a function of k squared, essentially the derivative of the amplitude with respect to k squared. And then this squared and then this operator on k squared and here's the magic thing because this guy wants to get as small as possible almost everywhere in the pattern the k squared is driven to this kb squared almost everywhere and you can see it okay because of that because of that this term k dot del k squared is much smaller Is much smaller than the mean curvature squared. Okay, so the quadratic terms that come in are products of this guy and this guy acting upon various functions of k. But it's this guy squared is the only winner, the only survivor. The other guys are much smaller. So the fact that K tends to this, that's at leading order. That's at leading order. This the wave number is driven to a preferred value means that essentially most of the terms in the E2 disappear. So after what we call the horizontal diffusion time, the time it takes essentially for information to cross the macroscopic distance, the pattern, the k squared has got to be this kb squared almost everywhere. squared almost everywhere and all the terms in this dropped out except for the mean curvature squared so the the the um the the average energy is completely universal the only way there's memory of the microscopic system is in various constants in that multiply the various terms but the But the individual behavior is the same. So all these different systems, you know, essentially corresponding to like high Prandtl number convection, have the same order parameter equations. They exhibit the very same character in their patterns. All right, so let's. Okay, now I really, it's too late to go into details here, so I'm not going to, I'm going to talk to you about the solutions. So we get this equation here. This is the equation for the slow variation of the phase. It's got this term, which is roughly k squared minus kb squared, and then it's squared minus kb squared and then essentially it's just the biharmonic it's what comes from the variation of the mean curvature so um so these of course come from two to um the strain energy and of course this is nothing other than the bending energy and um and so uh if you look for stationary solutions of this you're you're Of this, you're essentially saying that you're forgetting the time derivative and you're looking for critical points of the average energy. Now, one thing that people try when they have things like this is they say, I wonder if it is possible that the self-dual solution has played any role. In other words, that In other words, that somehow things arrange that the amount of energy in bending and stretching balance each other. And in fact, that turns out to be more or less the case. There is an obstacle. So you say, okay, let's try and reduce, make the problem simpler. The stationary equation is a fourth order equation, but let's say that del squared theta is just so. squared theta is just so this balances this plus or minus s is just plus or minus plus an error what's the equation for the error so you can calculate it and on the right hand side there's an awful lot of the Jacobian of the map from real space into order parameter space and here's the magic thing because k squared Because k squared tends to kb squared constant almost everywhere, let's differentiate it with respect to x. So it's f squared plus g squared, and we can go into higher dimensions if we like. h squared equals constant. We'll do it with respect to f, fx and plus g g g x plus h h x equals zero, then do it with respect to y. Do it with respect to y. What that is, it just says that the Jacobian matrix acting upon Fgh, K, as a vector, okay, is zero. That means the K, the wave vector, is an eigenvector of the Jacobian matrix with zero eigenvalue. And what it does is it more or less gets rid of this. It more or less gets rid of this whole right-hand side. Okay, so it gets rid of it in any dimension, but not completely, because the argument I gave you a minute ago presupposes that the Gaussian, for instance, let's go to two dimensions, the Gaussian curvature. See, if j k is zero and we're in two dimensions, the determinant. The determinant of J has to be zero, and that's fx gy minus fy gx, which is the Gaussian curvature up to this factor of the phase surface. And so the obstacle to this being zero is where the Gaussian curvature is. But we know from many works. Many works that the Gaussian character condenses onto the points. So they act like points, singularities. So you can treat this whole thing essentially as this pair of equations. And things even simplify further because now we've two equations, one for the theta, and that's that, we already talked about. And okay. And uh okay and now we have this wonderful thing since we can replace this strain energy by this okay now a half-pole transformation almost linearizes the two equations. Fantastic, isn't it? So we almost describe the whole thing as linear equations. Actually, Halfko is the thing that is That it's the same thing that you it linearizes the Berger's equation to the heat equation. It's an exercise in Forsyth's book, volume six. So it wasn't originated with possibly. Anyway, so you get these linear queries, and if the J is zero, then we can take the chi will be exactly zero, and the solutions are just easy to be a. Solutions are just e to the sums of exponentials. And if you take one exponential, e to the beta kb dot x, that's a set of stripes with direction kb. If you take the sum of two exponentials, it's a phase grain boundary. If you take a sum of three, you know, it's a more complicated figure. And various combinations, the dislocation is also a solution with the j equals zero. With the j equals zero. So we can come up with the solutions of all these problems, I mean, all these defects. And just now, because I want to tell you something of a challenge, one of the interesting things is this phase-grain boundary. Here's the phase-grain boundary. So you have a K1 and a K2. One and a k2, say this is angle alpha. So this guy has an energy per unit length along here proportional to the sine cubed of that angle alpha. But you see, there's a problem here because if alpha gets very big, okay, then essentially the lines go like this. There's a phase gram body. But there's no cost to that. It's just that. to that it's just that we've labeled this theta equals mine at 2 pi 0 2 pi but there's no energy cost to to that to that so obviously we can't have this guy can't survive as alpha gets too big so here's what happens it's it he you make the uh bisector here and the next guy coming out put a little loop here Put a little loop here. And if you calculate now the energy to compete with this, it'll be proportional to one minus sine alpha. It's just a little calculation. And so sine cubed has to be when one minus sine alpha gets to be less than sine cubed, then you have an instability from a vector field solution, the phase grain boundary. Solution, the phase grain boundary to the nucleation of a concave convex dislination pair. Now we see this, and so let's go to challenge. And oh, before I go exactly to the challenge, in three dimensions, let's look at these guys. If you take these loop defects, you can take the cross-section. You can take the cross section. Let's take it to be the concave distillation. And I'm going to bring it around and hatch it back to itself. Now I can do it in many ways. Okay. I can twist it by 2 pi over 3. I can twist it by 4 pi over 3 or 2 pi and more. Any integer multiple of 2 pi over 3. So this guy. So, this guy here has two indices. One, if I take a loop around in the plane of the loop, like perpendicular to the loop, that will give me the index half, or minus a half in this case. If I take the index, which measures how k twists as I go around like that, I get 2 pi over 3 divided by 2 pi, a third. A third. And if you do it with this guy, you'll only get one. It'll be two pi. So that's just one. So here we have objects, and these occur in liquid crystals, which coming from a system which only has translational and rotational variance, and you stress that system and you're producing objects with indices, topological indices of one. a third and a half and any actually integer multiple of the one and the third so sort of like pattern quarks and leptons so anyway who knows whether they've anything to do with real quarks and leptons pardon ether No idea. Local conic defects, then? Yeah, I have no idea. Oh, that's what they call it in liquid crystallology. Is that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I was giving a talk on this in Göttingen, and the same time there was a conference, and these guys produced this experiment, and they seem to see things just like that in there. But now, here's what we want to do. But now, here's what we want to do now. We want to talk about, and I'll finish there because it's time. What happens when you try to say, I have an elliptical cylinder and a certain depth, and I'm going to heat the side walls, and I'm going to look at the convection patterns. So, sort of the first row. Sort of the first row, the stripe you'll get will be sort of parallel to the boundary, like this, and the distance, the preferred wave number away, like that. Because you'll have rising fluid here, because the boundaries are heated, and so the rolls will be sort of parallel. And so you try to go all the way in, right, with that. And so it's an iconal solution you're looking for, but you're just trying to draw these contours, KB. These contours KB apart and so on. But unfortunately, now you have a problem with cusps, which go from one focus to the other. And so you end up with kind of when you get to the center, something like this. And this is indeed what would happen with the blister with the right boundary conditions. You'd get a non-stretched area up to this roof line. Up to this roof line, and then you'd get this line discontinuity where you'd have a, you know, that's where the bending energy would, the cost would come. But here's the problem. As I told Paul pointed out to you, if the angle here is too sharp, if the angle there is too sharp, these guys are unstable. You can't have this solution in the You can't have this solution in the convection problem, and that was something we discovered. Let me just show you an experiment by Gunther Allers here. This is what we sort of predicted has to happen, but that you get this defect, this VX pair. Here is just very small here, Vx pair, this nipple here at the focus. If you make the focus if you make the the the the the ellipse uh so that the ratio of the major to minor axis it gets much larger then it's quite interesting because uh this original icon solution to which you add essentially these vx pairs on the on the uh on the uh on this um between the foci On this, between the foci, that doesn't seem to be the final state. It's very interesting. The final state tends to look, well, like this. It tends to just become a series of dislocations along here. So somehow the Vx pairs that get created because the original iconal solution goes unstable. Solution goes unstable, okay, somehow these Vx pairs must merge and become full dislocations. Now, of course, the dislocation doesn't have any Gaussian curvature connected, but we have to have at least two pi's worth of Gaussian curvature because of the twist on the outside. So, that around here at the outer part, just at the focus, or just before the focus, where the instability first takes place. Focus where the instability first takes place, you will store a little bit of a loop there with a Gaussian curvature of the 2π. But this is something we haven't figured out yet. It's quite remarkable. So essentially what happens is at first you get the iconal solution, the roles that start that come in from the boundary, and when they get to the When they get to the line between the two foci, they realize they can't, they'll be unstable. It won't allow a phase grain boundary there. They make these Vx pairs. And then for some reason, they don't feel they're at a proper energy minimum. And they tend to flatten out the region here and create this series of dislocations. And that's an open question for us so far. So, anyway, that's a good time to stop. So, let me stop there. Thanks. So thanks for the stimulating talk. So, here, when we look at the experimental data, it seems as though K, the magnitude of K, is almost angular dependent. Is that an optical illusion? Almost angular dependent. Is that an optical illusion or is that really? It's a bit of an optical illusion. It's not. Okay. Thanks. So about this last point that you mentioned, so in elasticity, there is a very interesting structure. Structure which is called decon, the developable cone, which, if you think about it in terms of Gaussian curvature, it does not have any net Gaussian curvature. Nevertheless, because it's flat everywhere, and there is no, obviously, it's not, it's like basically it's isometric to a planar structure everywhere. Everywhere in contrast to a con up to this core, some core zone, which is a, and it turns out that this core zone, if you think about it, what's the distribution of Gaussian curvature there? It's quadrupolar. It does not have a net monopole moment of Gaussian curvature, neither dipole moment, only quadrupolar. What is exactly this distribution? It's an open question. But I just wondered whether this could be. But I just wondered whether this could be analogous to this. No, yeah, I know the decones. I mean, they're these pointwise isometric deformations with the tip. I don't see any analog appearing here. The huge difference is when you have an elastic sheet, the analog to the phase, the height of the Phase, the height of the surface, is a single-valued function. Here, our phase is a double-valued function. Okay, it's really single-valued. It's a function on the plane and its cover. So it's like kind of how do you think of z to the half, like in complex variables, you need this essentially. Is essentially two planes stuck together at the right point. We call it the branch point, right? So yes, I mean, it's an interesting. I must check actually if a D cone structure is a solution. Do you know if it's a, does the bending and the stretching energy balance at the core of the D cone? At the core of the Don, or in the neighborhood of the core of the D con? This is an open question. Yeah. As far as I know. Like one of the big paradoxes, one of, I think, very nice open questions in. Okay, maybe you can talk about it later, but I can. I have a pretty broad online question. So you mentioned convection patterns as these examples, but it's easy to see turbulent flows. Have you thought about, I mean, since your scheme is so general, have you thought about turbulence at all? And how you would think about turbulence every day without success. Day without success, yes, sure. So, of course. So, what I mean, it would be no, the questions in connection with turbulent, you don't have an underlying periodic pattern, first of all, in a turbulent flow. So it would be very difficult to kind of create even the notion of an order parameter or Of an order parameter or a macroscopic description of turbulence. So I'm afraid that'll be a long stretch. May I ask about the megalithic stones? May I ask about the stones from the introduction? The draw the sculpture. You have to buy me a picture. The beer is on me. Have to buy me a pint. You have to buy me a pint, but the deal I'll give you is this: if you don't find my explanation reasonably plausible, I'll buy the pint for you. How about that? Is that fair? Yeah. All right. This gentleman back here. Okay, that seems like it's on. Like it's on. When you were talking about the defects, it reminded me a bit on defects in reaction diffusion systems where you have spiral waves, which can have opposite signs as well. One rotates in one direction, other class in opposite ones, and they have negative and positive charges. How well does this relate to that? And well, yes, they certainly look similar, but in the But those instabilities come about is an onset of a time-dependent state. And so essentially, you have waves propagating. Now, the difficulty with the waves, when you try to describe them with this kind of toolbox, is that the group velocity, okay, is amplitude dependent. Dependent and it's the first effect essentially that the waves sort of travel are advected with their group velocity. But if the group velocity is a function also of the amplitude of a wave, you can create shocks. So what happens there, it's not easy then to create this macroscopic description. It's like in if you're If you're studying like a Court of Egg de Vries equation, like no instability at all, just waves. But you get sort of a periodic solution, but it can destabilize essentially to two-phase solution, and you have to introduce new phases. So that makes actually Lou Howard and Nancy Capell tried to put together. Powell tried to put together a theory for the chemical waves. And you run into this difficulty straight away. Here, the first balance is diffusion. And so the problem becomes well posed for a long time because of that. Thank you. If I count the defects on my fingertip, let's say, what does the density of defects in appropriate units depend on? I mean, can I predict from something or empirically, is it observed that it's a certain constant per wavelength squared or? No, no. First of all, the types of defects, certainly the disclination defects, there's very few of them on each fingertip. You have maybe one or two tri-radii and a loop in the center. Most of the defects are places where a ridge will just end, like a dislocation. And essentially, the places where dislocations occur, they can They can almost randomly distribute it on your finger. That's why, like, identical twins are identical in many ways, but their fingerprints are totally different. And so I don't think there's any way of predicting either the number or the likely positioning or the distribution of these rig ends on fingertips. Yeah. I'd like to follow up on you follow up on your response to the question. It actually reminds me, the question reminds me of the question, let's say, of what you can call the Thompson problem, maybe, which is the, I think it's called the Thompson problem, which is the hexagonal packing. Suppose you have a Suppose you have a sphere and you want to tiny spheres or tiny balls and you want to put them to densely pack them, hexagonal packing, of course, in this around a surface of a sphere. And as we know, Euler characteristics, Euler tells you that there is, there should be a topological number of 12, so you must have at least 12 topologically, you must have at least 12 disclination or. Is 12 disclination, or more accurately, the number, topological number, should be 12, right? I mean, that's the. But then, what was a question that was, I think, the first people, the stars I know, that put it forward were a paper by David Nelson and company. It started to ask, okay, if you put now elastic energy, you associate obviously to the lattice, to the deformed lattice, the hexagonal lattice, then obviously each disclination will induce huge. Disclination will induce huge strain around it, very far afield. So, you would expect that if you make this bit smaller and smaller, namely you go to the continuum limit, then you will start to proliferate defects, not disclination, but dislocations to screen this stress field. Just like a dipole, you know, when you have the by screening in electrostatics, etc. So, in this sense, and it turns. Sense. And it turns out that I don't think that this problem has been fully solved, but there has been quite a lot of progress on what you can say about the distribution of this. Actually, what people call scars. They coin the term scars, which is a kind of line of dislocations. And there is lots of... And I wonder whether there could be similar thing here, because what you have here is essentially also similar frustration. Love frustration. The number of disclinations, as you said, should be determined topologically, and there are few of them. But then the dislocations appear to screen the stress field that is generated by the disclinations. Well, I hear what you say, but I apologize if my ignorance gave you the wrong answer. But I have no knowledge. But it would be a fascinating question, I think. Yes, I'll try to address it from. Try to address it from an elastic perspective. These dislocations occur in these patterns by virtue of this first balance. I mean, this thing, the behavior from the E0, the first part of the averaged energy. Part of the averaged energy essentially brings this divergence of this object Kb. And this is the original neutral stability curve of the, this is the stress parameter, say. And so the action takes place here, and you're at a finite stress parameter. So here's where you're getting this mode. And this Kb curve looks something like this. And you're actually unstable everywhere, unstable here. This is the so-called Busa balloon, if you know the work of Fritz Busse on patterns. And this essentially corresponds to an Eckhaus instability, and this corresponds to a zigzag. You make chevrons if you put the wave number in here. But this is where you create dislocations, and usually create them in pairs. Usually, we create them in pairs in order to actually get the wave numbers right. And so it's quite possible when your fingerprint is just, the wrinkles are first being made, that in fact, in order to reach the right wave number, which is like reducing, getting the energy right, there are a number of dislocations put into the picture. Put into the picture. So I don't know, maybe there would be some. It's a good, yeah, it's an interesting question. In your perspective, the dislocations are there irrespective of the disclinations. Yeah. Okay, so I think the perspective that I try to suggest is that they are induced by the disclinations. Just because the disclination implies stress feeling. Well, I can't say there isn't a connection because I've been telling you here. Telling you here, part of this I can't answer is how these dislination pairs, single dislination pairs, suddenly pair up and become dislocations. And that's so, I don't know. That's the great thing about all the things we've learned. Many of the things we've come across in this meeting, apparently, fairly simple questions have no simple answers. And that's what. And that's what makes this. I think it was here. I have a suggestion for a topic for discussion, which will be a distribute type of distribution of defects in, yeah, basically along these lines. Okay. In order, though, in part. So everybody bring their fingers with them. Stephen seems to be extremely impatient and he wants to kick us out. Yeah, yeah, I knew. Yeah, yeah, I knew this. It mixes fingerprints with convection patterns. Because in the convection pattern, you have to have the director field. Yes. Fingerprints, I don't think. No, no, the wrinkles. Yeah, you. The W is signal-valued, yes, but the phase isn't. Doesn't matter whether you call the phase.
