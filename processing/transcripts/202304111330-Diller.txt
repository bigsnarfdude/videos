Hello, my father Philip Jeff here from the University of Notre Dame. We're going to talk about colonization distribution without studying. We finally posted the pre-print for this, so I have to stop doing this like that. I missed the table. Sarah. All right, well, thanks to the organizers for inviting me to be here and my peers for this audience. So I should apologize from the beginning. I don't really have anything to say about my own maps per section. It's definitely beyond part of the company, I guess. There will be a delta at some point, but it's with respect to a different area. So. So and it disseminates from stuff that was okay. Oh, and then the last thing is this is joint work with Roland Berger, who is also an Indian ID of the model. All right. Right, and this is not okay, so sometimes when it talks to get lucky, you just throw a theorem up on the first slide. Just throw a theorem up on the first slide and spend the rest of the time talking about everything. This is not one of those talks. It'll take a little bit for me to get in the theorem. So, what I want to start with first is just state a sort of general problem about rational maps that lots of people in here are familiar with. You have a rational map on projection space, complex projective space, and you have a proper sub-variety of projective space. And you look at the sequences of pre integers of that sub-variety. Pretty much of that sub-variety and asks asymptotically what's going on. To fix your imagination here, you should imagine in one complex circle and take a point and pull it back, and you can be able to resolve the widget set. And so asymptotically, you found the place where the dynamics are most interesting. If you hope for something similar in higher dimensions here, and there's a fairly old by now theorem of Versikowski and Scheckman from Scheckman from the 90s, which says that if the pullbacks of your variety grow quickly enough, I won't make that precise, but if they grow quickly enough, and you treat the sequence like a sequence of currents, and you normalize to keep the mass of those currents out of it, then for almost every sub-variety, the asymptotic behavior is the same. Whatever the behavior is. It doesn't have to, well, it depends on the dimension of the sub-variety. Well, it depends on the dimension of the subarray, but that's it. So that's in general, you don't expect this to have much to do with the variety you start with. So that raises another question, just a refinement of the top problem, is the bottom problem, is does this sequence have some sort of actual limit? Does it actually converge with something here? I will consider this in a very special case. Before I get to my context, though, let me To get to my context, though, let me throw up an excerpt from a paper. It's unfortunately going to be way too small for people online, but maybe some people on here can see how many people immediately know what this paper is. Eric, what's that? You have it, but Bedford's Millionaire. Yeah, Eric is. This is the second paper of Bedford's. And they have, in that paper, they prove a theorem that says if you have a They prove a theorem that says if you have a known map more generally, a follow-up automorphism of C2, and you start pulling back the curve and normalizing, then it always converges to this part V plus, which support is, well, one version of it should be accepted. All right? And we can get the paper and read the rest of it through. Okay, so from now on, from now on, narrow the Now on, narrow the scope more and more. And the dimension is going to be two. Rational maps have a projective plane. And the subroutine is going to be a curve. So dimension of the subroutine is one. Now rational maps are not actually maps, as many of you know. They have a finite set of points, which I denote by I of F, where they're not actually continuously. And then, sort of dual to that, they have a finite set of curves that can be contracted. Set of curves that can be contracted. So we'll have to denote that by E of A for specialized curves. Eric made this definition yesterday. I want me to get through it up again. I misspelled it. I did. I misspelled it with Delta. I have another use for Delta. Okay. Yeah. So the degree of a rational map is you just write it out in coordinates, a homotopian coordinates. Coordinates and homogeneous coordinates, and the degree of the component polynomials. And then the dynamical degree is what happens to that. What is the exponential growth rate of that as you start to iterate that? And in general, in most cases, they agree as something that's easily worked out. The future is just greater than that. But in general, it's a very tricky thing to handle. All right, so data means all sorts of things can work. Updata means all sorts of things can involve. Now it's better if your map is what I'm going to call for purposes of this talk stabilizable. I'm going to call this is, bear with me. So F, a map on the projector plane is stabilizable if I can find some other surface and a birational map to P2 that conjugates F to some map that is algebraically stable. And algebraically stable There's a statement there, but what it means is the following does not happen. You do not have a curve that collapses to a point. Well, you can have a curve that collapses to a point, but what you can't have is that that point goes to another point, which then builds up to a curve. You don't mix up the indeterminate exceptional behavior. All right. So the map is stabilizable if you can find. Map is stabilizable if you can conjugate it into a situation where you don't have that picture. Okay, and the reason I care about algebraic stability is what it means for pulling back the curves is if you pull back the curves as divisors, right, and pulling back by the nth iterate is the same thing as pulling back by the first iterate in times. You think that's just generally, but it's not. All right, unless you have this condition here. I want to be able to relate everything back to first iterate if I can. Okay, whoops, I skipped a page. Yeah, there's a theorem. And the theorem is that the same theorem I showed you from Bedford and Smiley 2 holds for stabilizable rational epsilon P2. This is a theorem with Guishar Gamma Gettijo-ish years ago, you know. And says that if, well, there's a technical condition, that the first dynamical degree of the map is not a minimum cross call. The square of the first dynamical degree is strictly larger than the topological map, larger than the number of units of the flow. If you have that condition, then there's a positive closed current T star on P2 that does not itself charge birds. So T star is not like a very positive. P-Star is not like a very cognizant-trained requirement. It's invariant of multiplication by the dynamical degree when you pull it back. And more than that, if you take basically any curve, almost any curve in P2 and you start pulling it back and normalizing by the dynamical degree, then it converges to this two stars. So it solves the, it basically solves the problem on the bottom of the first slide that I had. On the bottom of the first slide, but I do that. Do the preimages of C converge to some kind of almost? What is almost? So, what you really prove is that the pullbacks of a random California converge to the current, and then you think of the California as an average of the lines of the currents. So it's like the peripheral set of curves and C. Yeah, right, right. Almost every Almost every is very strong. Okay, so here's a strategy. Here is the proof we did not use for that theorem. But it's a nice idea for proof, but it's not the one we all want to prove it. So the idea is, well, parts of it we did. So first of all, you don't want to work on P2. You want to work on the surface where the map is actually algebraically scaled. So do that. And in that case, you may not be able to do that. In that case, you won't be able to find a curve that is deadline backward invariant by this map. But curves represent classes, either homology classes or linear equivalence classes, whatever your favorite finite dimensional vector space characterizing curves is. And so there is a class of curves, which is backward invariant, who soft things. And you get this invariant class. This invariant class, invariant up to multiplication by lambda. So if you were then lucky enough to have a curve that actually represented that class, then you could do the, what it means for the class to be invariant in analytic terms is this. You pull the curve back, you normalize, and compare with the curve, they're equivalent. So you can write them as ddc or dd bar of some potential function. They are equivalent. All right, this potential function. Alright, this potential function would be nice if it was bounded. It's not, but the singularities are not that bad. It's way better than a wall. And since we have algebraic stability, we can relate the nth iterate of the map to, we can relate it back, well, we can relate the nth pullback of C back to C by working one iteratively with model. We can write the difference as a total sloping series and then. Series, and then write each term in the series in terms of the potential, and we end up with this formula involving a sum of pullbacks of the potential. Now, when I stress, again, it's nice to think about the case you don't have, and that is when phi is bounded. If this phi were founded by one, then phi composed f of the j would be bounded by one, or j, and then this series would just be dominated by the word. Would just be dominated like the word geometric series, and everything would be great. Everything would converge here. But you don't really have that, so you can try instead to ask for that series to convert to the L1. That's a reasonable thing to try because the singularities of phi are very mild. And all you need to guarantee is that F to the J doesn't sort of sneakily pick up a big open set. Just collapse it and send it right to the place where Phi is. Send it right to the place your fee is really lower. So if you have some sort of like a volume estimate for your map, then you'll be able to safely prove that this link influences at least in L1. Now that, we never did that in our paper. Stress, but that's that's a that's still one of the two new lessons here. The other problem is you need Problem is, you need, if somebody hands you a random curve, it doesn't necessarily represent this class. And this class, anyhow, doesn't have to be represented by a curve. I mean, you can get a value that represents. So you have to deal with curves that don't represent the invariant device, and that adds trickiness to it, too. But as a strategy, it's not that. Okay. Now, so that there, I should. So, that theorem, I should say, for the sake of honesty and for the rest of the talk, that this theorem doesn't cover all rational maths. Not every rational math is stabilizable. And Charles gave the first examples around 2000 or something like that. So they're very simple once you realize it. We call a map monomial if some integer matrix and use the entries of the matrix as powers in monomials. And you make those into elements of your functions. Okay, so that doesn't annomial. It's basically just an exponentiated length of math here. And Schaun observed that if the matrix has complex conjugative eigenvalues and no power, and you choose it so that the powers of the eigenvalue are never one or something like that, so that the arguments of the eigenvalues are irrational multiples of 2 pi, then your minimum map cannot be stabilized. Map cannot be stabilized. Not only is it not algebraically stable in P2, it's not algebraically stable on any actual surface. All right? And it's basically, it is normally a surface that you can see here. The eigenvalues are not satisfying this condition, and in some sense, stick with that sentence. So there are bad maps. Something to point out about monomial maps, though, is technically they fail. Is technically they fail the hypothesis of the theorem with due to organic edge anyhow because the topological degree of the monomial map is everything comes from the matrix, the underlying matrix. Topological degree, you just take the determinant of the matrix, take its absolute value. First dynamical degree, you find, you take the absolute values of the eigenvalues and take the largest one of those, and that's your dynamical degree. So in this situation where your eigenvalues are complex. Where you eigenvalues are conjugates, you are exactly in the case where the topological square, which wasn't covered by R era anyhow. So this thing fails all over the place. But still, it's so simple. You should be able to just, by inspection, find, figure out what happens to free images of curves. There we go. All right, so here's how you can sort of by hand get yourself an invariant curve in your distribution theorem. So, one way of expressing the fact that the new real map is really just an exponentiate linear map is as follows. You define this logarithm map from C2 to R2 by just taking your coordinates, well, C star squared to R2. You take each coordinate, log absolute value. Coordinate, log absolute value of the coordinate, and for obscure purposes, we're going to lengthen both the logic. All right. And this gives, in our paper, we call this a swap equalization. I think longer is easier to remember. Now, if A has complex eigenvalues, that means you can choose a basis so that A is really just acting by rotation. So you can choose some norm. So you can choose some norm along to adapt it to the basis, which is invariant by A, or up to multiplication by A. And if you compose this norm with a longer than that, that actually gives you a Fourier harmonic function on the complex torus on C star squared. So taking DDC of that gives you some current on just the algebraic torus. Okay, so it doesn't. Okay, so it doesn't. I'm stressing here that when I take DDC, I'm just keeping the corner on the torus. If I let this thing, you know, if I DDC it on P2, it wants to pick up some of the lighters on the X-axis and the Y-axis, and the line that is really, I don't want those. So I just keep this current, and it extends nicely to all the projected plane. And because of this feature, the current... Because of this feature, the current is backward variant. It pulls back to just planning the degree times itself. So you can write down some sort of. Too star has A on it. Where's the A with the right hand? Sorry. Where's the A? Oh, it's on the norm. Thank you. I subscripted the norm here, but not there. So just think of A as a matrix for actual irrational or equations. And this is the standard. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so now what about equidistribution? Here's a candidate limit for pullbacks of occurrence. Is it obvious that the current is not zero? Well, yeah, it needs to be not zero because you're going to pull back currents at the last one, but I'm not sure I understand the gist of your question. But by the definition you give, maybe it's uh as a DDC as something it could be zero if the if the function was uh Is it function with a. Oh, is it clear that this isn't just the zero? Well, it's not the zero. You're right. That's a conjecture. No, it's sort of a support is everything in P2A. So it's kind of weird as a curve on P2. It's pretty big. All right. So now to single out the curves that my equidistribution theorem is going to work for, I'm going to call something a curve internal. Going to call something a curve internal. If it is not, so just draw a picture here because I'm going to reuse it. Everybody, picture P2. The complement of the purple is the algebraic torus. And I'm going to call a curve internal if it meets the complement. If it's not this, this, or this, it's an internal curve. Otherwise, it's torus invariant. Okay. Okay, unfortunately, even this kind of curve is not going to expeditious view for a minimum map unless you MMR. Okay, so what you actually can show is that if you take an internal curve and you start holding it back by your minimum normalizing, here's what you'd like to say, or is here, but you have the Cesaro average, too. For essentially Average too. For essentially the same reason, if you have an irrational rotation of the circle and you start taking a three-invisible point by that, it doesn't converge to anything. But if you start taking Cesaro means a three-invisible point, it converges to the magnet. And it's the same kind of thing going over here. So you get some kind of aqua distributional result from the maps. All right. Yeah, I think I'm getting close. Yeah, getting close. What about other maps? They're not stabilizable. So, a step away from the minimum map is what we call a toric, a rational map for lack of a better term so far. We're going to call a map toric if it pulls back the following form. Okay, so not the standard area form on C2, but the standard area form on the algebraic fluorescent C star squared. star squared. If it pulls that thing back from there, it will be itself. Delta is just a complex number here. It's actually in general. So we'll call that toric if it has this property. And monomial maps are exhibit A. They're toric, rational maps. All monomial maps are toric, and the delta is just a determinant of the values here. Another fairly trivial example is what I'll call a translation. You just scale each word. Translation, you just scale each coordinate by some non-zero complex number. Call it translation because it's kind of like group action of the torus, you just translate it. Sure. Okay, and if I had never thought about this before and you told me that this stopped here, I would be but it doesn't stop here. There's another easy example right here. Okay? If you take a skew product, x1, x2 goes to x1, some x1 some rational any rational map of x1 times x2 um that will also be toric and um since i set it up this way delta will be one for that the thing is and this is like d log x1 like d log x2 and uh since dx1 like dx1 is 0 that when you pull back this form it doesn't see the d log r so that's pretty transparent So that's pretty transparently Torrational microscope and compositions of Torque Maps and Torque Maps. So you can build a whole semi-group out of these things. And to this day, I'm still wondering whether that's the whole less. If you say birational, I've just given you the whole less here. You have to limit yourself to birational and then the whole restrictions on the rational function. That's it. You can build all. But that's it. You can build all fire action patterns that way. But non-importable ones? I don't know. All right. We put this. What's that? We put this. Well, for biorectional maps, Jeremy, not blunt, did this. I think. I mean, he did a lot more, right? He did a presentation of the group of biorectional maps that did this. Right, so do I miss something? I did. Oh, okay. There we go. All right, so it's so the general idea with these toric maps is they also work pretty well on the algebraic torus. Not perfectly well, not as well as you might hope. But one way in which a toric map works well on the torus Map works well on the torus, is there something that takes the place of the matrix A for one of these maps? Okay, so I call it tropicalization. Okay, we call it the tropicalization of the map. It's a piecewise linear, positively homogeneous. So if you scale the point by a positive constant, then again scales by a positive constant, just like the matrix. And it has the Just make tricks. And it has the feature, it doesn't have the feature that log components F is AF compose log, but the two things are asymptotic. If you take a, in a sense, I won't qualify perfectly because it's a little tricky, but if you go out toward the edge of the algebraic torus, then this statement is asymptotically true there. Alright, so there is something that plays the role of the matrix, and that thing keeps surfacing in what follows. So call that the truth. Folllows. So call that the tropicalization of F. And in all the examples on the list, it's a homeless. So without saying it for now, I'm going to assume that this thing is a home. But it is definitely an assumption. If your math is a translation, is AF a translation in RN? AF is, let's see, in that case, it does nothing. It doesn't work. No, wait, you're right. It's a translation. You're right. It's a translation. You're right. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. No, it's only. Sorry, sorry. You have a formula like that with a translation, but that's not the tropicalization because the homogeneity round down, right? So, no, it's just the identity. Okay, so a little less than 10 years ago, Jen Lee Lin and I wrote. Years ago, Jen Lee Lin and I wrote a paper that was systematically looked at maps like this. And one thing we were able to see is that a torque map is stabilizable if and only a state condition adds for an UM map. Well, I should say, so this AF. The picture you should have is like finitely many rates in order to. Where the linearity, the beta temp, in between each pair, a map is linear. Okay, but if you then just quotient out, so by positive multiples, beta induces a map on the unit circle. So it's fair to talk about the rotation number of this thing. If that rotation number is irrational, then the torque map is not stabilizable. And it's if and only if. I've got it backwards. It's stabilizable if and only if AF has rational. Anyhow, there are lots of toric maps which are not monomial maps, and lots of those have tropicalization to irrationalization numbers. Irrational rotation numbers. So there's lots more unstabilizable for rational maps. In fact, so, and in some sense, the thing that really motivated Roland and I to get going on this project, so with Matthias and Jason Bell, we were able to show that one of these guys actually has a dynamic relationship which is transcendental, which is a very strange phenomenon. But for my purposes, for this talk, even though that's Even though that's kind of a striking fact, what I care about is that there exists examples that are not stabilizable. Maybe you said this, but these twice linear are the breaking points, these rays, rational radius? They are rational. Yeah, and in fact, if you have a particular map, it's not that hard to work out where the gap is either. You just have to do one or two examples and then it's just going to shoot. Okay, whoops, backwards again. I'm just not in sync with these arrows. Okay, so now in order to proceed, I need to ditch P2 entirely and talk about general torque surfaces. A really non-standard definition of torque surfaces. The torque surfaces, first and foremost, it's a compactification. and foremost it's a compactification of c star squared like p2 is a compactification of c star squared but not just any compactification uh you want one where you have this two-form dx d1 over x1 x2 you want the compact you want to choose a compactification so that thing has poles at every component in the complement of the algebraic torus and practically speaking that means p2 is a toric surface it also P2 is a torque surface. It also means if you want another torque surface built up from P2, you have basically three options. You can blow up this point, this point, or this point. If you try to blow up some other point, which is not in the torque, you'll create something that's not a pole. Okay, so to get further torque surfaces, you just take, if you're going up, you take intersection points between poles on your old torque surface and blow them up, and you always have this sort of. Blow them up, and you always have this sort of cycle of curves that gives you the complement performance in your surface. So, there's nothing very mysterious about what these look like in general. Now, right, so between any two of them you have a birational map, and when that birational map is a morphism, when it's actually holomorphic, when all it does is contract, we're going to say that the That the domain of the bi-rational map is bigger than the range, bigger than the target here. So, one toward surface dominates another, if and only if you get down from the first to the second, purely by contraction. All right. Oh, there is one other thing on that slide. So, something I want to emphasize here because when some Because it might suit my purposes later, is that these curves in the complement of the algebraic porous, there's a very pretty way to index them with rational rays in R2. So for P2, there's a kind of a cool picture to the one I drew here, where each of these rational rays corresponds to one of these curves. I can outside the talk and tell you how the correspondence works, but I'm going to... Tell you how the correspondence works, but I'm not bothering here. All right, so, but the poles of the two form correspond to rational, a certain set of rational arrays are two. Okay, so now if you have a toric map, it behooves you to not think about it as a map on P2, but really between any two toric surfaces. And one thing, so one thing about this. One thing about this is if you have an internal curve, if you have a curve which meets the torus and it's exceptional for your map, then it's exceptional no matter which torus surfaces you use for the domain and the range of your patch. If it's exceptional for one, it's just persistently exceptional for all of them. The other thing about it is then the image of that curve has to go outside the torus. So the map basically takes a torus to itself, except if it contracts a curve, it Except, if it contracts a curve, it carries it off to infinity somehow. And now I'm going to substitute a condition, a much weaker condition, for algebraic stability. I'm going to call the map, the torque map, internally stable. If for every persistently exceptional curve, you can pick surfaces torque surfaces X and Y for every persistently exceptional curve and for any particular iterative. For any particular iterate, you can pick torque surfaces x and y so that the image of the exceptional curve by the nth iterate does not meet the indeterminate, the indeterminacy locates for f x y. So it's much more flexible than now create stability because you get to have a different domain and range for the map and you pick. As long as you stay with torque surfaces. And so I stress that that example in the paper with Bell and Jan said, all the examples. Said all the examples in that paper are internally stable. There exist examples which are not, but by and large, most of the torque maps are internally stable, even the unstabilizable ones. And so here's the first theorem with Brawlin that I want to mention. So it turns out that there's a nice way to distinguish the monomial maps among other Tor maps. And the monomial maps are, if you look at yourself to Are precise if you limit yourself to internally stable toric maps, the minomium maps are precisely the ones where the first dynamical degree is minimal. Any other toric map has lambda squared bigger than the topological degree. So this parallel, so Matthias and Charles proved a similar theorem for polynomial maps of C2. Okay, there's another case. I forgot. I'm so fixated on the unstabilizable case. Another possibility here is that your map is a skewed cross. Here is that your map is a skew product of a certain field. Okay, but that won't be of any concern to me because that will be stabilizable. All right. Right, so here's the theorem we set out to prove, and we finally got it. So say you've got an internally stable toric rational map. That's not monomial. So first dynamical degree is bigger than minimal. First dynamical degree is bigger than minimal. And say it's not stabilizable, so the tropicalization has irrational rotation number. I'll hasten to add that this term only works if the map is unstabilizable. I mean, in the other case, it's sort of covered by the theorem with Dujardin and Gedge, but our proof is only going to work for unstabilizable maps. In that case, there's a positive closed current T star on P2, in fact, on any color surface you like. It doesn't charge. If you like, it doesn't charge curves. It's pullback invariant after the appropriation and holding for the degree. Modulosome curves, where in all honesty, you have to throw out some curves to pull back because P2 is not perfect. And then for any curve, not almost any, but any curve in P2, there's a positive constant associated to the curve. So then when you pull back the curve and divide by the appropriate power of the dynamical degree, Appropriate power of the dynamical degree, it converges to some level of the current T star. Okay, so this for the unstabilizable torrent maps sort of solves the problem that I've stated on the first slide. In particular, the ones with transcendental dynamical debut. Okay, so that's, I finally got to state the theorem, and I think I'm down to like 10 minutes here. So what I have, and what time I have left. What I have, and what time I have left, I'll talk to some about what goes into the proof at least. If not, yeah. It's not just internal curves here. No, even the poles. So the thing is, so when you start pulling back, like, say, take the x-axis, you start pulling it back, because AF is an irrational rotation. At first you'll start to see other pulls, but then some of those pulls will contain the images of exceptional curves. And it's kind of misleading to say works for poles. It works for holes, but it does. Is there something special about the PQ here? Well, all the holes are nev. So they all represent nev class. If you take some much more elaborate towards our plus, even then, I think the fact that that is your rational location in there is I think you could prove it works for all curves, but we didn't actually write that part down anyway. Internal proves are the things that I think it's best to think about here. Okay, so the main technical device in the proof is an idea we took from books on Bob and Janssen and from Francophone, is that is when you can't decide which surface you want to use for your map, just use them all at the same time. All right, so what you do, you have all these torque surfaces and they're ordered by, you know, if one is a blow-up of the other, then it's bigger than. Blow-up of the other, then it's bigger than the other one. So you take the inverse limit of all the torb surfaces under that ordering, and you get something which is not precisely a complex variety, but in this case, it's pretty close to a complex variety. The recipe for getting what I'm going to call T-hat here is you pick a point, you just blow up all three points, and then you blow up all the intersection points in the new torque surface, all the intersections between poles in the new torque surface. A new torque surface, and you just keep doing that. And in the end, you get, you know, the algebraic torus is still there in the inverse limit. It is just a homeomorphic copy of that thing. And every one of the poles is still there in the inverse limit. And there's a little bit of extra stuff, but if you ignore the extra stuff, you're looking at a complex surface. So you can really treat it more like an object than you can in the paper with Matthias and Charles and Four Somme, where they And some where they just literally take the inverse limit under all possible blow-ups, not just torque blow-ups. There, it's harder to think about what you get as an actual space. Okay, so we do that. And as I said, it's very close to being a complex manifold. And if you have a toric map, it's very close to being a rational map. It turns out that that thing, so all those internal exceptional curves, those are the exceptionals. Those are the exceptional set for the map on the inverse limits. You have finitely many exceptional curves. Similarly, you have finitely many indeterminate points, even though it's kind of an infinite situation. That's a very transcendental situation there. You just have finitely many exceptional curves and indeterminate points. And then internal stability just means orbits of the exceptional things don't get the indeterminate things. So it's just like Algeria's stability, except it's on this high. Stability, except it's on this object we're calling t hat here. All right. Oh, the other thing is that this statement that a toric map is asymptotic to its tropicalization really comes from the fact that on the inverse limit, the induced map sends poles to poles. All right, and it doesn't just send poles to poles. You know which pole it goes to and which. Goes to and which if a pole C is indexed by ray tau, the image of that thing is another pole indexed by a output tau. So you know exactly where the poles are going in the inverse limit. Okay, but you don't stop there. You can also define classes and currents by the same inverse limit instruction. A class is on the inverse limit is really a collection of homology classes, one for every 20. Classes, one for every torque surface, and they have to be consistent so that if one surface is the blow-up of another, when you push the representative on the top surface down, you look at the representative on the bottom surface. You really can't talk about classes, and you really can't talk about currents. You can even talk about potentials for currents because of that. Right, Sean? Right. Okay, so the next piece is that just like in actual complex world, currents represent classes, they still represent classes in the inverse limit. And in particular, internal curves represent nef classes, they represent very positive classes. Ample, particularly that word. Oh, well, stand up. Moreover, Moreover, you have a nice way of building currents on the inverse limit. So you can start with some context function on R2, and then compose it with this logarithm map that I defined earlier, and DDC it. That defines a positive closed current on the algebraic torus. All right. Now, that doesn't have to extend to a torus surface. That just gives you something on the torus. But if you assume then, But if you assume then that the map or the convex function grows at most linearly in any direction, okay, then that is the condition you need for this current to extend any torque surface. So you can build lots of positive closed currents with some rotational symmetry by this construction. And if it's even more symmetric, we call it homogeneous. If the convex function itself is homogeneous, it just kind of grows linearly in each positive direction. Then we'll call the association. Direction, then we'll call the associated curve homogeneous. And something that's extremely useful to us is that, in fact, every cohomology, every positive, every yet cohomology class is uniquely represented by one of these homogeneous guys. There's just a homeomorphism from homogeneous currents to classes that turns out to be very convenient for us. Okay, and then the next piece to go back to books on Flav and Young. To go back to books on Flog and Johnson, we basically just cannibalize their main result to get that equidistribution holds on the level of classes. All right, there is some class on the inverse limit on this T hat that pulls back to exactly lambda times itself, and it attracts all other positive enough losses. So we have that. This part uses internal stability. We could not directly apply their result without internal stabilities. Oh, yeah. Sorry, Charles. It's for any nev class, or do you need to assume it has better for him to say alpha? No, I think in this case it's any nef class. I think there's, because of the specificity of the situation, you don't have to hedge that way. I have to think harder after, but I'm pretty sure it's okay. And then one more slide. Okay, so this, so the final result, it's not pretty to look at. Final result, it's not pretty to look at, but it was the hardest one, technically the hardest one for us to get. And it's the volume estimate I was talking about. If you could just prove that your map does not contract volume too quickly, then you have some sum, you want it to converge in L1, and life is good. So that's what we do in the final result. So Holan and I approved that provided, this is the place where you really need this tropicalization to have your rational rotation number. So if your map's unstable, Number. So if your map's unstabilizable, and this has your rational rotation number, then you have some estimate on the rate at which iterates in your map can shrink the volume of an open set. And you have this estimate, you know, so different constants on each torque surface, but it holds on every torque surface at the same time. Okay, they're just, the other thing I'll say, I mean, this is hard to parse in five seconds, but the main thing is this is a very, very The main thing is this is a very, very weak restriction. But we freed to kill ourselves because that would work. And it really heavily uses the tropicalization, which was, I think, plus enough for us. It sustained us through the rest of the other rooms. And that's as much as I can say in the time I wanted. So thank you.
