Talking about two letter braces, triply factorised groups and representations of steam letter braces. Thank you very much. First of all, thanks to the organizers who gave me the possibility to start and say hello to the people online, with everybody here. I'm going to speak a little bit about the presentation, today's representations. Could be the short title. And this is a work in progress with two of my colleagues, Sevan Romero and Etkala Buch, we probably are alive. This talk aims to reflect on a definition. Aims to reflect on a definition of embraced representation that allows us to discover new structural properties of embraces. And I should recall, probably everyone knows, that representation theory which studies after algebraic structures by representing their elements as linear maps or vector spaces. And in essence, In essence, representation makes non-stat algebraic structure more concrete by describing the elements by matrices, algebraic operations, matrices, like sum and conjugation. And of course the matrices are linear, maps are well understood, so they're representing an abstract rate. An abstract object by linearized objects could help sometimes to discover new properties even to simplify calculations. The role played by the important role played by schema races in the mathematical context, I guess, that we define and study representations of racism. Study representations of races, a subject which might be of interest. The problem we face with knowing to define representation of braces is that a brace is an algebraic structure with two operations. And reasonably, the representation should encode these two operations. This store. However, the generality of only one. And we propose a definition of representation that encodes the additive group of the phrase, I mean by means the representation of the additive group, and then a way to encode the landman. In our approach, the triple factorate groups or factories groups associated to phase and its representations of places and allows us to use techniques. Allows us to use techniques of the group representation theory to even the computational one to discover new proper conceptual basis. So let me start by fixing notation and for me up there operations and this is an interaction of two groups. Of two groups. We got since the group and we got this LC group and satisfy the range of the property, which is AB minus C A plus C for all AB and C and B. Of course, I know that the symbol plus for the first Plus for the first operation will not meet for a general approval and perhaps it's not convenient in some situations, but at least it was our choice. So when we study a press, there are two important tools. Maybe one of the first, the most important ones is the landaboon. Landema or land action. And we have a brace. For me, this is a skew brace. I say trace. This is skew like trace. And this is landmap. This is defined the following way: minus A plus A D and this definitely C. Most of all in C B, and this is equivalent to say lambda A B, this is C percent A times B. And what is telling us that the density for the multiplicative blue to the additive blue is the equation or one cosycle with respect to this reaction. And it's also telling us that the brace is uniquely determined by the Determined by the lambda mark, a betrayation over the lambda mark and problem. And so there is also this math is an action, I mean this an action of the multiplicative group onto the additive group. It's the same A lambda. This is absolutely important. Important for us to establish press. They are landed men. And the second one is a natural group associated to the press. One of them, because there are many, but one of them is to consider the semi-direct product with respect to the action. This is a natural way to proceed. We consider G, semi-directed product. This is my notation. This is my annotation with semi-dynamic product with K is from now on the ith2 and C is the multiplicative. I mean the operation is the useful. This is semi-didy product with respect to length. And this group has important properties. The first one, the first natural one, is this group is a three-factorized group. I mean, this is equal, there is a subgroup D, this is K and D equals C E and C intersection D equals A intersection D Which is C equal to 1, K inverse 6 and C, which is C plus 1. And mean C, R, D, and C are isomorphic. This is one of the three-factors group associated with the brace. This is three-factors group associated to P. I insist. And this group encodes the properties and braces, encodes landam and encodes embrace homomorphisms, encodes the ideal structure, and encodes almost every property on the system. And these three factor groups also need a categorical study, but I'm not interested on this at the moment here. Okay, now the motivation for the file, now we try to find a representation of a bridge. I mean, a star from a bridge homomorphism from B to general linear graphs. Here that we have R from B G L E raise a moment. Embrace the moment in such a way that rho, which is R restricted to K, this is restricted to highlight the rho is R. We consider R from K to DLD. This is V, this is F, vector space, there's some field. This is a group. This is a group homophorosum, because this is a brace homomorphism. And this, what does it mean? It just means that the rho B, which is R B, this is a subgroup, subgroup, a multiplicative subgroup, or GLB, and also it has another law, which is which is uh makes rho B upgrades. Rho B a brace, which is a brace. Rho B is a brace. Okay, so this brace has a lambda map, lambda one. What about this lambda one? What is this lambda mark? Okay, so we have A and B and B. So we put cro lambda A of B. So this is rho is a homomorphism, so it keeps products and sum. So this is exactly lambda bar RA over RB. And so this is exactly, this is exactly lambda bar composed R with A. With A row B and this is exactly what row lambda A dot B Okay, if we define now if we define now beta beta which is lambda bar composed R. Of R compose R, which goes to C, which is the multiplicative group of the brace, to the automotive group of rho B which is, which is the multiplicative subgroup of GLV. And see, this is a group homology. So if we satisfy the following condition for all A in B. For all A in V rho compose lambda A is equal to beta of A composed rho, which is conditionless. And with this condition, it can be proved that if we have a group of homomorphisms like that, and we have also a group of homomorphisms like that, the kernel, the kernel. The kernel, the kernel of rho is a strong left ideal. In this case, kernel of rho is strong left ideal of P. That means, I mean, this is a well-known concept of races. And this is a sub-race which is lampro invariant and which is also a normal sub-race of the eigenvector. Now, if k is in the kernel of rho, the kernel of the group homomorphism, rho of A is the identity matrix. And so, And so, lambda bar i A is the identity because we have a very structure B and so beta of A is identity, I mean A is the kernel. And so, what we have is the kernel of rho is containing the kernel of theta. Then, The kernel drop is contained in the kernel, eta. This is condition two. But in this case, with condition two, the kernel of rho is an idea over the in this case, Kernel of Rho is an ideal. Okay, so we have two conditions, a pair of homomorphisms satisfying condition one and condition two. And I see we could have a pair of homomorphisms satisfying these two conditions in a grace. Conversely, Conversely, sorry, I don't ask. Could I ask two basic questions because I already have difficulties? So, in your triple factorization, the group D, what is it explicitly in terms of the case? So, the C is a multiple group, the K is the additive, and what is the group B? It's the diagonal. It is a diagonal. B is delta C C and C and C, when delta is the identity derivation from C to K. So, when you apply Rho, you take R restricted to K, since K is actually equal to B as I said, it's not really a restriction. It's simply you see it as a result. Yes, this is a restriction. I said that it is not a restriction. It's just simply to say that this is a group homomorphism from B plus to the internal leading group, insisting on the fact that rho B is a multiplicative subgroup of TLB coming from the additive subgroup of the. Coming from the additives, how we put the places? So, sorry, on the other records, when you write the beta, so this R concludes with lambda bar. So, what do you mean with it? So, the lambda is lambda bar is homomorphism associated with the breadth, because I am assuming that rho b is a break. So, we have an homomorphism of one integrated group of rho, then the second operation of rho b to the automorphism group of rho b. Yes, but all ends up in the matrix GRP. Up in the matrix of G of V, so it is a lambda. So you see G of V, you don't understand why you say. What I'm saying is that you can place the mark R it's lambda, but R ends up in some matrix. Yes? And lambda starts in the press. Yes, I mean lambda bar, lambda bar comes from C. From the sorry, so the there is a rubbing operation here. Rho B operation here because rho B separates rho B and I'm assuming rho B is one predicated group and this another prediction. Okay, I see this is another partition group of homology and then I comport it up. Okay, I understand that. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't miss it. No, no, no, no, that's not. Sorry, no, no, no, no, no, that's not. And as you now, conversely, you have a brace, and we have a pair of homogeneous and a pair of row p that satisfying one chip. Okay? So the kernel of rho is an ideal of And so we have B over I isomorphic to rho B, which is a shadow which is getting. And this is a brace. And this is rho bar. This is a summary. This is a group isomorphism. So Robbie. So Roby immediately has a brace structure. Rhoby has a brace structure and which is rho B structure. I mean A and B and B and rho A plus rho B which is rho A times B. A times V plus I, which is exactly rho A times rho B. This is the brace structure defining by this bi acting. This is a brace, this is a brace, so this is a subgroup, and this inherits a brace from the second operation. So this is a brace, and which is the landmark of the Of this space. I mean, round about rho A and rho B, which is rho A minus one times rho A rho B and which is rho A minus one this is rho A times rho B and which is rho A minus minus A plus A B. A plus A B rho lambda A of B which is beta A rho B So beta is a political beta a both the landmark in your week. So, since land amount and one of the operations determines uniquely the brace, there are unique structure, unique brace structure in the row. And so, from that, the natural definition for the representation of a brace should be the following. We have five minutes more presentation Brace V is a pair rho beta where rho is a homogeneous from B plus to generally a group B when we F matrix space and two beta is our homomorphism a group homomorphism from A group of momentum from V dot to the octopus of rho V satisfy one this is a rho lambda A equal to theta A rho for the B G and two kind of rho containing the trend. So this is our definition So, this is our definition of grace. In this case, we can have, because we are interested only in a pair of homomorphisms satisfying one, we can say semi-representation. And a representation in a semi-representation should be fine two. Okay, now we test this definition. Just a couple of examples. First of all, this unrepresented First of all, this representation induced a representation, a blue representation of three-factorized groups, and the other was black. And then, when I have a three-factorized group like that, and I have B representation of a three-factorized group, B representation of three-factorized group, Factor is good. G is a representation of G size that size that terminal of lambda intersecting K C intersected terminal of rho bar intersecting K. D is a normal sublime G. This is not strange. This is very natural. And so this. And so this is a B representation of three factorial. So if we have a brace representation, we have a B representation of three-factor group. Because if we have a B representation, I don't have time to enter into details, but we consider, we can assume that. We can assume that the kernel of rho is one and have a vector, the vector space, which is associated with the vertex representation. And so we consider the individual module from K. This is a K module because we have a representation with space B, a K and a F k module. Module and we consider the tensor product of AK B and it's just a direct sum of C vector D with C and C and the action of G of these vector spaces is just equivalent to the action of the group on the On the left for classes, module K. And there is something like a vector space here, which is for every C, C times B L is F k momulus. And the action of K over this module, which is equivalent to the action. Module, which is equivalent to the action of k on B, is defined by beta. And then in this three-factor group, beta is a conjugation. I mean, we encode beta by means of the operation of conjugation of matrices. In fact, in fact, for every C, C, beta C can be identified with rho C rho C. rho C rho k rho c minus 1. This is a matrix computation, which is extremely nice. And the other way around, on the other way around, if I have a B representation of the factor gives, it's very easy to have a representation of the planes. And finally, in five minutes, I want to relate this definition with another one appearing in two papers. Now there is two in twenty twenty-two. 2022 in a paper of linear multilinear article considers modules for races of a million type and from this definition, Thomas, which is there, and Ben Lamin study extracted definition, extending this two definitions. This two definition, and they define a complex hand representation, which is Penny in 2024. By the way, this is nice paper, as you know from the study that should cover some German decades. And in the section 4, this paper introduced a complex n representation of a phrase E. It's a pair from B plus T M C and beta B plus T L N C and satisfying. And satisfy for using the same notation for every x and y in P. This is rho x i minus x. This is beta x rho i beta x minus y. And this is, of course it makes sense that you can substitute C by anything. By any field here, and the relationships. What is the relationship between the two Liaturmi and Mentramian representation and the representation? Okay, if Rho-Bita is assumed during the dramatic presentation, there exists beta bar. There exists beta bar from C to the automatons to the rho from B such that rho beta satisfies just one. And unfortunately, the kernel is not an ideal. I mean, there is a And there is an example of a set L D representation in which the camera is not an ideal. So it's very difficult to get a brace structure inside. And the other way around. If beta and rho and beta is a semi representation, Semi-representation in our sense, I mean a pair of homomos, for instance, satisfying one, there exists a super Retro-Migrant Ramian representation rho eta eta plus of V such that. Such that turn of rho is just equal to the term of rho dash. And this is the relationship. I take also only one in more. Thank you very much. Any questions? One more question. So, support it as a brace, we now take the trivial place. We simply take a group here, embed it as a brace. If I don't understand correctly your definition, it is that a brace representation for a trivial place would be simple representation of a group together with an automorphism. So, there is also this paper of Kenny de Comer about consider a brace as a braided group, and you look at representations. When you look at representations in the graded monolithon sense. Yeah, so you instead of looking at a brace as the structure of a praise, you view it as a graded group. Now you can look at graded group. And you can look at graded representations. But my question was about the relation between representations that you get among the common spoken. Any other questions? Okay, so we'll thank Adolfo again. And then we meet back here at 11. And then that's a very interesting example. I said we need to press the buttons. It's no arms.
