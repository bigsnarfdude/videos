     Okay. So our thing is to is to put that. To prove, like was done in the number field, to prove that if we start by semi-simply, simply connected, but split group G1, which we know it has Tamugamba number 1, that then any inner form of that G1 also has Tamugamba number 1. For now, we show it only for quasi-split, which means. Quasi-split, which means the Borel group is defined over the base split. Okay? And if it's split in a form of a split group and it's quarter-split, then it's split. No, no, quality split. You do self-semi-slip of what is split. No, no, the Borel group is defined over the field, but a G, it's not split. It doesn't have to be split. I mean, if you say that it's in inner form. Yes. Yes, in inner form, which is not split, yes. Yes. An inner split group, right? Which is cosy split. Yes. In a form of split group. Doesn't have to be split. But you say it's cosy split. So if it's cosy split, an inner form of I mean that extension that defines the when I say quasi-split, I mean it splits over some Galway extension. I mean the torus. That will you will not be in inner form of a of a split group? Why not the split group? Why not the screen? Why not total? Because that that field extension that gives you it's an invariant of inner forms. It's the same for all inner forms. That extension that gives you, you know, this process clip phenomenon. Okay, but we'll put it. Okay, we will see example and you will tell me what's wrong in the example. Okay. So at any point. So at any prime P, this is now the conventional notations. We take OP to be the completion of the ring of integer of the localization at P. Kp is the fraction field of OP, GP is the geometric fiber, and PT is the Boatitz building associated to GP. Of course, GP, KP, the group of points. The group of points acts on the building. So, if we have a subgroup that stabilizes a non-empty bounded subset, then this group will be a compact subgroup and there exists a point in that building that is being fixed by this gamma. Okay, so until now it's what we know the fixed point turbo, which is true to any cat zero space. Katzero space and Guantitz gives us also the underlying group scheme which is smooth. So we denote it by automorphism of X, but the content is the group inside GP that stabilizes or fixes X. So it's generic fiber Its generic fiber is again GP, okay? But its group of points is our gamma, our compact subgroup. And if you start by taking some maximum torus in GP, okay, and you take a point in one apartment, I mean the apartment that is being associated to T, so Px belongs to some. So, X belongs to some chamber in this apartment. The neuron-ranod model of T gives you the compact subgroup of the storus. Again, it's a model. I mean, the generic fiber of this nice T is T. So the affine weight group is defined by this. Defined by this quadrant, which means that the first factor is the regular value group that acts like permutations, and the other factor is the cocarto lattice that translates any chamber to the all space. So, if we take the subgroup, the stabilized The subgroup that stabilizes X, then by using the group that stabilizes the O chamber, we may get the automorphism of X inside the G. I mean an alternative way to see that is working with lattices over OP. Okay? Any point at the building, the automorphism, at the group of points stabilizes some lattice. Lattice. For example, if we take the origin, so it's stabilized, just we can say the example, but we are running over the stabilizer by conjugation of the concarter, the generator of the lattice of the concarters, applied with the uniformizer locally everywhere. So let us see an example. Okay, so G is. Okay, so G is SL2 and Ï€ is the uniformizer. So the origin gives us the SL2OP, which is a stabilizer just of OP square. And if we take the co-character that generates this lattice and we put on the uniformizer, then we get another hyperspatial point in A point in another chamber which stabilizes this lattice. So this lattice corresponds to this. But we have jumped over one special point, which is that point. And this means that this lattice. So when we are talking about simply collected groups, then conjugating which always give you one Give you one point per jumper. Okay? So in this case, it's just infinite in lesson. So we jump over the even points. And now I claim, it's not on tomorrow, I mean it's easy to see that the group that corresponds to this automorphism is not split, and we considered is. And we considered it as an inner form of our split one. Because it becomes isomorphic to the split over some double-by extension of the group. So now if this, for example, in SL2 is a tree, so if we begin from the origin, a zero, and this is X, and this is X alpha. Half a fix, okay? So if you take the intersection of the two stabilizers, then you stabilize the O chamber and you get what we call Yora Hari group, which means that the reduction of that group over the residue field will be a Borel subgroup. Okay. So, at any prime p, we take our generic fiber at p and we extend it to some possible group scheme over all p, which is the pt1 corresponding to some point. Now, if we have started by the split one, of course we cannot extend it by choosing this point because it's not an extension, I mean, it doesn't contain it. Okay? Okay? So sometimes, and this is exactly what what the continuum of what Igo talked about, you have groups that do not have locally integrally model which is reductive. Okay, so this is such an example. I mean, if you take the group scheme here and detect the genetic fiber, I mean, you cannot start by. I mean, you cannot start by even points. It's just, okay? So you take some Boatitz scheme that extends locally everywhere. You get an infinite vector of such schemes. And when you look at the group of points, you get actually a compact subgroup of the Adelic group, which is U. Now, we wanted We wanted to compute the Tamagama number, which is applying the Tamagama measure on this quotient space. So we regard this quotient space as infinitely many orbits obtained by the action of this U by translation. Any U translates a corset that belongs to U. X is a vector and And you know, like in the Burnside lemma, instead of looking at the size of the orbits, we look at the size of you, okay, divided by the kernel. The kernel is this kernel, because if you are translating by element from here, you just remain the same. So this is the kernel of the action. So we are running over the all orbits, so we are running over the size of the acting group. Of the acting group, modulating the action. Now, the action differs, but it's always finite because you have a discrete book intersected with a compact one, so it's always finite. And in this way, you get a convergent service, and you are running over representative of these double cosets. I mean, of course, not over. Of course, not over classes, which may be infinitely many, but you're running over all distinct representatives of Wassets in Y. Okay, so remember that this is the way, one of the ways to compute the Thermodynamic number. Of course, this scalar can be put outside. Okay, so we have two things. We have this measure and this volume and this series. And this series. Okay. The Tamagana measure we are talking about is our measure. Of course, the multiplicative, R measure differs by some multiplication by some scalar, but it doesn't matter thanks to the product formula. So we normalize this measure, and actually, the volume of The volume of U is this factor G is the genus of the curve, and locally this is all the measures of the groups of points locally everywhere. Okay, so what is this omega P? Prassett has shown in the 70s that it's equal to 2 MP, I mean, if you took the reduction of the Boatids. Okay? So, in general, this GP doesn't have to be reductive, but it is paraoic. So, it admits a levy decomposition. So, you take only the levy part in the reduction, and you take the directional points of the residue field. Points of the residue field divided by the power of the number of elements in the residue field, which is this average. This average is actually the dimension of the parallelic group. Now, of course, if our GP is reductive, then MP remains the reduction of GP and all this is just this. And all this is just the GP, which is what you written here. And infinitely many places, this is the cases. I mean, at almost all places, this is the local volume. We may only have at some ramified places that indeed the fiber is not redacted. Sorry, by smooth. By GP or the the whole model of GB smooth. You don't really mean that the group scheme is smooth over the base. I mean, you just mean that the whole model is regular as a steam? No, no, I mean that the reduction is in a Jebrais group. But then what is the difference between... Oh, so you're saying reductive or not reductive? Yes, of course. It would be smooth, but not reductive. I mean, it can have unipotent. Absolutely factors. Okay, so that's kind of at the ramified crimes. Yes, it can be occur only at ramified places, yes. Okay, perfect. Okay, maybe I didn't say that, I don't remember. Yes, we are batching all these local models to get a global one over the generic common group. Okay. So, a G. So, a G torsus is, you know, it's a G set such that it depends on the topology, but with respect to that topology is locally trivial everywhere, which means that at every place, say et al., so you have an etal extension of the OP over which the action comes simply. The action comes simply positive. Another way to see it is that it has a rational isomorphism between the original G and that torsion. I mean, you can realize P as the isomorphism set between a G and another G. That we're gonna see that. Okay. We're going to see that. Okay. So, what is H1? It's the set of all G-torsus modulo isomorphism over O. By the way, I didn't say that, but when you take a G over O, okay, so it's not an affine scheme, it's locally affine, I mean, because it's projective curve. It's what we call a dedicated scheme. Okay, so. Okay, so uh due to misnevitch, okay, we see that this H1 in this case actually uh coincides with the genus. Okay, what is in general the genus of a group? The genus of the group is all torsions that being generically and locally over the integers trivial. Okay, so you may have in general such sources. Such sources that are generically trivial and locally average, but not trivial over O. But here, but here, this vanishes thanks to the fact that G is simply connected and K has no real places. I mean, other shown that. And this vanishes just because G is connected and smooth, so thanks to the length. Smooth so thanks to the length level. So we actually see that any total of G is what we call Zaritsky, which means that it belongs to the genus of G. And why would we like to say that? Okay, this is a very fundamental theorem. Back to Giraud. It says It says the following thing. If we are able to realize our book as an automorphism group of some form, then the torsions of this group correspond to this set. I mean, I don't want to call it, it's not in work, okay? For example, the more common example is that. Common example is that if you take, for example, the autogonal group, okay, so you can think about it as the group automorphism of some quoratic form. So any tosus of this autograph group will be the isomorphism from that Q to another Q type. Okay? Or another example: if X0 is the endomorphism of some vector space, so you get the classification. So, you get the classification of objective homogeneous spectrum. Okay, so our idea is to take any seven-sample group and to realize it as the automorphism of some vector of points in all places. In all places. I mean, locally everywhere, it's just our choice of the poitites that extends the generic fibers. Okay? Now, if we treat it like this, so every torso is isomorphism of this vector with another vector. Of course, pK is not empty because we said it's Zariski, so it has a rational point. So it has a rational point, the same over all of B. So if we combine, compose W inverse with Z, so Z takes from X0 to X and the inverse of W takes you back to X0. So the all elements belong to an alder group of G. And this is how you get a correspondence. You get a correspondence between the representative of these double cosets and torsors of G. Okay, I mean, every torsor gives rise to such a point and the other direction. So now we get another interpretation of the series that we have seen before. Why? Now we are using what we call Now we are using what we call stack. I'm not talking about generally about stacks, just about this stack that we use. This stack that you use, the Plushin stack, is a kind of sheaf. A sheaf of torses. I mean, when you apply this stack on some scheme over the base scheme, Over the base scheme, then you get the torsors defined over that scheme. For example, we are going to use this type of terms over FQ, which means that any algebra of Q, okay, if you're looking at the stuff over that R, you get all torses of G defined over this. Defined over this alpha. Okay, so we have seen that this double cosensor predentive corresponds to torsus. So it's actually this double that we have been talking about. Okay? Now, when we talk about the cardinality of such a shift, we mean that we take any point. any point and we are computing is automorphism a group over that FQ what do I mean what is automorphism of a I mean y is another vector so when I write yx0 okay I mean the conjugation obtained by Y of this starting the point okay so this automorphism over FQ Over FQ is exactly what I say. I mean, it's the conjugation of our starting group, again, intersected with GK. Okay, so now we see that this, I mean, this is what we call twisted form. Okay, if the isomorphism is a tosser, so if you are looking the automorphism of yx0, Of yx0, you get the automorphism of, I mean, you get the group that stabilizes this new point. Okay? So when we saw before the series, it has now a new interpretation. In the last time, it was a series of all kernels of the action. Now it becomes a series of all. Becomes a series of automorphism group of the torsors that we have running over the apartment. I mean we have started from some apartment at some point and we are running over all the apartment. So here we saw the omega u. So we can think about the Tamagamma number as the Gamma number as the cardinality. I mean, cardinality, we are not expecting here to have some integer. I mean, that doesn't count the number of elements in the set. It's just this. This is called the currentity of coup width. So it's just this factor with the volume of u. And why would we like to interpret it like the cavali of a stack? Because we have the trace formula. The trace formula, I mean, the version of stats by your hand. Okay, so we want to see an example. Okay. How much time do I have? Until. 105, so you have 20 minutes. Okay, so let us see an example, okay? It's a little hard, apparently. Hard apparently to pass over all the torsus. So, what is this is a technique that we can use since G is simply connected. Okay, if we take one place in which G is isotropic, and there must be such place, thanks to the density turbo, and you look at this coset, then you did a strong approximation term, it covers. Approximation term, it covers all GA. So instead of running over this quotient space, you can run over this same quotient space, but now due to the second isomerism thermal, it becomes a module of this intersection. Now, what is this intersection? Is all elements of G over K that are being irregular everywhere except for at B. This is what From at P. This is what we call NP being regular everywhere except for at P. So it is exactly our integral model applied to this O B. What is this OB? With the brackets, this is exactly all elements of K that are being regular everywhere except for at P. So it's So it's more simpler to run over this representative. So again, we have to mode U to get the original Y. That is an example how we do it. Okay, so we start by SL two over over uh over K and we choose this infinite point, okay? Point, okay? And so the elements of k being regular everywhere except for at this point are just the polynomial ring. So if we want to think about the automorphism at some point, so in the origin is just SL2 over FQ, which is this number of rational points, but if we conjugate it with the But if we conjugate it with the choral capture applied with the uniformizer, then you get this group. But if you want to intersect it with the ring at infinity, then this must vanish and you get this must be zero. So here again you have q minus one, but here you can have a polynomial of degree uh two. Of degree two, so you have more points. So if you are running in this way over all the lacing, but jumping over only even places, okay, this is what is too high, then you get, and this is the commonality of the stock. You get this number. And if you are computing the measure of u, you get now, of course, you are running over. Now, of course, you are running over any possible residue field. It depends on the degree of the generating polynomial. You get what we call the zeta-Riemann, the Zeta function at 2, and again it becomes 1. So, this is an example of the split simply connected group. Okay, this is an example of the simply connected group. Of a simply connected, not split. Okay? You start by quadratic form, which is this one. We assume that the finite field is of characteristic free, so it doesn't have the root of minus one. So the Clifford algebra of this quadratic form is generated by these elements. And if you take a general element generated by these matrices and you compute And you compute the reduced norm, you get that the kernel, which is the spin group, is actually this group. Now, remember the lecture of Ego today, he told us that this group is reductive if and only if the coefficients of the variable are invertible and t is not invertible. So, this is an example, okay, that locale is not reductive. We have this. We have this additive group square, which is unipotent. Okay, so this is a non-split group, which occurs to be also because we took the dramifies, it's also not reductive. In general, non-split doesn't have to be non-reductive, but in this place, yes. But if we take an extension which is of staloity, An extension which is of stalau. This is a letal extension. Okay, you add the I, so you get isomorphism with S and 2, which of course is political. Okay, so how do we get to inner forms? Okay, take your simply connected group and look at the adjoint. This is the center. So the adjoint group Group is identified with the inner automorphism of G1. And you get a long exact sequence. This is all local, okay? But it's the same thing over the global also. So this vanishes because of G1 is simply connected. This vanishes thanks to the fact that K, that G1 is what we call of the Way type. Okay? So we have. Okay, so we actually get this isomorphism that locally is the isomorphism of a finite abelian group. For example, if our G1 before the adjoint of G1 was SL2, then the center is mu n, and so H2 will be just the n-torsion part of the bra group, which is fine, I think. Okay, so any element here corresponds. Any element here corresponds to an inner form of G1. And for example, if you start by SLN, you will have N isomorphism classes of such inner forms that are all quadratic splits. Okay? And so this is the local stack. And the reason why we interpreted all this stack by All this stack by the trace formula is because the trace formula is a product of all traces formula locally everywhere. So now we may concentrate on the local case. We claim, and this is our main claim, that locally everywhere the defect of the volume, remember that you have to go down to the To go down to the levy structure is compensated by the difference of the stacks. Why? Because if you take the reductive part in the case which is not reductive, so you get if you take the reductive part, the Levy subgroup, so you get a stabilizer of a larger dimension. Of a larger dimension facet in the building. So now you are stabilizing more points than your simply connected, which was split. So the kernel in the stacks actually compensate the deformation of the volume and locally everywhere it becomes one. I mean the ratio of these two elements. Okay? Okay, this is what I said. So we actually, if we go down, this is the simply connected and this is the powerhouse, but we take the reduction. So in the reduction, some of the entries vanishes, okay? So uh you get a a lower dimension group than your original uh G one, okay. A G1, okay, and this portion is nothing but a Grassmannian. So we can think of the kernel of the stats by the same trace formula obtained on this Grassmannian. Okay, so this is what we have seen, the cardinality, it's decomposed to the cardinality everywhere. So now we have to concentrate only on the We have to concentrate only on the places where the splitting extension splits and places where G1 or G is not reductive. So we know due to the right ish, right and we know that the kernel of these two stacks, since it is this one, it's decomposed this to this. This to this formula. Okay? So this is the added. I mean, everywhere when it splits, when the reduction is reductive, so you don't have this factor. This is the kernel that becomes when you go down to the levy subgroup. Okay. So, how do we? So, how do we show that? I mean, finally, what do we want to show? That locally everywhere, this ratio of the measures equals to the trace formula applied to the kernel of the stacks. This is what we want. And the kernel of the stacks is this Grand Magnet. Okay? So instead of looking at X plus, X plus was model the Paroic. We were looking at something greater. We're looking at something greater, modulo the Levi-Sa group, and the difference between the two in the level of the rational points is as structure of unipotent groups. I mean, X of force is not even a group, it's a homogeneous space, but we can apply common logic to this exact sequence. And actually, I think. I think the most important idea of our approach is this one. That locally everywhere, the ratio between the two volumes is exactly the trace formula applied to the kernel of the stocks. And this is one. I mean, this modulo, this is one everywhere. So you must get the gamma number the same. Thamma gamma number the same. Okay? Let us see an example. Ah, how do you compute the trace? I mean, because the four values is the generator of the Galois extension, so it acts on these vector spaces. These vector spaces, I mean, your Grassmannian is decomposed. Garstmania is decomposed into sugar cells. Every sugar cell is dimension, is the length of the word that gives rise to the cell by this decomposition. There it doesn't have to be B, already can be P. So the dimension of such H2I is what we call the Betty number. So actually we want to show that the ratio of the measure That the ratio of the measure is that polynomial. Because the Frobenius can be realized as a matrix, as a symplectic matrix multiplied with Q of the power of I. So we want to show that the ratio of the omega, I mean we want to see an example, okay, is equal to this polynomial. So let us see an example. Yes, this is an example. This is an example. We start at the origin. At the origin we have just SN2. Now we go to this point, which is in the middle of the chamber. No, it is the over edge of the chamber. And we get something that is not split. We take only the reductive part. And this is a known tomus. The number of elements. The number of elements in the norm to us is q plus 1. The dimension of x plus is 1. So you get that this is not 1 at this place because it's not reductive. So you have this factor. But in the other end, if you compute the trace applied to the action of the Forbenius on this, when we bullet all the dimensions, okay? All the dimensions, okay, you get actually this the same polynomial. Why? Because for the ID, the length is zero, so the dimension is zero, it's just the point, so it doesn't do anything. But if you take the swapping, then the trace is minus one and you get that the same polynomial. Another example of SL3, again, you SN3, again, you conjugate by this co-character. Remember that the two groups, the two inner forms, maybe this is what you meant, have the same building. Because if you tensure with R, I mean the Poke Authors differ by some finite index. If you tensor with R, the same building, only points are different. So if you conjugate, you get not in You get now in SL3, you have this three angle. So, if you look at one chamber, suppose this is the origin, so this X corresponds to this special vector is a vector that is stabilizer is the all well group. Okay, and this is what we call. And this is what we call X, and this we call Y. Okay, this is Y, this is the combination of the core characters, E23 is lambda 2 minus lambda 3. Then these two schemes are not reductive. Okay? Which means that if you take the reduction, the reduction we get a norm tobus multiplies with some unipotent group. And again, if we compare between Again, if we compare between the ratio of the measures, you get here, I mean, SL3 is just all this. And NK, in this case of two-dimensional norm togus, okay, is this number. 3 is the dimension of the Dasmannian. Dausmannion, you know, it's a variety that its point corresponds to change of inclusion of the... To change of inclusion of the vector spaces. So you get this polynomial. And if you go, this is in the level of the measures, if you go to the Jasmine, so these are the subspaces that you get. The Schubert cell. So you can see that this is one-dimensional because these are just the basic elements. Are just the basic elements in the trial group, but these are of length two, so this is two-dimensional. And if you rotate your triangular, you get trace minus one. This is like rotating in 120 angles. Okay, degree. And you get exactly the same polynomial as. Polynomial as in this case. Okay, so this is the paper that I was talking about. It was published in 2015. It uses this technique, okay, but it relies on the It relies on the well conjecture that was proven in that time, but it computes the Damma-Gamma number of any semi-symbol with respect to its universal copy being simply connected. So now our goal is to use, I mean, without relying on the wave connector, using the same technique. Connector using the same technique to show that the well conjecture. But I have something to say. Of course, this is limited the usage of the building of the quadits to the quasi-split. It doesn't cover the case of non-quasi-splits. I have still time. Now it's time for questions. Okay, now it's time for a question. Okay. So may I ask a general question? So as far as I understand, the general goal, the strategy, is to get a new proof, say, a web conjecture in this setup. Top going through this equality for Tamagella numbers. So, my question is: draw also results of Harder himself regarding anisotropic case function fields set up. Is it somehow independent, so I do not see how can you reach an isotropic case along this way? Along this way. You don't have. You don't have. So that's not your goal? No, no, you don't have. You start from this point and you shift it to this new group. So you do not want to revisit Harper's proof of anisotropic case because I may, but you see, I I passed over also the the the the the proof of of uh Gilz Grubby in Ruby and also of Rosengalten. And also for Rosengarten, they are not using this idea of local buildings. So I think it's very interesting to see the impacts of the non-being reductive. I want to say 12 years ago, you know, in my PhD, I used the book of Professor Rapinchuk with Pratonov, so I asked him a question in the mail. So he answered me. So he answered me and more than that he contacted me with Ralph Cole, you remember? And from this we have been publishing some papers and this became so I want to thank you because you know sometimes a little connection may be I mean produce over connections and so thank you Any other question? Okay, let's next run the account. If we have a coffee break now, we reconvene at 3:45.
