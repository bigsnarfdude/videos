Thank you, Martin. Thank you for the invitation. It's kind of sad that I couldn't actually visit there physically because of visa issues, but okay, we will survive with this. So this talk is doing work on the recent paper with Sophia. It's not so recent anymore, but okay. Still recent. So the main result that I want to talk about today, I hope you can see my screen there, Nadia. I hope you can see my screen. There may be a little bit of lag though. That's just okay. I hope. Yeah. So it's a little bit hard to hear you. I don't know if you can turn up the volume or. Do you want me to turn up my camera so that you hear me better? No, I think it's just the volume. Okay. Okay, that may be, I can try to increase. Okay, that may be I can try to increase my microphone volume. Let's see. Is it better now? We'll ask if we can, if we need a breathing. Please go ahead. Okay. I'll just try to speak more loudly. That may be better. Hopefully, okay. So, let's start with. Um, we will be working mostly about fields of positive characteristics, so that's why they were supposed to be a save in here and ordinary in here, but let's keep them a little bit aside. So, we are working over scales which are algebraically closed, and we have characteristic scales, it's some prime. Case it's some prime number greater than three. So all things are going to be greater than five. So I will be avoiding characteristic two and three essentially. And then the names I'll say is that you have twisted Sorian high partners x alpha. So x being a case is a case over the k and alpha being an element in the power group of x we have We have T, so this may be same, twisted, oh yeah, okay, partners, and this is just basically the set, you know, or we can put here, you want the cardinality set essentially, y comma beta. So this is here, so y is a sequence of this. T precise again over the C, and beta is the brower element in the Brower slide and Fourier mocha. So they are Fourier Mocha partners, that means the derived categories of twisted sheets. They are isomorphic, the set up to isomorphism for such platinum want its third dynamic. Vortics certain energy. This is finite. Also, there was one more condition important. C does not divide order of alpha in order of beta. Okay. And every touch by, beta is actually a force. Actually, a course model I say of table sheet actually in some cases table twisted sheets on it. Okay, so once you look at this result in itself, it could feel a bit bizarre, like what we are trying to do here. To do here. But essentially, what they're trying to do is trying to classify what kind of objects are going to be derived keepable and but the derived categories are slightly different than what they're usually used to of not just four and sheets but you know sheets which are only or objects which are only sheaved up to a whole cycle hidden by the browser class and so they are two pitch sheets essentially And so they are two situations essentially. So we're going to come back to introducing all the objects in this result slightly later. I want to say another difference. So if you have something that is finite, we generally want to have a count for it. And obviously, the count here is not going to be very pretty. It's really ugly. So, but the sound that we get in this article is really under one more assumption of being ordinary. And in this today's talk, I will just never explain. Today's talk, I will just never explain what is ordinary because it usually gives me a lot of time to explain what is ordinary. So we will kind of go around it and discuss a bit of the two. So let X be an ordinary case in surface over K. It's a very special kind of surface. We'll talk a little bit later about it. And so usually we want alpha to be zero here. So we are taking not Here, so we are taking not the twisted one, but actually, the surface first is untwisted in itself, and then the count that we get is actually equal to the count of the geometric general factor of the canonical lift. So, this is a case which will face over field of Characteristic T, and what we show is we compare it to another statement surface which is over a field of characteristic zero. So this is here as characteristic zero and over characteristic zero we have because it's algebraically closed fields and if they are nice enough the ground is and under certain sardinality assumptions we can have you know the standard trick of Let's principle. Bloodshed principles and can think of them as comparing it with the count of x payloads. They change to complex number. And also, let me describe what this is. This is the geometric generic fiber of canonical X of X and now. And now, why did I actually compare it with something overseas is because overseas, you know, K-Recurfaces are very well studied and in that case you have far more control using Sorali theorem via lattice theory. And so you can get a very lattice theoretic formula, which will help you give a precise count. And actually, if you feed in the precise lattices for the KT species, you will actually know essentially the numbers. And while this formula is interesting and gives us Formula is interesting and gives us exact results because the phenomenon lift of an ordinary K-surface preserves its two pre-card lattice. And so once you have the pre-card lattice, then that's the most important lattice after the hot lattice inside the hot lattice, which actually controls your sounding formulas and so, or if you know, dual controls or the continental lattice essentially controls it. So we get really good actually really. Actually, really equality comes out of that part of this. And just you know, to shock you up if you are not away from the coffee, I will write a very ugly sounding formula. It's not mine, and sorry for the person saying it's an ugly formula, but it's just a bit too much latitude. So here's the formula theorem of mom. So for S, a projective He to surface over sea and he adds a transcendental lattice for F and then and as this is a neural several lattice that the discriminant we usually write like this and let me just write it as a forum side As a foreman, I set off isomorphism classes of cystic 2M type partners F dash alpha dash of F where alpha dash order of alpha dash is actually equals to V so this V equals V and And sorry, alpha dash belongs to Broward V dash. And then, okay, sorry, here's the formula. So, summation over certain kinds of objects which explain summation over. Summation over certain kind of lattices is for these lattices. We try to compute the number of hot isometries, not of the lattice M, but M is sort of lattice coming from the Z dash where T is the transcendental lattice corresponding to this element X. Okay. So it's really, ah, okay. I am liking to basically I am lucky to be very clear, but okay. And this group acts on another group of four isometries on the discriminant lattice. And then you have another group acting on this lattice M plus, you know, parallel times D for another kind of over lattice for the transcendental lattice and again a similar kind of formula. Your kind of formula. Okay, so let's ignore all these things and actually just show you where it runs over the set for watch C S C D and F so in something these are the set of already it's very very lattice corruption And results are coming out of soda if you want to see isotropic discriminant. That's the last thing I'm going to write into technical detail. That's basically. Okay, so yeah, even though there are a few unexplained terms in the formula, but I think it will not help anyone much, my discussion is further. So let's go back a little bit and start looking at what are the main players we are going to be interested in today. So we are interested in talking about case resources. So although I think everybody in the room knows what case resources are, but maybe, yeah, for the sake of completeness, I will. For the sake of completeness, I will quickly say for us what is the case this will say. Okay, we are acting for a software non-singular variety of dimension two. This will be the surface. Variety for us is separated, geometrically integral skin. So, geometrically, we don't care if they're overlaping those things, not care. Because yeah, if they're not, yeah, so inside that you know, canonical bundle is trivial and h1x or x is equals to zero. And also, any smooth proper surface is projective. And so, not really saying I want a projective surface, so it is like an algebraic variety. But over complex numbers, there do exist non-projective cases for cases. So, here's an algebraic example of a case. Here's my favorite example of a paper system. 46 X3 inside P3. This is patient setting. And as an example, since we will avoid characteristic two, this is a good example. Characteristic of the base will market for certain. Okay, so depending on the characteristic and the visibility of the characteristic model of force, the statement through phase in positive characteristics can be very interesting. So it can be either ordinary or supersonic. It just depends essentially on the characteristic. And so it's one of my favorite examples. Besides conditionality, like if it's one or four, it's. Like if it's one mod four, it's ordinary, and it's three mod four, it's uh super singular or alpha. Yeah, one mod four. Okay, and like we already saved on a few words about super singular, ordinary and finite spaces. The class that screens inside into green is a super similar one-way or one equivalent way to characterize this by saying it's. Way to characterize this by saying it's rank of the Picard lattice, the rank of Picard lattice or rho of X rank of neuron category of X is actually equal to 22. So this thing can never happen in over complex numbers. So the rank of T card group is always restricted to 20. And so they only exist in positive characters. On the other hand, On the other hand, you have everything which has rank figured rank less than 22 is either ordinary or finite height. Now, ordinary is a special kind of finite case resurface. Essentially, one way to think of this is looking at the action of the provenance on the crystalline cohomology. And once you look what is the dimension of certain rates of probinase action on the crystalline cohomology, you get F-isocrystallized. Homology: You get F is a physical structure and you decompose it, and then you look at the party, this is at dimension one, then it's ordinary, otherwise, it's finite height. And if it's zero, it's actually super singular, and that's one way of saying that 35 minus 22. Okay, so that was in words of how I think of ordinary T3. So, one way to look at this provincial action on CCE. So they're very special in certain sense, and I will talk about it a little later. But the other main player, so one was the first main player was KD Susan. Second main player we had is our rubber book of K Risus. So this is actually So, this is actually Brauer group of any two projective varieties will be given by the group of Agemeier algebras. These are algebra that locally look like matrix algebra. And so, essentially, we want to look at core and sheets, which are like matrix matrices, and then you want to collect them into isomorphism groups, and that's an interesting group. And then there is this result of growth in deep, which tells you that essentially, you know, you can classify all these actual isomorphisms. Lysomorphism looking at an ethyl hormonology by and all looking at the second homology with the TM. Okay, so it's usually quite a big group. So in certain cases, even though it's finite, it may become really very nice, but not always. It can be quite big. So over C for a case this curve, the Bravo move of X can actually be seen as, you know, it's just. Be seen as you know, it does this so what is the trans-damped lattice of x would be divisible group, or so actually, sorry, it's a divisible group, and this will actually be given by this time 22 minus rho of x. Okay, so it's quite quite big, okay. And now for any arbitrary closed field, so this is what we call usually. What we call usually, I think the type 2. Maybe I'm saying it wrong, but this is the inverse limit of all the L torsion elements, which is torsion other than the characteristic. So if characteristic of K is not equal to L. In that case, it looks like The vector 22 minus 0 of x again of this form, but just notice one thing. So, in case you have a super singular case, you should say, so then rho of x is actually 22. So, this part actually vanishes. So, you only have something like p elements in the group or only p torsion elements in the in the bra groups. In the brow groups, it's always the torsion group. But for super simplicity, this is purely a p-torsion group. But for us, when we are working over ordinary or any finite high-psych, there's always all these same torsion groups. So we can actually indeed talk about same twisted OEM high-to-signers. Otherwise, you know, it will be an empty set and it will be nothing interesting to talk about. So we do have a lot of same classes. A lot of same classes. Actually, in general, I don't think I know what the grower group feet posterian looks like for ordinary KTV. Maybe somebody knows. I don't know. So actually for a super similar KT surface, so I can show that the browser loop as an edited loop is just the base case. Okay. And so now let's come to the actual main director, which was The actual main direction, which is putting both the things together, and we have a twisted case with surface. Which for you is just a, does anyone have a question? We just declare x alpha, x indicates just as alpha is in the power group and. And to this, we would like to associate first a category of shapes, which are let's say a module category of objects which are not really shaped, but they will glue up to only certain cycles, and that cycle is given by alpha. So, that is the definition of way of thinking of twisted sheets, and then it comes to its derivative. And then you consider its derived category. And let's connect this to cheese. And I will say something else here as well in a minute. And let me give my interest and by me saying if it are the right Hate resources are said to be dwind equivalent if there exists exact linear volume dbx alpha to dy b. Just by beta, okay. So, for another pair, Y beta, um, which is also just tape the surface with this robot. Okay, so now you think of this, now it looks very unnatural the way I have introduced everything, but this is kind of very natural reason why we kind of think of such objects, and this is natural. Natural example of a with this state interface. Also from the main term, we would get a hint of what kind of natural examples they're looking at. And these are modernized phase of table streets. Okay, for some generic some generic so when i say generic this ample time man also this one will determine the stability conditions generic introduce non-emptiness be a primitive okay so primitive sort of these typical versus non-stable culture with these so the This for the dimension. So, it is conditioned on the move high vector. This is a K3 surface. So, this model I space will turn out to be a K3 surface under some extra conditions on the Musai vector will turn out to be a fine moduli space. And once we have a fine moduli space, we have a result of revolution also telling us that now they are. Also, telling us that now they are positive characteristics. Also, before that, I think by Orlo in characteristic zero that, you know, this will give you derived equivalences. And so these are naturally derived equivalent things. So you have universal case, we have a fine modelized space, the universal sheet gives you a derived equivalent. So we have a divide like this. So, however, in general, you know, these modelized space need not be a fine modelized space, and you don't have anymore a universal bundle to give you the desired equivalence. But what we have, the obstruction to the existence of the universal family is actually encoded in the drawback lab. Okay, so obstruction to Fashion to university family is a power class belonging to our group. And actually, in that case, a twisted universal shape exists. Okay. So then a twisted universal shape like this. And so with that, taking that twisted universal shape as an object, you know, in the foreground of I transform it. Know in the four-mochi transformers, the four-mofi kernels, we can construct a twisted derivative of the length of this form. All right, and so this twisted universal shape because this direction, okay. So, that was sometimes a natural way that you have. A natural way that you have modelized phases which give you very natural objects to study for their derived length and data categories. Now, let me rephrase how we look at the moduli faces. And so in general, I think most of the people in the room don't like to look at them as moduli faces and they prefer to look at them as a modelite fact. And so, in general, once you have a pair x alpha, we will also not look at it as a disjoint pair, but rather than we can associate it to it a zero. So we can have, because now, yeah, still job x over x for because this alpha belongs to die, and we have we know that we classify g and g. By gender over X. Okay, what is a gender? So let's just consider it as a fact with a property that it's automorphism to all things. So you can consider it. So you can consider a stack as something which is a space with such that each point has an automorphism group attached. So usually on topological spaces, you don't put automorphism groups on the point, but for text, you can go to the point, but automorphisms for each point at once. You have automorphism groups, which are all the same for all the points. All the same for all the points, then you get a jerk. So it's not true that always the job will be sort of trivial. A true example of a trivial job is DGM, which essentially, if you look at just over the three things, is just a point with automotive group given to M. Like locally every job looks like it's like just this topological space multiplied by this. Like this in some way, it has the locally figured structure, but globally, it will not have a figure structure. Anybody has a question? And so, examples that we will be mostly interested in is the modelized type of table of sheets, which will come back to V. Cheese within time x v over its coarse modelized case or the sine modelized state. So you can very easily tell if it's coarse or fine by just telling if the zero is trivial or not. So zero is trivial, so you can only if this is time model like this. Okay. And now let's connect over from here to here. And so now over this journey. And so now over this term, we start looking at the category of co-want sheets. So now we are looking at the co-want sheets over the stack. And this category usually, okay, so looking for JMG, can be decomposed using the characters. And so for these characters, for the representation, so this is slightly characters. Um, are not the characters of the representation as in representation of finite group, but these are as bright group characters, and so you can decompose this by add a character, which are given by since we are considering g and g index by D and for other corresponding chip is the result of I think down lit later. I know it's written in the max PHD list, so we will find there. We will find there. So, this is actually, I do not wish to, for us, what we will call the sheets corresponding to index minus one or one if you want to be one. For alpha, it's like one twisted sheet. Okay. All right. So, this comes with the decomposition of the category by characteristics of channels. Correct with stem. So, this is a natural relation of the derived categories that we would be interested in. And I don't link them in the notation quite frequently, but mostly the work we're working on is using the selling object because they are, at least I find them much more lighter to handle than doing things. Okay. All right. all right so now let's go we had introduced almost all the main directors of what we wanted let's go back and look sorry uh the theorem yeah also introduced you to the model life sensors and now all we'd like to see how we go about proving such a result or talking about what's happening in the season behind so usually when we have such a result in characteristic This will result in characteristic zero. The main ingredient of the proof goes into sort of also similar to characteristic C in deformation theory. And there's a deformation. So this was a result which was proved by a similar result of like Yokofa and then extended by Marbrash Stellari to do cultural conjecture. And there we actually look not at the pistol sheet on the girl or The jerk are but we just go and look at them as untwisted shapes and browsers available by season. So that is quite a different style of working for your shogun. But in characteristic C, we will start off build over the work which has happened in characteristic zero. As you know, it's kind of handy for us. So yeah, characteristic team Main ingredients of the tool. So the main idea always is to define or lift the problem to characteristic zero and essentially go even further and work over C use Torelli. So mostly that's the most important tool we have. That's the most important tool we have, and why we can actually do this is due to the results of Delhin. And in the untwisted cases, this is good enough, but the twisted ones we have to do a little bit worse. So every KT surface leads to characteristic zero. So it may not be necessary that it lifts to over the bit ring or the ring of bit vectors over the base piece, but it definitely will always lift over around the side, finite some side. Over a random size, finite random size exception of the reference. And for the example, the main problem that comes is like lifting super singular KP surfaces, they don't lift over the reflection and we randomize sections. Although for finite case surfaces, especially for ordinary KP surfaces, canonical lifts actually are lift over the weak rate. And so then you don't need to go to the grammar extension. You can lift over, sorry, to with width. Okay. And then And then there are some special kind of links which are very important, and you can only do these for finite high-knit use reflectors. This is the result of lead digit modeling. Select colour and see cards reserving list. So here you actually essentially lift your kisslet phase along with all the line buttons. Okay, so we lift missile phase with all its time manual. I mean quite clear why you can't do it for a super singular KP services with T CAD rank 22 because I mean in Kevin zero the TAD rank maximum is only 20. Because maximum is only 20. So not every line number is going to be anyway. So they only have to have this restriction of finite time. And a very, an example of such a list is a canonical list of ordinary cases, okay? So there were two different ways. So there were two different ways. So Nadia had also constructed such lists in one way and then another one was also given construction by Dali and Luzi to do this because of constructing canonical lids. And these lids are over the wing of the factors. So now we have lifted our case with CTONOMA which vectors and with all its land manual meaning. Lifting is land manual clean. Lifting is line bundles, which means you can at least lift ample line bundles, which means that if somebody's lifting your head to the surface, formally you can also algebraize it. So, growth and geek existence theorem requires you to have lists of line bundles so that you can algebraize it. And so that's an important reason why we are actually asking for listing of blind bundles. But six hyperbolting also comes important slightly later. So, now in case, now let's go to Now, let's go to question we can ask next. Dialogue is what about lifting the browser group on the browser class. Okay, so we will essentially just not try to leave the browser, we will just try to leave the browser class. And then there is a result of DR, which says that given a brower class, there's a tightness assumption coming in again. The tightness assumption coming in again would not be difficult by the characteristics. Then you can find, and on a case we're seeing, you can always find an Algony algebra representing that class which is unobstructed. Okay. So even though the listing of, you know, whatever you started with an Altamaya algebra for the drawer class was obstructed, you will always be able to find an unobstructed Alzheimer's algebra. Obstructed asthma angle, so you can lift power flash using an unobstructed run. And potentially, this is lifting off a covering sheet and before lifting all the line manuals, you can altruize your covering sheet on the lift. On the lip, and so it will actually give you an algebraic Bravo class on the algebraic lid. So, this here we have the tameness assumption. This is the result of what I'm using is the result of the long and it isn't right. Okay. Actually, if you want to just write down the short pick sequence for seeing how browser classes behave as well, if you actually notice that the browser classes are always trusted, and so we didn't have to do this filter, but we still wanted to have an algebraized for algebraization, one needed to have some control and this provided us the control. So again, Abhmaya algebra. To the end, I'm a editor. Okay. Um, so actually, what is more special about these lips are that these lips of the brow. That these bits of the Brawler classes are actually unique, okay? So you can observe more. It is actually very easy, algebra to observe that you know, lips of brower classes are unique. Everything is still working over a dance enough working of finite case surfaces. So for some particular case surfaces, the basic. Super particular cases also work of dandrax. Maybe you can ask him more questions about super singular cells. So now all we need to do is use characteristic tools to conclude the same whole characteristic key thing. So we have lifted the main people or the main thing, but now there are a few more things we would like to list. And so first thing we would like to list is also once we are trying to play. Once we are trying to play with modulized faces, you want to lift modulized faces as well. And from there, you have to also lift polarizations. And so, you know, you have to lift carefully your polarization. So this was also slightly tricky parts, but I think it's still not difficult. But the main important ingredient was lifting the desired equivalence also to characteristic zero. So that's where the main trust of argument lies that you want to lift to start with the direct equivalence. start with a graphic equivalence to db at on still and the level of zeros i don't care about this so you have the zero so your zero rate now very good but to characteristic zero but now what about the derived does it this object in derived category does that object actually look okay the program The program of the kernel. So does this mean clearly not everything is going to live to characteristic zero? And so you need only special kinds of Fourier methodic kernels or special kinds of derived digital lenses can be listed. And we are called them as filters to add digital lenses. So this was introduced by So this was introduced by E.D. Olsen. First India article on showing unfit case for the MOOC networks and showing that they are 5994 cadences. And this article just extended to the twisted case. It's not a very different argument, actually, essentially. They really are on the same thing. So the filter derives. lenses also you can extend filter directly to lenses to so filtered in the sense that it's commens just about it means it preserves some kind of situation of this how groups and so here of course you have to think about where you want to look at the tau group and this how it adds for the zero and that's that's not very difficult and you can also develop all the all the theory for this pretty easily with literature and characters Meet it and characters. So that's pretty much straightforward hard work. It already has a lot of ideas from work of diagnosis and also not so difficult, but the main idea of how you lift filters. So I can give you a sketch of this idea. Also, the main idea of how we lift such a direct lens is given as the formation of X. So essentially. A deformation of x. So essentially, what we want to do is given the deformation of x, you want to find a deformation of y. So, given the formation, you want to find the deformation of y such that you know this kernel can also be lifted along with it. But now you can actually reformulate this lifting problem. So, we reformulate the lifting question. By using actually listing not them as this object but objects inside another derived category. So in some sense, this is a fun way of looking at using derived categories in a way to play with right through a lenses rather than like an argument. Using modelized spaces of Faces of objects in the directory. So now you start by considering the model I stack of please consider modelized pack or twisted universally doable. Relatedly perfect complex block. So here I'm writing X two species, so it just means one piece of chase for us, and so once you also have the lift, so respectively, you can also look at okay. So this is the lift over the R, which is the algorithm of the weight end. Then the kernel pattern actually we give an object here. So this was the model as that. Okay, you think of this is how I denote the model like stack. So why? This you can embed pretty easily into this. Pretty easily into this act. Corresponding, so this corresponding to our morphism, this is you later. And now all you have to do is see that the lifting problem is essentially the existence of a morphism. The lifting problem is nothing but. This is all you need. It still has to show there exists such a morphism. And this actually essentially follows from the smoothness of the stacks. Smoothness of the facts, okay-modulized facts, and we have four modules. And now, the smoothness of the fact essentially really uses the fact that you're in dimension two. And I don't see how to get rid of the dimension two argument. I really wanted to come there and just start about getting rid of the dimension two argument, but okay. Then this uses smoothness of one like that. On underlying dimensions we do. And now all you need to do is just observe, finally, you know, packing everything together is now you have these zeros. So you put one in minus one in. V minus one in dv minus one m x vis more life tag and now this is a filtered derived equivalent and now you lift everything to character zero and then base change it to see assuming certain things on your base page and k but once you are over it gives you a filter derivative A filter derived which will end in characteristic zero, and then there is again the salt of it, which ultimately tells you that you know such a derivative will end comes from an isomorphism, and that isomorphism, well, essentially again just already gives you that every filter for your Mocha partner is again a modelized phase of filter sheet on the case with the state. So quickly, you can say when you use Tirelli to conclude that why is actually I don't think two. All right, and then also then you have to say above it's the generic side this is isomorphic, the fact is isomorphic, this is the result of sending a slide, this is the result of Max to Karman course. Result of maximum force, which essentially does the job for us. Okay, and so now, in this respect, one thing is very easy to observe is that it gives you the finiteness of four microwave partners, 24M of di partners coming out of the finiteness of 24M of Tipartinus interact with zero, but it doesn't give you exact thought because now you still have to show that the specialization matches are injective, okay, and for this. And for this reason, we need ordinary gauge resurfaces because you want to have a control over where your feet are, what things you are lifting, and you should be able to recognize what lifts you are playing with. And for canonical lips, in some sense, there is a result of planning the which allows us to recognize canonical lips from all the lifts of a catalyst, ordinary catrie surface, and it's a phoomological criteria. Cohomological criteria based on ethalcohomology, and so all you have to do is compare the ethalcohomologies of liquid A to C spaces and then see that the modelized phase is itself if a canonical lift of the mod of the modelized phase of shift this is again an ordinary K2 surface because high excess is derived from the analysis. And so you see the word in terms of The most important inducement here assumption becomes really important that it's an ordinary case of surface and the lips we are working with are canonical. And the thing that allows us to conclude injectivity of the specialization map is the fouriom of hyparteners. You know, it tells the fouriomy partners of XPK, relocate, and with monolithic. So inside it to me is the ability to recognize canonical text from all other things. All right, so this was kind of a sketch of a few. A sketch of a few of explaining how do we get this country from that. So let's, since I have a few more minutes left, I want to just end it by having something fun to discuss with the end. Maybe one of you really knows the answer to this question and just thinking about it. When we have this relation here, we're thinking of Relation here, we're thinking of everything we associated as GM0, and then we gave it as a natural example with the modelized faces. And then we showed that you know, if you are divided equivalent to something non-trivial, you are essentially a modalized face. Your jury is essentially a modelized phase of some kind of modelized space, but it's every jur modelized phase of you. So essentially, on a table surface, are these the only examples of The only examples of g and girds. So, one way to rephrase this question would be to ask if there are twisted statements with no non-trivial. So on the other hand, if you remove these twisted conditions, the answer is yet there are a lot of statements procedures which have no non-trivial for entire partners. There is this result of hardware in particular zero which says that for I can actually hybrid and set actually hybrid and stellari so this is theorem hybrid stellari say that for any n there exist n pairwise non-isomorphic algebraic Algebraic resources x1 to xn of picard number xi equals to 20. So larger the picard number vector than you have for untwisted casing surfaces that don't have any untwisted for unified patterns. So in this over twisted for twisted casing surfaces looking for twisted partners, you really have more of a you really have more Fourier mobile buttons than so endowed with rubber plus with alpha one to alpha n category such that no these divide categories from i equals to one to the n are all for real i For a high yeah so you can actually modify the argument we claim but to do this for all higher all three hydrangeas greater than eight so you know this argument can be modified to yeah but this argument still doesn't say that they're Will not exist sophisticated surface with no non-stream frame type buttons. Okay, so that's all for the thoughts that I have today. If you have some questions, remarks, comments, thoughts. Thank you very much. Questions? Questions? So for the super singular K3, twisted supersingular, if you can do the deformation in a two-step process. First deform, or at least in the classical case, we do it by first deforming to the ordinary, then deforming to characteristic zero. And do you get a statement on the? Statement and the count, maybe uh no, I don't think I understand your question. So you're asking for two particular cases. Is it because we from them to ordinary ones? Yes. Okay. I mean, do you get it? Do you get the cancer? Maybe I misunderstood. No, no, no, no, no. I am not doing this for super singular or anything. I'm just, are you asking that? Can we do this? Yes. Do this? Yeah. I think you can get an upper bound definitely on the numbers, but then there will be again a problem of understanding how the Fourier Buchai partners of the super singular KC surface depends on the deformation of the Fourier Buchai partners of the ordinary KC surface to which I deform. It's not obvious to me that they should be saying. Do you think they will be saying? Well, I was just asking the question. I don't know. Okay, no, I don't think I would say maybe Dan knows if he is here. He may be watching online. Anyway, okay, thank you. Other questions? Now, let's thank the speaker again. We resume at 10:30. I just have a question for you. Is there something else I can help with?  There's only two. No, I think that was always a problem. Anyways, I think it's first time first serves some. I'm just kidding. I mean, any one of us doesn't fan money or yeah. Oh, yeah, my mother's money is also. Yeah, it was. I tried. I can't hardly see the money. This is more like this. So we were sticking on doing models today. Oh, yeah. I mean, a lot of the music. Yeah, I saw pictures online. Actually, I saw his altar post an altar. Yeah. And I spoke the other altars of us. Did you care something on the riding of the trail? Because yeah, I was like, yeah, just slower. I think that's why I wonder if we can there are some of you. I've been looking at the microphones. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to look at that one because, yeah, I'm just wondering questions about the salt or balance. Okay, like what can I say about like other Do you have any idea of what could happen if it's okay? Yeah, sure, but I have a speculation. I think I may be able to answer this one about actual source of this data. Oh, yeah, I mean, I met it. Oh, yeah, I mean, I messed it up. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, Brendan posted this. Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. Oh, and so. I can chat about it. I mean, I think I'm working on the scene with John. Oh, well, there's going to be points.  That the other one is the card out of the board. Okay, and this result must recover into your interaction board. Yeah, there's something about the non-burying. I'll try to check if you're doing something. No, I mean, Brendan posted the question, and so I thought it was one voice. I mean, it occurred to me. I mean, it occurred to me as well. So, one thing that I was kind of putting, you know, I don't know, Sarah and I chatted with Brendan somewhere about this stuff. And one thing that I'm kind of interested in more about various results. What's fields that if you match them, you get You get if you have two of the surfaces, and they're going to have isomorphic associated lumber K3s derived equivalent over C. And you know, there's like a lot of theoretic proofs. And Stellari has a paper, like this is a little older now, where he actually finds the kernel, but he has to do like a divide it by two. Do like a dividing by two our group to find his kernel, and so it's uh you know, really algebraic closure is used. And uh, I mean, I never use um there's some of those. Oh, yeah, you can go to the So yeah, you can go to the colour stack and then yeah, I mean, so I think this is coming around with an interesting result, and especially since I are starting to prod around this question for the generalized cooperative, it would be nice to. Nice to us to understand what's in the one-dimensional case. So, I suppose criteria for the tourist maybe for figuring out.
