Ah, there we go. All right. Well, thanks. I appreciate the invitation to come and join you here. And it's always good to be one of the last talks after lunch, right before the coffee breaks. So hopefully I can keep you awake for the next half an hour before we can get to those crazy chocolate paneer things that I'm going to probably eat about 10 of before this meeting's over with. I'm going to come at things maybe from a different point of view. As you can tell, I work for a startup called Super Intelligence. I work for a startup called Jupiter Intelligence. So, I wanted to first just sort of talk a little bit about why companies like Jupiter exist and then go into sort of why extremes really matter for the things that we do. When you go to work for a startup, you'll hear a lot about things called like product market fit. It's a great phrase. It's usually the reason that people give for why startups fail because their product did not have a market. Not have a market. So, right off the bat here, I'm going to try to establish that there actually is a market. And I think this group probably already understands that. I don't have to probably tell you that climate change is a real thing, okay? And that the impacts are actually being felt right now, right? That's the one thing that maybe is a subtle difference. This is not some mid or end of century problem. We're actually seeing serious impacts of climate change today, right? This is a quote taken just from the latest IPCC report, came out recently. BCC report came out recently. You know, we are seeing these impacts across. There's a great graph that goes with this. It has all these negative signs everywhere, right? It's sort of, you know, human, animals, infrastructure, everything. We're sort of seeing these negative impacts of climate change. In the U.S., NOAA tracks billion-dollar disasters, right? It makes for a great graph, but a little scary in its own way because the number of billion-dollar disasters seems to be going up. So there's an So, there's an immediate cost to these to climate change. And it's also coming in some subtle ways that are a little even more scary than just the price tag. There was a White House blog recently that talked about the rising costs of weather extremes, and they were talking about a number of economic studies that were focused on, you know, the old paradigm was that when one of these bad things, like a tropical cyclone or a heat wave or something, happens, there's, you know what? Happens, there's an opportunity for society to sort of rebuild. And in many cases, they rebuild better, right? And then some studies have come out recently, for example, this one on tropical cyclones that actually sort of looked at long-term impacts of tropical cyclones on economic development in the local areas. And what they're finding is that old way of thinking is not actually the reality, that it's taking decades in some cases before the local areas are actually. Before the local areas are actually able to recover from events like large-scale tropical cyclones, which in a changing climate, where we're expecting maybe more of these things more frequently, more severe. That becomes a little bit challenging. Then a couple of things that I've noticed recently. There's a couple of us here from Colorado. This was an article in the Denver Post not too long ago, and I love the headline: with Colorado Getting Strange. Colorado getting strange. I would have said Colorado was strange a long time ago, but the article had a couple of key points. One, it said it was really focused on the way people were moving around during the pandemic, right? All of us left, right? Our businesses, our universities, and we could work from home. And many people use that as an excuse to go work somewhere else. But they weren't going places that they should be going. They were obviously going to the beaches. They were going to the mountains. They were going to these places where climate change is a real problem. Where climate change is a real problem. And so the point of this article was: people are moving the wrong way and they're not pricing climate risk correctly. And I think that's a common theme out of my talk today is it's this idea, can we price risk at where it should be? Went further in this article to talk about a Redfin study. Redfin is a real estate brokerage online. They did this A-B testing where you would go look at a property and they would show you a risk score for flooding. Score for flooding, you know, if you were in that group or if you were in this other group, they didn't show you the risk score. And they realized that people were doing very different things, you know, with that information. So their article, their disc was, we need more climate information so people can make decisions. Not just governments, right, but people who are, say, buying homes or buying properties can make the right decisions. This was reinforced to me anyway from an article that appeared in Nature Climate Change recently. Article that appeared in Nature Climate Change recently that talked about the overvaluation in the U.S. housing market, an overvaluation of $200 billion. That's no small amount of money. And a lot of this was basically driven by the fact they were not valuing flood risk correctly. So, you know, Florida, for example, pops out on a map of what's going on here because they're not evaluating the flood risk. And the point was, is this isn't like the normal up. Was this isn't like the normal ups and downs of property values, you know, with economic swings? There's a real fear that these property values might be or declines in property values that this bubble burst might be permanent, right? And think of an extreme case, that million dollar vacation home you just bought on a beach somewhere is no longer habitable, sorry, because it's underwater, right? So there's a real fear that these values, this bubble isn't going. This bubble isn't going to just sort of be some up and down. And again, citing the need for more and more accurate, more accessible information about climate risk. All right, so that brings us to why companies like Jupiter exist. And it all is really similar to kind of what happened in weather services maybe a decade or two ago. It was a quick realization that National Weather Services were supplying a product, but it really wasn't meeting. Product, but it really wasn't meeting many customers' needs. You know, they did a great job at telling us, you know, what the weather tomorrow would be and severe storm warnings and things like that. But if you were in shipping, for example, you needed more detailed, more accurate information about what was going on with the weather. And this whole industry came up about dealing with really super high-resolution weather forecasts. And you're starting to see the same thing now in climate services. There's a realization that, yeah, sure, there's a lot. That, yeah, sure, there's a lot of publicly available climate data, right? If you're willing to go download, you know, the CMIP-6 data that you need and wade through it and get all of that, maybe you can make some decisions. But anyway, there's this industry that's evolving that really is an offshoot, I think, or an extension of the ton of work that's been done in climate impacts anyway. I'll call it climate risk analytics. It's basically just quantifying how the risks might be changing. Might be changing with various climate change scenarios. And that might be risk from flood, it might be risk from heat. We saw a great talk just now on heat, might be talking about fire, whatever it might be. And this is oftentimes broken down into thinking about physical risk, which is literally, you know, is my warehouse going to flood or is my house going to burn down, you know, to transition risk, which is, you know, thinking about, you know, what, what, how are things going? What, what, how are things going to change as you move your company or your industry to a carbon-free economy, right? So, if you're in shipping and you're used to having diesel trucks moving product around, what's going to happen when suddenly that has to be battery-powered trucks or things like that? So, there's cost, there's risk involved with that kind of transition. Jupiter, I got one obligatory slide. I promise there won't be much here, but basically, the products that we provide, a bunch. Basically, the products that we provide, a bunch of different perils, and the gist is that this is a huge downscaling effort to try to get climate risk information at a facility level resolution, right? So people can do portfolio analysis. Many of our customers have broad swaths of properties in different ways, and they want to say something about what's the risk of that portfolio over time. I put this up here. This is again more Jupiter marketing stuff, but it's kind of interesting because it was trying to talk about how customers think about maturity in their use of climate data. I have it here more to talk about use cases, and I know there's no way you can read this, but you might think of a really simple use case as climate disclosures. There's more of a push with, say, the EU leading the way with the TCFD task force for climate-related disclosures. Climate-related disclosures about companies, banks, et cetera, actually disclosing their climate risk in their annual reports. And we'll see an example of that in a minute. You know, all the way up to thinking about risk analysis, resilience planning, you know, you have that warehouse in a port city. What are you going to do to harden that site against flooding? All the way up to supply chain analysis, right? During COVID, I think I'd never heard of supply chaining really before COVID. And now everybody uses supply chain. COVID. And now everybody uses supply chain for why they don't have whatever product you want to buy. But you're also talking about it in terms of supply chain risk from climate change, right? Again, is a flood going to wipe out your manufacturing facility or that distribution center that you have? All right, so as I said, a lot of this is about really at its heart is a giant downscaling exercise, right? So we start with climate models, core scale climate models, and we simply think about. And we simply think about how do we correct for bias, which I'm not going to talk about today, but that's a huge part of it. Climate models are inherently biased in some form. But how do we get from, say, this scale, which in many cases might not be usable to this scale, right? I used to use the example that I live on the Front Range outside of Boulder, Colorado, and my favorite ski resort is Breckenridge. It's 90 miles away. Really, really different climates. You know, the Front Range is fairly, fairly arid. The Front Range is fairly arid. 90 miles out up in the mountains, it's snowy and in a high alpine environment. But that's well within one grid box from a climate model, right? So if you work for Vale Resorts and you're sort of thinking about snowpack and water management, you're going to need very different information than, say, a farmer who's on the front range and talking about irrigating their crops, right? So Down Stanley becomes really, really important because of this, just this misery. Really important because of this, just this mismatch between the information you can get from the climate models into whatever application that you have. Doug probably remembers this picture because I made it, I don't know how many, what, 15 years or so ago, but talks about downscaling versus regional climate models, right? Dynamic downscaling. So it simply takes the output of a global climate model and runs it through, or actually uses the boundaries from that climate model. Boundaries from that climate model on the coarse scale to run a model on the finer scale in order to get higher resolution information. So, think of a process where every day, right, an image is coming out of the global climate model and the regional climate model is taking it to run higher resolution stuff. A lot of people like these because they're based on physical principles, but they're computational and they have all kinds of biases, and there's a million problems that. Biases, and there's a million problems. That I already see Michael back there sort of shaking his head. You can also think about statistical downscaling, which is a different way of thinking about it. It's still sort of taking the same map. Only now you need a training set of coarse scale mapping to fine scale. Plug in your favorite statistical or machine learning model to do downscaling, and you name it. Everything's been tried here. But it basically is sort of doing. But it basically is sort of doing the same thing. Every day, you're getting an image, running it through the downscaler, and you're getting a higher resolution output that then can be run through your favorite hydrologic model or your favorite other impact-focused model. That's kind of the focus of many top-down analyses that sort of start with the climate model output, look at downscale climate model output, and then try to figure out what the impacts are, say, on your location. As opposed to, say, As opposed to, say, a bottom-up analysis, which is taking looking at your vulnerability and then mapping that onto climate. So, you might think of this type of analysis that's sort of outlined here. You know, if you're a farmer and you have a bunch of fields, you take the downscaled output and you sort of say, well, this field is going to get hotter and wetter. This field over here is going to get drier. The bottom-up analysis might be something like where a farmer goes back in time and sort of says, on this field, if temperature goes. If temperature goes above this level, my yields go down by so many bushels. And then I look for see what the likelihood of that event is going to happen in the future. All right, so we take a slightly different view of downscaling. It really, if you want to think about it, looks maybe complicated, maybe it doesn't look complicated. It's really an extension of, say, the hierarchical model that Raphael pointed, you know, wrote down this morning, right? So we're going to just take a bunch of output from We're gonna just take a bunch of output from GCMs. We're gonna do some bias correction, then we're gonna do some downscaling and then move along the pipeline. The difference here is that we're just gonna downscale sort of the distributions that we get that are fit to the individual data. So we're gonna fit, say, a bunch of GEVs to observations. Then we're gonna fit a bunch of GEVs, say, to core scale, RFI, reanalysis data, and then we're gonna try to build that hierarchical model that Rafael did. That Raphael did, but not nearly as elegantly, but probably with a whole lot more data. So, we might imagine taking as many precipitation observations as we can get our hands on. In this case, we grabbed about 40,000 observations from different sources, including the GHCN. And for each one of these observations, after a bunch of data checks, the data engineering is pretty extensive. We fit basically a GAV to that distribution. And that becomes our Distribution and that becomes our target. So each one of those GEVs at every observation is matched up to a GEV that's associated with an R5 grid box. Okay. And all we've really done now is set up a big supervised learning problem. Okay, so basically at this point, you can just plug in your favorite machine learning model, your favorite regression model, whatever you want. In this case, we toyed around with a lot of different versions of linear regression, a lot of different sorts. Regression, a lot of different sort of tree-based boosted methods, some voting methods, and so on, a lot of different ways to put this together. At the end of the day, the final approach that we use is sort of taking Doug's idea that he posted earlier about the observation to break things into sort of the spatial process plus everything that was left over into sort of extending that a little bit into a large scale component, a smaller scale component, and everything that was left. Scale component and everything that was left over. So the large-scale component was sort of a regression-based thing that mapped sort of the ARI5 GEV information to the observation-based GEV information. And the gradient boosting algorithm then looks at the residuals to try to bring in finer scale spatial information from that to try to give something that makes some sense. Some quick results of what something like an approach like that might look like. Approach like that might look like, you know, and we're focusing now again, we're not really focusing on the daily output, we're focusing on what happens on the extremes because we're going to pull metrics off of those distributions. So here we have what the Red Sea and the number of days above 38 Celsius going from the raw reanalysis to basically the downscaled efforts. 100 year, 100, 100-year one-day precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and really dealing with all the crazy. Dealing with all the crazy topography up there, and then maybe like wind speeds over the British Isles, same idea. All of these use basically the same kind of approach, different predictors, of course, but the same basic, basic ideas. A lot of people want to know how people are using this information. I don't know how easy this is to see, but this is AstraZeneca's latest TCFD report, their latest climate disclosure report. Uh, climate disclosure report, and they took. Let's see what I can see here: a whole bunch of their locations. They did a really detailed analysis on their climate risk. These are manufacturing locations, distribution centers, R ⁇ D, whatever. And they basically took a bunch of our data and labeled it in terms of different kinds of climate risk. This one might be, I have all kinds of problems with this one, but might be a little more interesting. They're looking at supply chain. So this is. They're looking at supply chain. So, these are supply chain locations, nodes on supply chains for 10 different of their of their medical products, right? 10 different drugs. And on the x-axis is a measure of their present-day climate risk, if you will. And on the y-axis is how that risk might change in the next few decades. And so, you know, they've color-coded it by different levels of risk, but you probably don't want to have this. But you probably don't want to have facilities up here, or if you do have facilities up in this quadrant, you want to build a different kind of resiliency plan than maybe things that you have down here. A different way of thinking about it and moving up that ladder we looked at earlier is about adaptation strategies. This is a partner of ours called GuideHouse. They work in the utility sector. This is a hypothetical situation where they Where they took a facility or a hypothetical facility and they looked at their transmission structure, substations, distribution poles, identified what those risks were to say flood, wind, and heat, what potential losses might be. But really, it's kind of interesting to come over here and say what, you know, how would you build some sort of adaptation measures on that based on the information that they had? Can't really read it here, but some of them are sort of silly, like move. Some of them are sort of silly, like move your distribution poles if they're in a place where there's a problem. Or buy different equipment if heat stress is an issue. But it's at least trying to get companies to sort of thinking about what this would really cost. All right. Yeah. We've been a lot of GAVs, and I don't want to dwell on this here, but I sort of really have more of a hate-hate relationship with the GAV. A hate-hate relationship with the GEV. This is an example where actually it worked out and worked well. Here's a bunch of GEV fits to basically this is an input to a flood product for global flooding. And what we have here, this is a bunch of locations around the world. This is taken from something called global tide and surge reanalysis data. We took the annual, sort of the annual maximum values, fit some GEVs to it. And you find that the shape parameter varies a lot. And so, this is one of the things I was going to mention: you know, from very positive to very negative. And it really kind of depends. There's sort of a spatial organization to the way this works. Galveston, for example, lots of tropical storms, lots of hurricanes go through Galveston. You know, it's sitting right about here, and it's in an area that's impacted by those storms. So those areas. Storms. So, those areas that have a lot of storm behavior, you know, we have a long, heavy tail. San Francisco, right, over here, not so much, right? This is an area that the tides really dominate the sea level and the surge values there. It's really mostly tidal. In that case, so the point is, is sometimes the underlying physical processes are sort of driving what's going on in the tails. In the tails, and you know, hopefully, this one, this one we felt pretty good about, this one not so good, right? So, in this case, uh, we're looking at fluvial flood now, right? Um, this is, you know, we divided the world up into 90 plus basins. Each basin has about 50,000 on average stream reaches. So, much bigger spatial problems here. This is a bias-corrected. So, these are models as input, but this is a bias-corrected error. Models as input, but this is a bias-correctly verified runoff that's sort of been run through a hydraulic model to produce stream flow. And 8,000 stream reaches through some code to calculate, fit a give to it. And I don't know what to make of this, right? So, clearly, some things think it's a gum. Some things think it's a gumble, right? Some things want to run off into never, never land, you know, on the bounds where I don't know what to think of a give with a shape parameter greater than 0.5 or less than negative 0.5. But just even then, how many are positive and how many are negative? And that really makes me uncomfortable, right? Because I don't understand really what's going on there. And our flood expert sort of wanted or thought everything would be sitting right here. So it's So, it's a real challenge to sort of think about how the GEV sometimes works and behaves. Lastly, talk a little bit about the compound hazard problem, because this is kind of where a big focus of our work will be coming down in the next year or two. Bottom line, environmental risk is rarely due to a single peril, right? If you think about a tropical cyclone, a hurricane, you're thinking about flooding, you're thinking about wind. Thinking about flooding, you're thinking about wind, you're thinking about other possible things. And when you look at the damage to a home, it's oftentimes broke down into the first floor damage is all assumed to be flooding. If the roof flies off, it's all assumed to be wind. But at the end of the day, it's how much damage happened to the house. So we really want to think about things like TCs where we're talking about wind and surge or wind and precip values. So we want to. So, we want to build sort of some infrastructure where we can think about the joint modeling of these different things and then moving that model, the outputs of that model into, say, some loss calculations or some damage calculations so we can kind of quantify what's going on here. This is an interesting example, Hurricane Floyd, of other types of way of thinking about compound events. But basically, this one had a large pre-sip event that moved through before the hurricane. Event that moved through before the hurricane. So, you're talking about, say, a situation where the ground is already saturated from the rain event, and then the hurricane comes through, and you get even more flooding. So, how we think about compound events becomes really important. This was just a simple proof of concept project with a former intern. I hate to call him an intern because he's been with the company for a few years now. Now he's down working with Andrew on his. Worked with Andrew on his PhD. Did a lot of the work behind this. Five by five degree tile sitting on the Gulf between Houston and New Orleans. We just kind of grabbed this tile. It's a 90-meter grid, but we're not going to do everything on the 90-meter grid. But the underlying data is 1,500 synthetic hurricane tracks. I'm running out of time. I can't really talk about that too much, but if you're in the TC business, But if you're in the TC business, there's not enough TCs to really actually do any modeling, real sort of thinking about risk assessments. There's a whole industry on producing synthetic hurricane traps. So it's not too hard to get the synthetic hurricane tracks. And then we have an in-house model that'll produce the precip and wind fields from those hurricane traps and then actually even start adding in some assumptions about what's going to happen with climate change. And this sort of And this sort of illustrates sort of the challenge of this data, right? Really, what we want to understand is how is this joint distribution between wind and precip not only evolving in time, but also evolving in space, right? So, this is just the average fields from the 1500 tracks. And ultimately, really, I just want to put this here to sort of illustrate how difficult of a problem this really is. When the top panel is wind, bottom panel is pre-sip. So, you have really high wind. precip so you have really high winds on average you know out in the out in the gulf and then as soon as the hurricane hits land it starts to disintegrate and the winds you know start to die down and do you know do crazy things as the storm starts to move through through the domain pre-cip you have almost no wind in the out in the or no precip out in the ocean huge drop right as the storm bands start to hit hit the coastline and then again the storm starts to disintegrate as it goes Starts to disintegrate as it goes northward. And so, when we were interested, not only thinking about the wind and the precipitation, but how is this correlation also evolving in space and time? In this case, we did the simplest thing we could, you know, fit a couple of gumbel distributions to the two marginals, picked a gumbel copula mostly because it was one parameter. And that's how the easiest thing we could do and code up. The easiest thing we could do and code up in the time that we had. I don't even know if COPAs are the right things to do. Hopefully, some of you out there can tell me whether I'm going to crash the financial markets by using COPOLAs or if there's really something else that would be better. We really just traded this as sort of the big regression problem, created some spatial covariates, surface height to try to try, and roughness length to try to get. Try and roughness link to try to get at that behavior as moved from the ocean onto the coastline, and then ripped out some basis functions from Lattice Creek. I think we heard somebody else do something similar a few minutes ago to try to also get at that crazy behavior right along the coastline. And then this is, you know, having great people who can work up all the MCMC that you're supposed to do. And then, you know, this is also another one of the challenges of thinking about a compound event. Of thinking about a compound event, right? I hate return levels anyway. They're really complicated, they're difficult things to explain to people who don't understand what they really are. When you're in the compound world, it gets even harder, right? What is a bivariate return level? It's not actually an easy thing. You can think about the or problem. You can also think about the and problem. I was thinking how to say that. That makes sense. So, is one of them above some, you know, some. Some, you know, some quantile, or are they both above some quantile? And in this particular case, just kind of picking a single location out of our model, this is one right near Galveston, you do sort of see over time, the precipitation is, you know, the return levels are getting bigger. You can think of that as the return levels are getting bigger, or the same return levels are happening more frequently, right? There's two sort of two different interpretations there. Bigger on the less in the win, more on the pre-supports. The less in the win, more on the precipice side. But again, this is a means to an end, right? Because this is ultimately going to be input, for example, into a damage or a loss model as we go forward. All right, so final thoughts real quick, assessments of climate risk. These are, this is, this doesn't do it justice, sort of the infrastructure and everything that you have to build to sort of pull these kind of things off. We have an amazing team, software developers. Amazing team, software developers, scientists, data scientists, statisticians. You know, the other takeaways: whatever we do needs robustness and scalability. Downscaling is super important. And really, sort of for us, the compound hazard problem is going to be a big one. And I really want to shy away from not use sort of these big MCMC problems because everybody's going to have a different problem, right? So, talked about different companies with different portfolios. About different companies with different portfolios. So, the challenge for us is: you know, Shotir is going to come with us with his portfolio, and it might be a thousand locations along the Gulf Coast. Somebody else is going to come in with their portfolio, and it's going to be 500 locations across Europe, and someone else is going to come with 10,000 locations across some other place. And, you know, sort of doing things, we don't have to do things in real time, but it can't be days and days and days to wait for an MCMC to sort of do its thing. To sort of do its thing. So, computational efficiency is a real bottleneck to some of these more complex analyses. And I think I'm over time, right? Thank you.
