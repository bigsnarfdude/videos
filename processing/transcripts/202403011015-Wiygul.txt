So, I'm happy to have this chance to talk to you about lower bounds and the bardic mass of spheres with small data. And there's collectively a lot of expertise in the audience. And we've just had some great reviews, expertise on mathematical relativity. And we've had some great reviews of it this whole week and recently in Paula's excellent talk. So move kind of quickly maybe through the first three slides. Quickly, maybe through the first two slides, but I like to start with this quote of John Wheeler, which I think summarizes very nicely relativity. Space-time tells matter how to move, and matter tells space-time how to curve, which is what the Einstein equation is telling us. So on the left-hand side of the, and in this talk, space-time is a four-manifold, and the left-hand side is telling us about the curvature of space, right? The Einstein tensor, and the right is entirely telling us. And the right is entirely telling us about matter, so source fields, right? So there's a split between curvature, which is telling us about gravity, and on the right, stress-energy tensor for all of the source terms, non-gravitational fields. Okay, and right away, I'll switch to the initial value formulation. So we can, we're going to think of the Einstein equation as an evolution equation on initial data. So we have a So we have a three-slice in this case, a Riemannian manifold. And our initial data consists of the Riemannian metric and the second fundamental form. In this talk, we just assume time symmetry throughout. So it's really, so that's totally geodesic initial data. So it's really a problem in Riemannian geometry. And there's some physics jargon in the talk, but it's a geometry problem. Okay, in this setting, we have also, I'm going to be talking about mass, but mass and energy coincide. Mass, but mass and energy coincide in this setting. And we have the constraint, the energy constraint coming from the Gauss equation. So rho is the energy density, so the zero, zero component of the stress-energy tensor. And this is proportional to the scalar curvature. And we're going to be assuming this weak energy condition, where it's the dominant energy condition in the setting, that the energy density should be non-negative or non-negative scalar curvature, of course. Of scalar curvature, of course. Okay, and so, right, rho is the energy density or the mass density of sources. It doesn't account for the gravitational field, right? So we don't have, except in special cases where you have symmetries, there's no natural candidate for an energy density for the gravitational field, like in contrast with the Newtonian case. Okay, we do, of course, as we know very well, have good notions. Know very well, have good notions of mass for total isolated systems, namely the ADM mass, which you just heard about. So, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat metrics, which we recently heard about. We have, as a nice example, we have the Schwarzschild, the Schwarzschild metric, which will come up. So, that's my notation in the talk for the Schwartzhild metric, GSM, with mass program. And we can define the ADM mass. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Thanks. Sorry about that. Okay. And we can ask for the relationship between the ADM mass and the scalar curvature, right? And one of the most fundamental results, of course, in this direction is the positive mass theorem. And we have many generalizations of this and alternative proofs. But let me jump to one that I want to. Jump to one that I want to single out, which is this positive mass theorem with corners of Meow, which has also been mentioned this week already. So, this situation here is right. So, this is a simplified statement or more general statement, but for me, it's enough to think about the case where the topology is R3 or R3 minus a ball, maybe. So, here I'm looking at all of R3 actually. And so the situation is that. And so the situation is that you have on the unit ball, you have some metric GN, and on the complements, you have some metric GA out. And the situation is that we allow at the interface on the sphere, we allow the metric not to be C1 across that. But we do require this inequality on the curvature, that the mean curvature should go down as you go out. And here, my sign convention. And here my sign convention is such that the unit sphere in Euclidean space has a positive mean curvature and curvature too. Okay. So you allow a discontinuity, a jump in the mean curvature, and that's somehow some kind of distributional scalar curvature. But if the jump has the right sign, then you still have the positive mass theorem, a positive mass theorem. And the proof involves a smoothing procedure. A smoothing procedure. Okay, so total systems, we have the ADM mass, and you can ask: can you assign mass to subsystems since they're quasi-local mass? So you have some subset, some asymptotically flat initial data set, and you want to assign some mass MQL quasi-local mass. And I don't know, I'm not in a position to argue. A position to argue on physical grounds for a good mass, but the fact is that there are a lot of proposals and they're interesting mathematically, it's interesting to compare them. Okay, and there are some properties which do seem very natural for some mass. And just let me just mention two right now. So one property is so both of the properties I'm going to mention are kind of asymptotic limits. So one property is the large sphere limit. You might expect that if you take an exhaustion of your Expect that if you take an exhaustion of your manifold, then you would expect to recover the idiom mass. And here I see actually that I have the, so I've talked at the top about the mass of a region, a solid region, a body, and I've shifted already to surfaces. Okay, so all of the masses that we're going to consider can be defined just in terms of boundary data. And so I'll be a bit sloppy as I was even before I meant to be about. Before I meant to be about whether we talk about the mass of a solid body or a surface. So, in this talk, the mass, quasi-local mass of some region is going to be identical to the quasi-local mass of the boundary. Okay, so then that's the large sphere limit. And then in the small sphere limit, here B tau is: I'm looking at some initial data set, and I pick some point P and I look at. Fix some point P and I look at metric spheres centered at P with radius tau. If I take the quasi-local mass of those balls, those metric balls, and I normalize by the volume, then I expect that, as I let the radius go to zero, I mean, I expect, I think it's reasonable to expect that you should recover the energy density at that point. Okay, so those are some things that maybe you would expect of a quasi-local mass. Right, and as I mentioned, yeah, you could. Mentioned, uh, yeah, you could you can, and I will talk about the mass of a region and also of a surface, okay. And the surface is uh, for me, this top will always be spheres. Okay, and so the first quasi-local mass I'll look at, which is the star of the talk, is the Bartnick mass. So, uh, Robert Bartnick proposed this quasi-local mass, which is a localization of the ADM mass, so very, very natural. Very, very natural. And actually, there are several variants of the definition. So, here's the one, the rather restricted one that I'm going to look at in this talk. So, yeah, again, I'm just, I suppose that I start with a sphere, which I'm going to identify with the unit sphere in R3. And I look at all asymptotically flat extensions with non-negative scalar curvature. And I have this outer minimizing condition. So I require that the extensions are such that. require that the extensions are such that the sphere that I start with, the unit sphere rather, is going to be outer minimizing, meaning that no enclosing sphere is going to have a smaller area. And along with the sphere, I should have said I have boundary data. So I have the induced metric gamma and the induced curvature H, which are boundary data. So I require this matching. Okay, without the outer minimizing condition, it's possible to produce. Possible to produce, if you can produce an extension at all, then you can produce extensions with arbitrarily small mass. So we need something to rule that out. Yeah, and the boundary conditions are natural from the point of view of Gauss's theorem, although Bartnick's conjecture predates Gauss's theorem, which I think was motivation for the theorem. Okay, so there's the Bartnick mass. Another very important quasi-local mass is the Hawking mass, which is Is the Hawking mass, which is in contrast to the Bartnik mass, is very natural in a sense, but also very abstract. And the Hockey mass, in contrast, is extremely explicit. Okay, and some properties of the Hockey mass for in the Schwarzschild metric, if you take an origin-centered sphere, you'll get the mass parameters, the Hawking mass. In Euclidean space, in particular, the Hawking mass will be non-positive with equality only. Non-positive with equality only for round spheres. So maybe that's an undesirable property that the mask is negative, but that's what it is. And this definition is a special case of a space-time definition. And I guess you can interpret it in terms of bending of light rays. But mathematically, the most important application of the Hawking mass, I think, is the proof, the Huiska-Nilmanen proof of the Riemannian-Pedro's inequality. Riemanni and Pedro's inequality, and actually, it proves something a bit stronger than the inequality. So, I think everybody we've seen this week knows the statement, which I haven't written, but instead we have this strengthening that actually, if you take not just a horizon, so you take any outer minimizing sphere, then that's a lower bound for the ADF mass of the manifold. Okay, there's a rigidity statement as well. Rigidity statement as well. Okay. And then the third quasi-local mass that I'll mention just briefly and will play an important role in the talk, but only briefly, is this Brown-York mass. Okay, so here I have a sphere which I assume has positive Gaussian curvature. And I also want to assume it's mean convex, actually. And then I can embed it isometrically in Euclidean space. And I can look at the And I can look at the mean curvature that I get from that embedding, which is H0. I have the same sign convention here. And I look at the difference of the mean curvature with integral. Okay, so there are some important relationships between these three masses. So first, by the Whisken-Helman result, we have that the Hawking mass is a lower bound on the Bartnik mass, right, from the property I just integrated. The property I just inequality I just mentioned on a previous slide. And then for work of Xi and Tam, so you can start with Bartnick data, and they constructed extensions realizing the Brown Dork mass. And so that tells you that the Brown Dork mass in particular is an upper bound, at least with these assumptions for the Barnett mass. Okay, and there are now. And there are now we have a number of other bounds, which so I just mentioned some names here. I will talk about in a moment on the next slide one of these. I'll give the statement at least. And so how are these proved? Well, upper bounds, the way that the Barnett mass is defined, you have an extension which is admissible, right, which satisfies those requirements, outer minimizing the boundary conditions of the non-negative scalar curvature, and you get an upper bound. So if you get... You get an upper bound, so if you could construct a nice extension, then you can prove an upper bound. The lower bounds, on the other hand, you are looking at some kind of constructing or finding some kind of inner extension, a fill in or some kind of inner collar, and using the Penrose inequality or the Whiskin-Elman inequality. Okay, so in particular, I want to look at this lower bound of Montino and Templeton-Brown from a couple years. Brown from a couple years ago. So, what's happening here is you have some region omega, an initial data set. And the point is that they, so we have a lower bound by the Hawking mass, but for the Hawking mass at the boundary of Omega. But instead, they say we can look at any point inside of Omega, and we can look at a small metric sphere around that point. point and we're gonna what they do is they perturb the boundary of the metric sphere so as to increase the hocking mass so they actually maximize the hocking mass with an area area constraint and then so the right hand side then is an estimate so this inequality holds you could put a supreme one here it holds at any for any point q and for any ball of a certain radius you don't want it to be to be too big if the radius is small enough that then you have this estimate Enough, then you have this estimate. They estimate the mass of the perturbed sphere in terms of the curvature tensor at the center. Okay, so we have these S and we also I don't know actually. So, I mean, the estimate is the Hawking mass, the way it arises in their work is the Hawking mass of the perturbed sphere. I don't know if it's related to Q curvature. Okay, so we have these estimates, and we do actually know the value of the Bartnick mass in a small number of cases. So if you have a sphere enclosing the horizon in the Schwarzschild metric, then you do add. Schwarzschild metric, then you do actually know that the Martinik mass is the mass parameter, and this can be proved using a result of Meow, which is the Riemannian Henris inequality with corners. So, of course, if you start with a sphere, then you automatically, by the assumption on the sphere, you have an extension which has the mass m, right, the mass parameter for Schwartzhield. So that gives you an upper bound for the lower bound. Gives you an upper bound for the lower bound. You can imagine you have some alternative extension, which is admissible. But then you have the fill in, which is the Schwarzschild fill in down to the horizon, say. And then you have this union of those two, you glue those together. It's not C1 across, but you have much like using the smoothing argument. Argument now, he also has a bearing to the Benner's inequality. So you had the lower bound as well. Okay, and then for minimal surfaces for horizons, actually by work of Montalinas and Shane and a generalization extension of the work by Chow and Martins. We know the Martinik mass for horizons satisfying the stability condition. Okay, and this is because for horizons, we have the Penrose inequality, so we have the lower bound. We have the Penrose inequality, so we have the lower bound, and then they construct sequences of extensions which tend to the lower bound with mass tending to the lower bound. Okay, so we know the Bartnick mass in a small number of cases, but it's very, very difficult to compute in general. And so, there's this important counterpart to Bartnick's proposal, which is the static vacuum conjecture. So, Bartnick conjectured that the Bartnick mash. The barnic mass should be, there should be a minimizer, a unique minimizer, even, which is static vacuum. We've heard about static metrics and substatic metrics this week. So vacuum, you know, is scalar flat and static as we've as we've seen before. So I don't think I need to say more about that. Okay, we know that in the greatest. Well, that in the greatest generality, so there are variants of the Martinex definition. So it depends what you're going to allow. But if you're as aggressive as possible, then the conjecture is false. We have examples where there's no static extension or where there's no minimizer. Okay, right. I mean, it's a big conjecture. There are different individual components or research directions by themselves. So you can also ask, well, what is their static vacuum fixed? Ask well, when is there a static vacuum extension at all? When is it unique? And so we know, we now know. Oh, sorry, you can also ask whether a minimizer, if it exists, needs to be static vacuum. And we do know that starting with work of Corvino and I think a few years ago, the complete full proof was given by Anderson and Jaregi. Okay, and then there's the existence question at all, which so meow. So, Miao studied the case of small data. So, when I say small data, I have in mind you have some Euclidean, some surface in Euclidean space, and you perturb the Euclidean metric a little bit. So, you get small perturbations of the induced parting data. Okay, and so Meow proved existence for small data in dimension three, right? So, I'm in dimension three, but you can talk about these things in other dimensions too. Things in other dimensions too, with a discrete symmetry assumption. Anderson proved existence for and local uniqueness also. So that there's an extension which is close to the Euclidean metric, and there are no others which are close. So Anderson proved that for in all dimensions without any symmetry assumptions. And more recently, An and Wang have proved existence and local uniqueness for a large class of Euclidean domains. Of Euclidean domains, so almost Euclidean domains. Okay, and now I want to return to the question of small spheres, so small sphere asymptotics. So for small tau, Fan Shi Tan computed the Taylor expansion for the Hawking mass and the Brown York mass of small spheres. And we have these expressions. So all of the terms. Okay, so all of the terms are computed at the evaluated at the center of b tau. Okay, and so in particular, we have we can confirm this uh this expected property, maybe that if you look at the limit of the Hawking mass and as you normalize by the volume, then you uh you do get the energy density to point, right? Uh, and more than that, because of the inequalities that I stated early, we earlier we know that the uh the Bartnik mass is uh squeezed in between these two. Between these two masses. So we also get the leading term because, and because the leading terms agree, right, importantly, for these, we get the leading term for the Bartmic mass. And so we also confirm that it has this property. But you can ask about the next terms. What can you say? Because there's a gap, of course, between the next terms. Okay. So, yeah, so that's. So, yeah, so that's something I'm interested in. And more generally, not just for metric balls, but for small data, what can you say? What estimates? And it's not that I think it's particularly important to know the next terms, what the numbers are. It's just that it's a relatively simple setting where you can see how much you can say. Can you say that you can find a minimizer to some order, say, at least. Okay. And so. Okay, and so you can say, you can say more. So you can get an upper bound. So there's a natural, because of Barnett's conjecture, there's a natural target for a best upper bound, which would be the static vacuum extension, which we know exists for these spheres, because it'll be close to the Euclidean spheres. And this was, so this upper bound was computed by me recently and then by Harvey at Wang in a more In a more efficient way. But the idea is the same for both computations to compute the mass of to right perturbatively to fifth order in the radius for small spheres. Okay, and you can write also, you can state an estimate more generally, not for small spheres, but for spheres with small data, but it's a little hard to digest. Okay, and looking at this estimate. And looking at this estimate, we can compare this. So, ms is the mass of the static extension, right? And you can look at the difference, the gap between this upper bound and the Hawking mass lower bound. And you can see that it's not zero when the trace-free VG is not zero at the point. Okay, and you can also compare with the upper bound of the brown york. Brown York. But I so I'm interested. Of course, conjecturally, we have equality, but there's this gap. And so you can ask if you can improve the lower bound. Okay, and so I'll talk about now some improvement. So what you could do is you, so the problem is to start with some partner data. I'll use sphere with small data, right? So here, gamma zero, H0, this is the standard data. So, this is the standard data, so the round metric and mean curvature two or minus two, depending on your dimension. Okay, and the idea now is, okay, so we're looking for lower bound, so it's going to be some kind of inner or color extension. And so I'm going to look at, I'm going to fix some inner radius between zero and one. And I'm going to look at this spherical shell or this annular region. And I'm going to look. And I'm going to look for small perturbations of the equity metric, which have a non-negative scalar curvature and induce the boundary that gamma1, h1 should be gamma h, the prescribed partner data on S1. And then we're going to try to maximize the hocking mass of the inner sphere and use that as a lower bound. Hope to use that as a lower bound. Okay, and to make it work, we're going to have to assume that. We're going to have to assume that the data is small enough compared, that is, differs enough from the standard data, differs from the standard data in a way that's small compared to the thickness of the shell that we're looking at. If you do that, so as small as needed, so you can, if you pick it small enough, you can ensure then that SR0, the inner sphere of the shell, will remain outer minimizing. Will remain outer minimizing. And then, if you have some arbitrary admissible Bartnik extension, you can attach this shell that you constructed, and you can apply the smoothing procedure of Yao. And you'll get a sequence of asymptotic extensions, which They'll have ADM mass converging to the ADM mass of the original extension, embissible extension that you started with. And the hockey masses of the boundary will converge to the hockey mass of the inner shell that you constructed. And because of the smoothing, we'll be able to apply the Benros, the Huisken-Helman inequality. And so you. And so you really do get a lower bound in this way if you keep the, you assume that the perturbation, which is going to be constructed for the data, is small enough. Okay. And so what about the, so how are you going to construct these perturbed metrics? Well, so at this stage, the enzatz that I'm making is not very principled. It's just something which is. Principled. It's just something which is simple, simple enough that you can carry out relatively easily. And the idea is we're going to look at perturbations that you get by just by conformal transformations and by deformation by diffeomorphisms of the boundary. Okay, so the form I'm looking at is like this. So here, so I have the conformal factor in front. So B is the perturbation to the conformal factor of one. This f is the so inside of the brackets is some vector field. The f is the unit time flow. So I'm pulling back the delta z equity metric under this under this flow. So just a diffeomorphism. And what is the vector field? Well, so there are two terms which are, so these are vector fields which are supported near the boundary r equals one sphere and the boundary r equals r0 sphere. Boundary r equals r zero sphere. And so here f and u are defining functions, so I can do graphical deformations, so normal deformations for each boundary. And so remember, at r equals one, I have boundary data that I need to enforce. And so I may also need some tangential, which these don't have any geometric effect. It's just the reparameterization, but I'm including it explicitly. Okay, and on the inner one, I give myself the freedom to do graph. I give myself the freedom to do graphical deformations to try to increase the hockey mass. And I have some cutoff functions, so depending on R0 so that they don't interfere with one another. Okay, and so let's look at the, so we have a kind of a boundary value problem. I haven't specified all the boundary conditions, but on okay, on r equals one, sphere, we definitely have the bar ng boundary data. bar and boundary data and in the interior we want to have zero scalar curvature and on the bottom well we'll we'll make some choices as we go so the bottom being the r the inner the inner sphere okay and so in this first line uh i mean it looks complicated with uh with the indices but this is just uh i'm just decomposing my uh induced my prescribed induced metric into a trace a conformal part Into a trace, a conformal part, a trace part, and a lead derivative. So, this is like just infinitesimal uniformization. So, I could use my tangential vector field X to do this, just reparametrizing basically. And then I want to achieve the trace part, but I have the conformal changes from B, and I have my graphical deformation. So, this is governed by the second fundamental form. So, that's where the G is coming from. Fundamental form. So that's where the two is coming from of the sphere, the unit sphere. Okay, and then also I need to describe the mean curvature. So the conform, and here I think I'm using the different sign convention from previous slides, but hopefully that's okay at the level of detail that we're looking at. Yeah, so the first here, this is the conformal change, right? The linearized conformal change of the mean curvature. And these other terms are the Jacobi equation. These other terms are the Jacobi equation on this feature. Okay, and right to first order, so the Euclidean metric is scalar flat, and I'm saying I'm going to look at the scalar flat deformations. So the first order, I want my conformal vector to be harmonic. Okay, and then it's not hard. So the X is really just this is sort of self-contained. And what I really need are the V and the. What I really need are the V and the F. And so from the harmonic condition and these are the equations, right, you can write down the expression for the Laplacian in spherical coordinates, radial coordinates. And it's not hard to put this together to see that you're prescribing. You need to, it doesn't matter what the right-hand side is. It just comes from the Barney data and from putting these equations together. But you need to prescribe the second radial derivative of the harmonic function, V. harmonic function b on s1 okay and that by itself that that's not enough to determine it we need to say think about what we want to do on r0 or or impose some other some growth conditions or decay conditions and so for for now uh what i want to impose is uh i'll express it in terms of the spherical spherical harmonics so um all right so i'm trying to impose the second radial derivative and uh so if i just look at And so, if I just look at the harmonic functions, which decay as you go to zero, then I'm not going to be able to achieve this for the low modes, the L equals zero and the L equals one modes. So I'm kind of forced to give myself these terms that will blow up. But then for the higher modes, I'm just choosing to use the ones which decay. Okay. Okay, and so that now you have a well-defined problem, and you can solve it in first order. And you, I mean, this system tells you basically that you can control the boundary data. And so the idea is to proceed iteratively. And if you want to, so to correct the scalar curvature, subsequently, you can do other conformal changes, not harmonic ones. And with that system on the previous slide, you can control the boundary data. A slide to control the boundary data. So you're going to be able to iterate and produce a solution, and it's no problem to get good estimates that do this. Okay, and you can do this for each R0 that you pick and each U. So U is the defining function for the deformation on the inner sphere. And then you can, it's a calculation to estimate to second, you go through the procedure and you estimate the mass to second order, the Hockey mass. Order, the Hawking mass, I mean, on the inner sphere, and then you maximize it in U. And if you do that, you get an estimate which is going to depend on R0. It's going to be increasing in R0. So as you take R0 closer and closer to one, you decrease the thickness of the shell, you get actually a better estimate. Okay, and so in this way, you get some estimates for small spheres with small article data, but again, they're a little bit hard to interpret. Again, they're a little bit hard to interpret. So, what do you get if you apply this to small spheres in particular? You get this estimate, which is maybe also hard to interpret, but you get that the Bartnick mass is at least, so here it's that static mass from before, but there is a gap, you lose a little bit. It's better than it's larger than the Hawking mass of Of the boundary of the ball, but there is still a gap with this method. Okay, and also I have a little low remainder estimate instead of bigger. That's because I have to take the tau small in comparison with R0. Okay, so that estimate does not, so I want to think about the Montevideon-Brown estimate. It doesn't follow directly from the estimate. Follow directly from the estimates that they state, but it seems that they can get it from their approach as well. And in their approach, they're given the region omega, and they're not changing that fill-in. They're just looking for surfaces inside of there with some and estimating the hogging mass. So, the method that we followed, we seem to get the same estimate that they get, and you can ask if. That they can get, and you can ask if you can vary, say, the choice of V. So we had some freedom in that, how we picked the static potential, the conformal factor, I mean. And you can ask if you can vary that to get an improvement. And if you look, it turns out that if you look at the data, this data, the problem with small spheres in particular, it's only the L equal two modes which are. Which are relevant to the estimates. And so it's simple to consider alternatives, but no, actually, that's the best one that you could do. So at least in this with this particular onsatz, you can't do better than that estimate. But it's restrictive. I don't think there's any reason to expect that this is going to give you the best possible lower bound. So I'd like to study the problem more systematically. More systematically. Okay, I'll stop there. Thank you.
