Thanks everyone for being here and thanks to the organizers for the invitation to speak. Can everyone hear me clearly? All right. I must also apologize, I couldn't make it to the previous talk I was teaching and I just finished. So sorry about that. So, sorry about that. So, let me start by saying that this talk will be based on joint work with Guigasal and James Freydag, where in this first paper we look at Ackling-Demand-Weierstruss type theorems for Fuxian groups, for uniformizers of Fukushima groups, and also with And also with again, Guy and James, but also with David Blasque-Sans, where we look at more general Swartzian equations. So let me begin the talk by giving my own motivation. So what got me interested in these problems, and so, and it will also serve as... And it will also serve as giving an idea of the kind of theorems that I'm interested in. So, throughout the talk, H here will be denote the complex upper half plane. And so, just to be sure we are all on the same page, by the modular J function, I mean the automorphic, the famous automorphic function for SL2Z, where here I just mentioned. Where here I just mentioned that it's unique once you fix those values for J. And also, it's an as I say, it's an automorphic function for SL2Z. And I do expect that, I hope it's a good assumption that everyone has seen J, but just a reminder that throughout the talk, this is going to represent linear fractional transformation. Okay, so this is going to be the premise here. And for me, something that's rather important is that the J function satisfy the following third-order differential equation. Okay, so we're here. This expression here is This expression here is the Swatin derivative. Okay. And for me, the variable of the J function is going to be T. So T varies in H or open subset. Okay. So J satisfy Schwartzian equation. So that's one thing to remember. So that's one thing to remember. Now, let me give the statement of the first theorem that I'm interested in. So, let me start with an irreducible complex algebraic variety and take few elements of its function field. And here I assume it has a common point in H, of course. And the idea here is I'm going to apply J to these functions. I will say that. I will say that the AIs are geodesically independent if they are non-constant and there are no relations of the form AI equals J, the accent of J, G, where G is an element of G L to Q plus, so positive determinant. Okay, and again, that is well known as well, but if you do have Well, but if you do have such a relation, then it's known that there exists modular polynomials. So there is a modular polynomial, let's call it v, such that when you look at the values of j, it vanishes. Okay, so if you do have this kind of relation between the AIs, you between the AIs, you have dependency, algebraic dependency among the J value, J function. And so the theorem of Jonathan Pilla, so the modular Axline-Weierstrass theorem, says that if you assume that those AIs are geodesically independent, so you don't assume none of those modular relations. None of us modular relations, or that they are non-constant, then you have that the n functions are algebraically independent over c or c of v of the function field. So let me just mention that Pillar also proved a differential version of this theorem. So here this Theorem. So here, the same statement, except that I add the derivatives of J. Okay, and I only have to add the first and second derivative because J satisfy a third order differential equations, and so you already get dependency there. And so a few comments. It's well known that somehow the modular axinum and Viastra plays a key role in Pillar's proof of the Andr√©. In Pilar's proof of the Andrea conjecture. But from my perspective, one might think this theorem, especially the theorem with derivative, as belonging to differential algebra. But again, that might be well known. The method used by Pillar does Does not involve differential algebra as the center, but o-minimality and all the other techniques from what I listed there. And so this is the first thing that sort of piqued my interest. So it's kind of part of differential algebra, but the proof does not involve differential algebra. But somehow also using this axiomand theorem with derivative. With derivative, James Freitag and Thomas Canlon proved that the Swartzian differential equation satisfied by J is strongly minimal. And I say and more. So I'm not going to talk about the other portion of the theorem here, but I'm going to focus on strongly minimality. And a quick version of what it means. So if I start. So if I start with a solution of the Swartzian equation, okay, so the focus is on the equation here, not necessarily just on J. So if I take any other solution or any solutions, and I take any differential field extension of C, okay, so I might add other functions to my base field. Then what I get is that the trends. The transcendence degree of the differential field generated by this solution is only a zero or three. And so, this is a strong way of saying that the solutions of the Swordian equation for the J function do not satisfy equation of order one or two, even if I extend the base field of definition. Okay, so even if I add all kinds of Even if I add all kinds of functions, I don't get lower-order sub-varieties. Okay. And now, this was significant from the multi-perspective. First of all, it's not clear how it's stated. So later on, we will see, but this amount gives a full description of a set of solutions and also gave a counterexample to. To long-standing conjecture in Mole theory. And so, but again, and just to put the two again together, is from my perspective, both the results of Tillar and Freitan and Scanlon fall in the rhythm of Mole theory of differentially closed fields. And so it was reasonable to try and see whether one. Try and see whether one could get a proof that involves differential algebra and instead of o-minimality. So this is what got me in the game. So trying to see whether one can use techniques from differential algebra, the Mole theory of differentially closed fields to prove the results. And I must say that one thing, one One thing, one idea as well, which was reasonable to expect is instead of first proving, sorry, have the modular axial demand bias trust and using that to prove the results of Freitag Scanon. It was reasonable to think that you should first fully study the Schwartzian differential equation, give a description of a solution set, and then use Of a solution set and then use that to prove the axiom and biastras. And this is somehow what was my motivation. Now, as I already said, the j functions satisfy the Swartzian equation. But when it comes to using the approach with differential algebra, it makes little Little sense, or you gain very little by just focusing on the rational function given here for the j function. And so it makes sense to study the Swartzem equation where R here is any rational function with complex coefficient. Okay, and what we'll see soon is that indeed we are able to That indeed we are able to characterize all, well, determine, so there's an algorithm that will allow us to do so. Okay. Now, so we've sort of used the net and what do we catch? What are other interesting functions do we get? So let me just say first that there's the example of conformal. There's the example of conformal mappings. Okay, so if I start with an R-sided circular polygons, then by the Riemann mapping theorem, I have a biholomorphic mapping from that circular polygon to the upper half plane. So this is in disguise saying that any simply connected open domain is Domain is conformally equivalent to the unit disk. Okay, and so here is the map. And so Herman Schwartz showed that these conformal mappings satisfy a Schwartzian equation where now the rational function is given as follows. And here the alpha i's correspond to I's correspond to the angles of your circular polygon. And indeed, this is how the equations got the name Schwartzian equation. And so by studying this more general context of a Schwartzen equation, an arbitrary R, so we are capturing these conformal mappings. But so somehow, zooming in a little bit, a special case of Zooming in a little bit, a special case of these conformal mappings is if we look at Fuchsian groups. So if I take gamma to be a Fouxian group of first kind and genus zero, so we saw in yesterday's talk example of those. So if you've never seen the Fouxian group of first kind and genus zero, it simply means that when you take the quotient under the action of linear functional transformation. Linear functional transformation. Well, you can compactify by adding finitely many points, and what you get is a projective non-singular curve of genus zero. Okay. And so by a uniformizer or up module for gamma, we simply mean so it has genus zero. So it's of genus zero, so we mean the generator of the function field of this curve. And it turns out that the j gamma is an automorphic function for gamma. Okay, so just an example of course is the j function, which we talked about earlier. So somehow by looking at the fundamental domain of action, you You can somehow figure out that these uniformizers can be seen as conformal mappings, and so they do satisfy also the Swartzen equation. Okay, and so instead of just focusing on the equation for the J function, by looking at this more general context of an arbitrary rational function, we are at the same time studying Foucault. Fuxian uniformizers for Fuxian groups and more generally come for more mapping. Okay, so as I mentioned, the first thing that I want would like to look at is proving this notion, like proving that these equations are strongly minimal. And so I'm going to explain in a moment, well, we will see in a moment how See in a moment how this is important, this can be very useful to prove functional transcendence results. But it's interesting, when I started working on this problem, I didn't realize that Paul Penlev√© himself already conjectured that these Swadesian equations would be strongly minimal or irreducible. Strongly minimal or irreducible. And so I like to show this little picture, especially because if you've never seen Le Son de Stockholm, it's nicely handwritten, big volume. And here it simply says, So function function here means the automorphic functions for Fouxian groups are irreducible, okay? Irreducible. Okay. And so somehow, so that was in 1895 that he made this claim, but there never was a proof of that. Let me double down on the French and put a quote of Henri Poincar√©. Les math√©matiques constitut a continent solid margange d'en tout des p√©is en bien reli√© les auzotres la de. Les Zain auxotres, Love de Paul Paul's Vais, et unides original, et explanted d'Alessendois. Okay, so coming from an island, first of all, it's nice to read that, but really what Poincar√© was trying to express here is that while the work of Panlov√© was nice and original, it was somehow not part of mainstream mathematics back then. And the reason I like this claim is our work The reason I like this claim is that our work somehow connects the work of Poincar√© with the work of Pernev√© and somehow is crucial in our method to prove these functional transcendence result. And so for those who know about the history of the Pen-Levy equations, so one of the major contributions of Pen-Levy major contribution of PenLev√© is the classification of second-order ODEs that have some, that share some tail properties with linear ODEs. So that's called the pen of it property. So it's about that solution have a nice analytic continuation. And so somehow this is not going to be a focus on my talk. So I'm not going to say more about it, but it is in this context of working with a penny. Of working with the Penovet equation, that Penov√© introduced the notion of irreducibility, which for us would be synonymous to strong minimality. And his idea was that all the solutions of your equation is highly transcendental in the sense that they cannot be expressed in terms of known functions. We'll see in a second what that means. That means, but it's attributed to Umemura for a precise definition of irreducibility. Okay, and so here it is. And I use this opportunity to fix some of the things I've been saying. I've been talking about solution, I've been talking about functions. So, one, of course, usually think of solutions to ODEs as meromorphic functions. To ODEs as meromorphic functions on some domain, a meromorphic function on some domain. But we know that the collection of meromorphic functions, let's say equipped with d by dt, is a differential field containing cd. And so we usually think more generally of a solution as simply as an element of an arbitrary differential field, let's say extending ct d by dt. Okay, and so Okay, and so we don't confine ourselves to Meromorphic functions. And so, in my talk, when I say function, a solution, you could think of it as a meromorphic function, or you could think of it as a point in an arbitrary differential field. And so here's what the definition of irreducibility with respect to known function is. With respect to known function is. So, for simplicity, here I've looked at ODs that are the form given here. So, degree one in the highest order. So, Umemura, looking at the work of Pendovey, found out that what Pendovey meant is that the equation has no solution in No solution in the algebraic closure of C of T. So algebraic functions, if you want, can be thought of as the most known function. But then the same definition I had before for strong lemon minimality. Okay, so this is strongly minimality. So for So, for any differential field extension and any solution, if I look at the transcendence degree over that field, then it's zero. And so the solutions do not satisfy any lower order differential equation, even if you extend the base field. So this is So this is precisely what I stated before for an order three equation. Do I have any question so far? I hope I'm not going too fast as well. You're good? Okay, thank you. So, all right, so our aim is to Right, so our aim hence is to first prove this conjecture of Pennovae. So notice that for automorphic function, number one has been known for quite some time. So one can say you can find it in the work of Lishioka. So really it's trying to prove this statement about no lower order equation. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to say a few words about the proof of strong minimality and then I will explain why do we care about proving strongly minimality. Okay, so as I said, we are not going to focus on just Penlov√© conjecture. So Penlov√©'s conjecture is for Fouxian, so automorphic function for Fouxian. So, automorphic function for Foucault group. But what we will do is we will try to prove strong linear minimality by considering a general Swartzian equation. Now, by the linear ODE attached to the equation star, we simply mean the following. So, here, a very important note is the derivation here was The derivation here was d by dt in the Schwartzian equation. But when we look at the linear ODE, we are looking at the derivation d by dy. And so it's a second-order linear differential equation. So again, the rational function is in terms of y. So we don't have a u hanging around anywhere. Uh, ain't hanging around anywhere. Okay, and so uh and this is again, this is well known, very classical, and this is what brings us to closer to work of Poincar√©. So if you look at the conformal mapping, remember I gave you the example of what the r, the rational function was. So in the case of conformal mapping, what we are talking about here is we're talking about the Fouxian differential. Talking about the Fouxian differential equation. And so, including in particular the hypergeometric equation. Okay, so what we're looking at here is hypergeometric equations and more generally, Fouxian differential equation. Okay, and so here's our theorem. So, I want to study when is When is the Swadesian equation strongly minimal? So it's strongly minimal if and only if when I look at the Picard vatio group of a linear differential equation, so if I look at the differential Galois group of the linear differential equation, it's as large as it can be. So it's SL2C. Okay? Okay, so somehow it brings the study of strong normality of a non-linear OD by looking at information about the Picard vessel group of a linear differential equation. And so let me just say a few things is studying the Pico-VSEO group of Studying the Picard-Visier group of a linear differential equation as given here is a classical problem and it's related to existence of what it's called a Louisville solution. Okay, so here I say that a Louisian solution is Louisian if it can be written as a quotient where one of the Fi's are given in the form here. Okay. And so what's interesting And so what's interesting is determining existence or non-existence of linear solution has been tackled and there's an algorithm, the Covastic algorithm. And so it relates the Covastic algorithm for Louis-William solutions to finding strong minimality or irreducibility. And so let me just add Let me just add what does it mean for the statement of our theorem is it's known that when the Picard vessel group is as large as possible, then there are no Louisian solution. Okay, so this is the first theorem. And as a corollary of that theorem, we get Penovet's conjecture. Conjecture. Okay, so in the previous theorem, oops, we were looking at a general rational function. So now I'm going to focus. Could I ask? Yes, go ahead. Can you go back to the so, I mean, is this not just an antiderivative? I don't understand the linear equation. Right. Right. So here's here what you have to be careful is that one is derivation with d by dt, the other is derivation by d by dy, right? The bottom one. Right. So is this not just taking antiderivative twice? So so somehow, so what you have, if you remember, there are two, there are two. two two there are two functions when it comes to Schwartz and the equation there's there's one for an equation for y which is this one an equation for the inverse of y and the equation for the inverse of y is simply written as uh oops y yes sorry let's let's do z Let's do z equals let's say our y up and two. Okay, and so somehow I'm not sure if it's antiderivative, but what you have is that the linearly independent pair of solution of Solution of the linear equation. If you take the quotient of that, then you get a solution to the inverse equation. Okay, so I'm not 100% sure I... Excuse me, is there a missing U in the linear equation? Ah, that's my equation. Oh, right. Oh, yes, that's very important. That must be. Was it Michael? Michael, yeah, I'm really sorry. Yes, yes, thanks, Michael. Thanks for pointing that out. This is terrible, right? So, this is very important indeed. Thanks, Michael. Yes, so it's an homogeneous linear differential equation. Thanks. Okay, that makes sense. Is it a little bit clearer now? Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Sorry about that. Okay. And so here, so now we are talking about the actual Swordian equation for the uniformizers of Fourier group. And this is Pandavais conjecture. And as I say, it's as a corollary, we obtained Penderv√©'s conjecture. And a sketch of the proof is A sketch of a proof is so, as I mentioned before, when we're talking about conformal mapping or uniformizers, sorry, we're talking about Fouxian differential equation. And in this case, we have a characterization of the Picard-Vissier group in terms of the monodromy of the Fourier equation. Okay, and so a theorem. Okay, and so a theorem of Schlesinger says that the Picard-Visier group is the Zariski closure of a monodroming group of a Fourier equation. Okay, and so this theorem works generally for any conformal mapping. So this is for conformal map. Okay. But the added information is that Is that the work of Poincar√© on Fouxian group was precisely to characterize those Fouxian differential equations that have monondromic, discrete monodromic group. And so the Fouxian groups are precisely the monodromic group of a linear equation. And so they are Zariski dense in SL two C. So and from this we obtain strong minimality and irreducibility. Strong minimality and irreducibility. Okay. Does that make sense? I apologize for the missing you there, but I hope this makes a little bit of sense. Okay, so this is proving strong minimality. And again, as I said, connecting works of Poincar√© on uniformity. On uniformization and somehow Penn Leve's work on irreducibility. But now let's turn to what really, if you want, interest us is application to functional transcendence. So the first thing we there's a question in the chat. In the cat, is the equation for the inverse the Ricardi equation of the linear one? It's not the Ricardi equation, but from it you can derive the Riccardi equation. So it's not exactly the Ricardi equation yet. But you can derive the Ricardi equation straight, quite straightforward. So let's see. Let's see. Maybe I can say a few words about that. So let me see if I remember. I don't want to get into it. But there's a straightforward change of variable using y that allows you to write the Swartzian equation in terms of a Riccardi equation. But I don't remember on top of my head. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Okay. And so Okay, and so yes, so now what we want to do is we want to talk about the Axling-Weistrass theorem. And so I want to maybe convince everyone that proving strongly minimality is relevant when you're trying to do these kind of functional transcendence theorems. So here I'm working in the context of having a uniformizer of a Fouxian group, first kinetic zero. And I will have the same assumption as I had for the J function. I start with an As I had for the j function, I start with an irreducible algebraic variety. I have n elements of its function field with a common point 2h. And the goal is to classify when the functions and the derivative are algebraically dependent over C of. Okay, so here we obtain both the axiom. Obtain both the axial Lindemann Verse stress without derivative and the axioman weight stress with derivative. So, how does strong linemality help us? So, one thing that I sadly didn't get to mention, and I mean it'll take too much time, is that strong limitality is a sort of fundamental notion in model theory. There's a precise There's a precise manner in which you could determine the structure of all differential equation building on the strongly minimal ones. But very importantly, we have the work of Rushovsky and Soporovich and others that gives us a classification of differential equations. Of differential equations that are strongly minimal. Okay, and the idea here is if you're trying to understand algebraic relations between solutions of differential equations, if it's strongly minimal, then you somehow, there are few predetermined type of algebraic relations that you fall into. That you fall into. Okay, and so you're not sort of, so that's what the classification gives you. And so here I'm going to state the one that's most important for our setting. So if you have an autonomous strongly minimal differential equation of order bigger than one, okay, so here autonomous means that all my parameters are complex numbers. Are complex numbers, then what you get is that the differential equation or the solution set is geometrically trivial. Okay, and what is this? What is triviality? So if I take n distinct solution and I want to study possible algebraic relations between y1, y2, and yn. Y2 and Yn, but also let's throw in all the derivatives. Okay? So if I were to find an algebraic relations between them, then it must come from a pair of solutions. So there would be a pair of solutions for which there's going to be algebraic relations between the pair and the derivative. The pair and the derivative of the solution. Okay? And so, in some ways, if you're trying to show that there are no algebraic relations whatsoever, all you have to worry about is pair of solutions. Okay, so this is what geometric triviality says. And the strong classification, which I sadly haven't had a chance to talk about, gives that if you have an autonomous strong classification. To numbers strongly minimal equation, then you always of order bigger than one, you always get this geometric triviality condition. And so remember, our Schwartzian equation, the one we are looking at, only have complex parameters. And so the strong classification straight away, because we've proved strong minimality, it tells us that the Schwartzian equation are geometric. An equation are geometrically trivial. Okay. But of course, some of some I've heard complaints before that, well, you still have to deal with derivations of the functions. Okay, so we don't boil down the algebraic relations between just the solutions. Well, it turns out that in the case of, again, in the case In the case of again, in the case of a general Schwartzian equation, so here I'm looking at the Swartzian equation with a general rational function. If I assume that it's strongly minimal, so if I assume that the PV group of a linear equation is SL to C, then what I get, the same statement, if I take n elements and I have an algebraic relations between this function and the derivation, well, Well, we can go a little bit further, and again, this is results with James Freitag and Guy Casal. So, we can go a little bit further. We can actually say that there will be an algebraic relations between the solutions and pair of solutions, but without the derivation. Okay, and so somehow somehow and geometric triviality is key in improving this results and of course using the fact that we are talking working with the Swartzian derivative as well plays quite a bit of role okay but what we are able to do is to say that in general so if you take any Schwarzenegger equation then the only thing that matters is polynomial relations between solutions and without Solutions and without the derivatives. For Fouxian groups, we can do more, and indeed, we can give a full answer to it. Okay, so now this time I'm talking about the rational function. So here I'm talking about the equations for uniformizers of Fouquien group. Okay, so if you look at the statement here, sorry to go back for a second. Sorry to go back for a second. It seems we are talking about distinct solutions and abstract points in a differential field. When we look at the statement of the Axling-Weierstrass theorem, it's about the J function as a monomorphic function, okay? Analytic function. And so it turns out that we are not too far. So when we take any So when we take any solution of the Swartzian equation here, I can use the J gamma and an element of SL2R to write down that solution as J and with an action of G in L C L to R. So somehow every solute, all solutions look like the J function. Like the J function except modular in action of SL2R. And so for us, what this means is what we have to classify is, in the case of the J gamma, all polynomials which vanish on J T, J gamma t, and J gamma g t. Okay, so that is So, that is quite a bit of simplification. We can't do that if we're working with a general. So, here this works when we work with the rational function for the j gamma. Okay, so that's what we need to do. We need to classify an all polynomial that vanishes on two solutions like that. I would add. That. I would add an important remark here: is that, as I said, when we want to prove the axiom and Weistrass theorem, we want to take A in the function field of variety, and we want to look at J gamma of A. But it's not the case that J gamma of A will satisfy a Swordian equation here, that Swordian equation, okay? So An equation, okay? So that one has to be careful. We'll come back to that later. And so let's do this. Let's try and classify all polynomials that vanish on those j gammas and j gamma g t's. To do that, we look at the commensurator. So remember, two groups are commensurable if the intersection. Commensurable if the intersection has finite index in both. Okay, so the commensurator of a Fouxian group gamma is all the G's in SL2R such that the conjugate is commensurable with gamma. And so we've seen yesterday in talk arithmetic Fuchsian groups. And so a deep result of Margulis states that a Fuchsian group is a States that a Fukushima group is arithmetic if and only if gamma has infinite index in the commensurator. Okay, so this is just to tie it up a little bit with yesterday. But for us, what we are able to prove is that those functions, j gamma t and j gamma g t are algebraically dependent if and only if If and only if g comes from the commensurator. Okay? And so somehow, and to mimic the J function situation, when we take an element of a commensurator, the polynomial that witness that these two functions are algebraically dependent, we call them gamma special. We call them gamma-special polynomials. So for the j functions, these are the modular polynomials. Okay, and so it's well known that these polynomials exist. And so what we show is basically the only possible algebraic relations between the J gammas comes from these gamma special polynomials. Okay, and from this, we can state the version of the The version of the Axiom Lindemann Bay stress theorem that we have. Again, the setting is exactly the same. Now I replace geodesically independent by gamma geodesically independent. So these are when the AIs are related by an L-meth of a commensurator, that is when there is a gamma spatial polynomial between them, between the J's. Okay, and so the state. Okay, and so the statement follows. Okay, so if you have n functions in the function field and they are gamma geodesically independent, so if you rule out these gamma special polynomials, then all the functions and the derivatives are algebraically independent over C of V. Okay, and so the work on strong liminality and geometric triviality shows Reality shows that these gamma special polynomials are the one, and there's nothing other. Okay. So let me just say that, of course, when gamma is arithmetic, this work has non-trivial intersections with the work of Pila Pilat, Ulmoya Five, Klinger Ulmoya Five. And I would say that in And I would say that in many cases, most of his work are the axioman viestras without derivative. But somehow for the case of gamma, the axioman weiestrus without derivative was known. But so our work really gives a general proof that tackles both the arithmetic case and the non-arithmetic case all at once. Okay, and this is just a quick comment that, as I mentioned before. Quick comment that, as I mentioned before, if A is in the function field of a variety, it's not the case that it satisfies a Swartzian equation as before, but it satisfies what we call a fiber of a Swartzian equation. And so what we do is what you saw here, classifying, proving that it's strongly minimal, geometrically trivial, and that the only The only polynomials of the gamma special polynomials somehow is what you have to do not only for the when the case when it's a zero fiber, you have to do it also for the non-zero fibers. And this is key for the proof of the axiom and by stress theorem. Okay, so in the in a few few any questions? So I'll say a few words about Different setting there's no question maybe I do have a question, yeah. So these fibers, I mean, are they somehow similar in structure? Yes, so somehow what I can tell you what you have, you have that it's gonna be strongly minimal, trivial, and somehow trivial, like when it's Trivia, like when it's somehow the only possible relation comes from gamma spatial polynomial. And you also have that when you look at different fibers, they are orthogonal. But you can, I mean, it's not like a torso over the over a group or something like that. It's not like you can identify these fibers between them. Uh no, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. And so, quickly, I'm running out of time, but I think I have a few more minutes. So, let me just bring back, this is something I've stated before. For the general Swordian equation, we have this very, I think, quite good theorem that tells us that you only have relationships. Relations that come from polynomials. Okay, so if you have to have, if you want to have algebraic dependency between solution and derivative, then it must be because there's a pair and a polynomial that vanish between two solutions. The question is, what about, we've dealt with function groups, but what about other conformal mapping? And so I'll just quickly say that in the case of In the case of circular triangles, so here you remember D was an R-sided polygon. So if we look at the circular triangle, that's one of the only cases where you can explicitly write down the rational function in terms of the angles, so alpha, beta, gamma. Okay, and this is the rational function that you have. Okay, Okay, and so since you are able to write down the equation, so oh yeah, so let me just say that the function, the conformal mapping in this scales are what we call the Swartz triangle function, and the equation is what we call the Schwarz triangle equation. And so by a generic triangle equation, we mean an OD. We mean an ODE where the alpha, beta, gamma are algebraically independent over Q. Okay. And so what we are able to do is we are able to, for the generic triangle, so generic SARS triangle equation, we are able to show that it's strongly minimal and that those p don't exist. Okay, so if I take n distinct solution. I take n distinct solutions that are not algebraic over any base field I want, then when I look at the collection of solutions and derivative, I have that they are algebraic independence. So basically there are no gamma special polynomial or no polynomial at all that exists in this case. And I'll just say that the ingredients in the proof are here. So basically we use the result we had. Use the result we had with James Freitag and Kikesa. What we tackled there is we tackled triangle groups, Fujian triangle groups. Again, this was in the talk yesterday. And the key idea here is that the commensurator, how large the commensurator determines completely whether they are finitely many gamma spatial polynomials or whether they are infinitely Or whether there are infinitely many. So, for example, for the arithmetic Fuxian group, we have that it has infinite index, and that what equates to is that there are infinitely many gamma spatial polynomials. So, in the case where the commensurator equals the group itself, that's the case where the group is maximal, it's called maximal, and where there are no gamma special. There are no gamma special polynomials. And so, what we use is we use the fact that the set of parameters, KLM, where the maximality holds, where the triangle group is maximal, is Zariski dense in C3. And so if there were a polynomial at a generic level, then because the parameters are generic, we are able to use the fact that where it's maximum. Fact that the way it's maximal is RSCI dense to show that there are no gamma special polynomial at all. Okay. And so I think that's it for my talk. Right, so let's thank Ronnie. Thank you very much. Is there any question? Okay, so if not, we can discuss later in the coffee break. Right, so let's find the speaker again. Did you stop the recording, Jason? Let me just stop it right now. Thanks. So, what time are the coffee breaks?
