I'm going to be talking to you all about some unknotting operations and invariance of trivalent spatial graphs. I'm a knot theorist. I'm at VCU, and I'm going to tell you about a variety of different projects in this area. Okay, so my arrow key does not work. Excuse me. Let me go full screen again. Okay, so my collaborators on this project, there are quite a few of them. There are quite a few of them, including two people who were or are students at BCU, Matthew and Ray, and my collaborators, Ken Baker, Dorothy Buck, Danielle O'Donnell, and Scott Taylor. So a knot, of course, we're all familiar with knots. They're embeddings of S1 into S3, and a link is, of course, a collection of knots. And we have had mention today of spatial graphs. So a lot of what Today, of spatial graphs. So, a lot of what I'm going to talk about pertains to trivalent spatial graphs. So, these are going to be regular degree theory. And one thing that arises when you consider spatial graphs is they're like knots, but they're also not like knots, in the sense that a knot is truly a sub-manifold of S3. But when you deal with a spatial graph, it is a one-complex. And sometimes that subtlety of dealing with something that's not really a manifold makes things harder, which Manifold makes things harder, which I'll return to a few times. One of the spatial graphs that is really captured my interest lately has been the theta curve. And so what a theta curve is in particular is just an embedding of the actual theta graph, the abstract graph that has two vertices connected by three edges. And so I have some pictures on the slide of some theta curves. Theta curves have a lot of nice properties, but one of them is that they're Of nice properties, but one of them is that there are correspondences between them and strongly invertible knots and knotoids. So the additional word here is simple. What a simple theta curve means is that one of the constituent knots is an unknot. When you have a theta curve, you can take a pair of edges and you get a knot, and there are three constituent knots. As long as one of them is an unknot, then you can describe this object as a strongly invertible knot or as a knot toy. Invertible knot or as a knotoid by kind of stretching the knotted component out and then regarding that third edge as being kind of half of your strongly invertible knot. So I won't stay too long on the motivation from biology slide because you all are the experts in this. But there's a lot of great reasons why you would want to study knots or theta curves if you're concerned with the DNA topology. You're concerned for the DNA topology. One of the reasons is because you might be interested in studying enzymatic actions. And this is something that I've definitely thought about before. And here's two classic images from the 1980s where a knot was found in a plasmid of E. coli. One of these knots was created by type 2 topoisomerase, the other one was created by site-specific recombinase. And if you are interested in understanding And if you are interested in understanding the structure, the mechanism of these reactions, then it's helpful to think sometimes of these structures as being knots and the actions mediated by these enzymes as being an operation, an unknown operation on the knot, like a crossing change or a banding. This image comes from the NOT protein database, the paper about the NOT protein database. So, this is not my image. Database, so this is not my image, but I just wanted to point out that there's a lot of different things that are sort of like knots, a lot of knotted structures in nucleic acids for which the tools of knot theory can help you to analyze or study any or all of them. So not just knots and links or spatial graphs, but also knotoids and other structures, deterministic knots, probabilistic knots, and other things that are described in this database. So, this is a good resource that's out there and demonstrates that you might And demonstrates that you might be interested in some kind of knotted structure, maybe not a mathematical knot, but that there are still tools here that could be of use. So with that kind of broad motivation, then from my perspective as a knot theorist, there's a lot of different things that I want to do. I want to tabulate and distinguish and characterize all these different entangled objects. So be able to tell when something is or isn't knotted or when it is or isn't the same knotted structure. Isn't the same knotted structure and to organize them in a reasonable way. And then, along with that goal comes trying to understand which object is the simplest. If I am going to be modeling some sort of action in the cell, then I want to know what is most likely, and I don't want to make it an arbitrarily complicated situation. So, in terms of a knotting operations, that's kind of asking about which is the closest. Asking about which is the closest to the unknot and which is the closest to the unknown if I'm doing crossing changes or if I'm doing band surgery or something else, sometimes gets a different answer. So, another kind of broad goal then is to develop the topological invariants and tools of entangled objects. So, when you have developed a new knot invariant, then you want to know how it changes and how it behaves under crossing changes, bandings, and other ways of modifying your knot into a knot. Ways of modifying your knot into another closely related knot. So, this informs the question of like how are structures formed? If I'm interested in a theta curve that might be used to model something going on in replication, I want to know how it arises. How could it come out of this banding or crossing chain? I also want to use the non-invariants that I developed to study other invariants. So, there may be one invariant that is perhaps easy to define but difficult to compute, then there may be. Difficult to compute, then there may be another invariant which is difficult to define but easy to compute. And you can use one to inform you about the other. And then my own personal motivation involves a lot of problems that are kind of inherent to three and four manifold topology, because that's my perspective. So there's a lot of different nodding variants out there, but some of the ones that are most relevant to the work I'm going to tell you about are a knotting number, the determinant. Are a knotting number, the determinant, signature, Alexander polynomial, and then some other invariants that are related to the branched covering spaces of the knot complement. There's a lot of ones on this list, but I have over here an example worked out for the trefoil. So the unknotting number of the trefoil is one. It's an integer. The determinant and the signature are both integer value non-invariants, but they become more complicated after that. The Alexander polynomial is a polynomial. And then this notation, sigma. And then this notation sigma, what this is going to mean is a branched covering space associated with this knot. So that's a sort of auxiliary topological space. It's a three-dimensional topological space that captures a lot of the topology of the knot. And having created that space, you can calculate its homology, you can calculate its Hager philosophy, and do all kinds of other things. So the projects that I'm going to go over will deal with statements about a nodding number, determinant, and signature. Determinant and signature. The notion of the branched covering space is sort of implicit in all of them. But you'll see these invariants pop up again and again. A knotting number is possibly the most well-known knot invariant. It's definitely one of the easier ones to describe. It's the minimum number of crossing changes to do to turn a knot into an unknot. And that's just a diagram-independent definition. So this means overall diagram. So, this means overall diagrams, or if you're thinking about your knot as being embedded in a three-dimensional space, you can give a diagram-independent definition of a crossing change, but it doesn't depend on the diagram. A knotting number is easy to describe, but it's notoriously difficult to compute. And I have an example here to illustrate kind of why it's so tricky. This example is due independently to Bliler and to Nakanishi, and it is the NOT 10-8. So, on the left is So, on the left is a minimal crossing diagram. It has 10 crossings, and you would need to change at least four of the crossings in this minimal diagram or any minimal diagram in order to unknot this knot. But if you were to take this knot and draw it in a non-optimal way with 14 crossings, then you can actually find a more efficient unknotting sequence using these three highlighted crossings. So, there are no minimal crossing diagrams. No minimal crossing diagrams that will give you an unodding number of three. You really have to push it to this 14 crossing diagram. So it can be very tricky to compute. Not only is it difficult to compute for arbitrary knots, there's a lot that's still unknown about a knotting number. We don't even know what the unknotting number of all the 10 crossing knots is. So there are bounds, but even for such small knots, it's still not known. And another major problem. And another major problem in knot theory is that we do not know whether a knotting number is additive under connected sum. Connected sum is the most basic operation by which you add two knots together. You basically splice them together. It should be the case that the unknotting number of k1 plus k2 is the unknotting number of k1 plus the unknotting number of k2, but even that is open. The strongest result in that direction is due to Charlemagne in the 1980s, and it is that I'm not even. In the 1980s, and it is that unknotting number one knots are prime. So, if you have two knots, say for example, the figure-eight knot and the trefoil, these are both unknotting number one knots. You can at least say that the connect sum of these two knots is greater than one. But we still don't have additivity in general. So one would like to prove the open problem, whether a knotting number is additive under connect sum, but if it is out of reach, you might think about other knotted structures for which you could make some progress. Structures for which you could make some progress. So, a natural place to go is to spatial graphs. So, is it possible for us to prove something like this for spatial graphs? So, in order to pose this question about spatial graphs, you have to be a little bit careful, though. So, the first problem that arises is what does it mean to be an unknotted spatial graph? And if your graph is not planar, it's not clear that there's a good answer to that question. But when your graph is planar, then you can But when your graph is planar, then you can refer to it being unknotted or not. And a planar graph is unknotted if it can be isotoped to lie on the sphere. So in my figure, I have a planar graph. In one of the drawings, it looks planar. In the other drawing, it doesn't look planar, and I can isotope it to lie on the sphere. Now, if I go and tie a knot in one of the edges, I now have an embedding of that planar graph, but it's not unknotted anymore because there's a little knot tied in the edge. Abstractly, they are the same graph. Abstractly, they are the same graph. So, if the graph is abstractly planar, old results also imply that there is a unique unknot. So, you can refer to its unknotting number being the minimal number of crossing changes to get to the unknot. Another issue that arises when you deal with spatial graphs is how you add them together. When you have knots or links, when you have an oriented knot and another oriented knot, connected sum is well-defined. Oriented knot, connected sum is a well-defined operation. When you have spatial graphs, there's two ways to carry that out. You can connect some them along an edge, or you could connect some them at a vertex. And we call these order two and order three connected sums. So you don't have to look far to find examples where it starts to get a bit hairied. So if you calculate the unknotting number of this theta curve, it is one. And if you calculate the unknotting number by changing this clasp of the hand. Unknotting number by changing this clasp of the handcuff graph, it is also one. But if you vertex sum them together at the vertex, then the unknotting number of their sum is still one. You can use the same clasp move that you use for the handcuff graph. So this is subadditive. So the best that we can do is to prove a version of Charlemagne's theorem for theta curves, just theta curves. And the statement is basically the same statement. We just have to consider the two different ways of Have to consider the two different ways of doing a connect sum. So, if the unknotting number of the theta curve is one, then either it's prime with respect to both operations, or it is the connected sum of a trivial theta curve and an unknotting number one not. Besides proving Charlamin's theorem for theta curves, we also gave a more general version of the statement where instead of just doing crossing changes, we did proper rational tangle replacements. That's a bit of a mouthful, but basically what it means. Of a mouthful, but basically, what it means is that you can take out a small tangle and you can put in another small tangle that's sufficiently simple, and then we get the same type of theorem statement. So, the unknotting number with respect to that operation, and then an identical statement otherwise. So, to go about proving this involved some exceptional surgery theory and a lot of manifold topology. So, studying data curves. So, studying theta curves means really in some way that you're studying two string tangles. In Professor Kaufman's talk earlier today, we saw kind of a strategy of taking a spatial graph and then taking out a vertex and putting in a tangle. We're doing something quite similar here, except we're going to remove an edge and then put in a tangle where the edge was. That's another method of taking our spatial graph and converting it into a knot or link. Or link. And if you were to contract that edge, it would basically be the same thing. So there's a proposition that we prove in doing this, which is the sort of tangle version of the previous theorem. And that statement is that if you have a marked tangle sum of tangles, neither of which is integral, then no crossing change will take you to an integral tangle. Integral here just means you can have like horizontal twists. The proof of this proposition. The proof of this proposition is complicated, and there is involved case analysis. But one part of it uses this sort of special tangle row. And to give you a flavor of kind of how it works, there's a lot of cool facts about this particular tangle row, which is pictured in pink. It's not rational. It's not a tangle sum. It has no essential Conway sphere. The numerator closure is the unknot. And the denominator closure is the not 10, 139. knot 10 139 which is just some 10 crossing knot but it has a good property and it's that it's a knotting number is pretty high the knotting number we of 10 139 we do know and it is four we also know it's proper rational um unknotting number as well so how we use rho is basically in the role of a proof by contradiction we assume that the tangle sum t1 plus t2 admits a crossing change to an integral tangle and then what we do is we add in the And then, what we do is we add in a tangle row. In doing so, we get a knot, and we know a lot about that knot. We know that this knot, we know that this knot is an unknotting number one knot with an essential Conway sphere. And that's enough information for us to then come at it with the toolkit from three-manifold topology. So, we apply work of Gordon and Lucy and Eudabe Munoz, and some additional work of Charlotte, and are able to essentially arrive at a control. Essentially, we arrive at a contradiction. And the contradiction is with the unknotting number of the denominator closure of that knot. In particular, we conclude it has to be a nodding number one, and it's a nodding number four. And that's sort of the flavor of that result about a nodding number. So, I want to tell you about a couple other results about other non-invariants and things we can say about them when we think about spatial graphs and how to take these non-invariant. About spatial graphs and how to take these non-invariants and kind of port them over to the world of spatial graphs and theta curves. This is a project that was joint with my students at BCU, and it is about the determinant of a theta curve. So as I mentioned before, when you have a theta curve, you've got three constituent unknots. That's what's pictured here, K1, 2, K13, and K23. And the result of our theorem statement is that the determinant of the theta curve is the product of the determinants of those knots. That's a very sensible statement. It's what you want. That's a very sensible statement. It's what you want to be true. In this case, it's one times one times three, giving you what you would expect the determinant of something that looks like the truff oil to be. So our theorem statement is that the determinant of theta is the product of the determinants of the constituent knots, but it is not how we are defining the determinant of theta. It is something that we prove about the determinant of theta. So, how is it that we actually define the determinant of theta then? And here's where we thought about the situation. And here's where we thought about the situation in knot theory. In knot theory, the determinant of a knot has a lot of different definitions that are equivalent to each other. One way is that it's the Alexander polynomial evaluated at minus one. Another way is that it's the Jones polynomial evaluated at minus one. Yet another way is that you can take the determinant of v plus v transpose, where v comes from a ceifert surface for the knot. It's the ceifert form. And then another equivalent definition. And then another equivalent definition is that it's the order of a homology group of that auxiliary space associated to the knot. So here's where we brush up against the problem of graphs, and that's that we're not dealing with a one manifold. We're dealing with a one complex. So perhaps we would like to think about the determinant as being something that comes from a Ceifert surface, but we don't have a Ceifert surface. We have a two complex whose boundary is the spatial graph. As the spatial graph. So, what we did is we decided to use the last item on the list, which is the homology of a branched covering space. We won't quite use the branched double cover. We use something different. But that is what we use to define the determinant of theta because it most readily translates into the world of spatial graphs. So, here, essentially, what we do is we take a simple theta curve and we take a branch double control, we branch double control. Double control, we branch double cover over the unknotted component, lift up that third edge, which becomes then a strongly invertible knot, and then we branch double cover once more. It's an iterated branch double cover. By this iterative process, we arrive at the three-manifold that is what we call the Klein cover of the three-sphere branched over the theta curve. And the reason why we use the word Klein is because there's an associated deck group with this, and that's the Klein 4 group. And that's the Klein floor group. So, as I mentioned before, when you're dealing with the simple theta curve, you can go back and forth between other structures like strongly invertible knots or knotoids. And we found it very convenient to think of our simple theta curve through that branched covering construction as being basically a strongly invertible knot. And what a strongly invertible knot is, is it's not with a special kind of symmetry, a Z2 symmetry. So you can take your knot and involute. You can take your knot and involute it and quotient by that involution, and that's what's pictured on this slide. You go from the strongly invertible knot to its quotient under the involution, the axis becomes the unknotted component. And there is some additional three-manifold topology that tells you when you have an involution of the three-sphere, and that means when you have an involution of the three-sphere, the fixed point set actually has to be an unknown. So that's So that's from the Smith conjecture. So we can go back and forth between these two pictures of what we're dealing with. And the upshot is that for simple theta curves, at least, the determinant of theta is the determinant of the strongly invertible knot. And given the strongly invertible knot, we can calculate it with some classical techniques. We can use Garrett's matrices and or take graphs. This is a method for calculating the This is a method for calculating the determinant of a knot where you actually calculate a determinant of a matrix. So you take a checkerboard coloring or a graph of the checkerboard coloring, which is called a take graph. And what you do is you build a matrix and then you take a cofactor. You end up thrusting out a row and a column and taking the determinant of that. And what it really is, is a kind of instantiation of the matrix tree theorem from graph theory. So this is an old theorem that's due often. Old theorem that's due often to it's often attributed to Kirchhoff. Sometimes I see it attributed to Tut or Bot and Mayberry, and there's lots of different versions of it. But it basically says that if you take the determinant of a graph Laplacian, which is the degree minus the adjacency matrix, you get the number of spanning trees of the graph. And that is a calculation method for arriving at the determinant of a knot. But thinking of it in that graph theoretic way gives us a way to understand the constituents as well. So as it turns out, some kind of So, as it turns out, some combinatorialists looked at graphs that had an involutive symmetry, and they came up with a product formula for dealing with determinants, for dealing with the number of spanning trees. And their spanning tree enumeration formula is what's on the slide, says that the number of spanning trees of your graph with symmetry is basically the number of spanning trees of a left graph and a right graph. But left and right graph don't mean subgraph or induced subgraph. Subgraph or induce subgraph, it's a little bit more complicated than that. You take some of the pieces on the left and you add a vertex. You modify edge weights if it's a weighted graph, or you take some of the pieces on the right and you subdivide along the edges. So there's a bit of a procedure to produce these pictures, but they have this formula. So what my students and I did is dig deep into what this formula meant, and we discovered that the left and right graphs that you see in their formula for enumeration. Formula for enumerating spanning trees are exactly the take graphs that you get out of the constituent knots when you pass to this quotient under the involution. So we start with our strongly invertible knot, and we have two different kind of quotients, and they correspond perfectly with the two terms that occur in this formula by the combinatorialists about spanning trees. So it's a very fun combinator project. Okay, so one invariant that I haven't mentioned anything about yet is signature, and I have a couple minutes left, so I'll tell you about some recent work with my collaborators where we're trying to understand how to use signature and slice Euler characteristic to bound a knotting number for trimalog graphs. So there's a great old result of Murasugi from the 1960s that says. 60s that says that the signature is a lower bound on the unknotting number of a knot. And more specifically, there's three terms in the bound involving this signature, the smooth4 genus and the unknotting number. So chi4 here means Euler characteristic, and more specifically, it means the Euler characteristic of a smoothly embedded surface in the four-ball. So it's a kind of a four-dimensional thing. Four-dimensional thing. And we find it convenient to write this bound in terms of the orbifold Euler characteristic, which we do. And then because there's this useful result that you see a lot in knot theory, we wanted to give a version of it for data curves and more generally for other trivalent graphs. So we weren't the first people to think of signature trivalent graphs. It's probably been thought of by a bunch of different people, but in By a bunch of different people, but in Gilles and Robert in 2018 defined and studied signature for Klein graphs in particular using foams. What a foam is, is our sort of generalization of our cipher surface. As I mentioned before, we kind of have a difficulty in that we're not dealing with manifolds. So instead, this is a two-complex whose boundary is our trivalent graph. And our trivalent graphs, we're thinking of having a particular coloring where we've used three colors to color it. Where we've used three colors to color it, which is related to the way that we think about its covering spaces. And the result that we have in progress right now that we should be done with soon is almost the theorem statement that's on the slide, but not quite. The theorem statement on the slide is a bit of a lie. This is what we would like it to say, which would be the cleanest generalization of Murasuki's statement. Basically, giving a bound where we have signature on the left. Signature on the left, Gordian distance, which is related to unknown number on the right, and then a slice or characteristic in the middle. But it's not quite this because there are complications. So in the inequality, the distance that we deal with, there's really two types of crossing changes. There's crossing changes between edges, on an edge with itself, but there can be crossing changes between two different kinds of edges. And so that complicates the. Of edges, and so that complicates the notion of how you do crossing changes and how we measure distance. And then there's other terms that show up in these inequalities that make it messier than what's shown on the slide, including the nullity of the constituent links, the number of the components of the constituent links, and then some combinatorial data about the foam, like its number of vertices, its number of seam vertices, and then there's some additional complications about how we think about orientability. About how we think about orientability in this situation. So, the actual theorem statement has like very long, ugly inequalities. But the good news is that when we state it for theta curves in particular, most of the stuff vanishes and it does become this really nice set of inequalities, just like Marasuki's theorem. So, that is our corollary, and I am going to stop and thank you for your attention.
