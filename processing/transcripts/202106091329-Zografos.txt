The authors introduced this equation here in order to evaluate the instantaneous extensibility. And what you see here, you can see the trace of the conformation tensor. And then you can see this k star parameter, which is given by this long function, which is nothing more than just a function of the instantaneous extensibility, the maximum extensibility, and then an M star parameter, which again, it is again the fraction of the maximum extensibility to the instantaneous extensibility. Maximum extensibility to the instantaneous extensibility. And as a parameter, its condition will always be larger than one. Now, here in the right-hand side, you can see a Z parameter, which by just modifying its value, we can control the growth of the stresses. We will see some results on that later on. And a very interesting effective Weiserberg number that they proposed, which you can see here on the left-hand side, and it's defined in this way, where lambda is the relaxation time. The relaxation time, and the next here corresponds to the maximum migrant value of an effective CRA tensor. And the effective CRA tensor was given in this form, in which you can see that it's similar to the actual CRA tensor, but the difference is that it has this S parameter, which multiplies only the non-diagonal elements of the tensor. And in that sense, it was employed in order to control the onset of the sear thinning. I want to make clear how. Sear thinning. I want to make clear, however, that this effective CRA tensor is not used in the momentum equation, but it's only used in here in order to evaluate the effective Weisenberg number, which we will see later on, that it's like a local Weisenberg number of the flow. Now, how, let's move now to the actual extensibility and how the actual extensibility is evaluated. So, the authors proposed this evolution equation, where here on the left-hand side, you can see the time term. Where here on the left-hand side you can see the time term, and then on the right-hand side, you can see two terms where the first one is related to the stiffening process of the molecule as the molecule is stretched. And then the final term here is related to a relaxing process. Now, the k parameter that you see here that doesn't have the star, so it's like the actual regime, let's say. And it's the same function as before, but now it's just a function of the actual extensibility department. It's just a function of the actual extensibility parameter and the maximum extensibility parameter with m defined in a similar way as before. Now, as you can see now here, in this first term, there is an f function which multiplies the term that is related to the stiffening process. And it's evaluated by the outer product of two normal vectors. Now, the first vector is the unit vector, which is parallel to the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue of the effective CRA tensor that we saw in the previous. Effective CRA tensor that we saw in the previous slide. And Na is a unit vector, it's a singular unit vector, which is parallel to the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue of the confirmation tensor. Okay? Now, how we are solving the equations? We're starting first by, once we have an approximation of our velocity field, we evaluate the effective CRA, the effective Israelite number and the trace of the conformation tensor. And from here, we evaluate the instantaneous extensibility. And then, once we have the value of the instantaneous extensibility, we plug it. Extensibility, we plug it into the equation of the actual extensibility, we get the value of the actual extensibility, and then from there we evaluate the evolution of the conformation tensor, where you can see that the actual extensibility exists in this f-tone and f-tone b, f-tone a and f-tone b functions. And then once we have the values of the conformation tensor, then we translate it to the polymeric stress by using the Crammer's rule. Now, in the next slide, I'm going to show you how this I'm going to show you the solutions for these equations for study. Show you the solutions for these equations for standard viscometric flows to see what the model is able to predict, and then I will show you some results based on our implementation of these equations on top of our in-house CFD solver that was originally developed by our colleagues in Porto and it's a finite volume solver and follows the log information approach. You can find lots of information in these publications down here. Now let's start with seeing how the adaptive length scale. With seeing how the adaptive length scale model, the closed form of the model, performs in standard viscometric flows. So, the two kinds of flows that I'm going to show you is the steady state planar extension of law and the steady state shear flow. Now, starting with the case of the steady state planar extension of law, you can see here how the effective Weiserberg number will be. And as it was also identified by Gauss et al. in their paper, what we expect here, we expect that for this particular flow and the uniaxial flow, This particular flow and the uniaxial flow, all the steady-state extension flows, pure extension flows, the instantaneous extensibility should not change from the maximum extensibility. This will have as a result that also the actual extensibility will be exactly the same with the maximum extensibility. So at the end of the, so at the very end, what we expect, we expect to see a similar behavior with the Phine P. And this is exactly what we saw when we're solving for a maximum extensibility of a 300. You can see that in terms of the extensional viscosity, we get exactly the same behavior with the Fini P. Exactly the same behavior with the Phinep when matching the extensibility parameters. Also, you can also see that in terms of the first normal stress differences, you can see the same behavior. Now, another thing to point here is that this behavior is independent of the values of the parameters of S that is in the effective CRA tensor and the Z, which is used for the instantaneous extensibility. Now, let's go to the steady state CR flows. Now, let's go to the steady state CR flow. So, you can see now down here, you can see the form of the effective CRA tensor. And what I'm going to show you now, I'm just going to change the Z value and I'm going to keep S equal to 1 and for a maximum extensibility of 300 and see the behaviors that the model predicts. So, this is what the model predicts at steady states here flow. So, you can see here the behavior of the actual extensibility at the very low Weiser Bank numbers. It's not changing, so it's exactly the same as the Phineas. Changing, so it's exactly the same as the FiniP, but at intermediate values, you can see that it's decreasing, reaching to a minimum, and then asymptotically it reaches back again to the Finip limit. And here on the right-hand side in this graph, you can see the behavior of the first element of the conformation tensor, which is actually the dominant term in this kind of law. Now, if we start changing the Z value, you can see the different responses that we are able to obtain. You can see it's a similar behavior, but with a different. Similar, similar behavior, but with a different minima. And if we if we push it even further, you can see that we see no changes for the actual extensibility. And as a matter of fact, at this limit, we are obtaining exactly the same solution with the FiniP. So the FiniP is recovered. Now, in terms of the sear thinning, you can see that the model is not predicting any huge differences in terms of the sear thinning for the different Z values. But if we plot this in terms of But if we plot this in terms of the first normal stress difference, you can see the regime where the difference is, most of the differences are occurring. After that, you can see that they are matching. And here in the insert, you can see the behavior of the first normal stress coefficient. Now, let's go now to see how the model performs and our implementation in simple and complex fluid flows. Now, the first simplest case that we decided to start with is just the simplest. Decided to start with. It's just the simplest case that one can start with, is just a 2D straight channel where the flow is coming from this side, it goes from that side, where the characteristic Weiserberg number is defined like this based on the average velocity. And so we've implemented, we wanted to see if the solver is able to predict the responses that I just saw you. So we did creeping flow conditions and we simulated these cases for dilute polymer solution of 0.9 at the characteristic value. Resolution of 0.9 and the characteristic Weisenberg number of 10, where the maximum extensibility is set to be at 300, where we keep the S parameter equal to unit and we're just changing the Z value, the Z parameter. So now you can picture what I've told you before about this effective Weiserbeck number and how it is acting like a local Weiserbeck number. So you can see that in the central line and in a region around the central line, it's zero. And as we're going closer to the Zero and as we're going closer to the walls, it starts to increase. Now, then in this counterplots, here you can see for the different values of Z, you can see the different responses that we get for the actual extensibility, where you can see for Z equal to one, you can see a thin region where BS is not changing and changes after as it goes closer to the wall. Whereas for the Z equal to four, you can see a larger region where this BS is not changing. And then you can see now the different responses in terms of the first element. Different responses in terms of the first element of the conformation tensor, which again in this flow is the dominant term. You can see the different responses that we can obtain. So we wanted to see if actually the numerical implementation is matching with what the expected behavior from the steady-state shear flow solutions are. So we just took a transverse profile and we compared our results. And you can see that we have an excellent agreement between the two solutions. The two solutions. So we were sure that we are solving the correct equations correctly. So going to the case that motivated this work, which is the flow in a 4-to-1 contraction. So you can see here the mesh and you can see the definitions of the absent width and how the geometry is defined with the absent width and downstream width. And this is how we define the characteristic evisor-width number. And we're considering creeping flow conditions and we're performing the simulations, looking not only for steady. Simulations looking not only for steady-state solutions. The results I'm going to show you are for the cases of dilute polymer solutions where the maximum extensibility is said to be a 1500, where now I'm keeping Z the same and I'm only varying S. And I'm going to show you also the equivalent responses for these flows for the Finity. Now, here you can see the solutions that we obtain on the top counterplot. You can see how the actual extensibility is changing. Extensibility is changing inside the development region, and in this down here, in the control flow down here, you can see the first normal stress differences, which is only for the polymeric, doesn't contain the solvent. It's on the polymeric part. And you can see how BS is changing inside the region. So the equivalent of the FiniP would be as if everywhere it was red, as everywhere it was 1500. Okay, it wouldn't change. So as we increase the Weiserbeck number, you can see the different kind of responses that we are able to obtain. Are you able to obtain? You can see how BS is changing, and you can also see how the corner vortex is altering, is changing. Now, to have a comparison with the FiniP for this case, here you can see the solution that they just presented to you for the LSE. And down here, you can see the equivalent Finip. In the instant, you see the actual extensibility. And as we increase the Weiserbeck number, you can see now the different kind of solutions that we're getting for the two models. two the two models um also for in terms in terms of obviously for the for the n1 but also in terms of the vortex and and and and the the the vortices that they are forming you can see here we have a leap vorticy vortex where here we don't have and now just moving moving to the case where we have the i'm just changing the s parameter so so here you see that the previous solutions for which s was equal to one and down here the case where s is equal to two and you can see the different um the different Different behaviors and the different response of the actual extensibility. And if we increase the Weisermeg number, you can see the differences between these two cases. Now, going to the most interesting thing from where we started, and we wanted to see if we are able, what the model is able to predict in terms of the quite correction. So, what I'm plotting here is just a dust line that indicates the Newtonian value. It's a guide to the eye. Value, it's a guide to the eye, and the other here it just corresponds to the Fini-B solutions where you can see similar response as we saw before. And now you can see for the ALSE that for the Z and S is equal to one, and now for Z1 and S equal to two, you can see the different response that we are getting. The important thing is that it's correcting the FiniP response. Remember that for this, for at steady-state extension of law, we have the same exact responses, but you can see here we have we are able. Here we have we are able to predict an enhancement in some enhancements in pressure drop, and we believe that it has the potential as a model to by tuning its parameters to produce better results. So with that, and before I conclude, I would like to thank both Fernando and Manuel for all the very interesting discussions that we had during the implementation procedure. And thank you both for helping me with some issues that I had. And with that, I'm just going to leave you with my conclusion. Leave you with my conclusions and thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Costis. Was quite nice. Thank you. There's a comment from Ian. I don't know if he wants to further comment on that. I was trying to guess the final number. You got quite some pace there, Costas. It's slides per minute. You you are the winner, for sure. No, no, you No, no, that's the problem when you're using Linux. When you're using Linux and you have to create presentations, then you have to find ways around it. So the number here corresponds exactly to the number of effects of changing, you know. So this one is just, it's the same slide, but it's just changing the. So yeah. You still got the trophy. Okay. Okay, thanks. There is now a question from Esteban. Esteban, do you want to comment? Yeah, thanks very much, Anuil. Costi's really nice work. Thank you, thank you, Steban. Yeah, I saw you referred one of our papers. And indeed, I want to ask you a couple of things on this stuff. Firstly, I know that you are solving a planar flow. Yes. Solving a planar flow, which is somehow different to an axisymmetric flow. My question is: what's your measure of extension rate in complex flow for that plane of flow? Sorry, the measure, sorry, I think I said the measure of the extensional the extensional rate for flow. I mean, there's some combinations of invariants. Yes, okay, yep, yep. But my question is what what's the one you you used? What's the one you used? Well, we didn't actually use the invariance. I know, I know what you're talking. You're talking, you have seen in your papers also that you're using the invariance. And correct me if I'm wrong, in order to approximate the response of your model, right? Indeed, we kind of calculate from the field, the extension or shear rates, and then input them into the models, yes. Okay, okay. Yes, so in the solutions, we are not. Solutions, we are not actually using specific invariants. No, no, okay, because that could help you in that paper of 2019 that you mentioned, there is some information about it, so it can help you to enhance your corrections. So just maybe it may be useful. Okay, yeah, that's great. Yeah, thank you very much. By the way, let me also say something in the continuation in the Webster paper, Webster et al. paper, I think it was Planar Flows, right? Yeah, it's the same configuration, yes. Yeah, okay, okay, the same configuration, okay. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And the other question, if I may, Manuel? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. There, we just basically boost extensional response of the model using a Weitz met in our time combination, and we assign that to like an extensional dissipation mechanism. Also, this new molecular type proposal that you have, is there any mechanism that? that you have is there any mechanism the physical mechanism that you are assigning to this enhancement in in in the quote version a physical mechanism i mean other than other than the than the equations that i just presented before no it's not something that it comes to my mind so because i i see it comes from the extensibility that you're estimating but uh we say that it's an uh something that is related to the viscosity itself that enhances uh my question is My question is: if there's a thought like that for you. I'm not sure I get that, to be honest. Yeah. Well, maybe we can discuss after. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay. Thanks very much. Yeah, thanks. Thank you. Do you want to? Yeah, hello. Can you hear me? Yes, hello. Yeah. Hi, Constantin. This was really a nice talk. I really enjoyed it all.
