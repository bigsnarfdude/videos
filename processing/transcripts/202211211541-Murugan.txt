And uh so for the analyst for example, you see this formula. I mean just by looking at this formula right away, you see that when p equal to n, something special happens. That is some kind of scale invariance, if you will. If you replace r by lambda r, in fact, that is, you can say much more in n-dimensional Riemann manifolds. 20 equals n, you have conformed invariance. And so, how can we detect this kind of dimension just by using peak capacities in a rather rough setting where you just have a metric space, don't necessarily have gradients or any smooth structure. So this is kind of the main question and and there is a a beautiful theorem of Carrasco that I'll be talking about. Of Carrasco that I'll be talking about, and a slight generalization of that tries to identify the dimension of a metric space in terms of certain estimates on capacity of angulars. So I'll start with, so we don't have a nice notion of gradient, so we'll be working with some kind of combinatorial version of capacity. This is the notion of combinatorial modulus. So we are going to look at the. Community to a modulus. So, we are going to look at some graph. Ultimately, we'll be approximating a metric space by a sequence of graphs. And if you have a family of paths in this graph, then the p-modulus of this family of paths is you are trying to minimize the total p-mass or the p-th power of the LP norm of this function different on the vertices over all paths that over all atmosphere. You know, or all admissible paths. A path is, sorry, or all admissible metrics rho for this family of paths gamma. A function rho is said to be admissible if you add the value of this row along any path, it should cost you at least one. So I like to think of rho as the cost that you need to pay to trial through a vertex, and the total cost for each path is at least one. And okay, you can also define this notion for functions on the edges instead of row using a slightly modified definition of admissibility. And this is kind of the older notion due to Duff and instead of vertices, which is attributed to Canon. But for bounded degree graphs, which is going to be the setting in our case, these notions are comparable. And this is a small lemma, it's pretty easy to prove. Pretty easy to prove by Hay and Schramm. They studied this notion of vertex version of modulus in connection to circle packings. And if you have a family of paths that join two different sets, that's kind of the typical path family that we would consider in this talk. It actually coincides with the p capacity if we define this function on the edges. If we define this function on the edges, if we define on the vertices, it leads to a comparable quantity. And we are going to, as I said, understand the modulus or capacity between sets using a sequence of graphs at finite, finite scales. So this So, this leads to a notion of a critical exponent that you can associate with the collaborative modulus. This definition is due to Carrasco. So, it comes with a bunch of parameters. It turns out all these parameters are unimportant. So, please bear with me. So, you have three parameters, A, lambda, and L. So, A tells how you are kind of looking at some kind of dyadic or generalized. kind of looking at some kind of dyadic or generalized dyadic scales where you are looking at a maximal a to the minus k separated subset of this metric space. It means that any two distinct points must be separated by distance at least a x to the power minus k and it's maximal in the sense that a larger, a strictly larger subset will no longer be a to the minus k separated. These are sometimes called nets and you can also ensure that Also, ensure that these sets are increasing as you move to final and final states. And define a sequence of graphs where if you have these next xn, we can join kind of two nearby points if the balls of radius lambda times are to the minus n centered at x and y intersect. So this kind of So, this kind of gives a natural way of approximating the metric space by sequence of graphs. And so, this is the critical exponent. So, you look at a family of paths. Here for each x at scale n, which is really at scale minus n, like this, your You want to cross this analyst from radius a to the minus n to radius l times a raise to the minus n, like using a sequence of points in the smaller scale. At scale a to the minus n minus k, that's why you are looking at vertices in this graph g n plus k. So you can kind of think of these graphs as lying on top of each other, and as you move down, as you increase n, these graphs As you increase n, these graphs get to finer and finer scales. And you are trying to look at all paths that cross the analyst at a finer scale, which is k scale is more finer than where you are. And you can define the modulus of this, p modulus of this path family. And you can so I. So, MPK is a we want a uniform control at all locations and scales for this quantity. And MP is the limp as k goes to infinity. And the critical exponent for the common modulus is the smallest p for which m p equals u. One thing that I forgot to mention is that this quantity m p case or m p's. MPKs or MPs, they are all going to be non-increasing. That's because if you look at the definition of modulus, you have this function rho to the power p and even though I wrote rho to be a function from 0 to infinity, it actually doesn't make sense for this function to be larger than 1. So rho to the power is going to, rho to the power p is going to be decreasing as p increases. So, this is a non-cracic quantity, so you can certainly look at the infimum of p such that m p is 0. Okay, this is the definition of critical exponent of parameter modulus by Karasko. So, it kind of gives a, you know, when p is larger than its critical exponent, the modulus goes to 0 in kind of a scale at all scales and locations. And okay, I wrote this as a definition, there are a bunch of things to check. As a definition, there are a bunch of things to check, so we made lots of choices. We have this a lambda l, and we have chosen these sets x, k, but none of these choices matter. So it's a pretty robust notion. And a similar notion is also in a paper of Guta and Kleiner, but they work in a slightly more restricted setting of approximately cells in the cells. Any questions on the definition of? Questions on the definition of this critical NP to be 0 or positive? 0 is good. Because if you increase speed, you are making the modulus more sensitive. So actually if you increase speed, what's happening at the discrete level is that this analysis gets wider and wider, the graph distance gets really big. Graph distance gets really big. So L is fixed. L is fixed. But P has nothing to do with the graph distance, right? P is. P just controls this exponent, P modulus. Right, so I think if you make P larger, it becomes more sensitive. If you become P large, if you make if M P is 0, M P 0. If you make if m p is 0, m p plus epsilon is 0 for n epsilon. So so it actually what's going to happen typically is that it's going to be 0 and basically it's going to show depression at it if you do it on it. So it's so it's different from the continuous model, that's because continuous model. Yeah, there is no scaling here. There is no rescaling of energies, nothing. No, but even without rescaling in the metric. Sorry, I can talk to you. Okay, okay, sure. Okay, okay, sure. So, you know, you can, for example, do this kind of calculations for a unit box in D dimensions and n dimensions, and you can see this kind of picture. So when p is large than n, it's going to be 0, when p is less than n, it's going to be infinity. When p equal to n, it's going to be some fire. Okay, this is kind of another way of writing the same picture of crossing analysts. So you have some scale. Crossing analysts, so you have some scale, some finer scale with more points drawn in, and you're crossing this analyst. And so this is one very parameter notion of dimension that comes from this critical exponent. And now we'll see a kind of more classical version due to a soul. So, a metric space is said to be doubling if you can cover every bot of radius r by n bottles of radius r over 2. That is. Of radius are over 2, where this end doesn't depend on the choice of all. And there is a more quantitative way to say how doubling a space is. This is this notion of a short dimension. It's the infimum of all alpha such that there is some constant. So here instead of covering balls of radius r by balls of radius r over 2, you are going to cover balls of radius r with big r with bolts of radius little r. And if you can do that in essentially kapla over litla raise, before. Essentially, capital over delta raised to the power alpha and you take infimum over all alpha. This is also the dimension of the space. So it's kind of tells you how efficiently you can cover big balls by little balls. And it's easy to check that the sole dimension is finite if and only if the space is doubling. So it quantifies this doubling property. You basically iterate this from r to r over 2 to r over 4. From r to r over 2 to r over 4, you'll get some exponential. And a closely related notion as double measures, which is perhaps more familiar, is that a measure is doubling if maybe I don't even have to say this definition in front of this audience, but so ball of radius twice R can be the volume of ball of radius 2 R can be controlled by volume of ball of radius R uniformly, independent of the central radius. Of the central tradition. And again, just like what happened with Assort dimensional definition, you can actually instead of looking at R and 2R, you can look at N Kaplar and Lar. And you can try to ask what kind of Q you can put. So this is the notion of Q homogeneity. Every doubling measure is going to be Q homogeneous in this sense for some Q. And there is a And there is an important theorem of Woldberg and Konyagin that kind of relates these two notions. The assorted dimension of compact metric space is the infimum of all Q such that there is a doubling measure that's Q homogeneous. So this Q homogeneity property can be used to determine the assorted dimension. So, in particular, this says that every compact doubling metric space has a doubling measure. I need to introduce one more definition to state the theorem. So, this is this notion of quasi-symmetry. So, this is a generalized version of controlled maps in the context of metric spaces. So, this quasi-symmetry comes with a kind of parameter eta, where eta is a Parameter eta, where eta is a homeomorphism from 0 infinity to itself. So it's an increasing function. And it satisfies, and you have a homeomorphism from one metric space to another metric space. It is said to be a quasi-symmetry if the ratio of distances in the source space controls the ratio of distance in the target space in this fashion. When you first say it, it seems When you first say it, it seems a little bit mysterious, but it can be stated more geometrically in terms of trying to bound annulus in one metric using annulus in the other metric. So I tried to draw a picture here. So if you have some annulus from R to A R, you can kind of try to enclose it with some other annulus in the other metric. handlers in the other metric with S to eta A S. You know, here S and R may not be related like in pile of shifts maps since you're only looking at ratios. The general idea is that we don't really care about how this map distorts the size of sets. We only care about shape. And that's why the ratio is more important. And the conformal gauge of metric space is the space of our metric. Is the space of our metrics on this space X such that this identity map from one metric to the other metric is a quasi-smet. And this actually defines an equivalence class among metrics. And there are various kinds of conformal dimensions. The general philosophy behind conformal dimension is that you are trying to find the flattest metric in the conformal case. The flattest metric in the conformal gauge. So you are trying to minimize some kind of dimension by changing over all metrics in the conformal gauge. So the all-force regular conformal dimension of the metric space is the infimum of all Q such that there is a Q All force regular metric in the space. And this notion was introduced by Pan Su. I think Pan Su introduced with Hausdor mentioned instead of the South Force regularity. The south source regularity, but you know, this notion was studied by Bonk and Kleiner and also by Buddha and Pajo. And possible values of alpha stereo conformal dimension are basically all values, all non-negative values except between strictly between 0 and 1. It's a theorem due to cover layer. And LASO constructed lots of examples showing that all these values are possible. And you can define the conformal assault dimension, where instead of trying to minimize the alpha siddhar conformal dimension, we are trying to minimize the assault dimension by varying among all vectors in the conformal gauge. And it's you know, in general, the basic questions in this area is: you know, what's the value of this infimum and is this infimum attained? Infimum and is this infimum at end. And they are both very hard, even for simple examples like serpent Catholic. And so I want to explain a little bit about the motivation behind studying this notion. So Panzer's motivation comes from geometry group theory, where it turns out that a boundary of the hyperbolic group is a quasi isometric invariant. Isometric invariant. First isometry is some natural way of saying that two groups are the same in geometric group theory. And in complex dynamics, the conformal dimension of a Julia set is inclined in what's called as cursting equivalence. It's again some kind of conjugacy between two dynamical systems. And so this notion of conformal dimension has been widely studied in both these contexts. And personally, I started to appreciate quasi symmetry as a tool to understand hairline inequalities. This was promoted by June Kigami. So conformal as well dimension is finite if and only if the space is doubling. So these are some basic facts about conformal dimension. And the alpha siddler conformal dimension is finite if and only if Dimension is finite if and only if the space is doubling and uniformly perfect. I already told you what uniformly perfect is. So, a space is uniformly perfect if there exists some constant C p such that if you have a ball that that's not the whole space, then the ball minus a slightly smaller ball is not empty. So there are no too many isolated eyeliners in the space. So I I'll I'll tell a little bit more. Some of the problems that that alpha circular conformal dimension faces is due to this uniform perfectness property. So I want to mention one issue with this notion of alpha circular conformal dimension is that if you have a subset of y is a subset of x, let's say they are both compact, this doesn't necessarily imply that the alpha circular conformal dimension of y is less than x. Alpha's regular conformity dimension of y is less than x, which seems a little bit strange. This is mainly because this is because of the fact that a subset of a uniformly perfect space cannot be uniformly perfect. So, you can have a finite alpha circular conformal dimension space, and that will be a subset whose alpha-specular conformal dimension is infinite. So, on the other hand, all the other exponents that we saw, the conformal dimension and this kind of combinative. Dimension and this kind of combinatorial modulus critical exponent they satisfy this nice monotonicity property that we should expect out of dimension. So and also from the viewpoint of quasi symmetry, doubling measures are much more natural than alpha cellular measures because doubling measures are preserved under quasi-symmetry whereas alpha cellular measures are not. So this is why I want to kind of promote this view that you know This view that conformal also dimension is really the right version of alpha-specific conformal dimension. The reason is because it's known that when they are both finite, they both agree. So, in a sense, conform Lasso dimension is a meaningful invariant in a larger Sambio space. So this is an unpublished result due to Hanon and which I learned from a book of McKay and Tyson. And Carrasco proved this theorem that if you have a compact doubling uniformly perfect space, then this combinator notion of dimension that comes from studying modulus of annulus coincides with this Alfoslar conformal dimension. So I think this is a beautiful result. So I think this is a beautiful result. Last semester, some of us were in Berkeley and there was a reading group just to understand the proof of this result. And towards the end of the reading group, I realized that maybe a better way to state this theorem would be replace this alpha switch conformal dimension with conformal assorted dimension and remove this uniform profitness assumptions. And that's the result that I want to present. Uh so so it you know you know in in a sense it's uh it's not surprising. Uh on the other hand Karovska's proof kind of you know he proves this equality as two different inequalities the upper and lower one and they both end up using uniform perfectness property. So that is a nice survey article by So, there is a nice survey article by Marius, which explains that there are some conditions that he introduces, and those conditions imply a uniform perfectness property. So, the goal was to basically go through his proof again, but removing all instances of the use of estimates that involved uniform perfectness constant. So, I want to tell a little bit about this, but before going into Bit about this, but before going into the proof, I want to give some heuristics for why such a theorem could even be true. You know, it seems kind of coming from totally different worlds. One of them is by looking at this analysis and curves, and the other one is about trying to minimize this alpha-circular dimension over the conformal gauge. So, everything in this slide is false, but it's not too far from the truth. So, you have to take this into. So, we have to break this into Brainerd. So, roughly speaking, what's happening is the following. So, we are looking at this modulus problem, where we are looking at this analyst from some radius r to lambda times r at a smaller scale. And so, you can think of this as each vertex in this graph as some balls at the corresponding scale. Here. And so the diameter of this, so we are trying to construct a new metric theta. We are given a metric D and I have drawn this bonds in the original metric. We are trying to construct some new metric in the conformal gauge. And roughly speaking, so this optimizer for the modulus is some function that lives on the vertices. So you can think of it. So, you can think of it as living on these balls. So, the optimizer for the modulus for a ball at a smaller scale, you can think of it as ratio of diameter in the new metric for this ball and kind of its parent ball, which is kind of located nearby. I think I also wrote this in the slide here. Wrote this in the slides here. It may be too small to read. So, there are two conditions. There is this admissibility condition in the modulus that tells us that it should cost you at least one to go through any curve that goes from inside to outside. And if you kind of use this formula or this heuristic, it tells us that the diameter in the new metric for this small blue balls should be at least as small as the. Should be at least as small as the diameter in the new metric for its parent. So, this is, you know, I like to think of this as a no-shortcuts condition for the new metric. We know that this kind of thing should be true if it were really a quasi-symmetry. You cannot go quick, you cannot cross an analyst too cheaply compared to the diameter of the ball. And the smallness of the p modulus, okay, so you know, we have this exponent that says that this p modulus should be small. That says that this p model should be small. You can interpret this as diameter, so that's the same as saying that the summation of rho to the power p is small, which is same as saying that the diameter to the power p at finer scale is smaller than diameter to the power p at larger scale. So you kind of take the ratios to the other side. So this should be interpreted as a dimension less than or equal to p condition. You have a space with dimension less than p, dimension less than 1. Dimension less than 3, diameters to the power 3 at smaller and smaller scales will go to 0. Excuse me. So now you are thinking about uniformly compact, uniformly perfect. There are many gaps that can be answered. Can you you know so for any scale, can can you have like this, you know, tenure balls? No, that that's why I told everything in this slide is false. I told everything in this slide is false. But it's good to have this intuition. Yeah, you're absolutely right. But this is kind of a first-order approximation of what is actually happening here. So this is just heuristics. The actual technicality relies on the theory of hyperbolic spaces in the sense of Gromer. In the sense of gromo. So I have 10 minutes, maybe. So I'll give you a quick crash course on gromo hyperbolics. So the definition is surprisingly simple. You start with a metric space Z D, the Gromo product between X and Y with respect to some base point W is the sum of the distance from X W to Y W minus PXY. And this is the Gromov product. And this is the Gromov product. So, if you're actually familiar with hyperbolic geometry, you know, let's say I'm going to draw a point at a disk and you take some point x, some point y, you can think of this as the distance of the w from the geodesic joining x and y. That's roughly speaking the chroma product between x and y up to some mild relative constant. And a space is delta hyperbolic if it satisfies this four-point condition. For any four points x, y, z, and w, you have this inequality of Gromo products. It's kind of mysterious. It's such a simple definition. And Bromo introduced this definition and wrote maybe around 200-page paper explaining the consequences of this definition. So, a hyperbolic space comes with a notion of boundary. So, in this kind of point-player disc, you can think of boundary as what lives on the circle, but the definition is the following. A sequence of points is said to converge at infinity if the Gromov product between xi and xj goes to infinity as i and j go to infinity. The choice of w does not matter. And two sequences that can be at infinity are said to be equivalent if the Gromo product between these two sequences goes to infinity. This is actually an equivalence relation if the space is hyperbolic. These are all pretty easy to check just based on the definition. And the boundary of the hyperbolic space is the space of equivalence classes of sequence that converge at infinity. And so you can extend the notion of global product all the way to the boundary. Glomer product all the way to the boundary. So, given two points A and B on the boundary, you can define its Glomo product as by taking the supremum over all sequences that belong to the equivalence classes of N corresponding to A and B of the Gromov product or the limit of the Gromov product. It doesn't quite matter whether you put laminth or lipid soap or inst of soap you can put in. They all only change things by some additive constant delta. And this boundary comes with its own natural kind of metric called the visual metric with some visual parameter alpha and some various point w. If there is this metric, rho AB on the boundary satisfies alpha raised to the power minus the Glomer product linear. So in this picture, so A and B are two points on the boundary, and you can think of this. And you can think of this grommo product between two points on the boundary as the distance between W and the geodesic from A to B, the point-grade display. Yeah. If you start with the gromof hyperbolic space, I mean, it does not need to have curves in it, right? I mean, that's. But is it possible to embed it into a grommet hyperbolic space that is also a part of that? Yeah, that's a theorem of Blanc and Schramm. Theorem of Bonk and Schramm, where they do this. That you can do, you can actually embed it in a geodesic space where you don't increase even the hyper velocity constant. So you could talk in terms of the distractingness of the triangle. Exactly. Yeah, this doesn't require the space to be connected in any sense. So there are different notions of boundary that comes from, you know, instead of this is called as the sequence model of the boundary, that is the kind of the array model of the boundary that you are alluding to. Okay, so and there is this notion of quasi isometry between two metric spaces that interacts nicely with the Roma hyperbolicity, which is the following. So that you know the distance in the target metric is kind of a Pylopschix map of the distance, the source metric, except Of the distance is so small, except for this relative constant V. And every point in the target space is not too far from the image. So this is actually quite a difficult result. At least it doesn't quite easily follow from the definitions. So if you have two almost 0 to 6 spaces, I told you what almost 0 to 6 is. Think of it as either a graph or a 0 to 6 space. That's good enough for the purpose of this talk. That's good enough for the purpose of this talk. Then, if you have a quasisometry, then one space is hyperbolic if and only if the other one is. So, hyperbolicity is kind of stable under quasi isometries. That's also not at all obvious from the definition of hyperbolicity because if you know you are adding distances, then subtracting a difference to come to the global product. And there is a notion of boundary map. So, a quasi-isometry actually extends to a well-defined map on the boundary, where you take some sequence and look at the image of that sequence. To check that it's well-defined, you need to check that this sequence converges at xn converges at infinity if and only if the image converges at infinity. And the same is and the and two sequences that converge at infinity are equivalent in the source space if and only if they are equivalent. That source space, if and only if they're equivalent, or if and only if their images are equivalent, the target space. So that's true. In fact, this map is a bijection. And you can see, so there's a theorem of Bonk and Schramm that says, you know, it's not just a bijection. If you equip them with visual matrix, it's actually a homeomorphism. Well, not only is a homeomorphism, it's a quasi-symmetry. It's more than a quasi-symmetry. It's a special kind of quasi-symmetry called power quasi-symmetry, where you can take each and the definition of quasi-symmetry. E times the definition of Poisson symmetry as C times some maximum of two power functions. And there is a theorem, I mean there is a nice construction due to Beyond Beyond and Swan Bullingham that we used. You start with a given metric space, which is compact. You can view the metric space as a boundary of a hyperbolic graph with its Hyperbolic graph with its visual vector. And these kind of constrictions are much older, but the nice thing about this paper is that they already removed the constant of uniform perfectness in its assumption. So there is a proof by Buddha and Pajo which proves some hyperbodicity, but the hyperbodicity constant actually gets worse and worse if you change the uniform. Worse, if you change the uniform perfectness constantly infinitely. So, this proof, you know, they control the hyperpotic constant just using this parameters a and lambda. And this is kind of, you know, I mentioned some heuristics a while ago. To make this heuristic precise, what we really need to do is use this hyperbolic filling, which is really a graph, and do a violent shift change of the graph back. And do a bile-shift change of the graph metric. No. You know, finding a new metric in a conformal gauge sounds a lot more scarier than changing the graph in a bilip shift fashion. And that's what all these proofs really do. And actually, there is one issue with this hyperbolic filling. So the Bongstrand theorem, as I mentioned, can only apply. Theorem, as I mentioned, can only produce metrics in the power quasi-symmetric conformal gauge, but not all quasi-symmetries are power quasar symmetries. In fact, but it doesn't matter for the Karasko's purposes because if you have a uniformly perfect space, then power quasi-symmetries, all power symmetries are power power symmetries. But in general, it's not the case. So, since we are not in the uniformly perfect setting, we had to worry if the conformal assource dimension. If the conformal assault dimension is actually different, if you replace positive symmetries with power positive symmetries, because we are taking infimum over a strictly smaller set. But that does not happen, fortunately. And I don't have a good explanation for why this should be true, but it kind of follows from our proof. And it could be, I think, this should also be true for any other. This should also be true for any other notion of conformal dimension, for example, for house-to-dimension. But I don't know how to show it. Okay, so in interest of time, I'm going to skip some of the proof sketch. Both sides of the proof uses Holdberg-Kanjagen construction, so doubling measures play an important role. I I want to end with some some open question which I think is uh very relevant. Very relevant and interesting for a lot of people. Actually, this question was asked to me by Bonk. So, there is a general sub-multiplicative inequality that tells us that this kind of modulus grows in some exponential rate as K increases by this exponential growth rate given by P. Sorry, I think I missed a log here in the slide. In the slide. That should be a log of m kp. So the sub-multiplicity activity becomes sub-additivity and then this limit exists. So it's easy to see because modulus decreases as or modulus is non-increasing as P increases. It's easy to see that this exponent should be non-increasing. But you know in practice what what actually happens is this exponent is strictly decreasing, but there are no good results in this direction. Good results in this direction. And the reason why this would be interesting to show is that we can characterize our ultrasonic conformal dimension or conformal assault dimension as a unique exponent P for which beta P is known. And in fact, Bonk has even a specific example that he found very hard to analyze for this particular problem. So you can ask this question in a kind of a general setting of self approximately self-simple space. Self-approximately self-simple space in the sense of this ICM article by Bruce Kleiner, which includes all these examples, boundaries of hyperbolic groups, Julia sets, separate cascades, carbonates. Okay, so maybe I'll just say some finish with some concluding remarks. So the kind of the main message is that conformal assault dimensions better to define alpha singular conformal dimension. And also, these constructions of doubling measure by Wolhurg and Konyagin and the construction of metric by Carrasco is actually quite flexible to be adapted for different purposes. For example, in a paper with Martin Barlow to show the stability of electric habitat inequality, we had to modify this construction of governing measure by Wolfberg and Konya again. And similarly, in a work with Kajino, which he's going to talk about in the next talk, he In the next talk, we use Karasco's construction to identify a new relationship between elliptic and parabolic kinetic properties. So I think this is a good place to start. Thank you very much. Uh I had a question uh about the concise synopsis and or at least anything in his book that you can always find the power without I may be wrong. No, Johan Heronen has a result in his book that states that if you're in a connected situation then quasi-symmetry is power quasi-symmetry. But in general, in fact, Johan Hener in his book also mentions an example of a positive vector which is not a power position. In the same chapter, I think. You know, it's this minus log x reciprocal, something like that. And Trotseiko and Weiser wrote a really nice paper where they classify all metric spaces for which the space of power symmetries is the same as the space of power passes symmetries. They call it relative connectivity. They call it relative connectedness condition. But it's completely known which spaces satisfy the property that all polymetries are power power symmetries. It includes all uniformly perfect spaces. So for Karasko, he didn't have to worry about whether this conformal dimension will be different if you use power power symmetries instead of power symmetries. So now we have a four microphone. Yeah, it can be different. Yeah. With the CAROSCO construction, if you assume the first three of the four conditions, you can recover, I mean, you can construct the quasi-symmetry that would necessarily be power quasi-symmetry. Your space is not unique. So, somehow his description also is missing, not power quasi-symmetry. Exactly. So, all this hyperbolic missionary naturally only can give power quasi-attrix. Naturally, only can give all quasi-metrics, it cannot give all causes. So we've got a five-minute break before Nataka. I know we need to talk.
