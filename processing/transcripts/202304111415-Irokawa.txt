So we have the pleasure to hear Rainy Irokawa from the Institute of Fundamental Mathematics and TT Corporations. And she's going to talk about non-Archimedean and hybrid Zionist for penal math. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you all Maynard for giving me such a nice opportunity to have her talk here. I'm so happy to hear you. Okay, I'm so happy to hear in front of Matthew Sims here. Thank you so much. And today I like to mainly talk about the hybrid dynamics of the analogs. So what means that we make in the options? So books is a fast game. I don't know why. I mean here I I have these books and it's like I have these books and it's already disappeared. So the element that I used during this talk is of this form of normalization. So we use this complex, the general element of the main D, which is the method, is a map which sends which marks XY to Bx minus 0x, where Bx is a moment. X, where the X is a one-incommon degree and A is another conflict number. And if we replace everything with some other fields, I mean we have some other kind of dynamics. And here we want to consider an Archimania version of L Map2. So here we fix some algebraic closed sphere with complete non-trivial algebraic evaluation. And then we consider the exactly same form of a non-dmap, but coefficients are the coefficients are the element of the fixed non-Markivian field. And then we have our non-Markivadian elements here, okay? And by taking the requirements identification, we can have some analytic analytical systems. I mean, here this is just the I mean here this is just the just the algebraic map. The topology you consider here is just the Tsariski topology. But here I want to reconsider some another thing. So we take the recommended identification. I mean the recommendation identification is a kind of framework for studying this like longer Canadian kinetic geometry because for an infrared TV for any variety V, if we take just in as complex geometry, if we take incomplex geometry, when you analyze when you take the identification of some archival variety, we just take the close points, the zeros of points. But if we do the same thing for the magnet median situation, we have zero problems for the closing, for instance, they are They are totally disconnected and usually non-locally packed. But if we take, so we have to take some built identifications to consider the narrative geometry. And one way to do this is all the birth analytic symmetry. And we take this kind of identification, and then we have some good structure, we get to call as cost structure to study dynamical systems. So we need to change this. Yeah. And also the main topic of this talk is about hydrodynamics. Here we consider the degenerating family of animals. So here we take the open Linux quantitative disk and consider the set of microphonic functions over this disk with all this. It's only at the origin. So this is a homomorphic function over t star, but on the origin they may have a homework recall or a variable information. And consider an N of map whose cohesions are this for the D inverse and then we because this is a set of holomorphic functions on the unit point this. So this defines So, this defines an anarchic family of anonyms. But possibly, there will be values an article in that theory. So, and here we I didn't write it, but here I wrote ATY, and this AT has no zero outside of the algorithm. So, but of course, it will be zero when the system. And the goal of this book is to study the limiting behavior of these patterns. By means of the hybrid spaces. So, what is the hybrid spaces? I well, okay, I agree. So, the main tool to study this kind of dissaturation is so-called hybrid spaces. And I want to talk, I want to introduce briefly about that later, but the base, the rapid. roughly speaking uh we we want to we want we we want to we want to study the living behavior and roughly speaking we first of all so sorry I'm sorry I'm I I'm a little nervous so the coefficients of HD can be regarded as a where by definition this is a this is a coefficient of This is a coefficient of Xt is an element or element of OTT inverse, and analogically, this can be embedded into the lower source squared over C. So we can also regard H is polynomial automorphisms of CP CT2. So this family induces the This is the polynomial odomorphisms of the affine plane over the Lorentziosphere, obviously. And we can take the analogation of this map to get the immediate dynamics. And then, like Buxon and Pablo and Johnson use their framework to study this kind of degeneration. This kind of degeneration by means of hybrid dynamics, where we regard this induced non-Archivedian dynamics as the limit of this property of elements. And the main result uh I will go back here later and let me explain the main theorem. Explain the main theorem first. So the family Hd is what we considered before, and for HT, we have a n of H D and we can take the invariant measure just by taking the red product in the present in minus and that will be that measure. And then we have a family of measures from this family. and we and also because this funny induces our non-Archimedean nerves over the Lorentz freedom to say and there exists a measure defined by the Indian's monarchimedian dynamics so that this family of metals over complex fields Measures over complex fields somehow weakly converges to this measure that we have here over the non-Mercurian space. And this means when they say what hybrid spaces are, the rough picture of hybrid spaces looks like that. So this is a picture of the case. The case, the spaces, to hear from video project 9, not a two-dimensional case because I cannot draw a picture of their dimensional complex spaces or three-dimensional spaces. So I drew a picture for the case where the case is dimension one. But the point is that this space has some permit. This space can be regarded like a this this is formatterized by some closed disk. So that the for per meta T non-zero per meta there's a fiber which is just a complex projectify I mean in in any case of a claim and on the fiber of the origin there appears the monarchy media. Appears the non-Archimedean space. So we may regard the non-Archimedean space as the decelerating limit of some complex objects. So in this sense, with this technique, we may regard the London Archimedean object as the complex and say. So in this sense, we have this kind of theorem. kind of error so let me explain about the first let let me explain about more let some brief explanation about the theory of hybrid spaces so here i'm sorry um first of all we need we we need the permital space the close to this of the the the hybrid states so we need the hybrid We need the hybrid norm, which is defined over the complex number field, by just taking the maximum of one and the Euclidean norm. And then, with this hybrid norm, we define the topological ring, which is a sub-ring of the Lorentz Fierog, which consists of the Which consists of the series converging on some closed disk of radius R in the hybrid sense. So that the set of series A and T N which satisfies this condition. And then AR is actually a complete monitoring by the norm, in this norm. And here, here. Norm. And here, I didn't write it, but this AN means the hybrid norm of AN. And then we take the set of bounded multiplicative symbols of AR. This is the back of its space. And the topology is the weakest one such that the evaluation map by any FDAR is DS, and then we have And then we have actually a natural to close correspondence from this CR to the closed discomfort, complex closed discomfort. And then for, I mean, the originals, I mean, the books on Folly and Johnson's original paper treat much more, much more general kinds. General kinds of families of varieties, but here we restrict everything to the trivial comedy of projective spaces or affined spaces. And then we have these two kinds of base extensions. The first one is a base extension to AR that we defined in previous slide. And also, because the AR is a subgroup of the diversity with LC, we can also take the base extension to the analysis with. Swift. And they both have a variety. They both are a variety of samples later in rings. So we can take the recognition identification of this to have two kinds of samples possible space. And then actually the the the documentifications of the x So the base extension of X to AR it has a structure morphism to CR and because CR is topologically I mean the CR is a homeomorphic to the complex closed disk of the radius R. So we have the this five fiber structure that we explain in the introduction. Explaining the introduction, the picture of the project. I showed you the picture of the project, the familiar project lines. We have the similar kind of things here by this homogenization, so that for each non-zero fiber t, for each non-zero t, there's a fiber of this extra. of this x hi over p is just the just the x d since it's the original original i mean the projective space of the affine space and over the zero the the factor of zero is appears there appears uh one Northumberland one Northimedian variety which is a interest from is only I guess it also appears in some Johnson paper referred to me, but I guess it's also referred your serious papers of yours, but I just I just referred to your big friends for dynamics, and sorry for that. And because the and also for sorry. So for morphism, so we we need morphism to consider anonyms. So we for this x we consider a generic family of algebraic morphisms. For instance, the non map we considered before is a family of algebraic satisfies this condition. So we consider these kind of organisms. And then Organisms. And then, because coefficients of A can be regarded as elements of both AR and the Lorentz squared over T, so this also induces the morphisms between of XAR and both XAR and the group XCT. So we can well, these are aspect morphisms, so we can Are astronomical morphisms, so we can take the identification to have an article morphisms for here and here. And because for hybrid space we have a fiber structure and clearly this presents the fiber structure and for each T, if T is zero, the fiber, the the the the This restricted to the fiber t is disappears the original and over the fibers of zero there appears the induced non-Markinadian or present. So just in the same way we can regard the induced non-Markinadian or present as the limit, deserving limit of the the limit, the zero limit of this family of complex morphisms of their complex projective space via these theory of hybrid spaces. So this is a rougher explanation for the amorphism. So here we see how the the format of space. The parameter space, which is a close disk of radius R, and for each non-zero t, there's a I mean, sorry, this is also a picture of a one-dimensional case because I can draw pictures in one-dimensional spaces. So, for each non-drawfiber T, there's a project, I mean, there's a complex space, and on each C, the family has to The FP acts on this complex space, and also over the fiber of zero, there's a non-Arcanadian space. And here, we, because this RVD induces a non-Arcanadian non-Arcanadian morphism, so taking so the this the induced non-Arcanadian dance acts on Dance acts on this space on the five or zero. So, this is the meaning of the limit of this family. So, is this yours, or I'm sorry, that it's more I mean, I mean it's I mean it's distributed first, correct? And it's fine, I'm sorry for not taking all the papers from Carlos and Johnson's work. For this situation, we can consider Sopho you maybe yeah I should refer some previous reference from yeah I'm sorry, but uh anyway so Anyway, so for this setting we can consider for the uniforms function with a cast or second, so regular admissible data degree and divergence. So I don't really want to explain the meaning of this because it takes it too much time. There's some There's some good function for considering, I mean, there's some nice function. So for the uniform function, for this kind of function, we have this kind of... I mean, the important one is second. This we deconvergence. The Mont Junker measure of P E over P. So we preconverges the the Mont Junker measure So I don't think I have much time to explain the meaning of it, but yeah, I think I sorry? Ten minutes? Twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Okay. Um Minutes, okay. I may hover some time, okay? So the uniform function is namely the uniform limit of model functions. And model function, I mean, model function is something we can write as the as the, how can I say, uh, the Um the the log of the metric of the logo I mean I I sorry I I well the uniform the uniform functions are the uniform limit of so-called motor functions and modern functions are very nice functions where we can calculate the the integer by some intersection theory kind of things. kind of things. So this is of real functions, but a kind of algebraic kind of things. And the uniform functions are the uniform limit of these kind of functions. And the meaning of the uniform is this. So for each T the convergence is uniform and the uniformity when T moves can be controlled by When Tmoves can be controlled by its logger swim versus and we have to remark several things so I think the original result by books on Babra Johnson I'm so sorry I didn't mean I I mean I didn't I didn't I really didn't want your mean book the answer I'm so sorry about that but uh I want to remark that the original result covers much wider ranges of families, varieties, and organisms, but I think the projectivity here is essential to have the fact here presented here. And by means of this, I think this is this is correct, I think. So pop, pop, power, pop, fire. So pop pop shows the the same results that I presented in the my main results. In the case of endomorphism, projective spaces for any dimension. And the difference between him, his and mine is uh we I I treat the case where the space is uh not not product and not productive quality projective. Yeah. So to do this, let me explain now I mean let me collect some basic facts from potential theory which I don't think I have to explain. But you're okay, but let let let me to to to complete my the proof of my main result, let me briefly collect several facts from a hint. From the NMOX. So here we have our generating family of NMOX as before. So and for HD we have NMMAP and we can consider the separate functions, the ring functions. And we can consider the And we can consider the currents and we can take the wax product of them to have the invariant measure. And we know that this mu t can be written as the weight product of D D C of the maximum of these two functions. Uh these are the facts from I think the first piece of the uh your smiley. Uh you want Smiley? Smiley has two televisions. Sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for my study. Okay. I will mix it. I'm so sorry for my joke. I'm truly sorry for several mistakes from my side, okay? On on my slide, okay. And we uh and actually we have the similar type of result for non-Archimedean situation. So for non-NARCUMEDENO map, we can also define the green function and we can take the current by taking the ddc of these functions. And we can take the, of course, we can take the vet's product of T plus. Take the vets product of t plus and t minus, and we can take the vets product of tdc or the maximum of these two functions. But I'm expecting that this current should be equal to the with productive T plus and TYS, but I I'm not sure. I mean, I I I I want to show this one, but I I want to show this one, but I don't know how to do it. So you're defining it as a model pair measure like that? That's a definition of mu, right? I'm sorry. So your definition of the measure is you take this max and then you take like the non-junct pair. Yes. Okay. But you're asking the second wedge product. Is this in the sense of Jean-Bourne devoir you can move this? I mean, uh originally I mean w was there some of the one because it says but I I think it's very point signed. But anyway, the point is that we have the same kind of current set of measures in the non-North Iranian setting, which appears in the limiting space. So what we want to do is to do is I didn't mean to I mean remove your name but I mean I'm sorry for my bad slides but what we want to do is to apply the results from the theoretical hybrid spaces to the situation of analysis of the map but because the head-on maps are not not Are not a morphism over the projective space, and we cannot make we cannot extend this map to the projective space as a morphism. So what we have to do is to consider the forward orbit and the backward orbit at the same time to make this map to be projective. I mean, to extend this. I mean, to extend this map to have morphism over projective spaces as a morphism, or a rational model. So by considering the porological and metallurgics at the same time, and then we can do the same kind of, I mean, we can extend this map to the To the morphism of projective spaces in the case of enemabs. And then, so this, so if we sorry, this end is, I think two. So the explicit description is as follows. So here we embed the original applying plane into the into the projective space where the set as the set of the set of points where is the third coordinate is non-zero and then we homogenize its its what coordinate of eight and a h n and h minus n and then we And then we can have an explicit description of the nth iterate and nth minus nth iterate of h. And use this explicit description we define this type of function where this is just the maximum of the modulus of each coordinate. And then actually we can say that this pi n is a model We can say that this phi n is a model function of degree d to n and this converges to some uniform function phi. So we have a uniform function which adapts the setting of the address spaces. And actually this file is of this kind of form and here is the function we considered before and define the I mean to define the measure. So then, let me go back to my main result. So just for the reminder, I listed up all the things that I presented here. So ODT inverse is the set of normal functions over the in its both of their origin and consider the disgenerating function. This generating summary of n naught, which is an n naught, whose coefficients are elements of this only the inverse, and 80 is not zero or when t is not zero. And this defines another family of n naught, possibly monomorphically designates at the origin. And because this can be regarded as a subling of the Lawrence radio C naturally, this H index is the This HD indices the Narcanian lands and also we have the one reason of the hybrid spaces, hybrid affine plane and over over non-zero T the sorry uh sorry this yeah over non-zero T the the fiber, the the this this A is restricted to the fiber B. It's restricted to the fiber of D, it's just the H D. You can see that here. And over the fiber of zero, this H becomes the induced. This is the setting, okay? And for each C, we define the measures via T. This is measures over complex spaces for complex affine plane for long zero t at this middle. And this mu t is the 4t equals to 0, this mu t is the measure we define in the non-Ducadian setting. So we have two kind of measures, okay? We have a family of complex measures which is defined from the complex map, and we have a measure over non-recommended spaces, which is defined from the non-recommended map. And in this notation, we taking the Because we have this holomorphism, we can push forward these measures to have the family of measures over the hybrid frame. And the main result is the weak convergence of these measures when t goes to zero. So the push forward of mu t weakly converges to the push forward of mu zero. This is a fundamental measure. And yeah, I mean the book. I want to add the key outside and I want to add the jobs of here. So I've written their results, the P that we defined in the previous section, and using their theory, the this phi, and we argue everything over the projective plane. The projective plane, and then we want to restrict them into the affine plane. So, as before, this is the slide I showed before. So, we accept phi n to be this function, and we know that this is a model function, and this comprises the identical function phi, and phi is of this mode. So, by We have this weak compression for the non-Jungle measures of pi. This is a weak compass over the project to pay and we can restrict everything to A2 to have this components. I mean just taking the restriction. And the resting, it remains to show that these measures are big and we are with D, and we can show that by comparing the almost by definition we have this kind of bigger discussion. And here I listed up several questions I have and I yeah I the first one is I I I think I I I to to I made this like three weeks ago and I thought This is like three weeks ago, and at the time I thought this convergence of the connective exponent looks a bit non-trivial, but I think this is a straightforward concept from my main result. So this is not a problem. But I want to do some higher dimensional analog for workers and so on, with alzheimer's stability. And also, I want to consider this kind of kind of the convergence of meses for some other organisms for instance a family of microbrick cottomorphisms over k30 reserve sure but i i'm these are the questions and also because we uh because we embed all the the inverse the the the lower To the Laurence Freedom overseas, and the Laura City field is some kind of a formal kind of object. So the non-North Canadian animal map covers a formal family of animal maps, but I'm not sure when that formal animal map is actually analytic, if I'm analytic from this. This is another question. As also, I this I but this this uh for this I asked Charles yesterday and it makes up to the difficult I'm not sure but I I'm wondering if the the the theory of spaces are that can be be extended to more general I mean non-compact spaces I don't know I I don't know and also And also I want to explore more deeper about the non-macroeconomics. For instance, I didn't show this equality yet and I don't know about the entropy or because in the complex situation the complex connect can be written by by means of some critical points, in some sense by In some sense, by using deeper analysis. So I won't believe the guests in the resulting situation. I don't know about that at all, but these are. I'm curious about these kind of problems. So thank you for all. I have some situations where you have some degenerations like this and you can actually describe the limit of the measure of UT in C2. Sorry. So, I mean, when you have the generating family, it can happen that the measure stays in a compact subset T and so on. So it will also have new points in the classical sense. Classical states. So, under certain situations, we can actually have certain formulations that will be classical. For instance, when you have just a family which degenerates to one-dimensional topic, so just the only variable is the Jacobian. So, it degenerates to a measure that you know which is the one dimensional. Can you read this face? The theorem that you I I mean that I mean proved I think it gives you some information about the kind of measurement where the support of the measure is going to be a hybrid measure gives you some information about the limit that you can probably you can charge and move in curves or this situation that you are mentioning and have the geometry and chill that's going to charge. We can chill the time to charge the curve or how long it is to do it. Th this dynamic, the consider the invariant I mean I mean the the canonical measure and the and the limit. And the and the limit is uh something also countable sums of the mass. And this result increases from this type of result to the hypertext result of case. And yeah, I I was wondering if we can do the same thing for the endpoints, but it's too difficult because uh It's too difficult because in one dimensional case, the purple sub-varieties are here is just a point, and also the point there is only here are not. But in the two-dimensional case, we have cars as the sub-varieties, and they are so much more measurable about the cards than points. So I don't know if it's supposed to So, just to comment, so the result you mentioned was put by Laura and the Marco and Abera, I think. And I totally agree with what you said, is that it's not clear that the complex measure in the format is going to converge. Because you have this convergence about a hybrid measure that you have convergence of hybrids. That would be nice to know that. So that would be nice to know. Analytic set. So they describe that the general So, they describe the degeneration already there. Do you expect that you can do something like that, or maybe it's too difficult at all? It's the same question. So what do you mean by the entropy problems? I mean I I mean I mean I didn't qualify the entropy this problem. You want to calculate the non-active entropy? Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, so thank you again.
