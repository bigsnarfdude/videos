Thank you. So, thank you for the invitation to give a talk in this so distinguished meeting. I'm sorry I could not make it. So, this talk is about recent work on short wave-long wave interactions in the Relachivistic context. In particular, we introduce models of short wave-long wave interaction where the short waves are described. Where the short waves are described by the massless one plus three dimensional Tiring model of the non-linear Jiraki equation, and the long waves are described by the one plus three-dimensional Relachewski-Euler equations. An important feature of our model is that the Dirac equations are based on the Lagrangian coordinates of the Relachewski fluid flow. In particular, an important contribution. An important contribution of the paper is a clear formulation of the Realachivisky-Lagrangian transformation. Finally, we establish the short-time existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution of the Cauchy problem for the Rachelviski regularized model. So, this is a joint work with Jean-Paulo Diaz from the University of Lisbon. So, let me just make a brief Let me just make a brief give a brief review of this story, the story of this short wave-long wave interaction. So, in 77, Bennett proposed a general theory describing interaction between short waves and long waves in the classical non-regal Rachelvinsky context. More specifically, in Benny's model, the short waves are described by non-linear shredding equations, as in for the long wave, two examples. Long way with two examples that were given by Benny's paper: a non-linear transport equation and Booger's equation. Namely, with some simplification, these examples are this one here, the first equation, and this one below the Burgess equation, right? The first one is the linear case, the second one is the Burgess equation. So we recall among So we recall among the works dedicated to this third of this original model of Mbeni that the well-posedness of the linear case was addressed in Chisutsum Hatanu 1994, while the case of the Boges equation with dispersion, that is the KGV equation, was addressed by Bekiranov, Ogaia, Ogawa, and Pons. In GS Figuera in 2000, In GSFiger in 2007, global existence for the burgers flux with acubic perturbation, this one here, B greater than zero, was obtained. We denote the coupling prescribed by Benny in this way here, this form. So an important improvement in the model was achieved in GS Viguera and myself 2010, where the coupling in the case of long waves. In the case of long waves, described by scalar conservation laws, was prescribed in this form here with a G, right? And the support of G prime is suitably chosen so as to guarantee the preservation of the physical domain. So in this way, you can easily address the Booges equation. Just well, I'm not being let me. Not be let me try to okay. Moreover, the improvement proposed at the DS Figuera Fried also enabled the study interactions with long waves governed by systems of conservation laws, such as elasticity, electromagnetism, symmetric systems, etc. All these examples are given there. It also opened the way for the study of interactions with For the study of interactions with compressible fluids, starting with a paper with GS in 2011, followed by extensions of heat conductive fluids and magnetohydrodynamics in a paper with Pan and Zheng 2014 and with Xia and Pan 2017 and a paper with Mao King, Pan and Pan in 2018 and Mao King in 2019. And Mao King in 2019, it's by himself, and myself, Mao King, and Naiyosh in 2021. So, the important thing about these models in fluids, fluid equations, is that the shredding, the non-linear shredding equation is based, is based on the Lagrangian coordinates of the fluid. Also, the coupling is. Also, the coupling in these works are on interactions involving fluids a little bit more involving. You put also an H here to modulate also the size of the modulus of the wave function in the shredding equation. Okay. So, and now it's in the Latviansky context In the relativistic context, the short wave can no longer be described by the Schrodinger equation, since this type of equation yields infinite speed of propagation, which violates the relativity principle, that no signal can propagate with speed higher than the speed of light. The natural substitute for the Schrodinger equation is then the Dirac equation proposed by. The Dirac equation proposed by Dirac in his book 1930, and in search of compatibility between relativity and quantum theories. On the other hand, as a replacement for the non-linear cubic Schrodinger equation, there are different models of non-linear cubic Dirac equation. For instance, the Tearing model, 58, the Shadow Glass is 74, Kuznets. 74, Kuznetsov, Mikhailov, Mikhailov, 77, Delgado, 78, Bashielon, 89, and so on, the Kend 2011, Kendiher, 2018. So here we will be concerned with the Turing model proposed by Turing, whose mathematical study has been considered in several papers, some of them I cited just now. More specifically, More specifically, here we consider the massless case, the zero mass case of the Turing model. For instance, in the Lajviski context, using the mass less cheering model, the simplest case of the transport equation that we showed before in the Beni model. In the Benny model, in the non-Ryachwiski case, it's just this one, right, where you have this coupling here. And now the quadratic term is given by this matrix, Podratki matrix, which is sometimes called the Tiring matrix. Well, as usual, the Podgiric equations, G is fracky U is in situ complex and is And is a two by two complexity matrix satisfying the adjoint equal to A, right? It's self-adjoint matrix, and A square is equal to the density. Here, alpha greater than zero, lambda in R, and U is the Chiring-Podratki matrix valid function. Well, the DAG means the conjugate transpose. So this. So this flak u1 u2 in c2 you have that this is equal to u part u2 and then the modulus square is just the real of real part of u1 imaginary part and so on square right and the justification for this for one is follows from the one of for the Noyrochewski case in Benny. No Herodviski case in Benny. In this connection, we recall that in GS Riguera 2008, it was established an important property of the solution of the one-dimensional simplified version of the mass lesser model, u equal models of u square, which in fact, which is the fact that these models of u frac square solves the wave equation. This property was extended by Giaz and myself in 2022 or last year to a general multidimensional mass-less Tiering model, U as in Q in the one-dimensional case as originally proposed by Tiering and also to the multi-dimensional case. So, okay, then let's see the multi-dimensional case. So, let us consider the equation. So let us consider the equation. This is the G-Rec equation in three space dimensions. And here, this P is a matrix with some prop. So here we have three matrix, A1, A2, A3. And U now is in C4, right? And AI, 4x4 complex matrix satisfying the adjoint of AI is equal to AI. They are self-adjoints. And AI square is equal to the density. Ai square is equal to the density 4 by 4 and Ai Aj is minus the J Ai different of J ij from 1 to 3. And B T Y is the 4 by 4 complex matrix such that the B adjoint is equal to B and Ai B is equal to B A I. So commute with this matrix should commute. With this matrix, this should commute with B. This includes the one plus three-dimensional extension of the Massless Turing model, where B is equal to lambda U V T Y, where V is any real valid function. And this U now is the U tag U I4 matrix here, and U tag B U B, where this B is this matrix here. matrix here right so it it has to have the the so the properties that the b should this be should commute with this guy here so this is the adequate matrix to be chosen so in 20 last year we established the following it was published last year and the following result let you be a smooth solution Let u be a smooth solution of three and let a i equal one to three satisfy the the the three dimension the the above properties the above property then both w modulus of u frac square or w you call u dag d u satisfy the wave equation. So this is the basic property that this function satisfy the wave equation. Satisfy the wave equation. And this is important, recall that this function here includes this kind of, right? So then this guy also satisfies the wave equation. So this is the wave equation. Then, okay, so remark here that from the proof of this theorem, we also obtained that this derivative in time of the models of Euphrac square is satisfied this. Where it satisfies this equation here, and also this other function here, u dag b u, the derivative in time satisfies this one here. And this implies that this derivative in time of the modules of u frac square is given by these space derivatives of this function. So at time t equals zero, these functions only depend on the initial data. So you can also retain the So you can also retain the initial condition for these functions just from the initial data of so u0x, right? So in this paper 2022 with GIS, two examples of one-dimensional models of short-wave, long-wave interactions in the relativistic context were addressed, namely the case of the one-dimensional scalar conservation loss in the Laws in the relativistic context, such as the one introduced by LeFlo, Mahlov, Okumustech in 2012, and also in this paper of Huo and Wei, and the interaction with long waves described by the augmented Bohn-I-Field equations in the electromagnetism introduced by Brenier in 2004. 2004. So, here in last, so this year, Diaz and myself, we considered the short wave-long wave interaction for Relativisky fluid described by the Velativsky Euler equation in R3. So the latter, when no external forces are acting, is given by you can see, for instance, in Makinu Kai. See, for instance, in Makinu Kai 1995, Opin's Molly 2006, just for giving a few examples, Lefro and UCAI 2009, and here we adopted some notation of Lefroy and UCAI, and we write the equation this way, where this epsilon here means the inverse of the light speed. This was okay, so here rho is. Okay, so here rho is the mass density, u is the velocity field, vector flu, logic vector of the fluid. Both functions of Tx and epsilon is c to minus one represents the inverse of the light speed and delta j k is the chronecker delta symbol so that the d by d identity matrix is i to d and there. To D and delta Jk, Jk equals one to D. And the P P rho is the pressure. The physical domain for the unknown P rho is rho greater than rho u is rho greater than equals zero. The models of u square less than epsilon to minus two. Well, the pressure is satisfied. This inequality here, so this is a standard assumption in UCI maximum. Assumption in Yukai, Makinu Kai, for instance. And here we go first. So, as I said, the interesting thing of this model is that the short wave equations should be based on the Lagrangian coordinates of the fluid flow, right? So, we are going to obtain first the Lagrangian transformation for nine. For that, it will be useful to introduce the It will be useful to introduce the following auxiliary variables. So, relativistic rho equals rho epsilon square or epsilon to the fourth power model of u squared p 1 minus epsilon square u relativisk u equal rho plus epsilon squared p over rho plus epsilon to the fourth power modes of u square u. And this p tilde here we call the relative. The relativity pressure loss tensor and it has this form here, right? Relativistic rho, epsilon square has this form. And so the key point here is that the Ratzwisky rho versus Ratzwiski U is equal to P plus epsilon square P rho plus epsilon square P one minus epsilon square. Uh, one minus epsilon square u times u here, right? And then you can write the equation in this illuminating form, which is a you have exactly a continuity equation in the first in the first equation. And the second one is reads this way here, right? Very similar to the momentum equation, but now you have this pressure-loss tensor, as we call, that it functions as a That functions as a pressure tensor also. And this guy, and now we include here in this part also external force because here is the place where we make the coupling with the Girlach equations, right? Through this guy here. And so concerning the Lagrangian transformation. Concerning the Lagrangian transformation, due to the very similar structure of 11 with the non-Re Lachbisky Euler equation, we basically repeat the same procedures as for the non-Re-Lachbiski case in GS-Fried and Fried, Pan, and Zhenk. So let's consider the flow feed, Tx, given by the differential equation, right? This one here, as in the non-relativistic case, In the non-relativistic case, we consider there's a copy of matrix of this flow, right? For which we the well-known, or we have the well-known Eulerian density for the Jacobian. So, this is also sometimes called the Liou-Ville equation, right? And here it appears again, the relativistic velocity, right? The Lagrangian transformation y is given then by so the Lagrangian transition. Then by so the Lagrangian transformation definition is that it is a function which is constant along the stream lines of the flow, right? So this is so this means that y t phi tx is equal to y 0x. And you can choose this y0. These are conveniently chosen diffeomorphies. And we choose this one because this one is the one that gives the is the one that gives the the the well-known the well-known fact that uh right so okay so from the relations trace 13 15 and 16 it follows that the j y which is the determinant of the zacobian inverse zacobian dy dx right is satisfies this equation here so right we have a minus sign here and here again And here again, as in the normal HBC case, we have that the derivative of this quotient here is equal to zero, which means that the Jacobian is exactly equal to the, well, since this guy is equal to the row, Rachwiski row in the initial data, so then you have that this guy, the Jacobian, is always all the time equal to this Rachwitski row. Equal to this relativistic law, right? And so you have this determinant is equal to that. So the point here is that as long as the relativisk density is positive, as in the non-relativisky case, but as long as this one is positive, the Lagrangian transform is non-singular. We propose the following simplified model for the interaction with. Model for the interaction with short waves long described by the massless Girling model and long waves prevented by the Rachwiski-Eulier equations. Of course, we have to remember that there is a V in the Girac equation. So this V we choose being equal to kappa. The specific volume, Rachel Visky specific volume here defined in this way. So V theta. So, V theta Re is equal to one over rho e composite with the inverse Lagrangian transformation. And the external force in the Euler equation is equal to this one alpha over rho e. So gradient of this frac U composite with this Lagrangian transformation. So where this y to minus one is equal to tx t y is the inverse mapping of the Lagrangian. The inverse mapping of the Lagrange transformation. Kappa alpha positive constant, and this theta Relachewski theta is called the Relachewski specific volume. Okay, we then arrive to the following simplified model for the Relachewski short wave-long wave interaction for the Relativistic Euler equation. So we have the Girac equation with this right-hand side here. Right, given this way, and this the Euler equations here, this one in the moment, so the coupling guy is here, and is given by alpha gradient of this guy here, gradient of U composite with that, right? So, where dy is given is in the first equation, the Lagrangian coordinates of the fluid defined in. The fluid defined in 14, 15. We defined this before. It is also useful to have the above system written in the original dependent variable. So let's come back to the dependent variables. You have the original, the system written this way, right? With the row, you, and everything. So the problem, so there is a problem with the system as it is here, right? system as it is here, right? Because this term here in the right-hand side, this derivative of this guy here, since it evolves the Lagrangian transformation, we know that the deformation gradient by the estimates that were done in my paper with Spanish and also with Mahoki and Naiyosh, we know that the regularity of the gradient on the right-hand side is Right-hand side is compatible with the gradient of the velocity, in this case, the Rativisky velocity. We then consider the regularized version. So we consider a regularized version of this model where we regularize this copying term here, right? This one, the last one. Instead of putting the gradient directly to it, we just modify this guy here, right? And And so, of course, this regularization is sometimes given by the parabolic revolution. You introduce like an obvious Stokes equation. But here, you cannot use this kind of regularization because since you are in relativity, so you have to use something like that. So, which regularize the right-hand side of Polarize the right-hand side of 23 with a modifying modifier of this kind here. And so let's pause the initial data here. We adopt the same assumptions on the earlier equations as Makino-Kai, right? They are these assumptions here, right? As in Makinu-Kai2. This paper is 95. And you have the main theorem is the following. The main theorem is the following. So, Diesy, myself, 2023. So, assume that 26 for P, the restriction that we put in the pressure, and suppose that the initial data U0 belong to certain H3 and rho belong to H3, and for some rho infinite s greater than 5 over 2, and there exists a positive delta sufficiently. The positive delta sufficiently small so that you have so this delta is another delta, not the other one, so that you have this inequality here. Then the equal sheep problem itself has a unique solution, right, with this property here in the time capital T, which depends only on this delta, this delta here that bounds the. bounds the the the the density in the initial the initial density in h3 in the hs norm uh of uh depends also in the of the hs norm of this initial data right another thing is that if that delta when that the delta of the regularization is equivalent to the alpha the coefficient alpha that appears in front of this regularization right here Here, right, if this delta here is of the same size of this proportional to this alpha, right? Then the local in-time solution converts to the, and we send them to zero, the local in-time solution converts in time converts to the short, the local in-time smooth solution of the Rachelvisky-Euler equation. The Riochevitsky-Euler equation will be tened in Makinokai, together with the smooth solution of the one plus three-dimensional GD model non-linear Dirac equation with a potential proportional to the Velachewitsky-specific volume. So this is interesting because in this case, even you send even send this coefficient alpha to zero together with this guy, we still obtain a coupled model, right, where there is no. Right, where there is not only coupled by the Lagrangian coordinate of the fluid, but also by the presence of the specific volume in the Girac equation. So the proof of this is more or less standard. I should point out, so the scheme of the proof is as follows. First, we use the symmetrization introduced in Machinukai, based on a theorem of Godunov. So, Nov proven that if you have an entropy, a convex entropy, strictly convex, then you can symmetrize the and Makino-Kai found this convex entropy. Second, we observe that we need to adapt the main theory more in Katum, right, since the right-hand side of the symmetrization of our non-homogeneous relative each equation is not of the form as the right-hand side of cube pipe. As the right-hand side of Q prime in Cartoon, which is defined for each T as a function of the subset of D of Hs, R3P. P here is R4. This is due to the fact that in our case, this term is defined through the Lagrangian transformation introduced here. This adaptation is possible by using the estimates on the deformation gradient. These estimates follow exactly as in It's followed exactly as in Fried Panzeng in 2014 or Friedma Mahoki in Iroch in 2021. We also use the fact that models of U squared depends only on the initial data by our theorem one. We use the latter also to solve the non-linear Jiraic equation. And uniqueness follows in a standard way. The last assertion also follows by. Session of also follows by the special structure of the system. So, this is the end of what we wanted to say to you here today. And the reference, there are many reference here. And this paper that I cited with GIS of last year was published in Communication Mathematical Analysis and Applications at a new journal. And I will I will show the cover of the journals. This is our new journal. And thank you very much for your attention.
