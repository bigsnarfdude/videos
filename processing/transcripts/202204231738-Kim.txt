Of brain efforts and the progressive pathology of the degenerative diseases. Please. Thank you so much. All right. I will apologize because I made the trouble this afternoon. And I hope you can be generous, thinking as me, as friends. So I really wish I can make some kind of great communications about the brain itself in this section. know about the brain itself in this section. So as you know, I'm not the computational scientist or I'm not this. So actually I don't really know how to approach you. But the thing I'm thinking of is you are all the brain scientists. So that common feature I think I could approach. So I want to introduce myself and my work as just a little chat with my friends or you know. The friends or with the future collaborators. So I just, you know, if some explanation is not good enough, then if it's the past, then please just bear with me and then ask me any questions. So this one, I just made a question like a title as an understanding of the brain molecular networks because what we are doing is very low level and for the brains and for the molecules and then for the features for the cells. Than for the features for the sales itself. So I think about it for those problems first. So as I use this slide for the introduction section, so I was interested in why we have neurodegenerative diseases. So at first I said we have the problem in the cells. So I raised the issue about the selective vulnerabilities. So some cells, specifically, some cells die, not all the cells. So for example, for the Alzheimer's disease patient, For example, for the Alzheimer's disease patient, they have a loss, memory loss, and they can really judge. They have a community deficit. But the problem is that, but then their cells, they have a coinogene urine or group of mutagene urine die. There, the dopamine cells are okay. For the Parkinson's disease case, we have a problem in the dopamine gene urine and a totally different symptoms for the Parkinson disease compared to the Alzheimer's disease. So, what is it? What is making this? So, what is it? You know, what is making this a selective vulnerabilities? Why those cells only die? And then, why they have a specific degeneration? What is the coping mechanism on those healthy cells like a skin fibroblast? So, if we know about those, then maybe we can approach to the problem solving. So, that was what you were thinking. So, thinking of the Parkinson's disease, you know, Parkinson disease grandfather here, you know, you saw this picture several times already. So, this is about the main target areas we call the substation nine bra. We call the substantial nigra. So, substantial nigra, we lose the cells. And then, not only for that, we see the atrophy around those areas also. So, that sample, the tissue itself is a shrink. So, big, big changes are happening here. And then, if we are talking about those areas, you know, those areas, which areas are the problem, then we call that basal ganglia. Basal Ganga is a big area. So, it's complicated. It's not really one-minute talk about how. Really, one minute talk or however talk we can finish up. But then here, you see that a lot of connections you see. Okay, so I'm talking about here substantial narba, but in here the cells will send the signals to others, other brands, and then get some signals from other brands too. So complicated game. Okay, same work. This figure, if you take a look, this is a brain mapping, as you just mentioned. So by Google. So that people, those people, Google people. So that people, those people, Google people, even are talking about this brain as a mapping. They want to know individual differences for those regions and then expressions and then those genes and something like that. And what they found here in this picture is one single neuron has over 4,000 content parameters. That means again, even for one cell, very complicated. So how to solve these complications? For little cell, we have a lot of a lot. We have a lot of risk factors to make these cells die or degenerate. Very big problems. So, what I have done so far is like, you know, what is it? What could be the problem? How can I solve this problem? I was only thinking about it, but then it's about the protein processing, epigenetic regulation, microchondial bioenergetics. We have so many stuff, but then most of them are aging-dependent. So, a lot of time factors we have. So, how can we? We have. So, how can we really at least understand this? The first approach, because we were talking about these specific cells and this specific solutions for the disease, so I was thinking some healthy cells we have, and then probably because of those multiple risk factors, we had sick cells now, and then whatever we have, the tools, if we can change those to the healthy normal cells, then. To the healthy normal cell, then it'll be great, right? And then the another approach, the one-more step approach is: if we can put this good cell to the patients in right way, perfect way, in the perfect environment, that will be a very big step for the solving problems. So that was what I was thinking. So the first thing, first approach always my research do is finding the problem. So what is going wrong in this disease, model disease? This disease model of disease. And then, next is about the potential therapeutics. So, here in this section, today's section, I'll talk about one little step about the cell replacement therapies. So, at first, if we have the model, disease model, the first thing we do as a biologist is, okay, what is wrong, right? The first thing we see that, like, you know, the genotyping is, okay? What kind of genotyping problems do we have? Problems do we have in this disease model, disease populations? So people studied a lot and then find that a lot of gene differences, you know, so they're like a gene mutations we found in the patient growth. So here, if you see it, synuclein, I told you about the protein aggregations, right? So those protein aggregation, the main material is a synuclein. Parkin mitochondria-related molecules. And the kinase and DJ-1 mitochondria-related molecules. NDJ, like mitochondria-related molecule, and then kinase, and then combinations, and then other proteins and peptides related to the protein processes. So, something like that. So, we believe that probably this complicated figure will explain about disease pathologies. So, I don't want to ask you about all of these details for the sense now. But then, to go to the neuronal depth, we have to pay attention for this problem in Or this problem in protein, and then synaptic problems, and then mitochondrial energetics, and also about some kind of the chemical combinations. So, all things come together with all mutations. You know, we don't know how, but you know, we have a cell deck. So, degenerating. How can you solve? So, I said just a little piece of those solving problems that I will show you today, right? So, we have that. right so we have that one big staff we tried several for that last several years so less than five years maybe in total long years but then we try to make a cell transplantation cell replacement therapies so that means an easy way of thinking so from patient get his own cells and then change it to the transferable cells so we call that pluripotent cells Call that pluripotent stem cells, and then make our own healthy cells. So that means changing. So we are trying to change their fates, okay? The cell fates. So making different cells, but healthier cells, and putting the into his brain, his own brain, and back. So that was our plan. So this is not only my work or my team's work or my collaborators' work. A lot of people study about this field a lot and very long time. And therefore, this one. Eye and then for this one, and you know, we do have two many big approaches. You know, one is the allogenic and the other one is autologous. So, what does that mean? So, if it is the source itself is from the other parts, you know, from other places, you know, from others, then we say that allogeny. If it is from me, then autologous. So, autologous is ideal because it has no immune rejections. Rejections. Immune rejection is very big, big, big, big cutscenes. Even though I have the perfect cells, the cells will be rejected in the tissue, nothing happening. And even maybe itself makes the patient die. So we are trying to go this direction. You know, all these directions, a lot of people are working on. So what I was doing, what my collaborators are working on, is this direction. Is working on is this direction from getting the cells from the patient, the skin, get the fibroblast in culture, and then making those cells into the IPS cells in use chlorine group stem cells, and then making good differentiations to make a dopaminergic neurons and then putting back to his brain. So, for this little simple plan and ideas, you know, actually, we have a lot of You know, actually, we have a lot of headache, so it's not simple at all. The first, getting IPS cell itself is not easy. And then, especially to get a greater, better, healthier, then applicable, and then like a surgical applicable cell itself is not very difficult. In the GMP conditions, that is biologically acceptable. So, that is really big questions there. And then, second question is also very big. This is how to make this dopamine. This is how to make this dopamineergene urine not only making the percentage high, but it must be safe. So it must not cause any problem in the patient's brain. So this is a big issue. And then the other one is also just putting those cells into the brain itself is not easy. Because, you know, this is not about just injection. This is putting those cells into the very packed tissue. So it's not coming in. That's not easy. So those are skills. That's not easy. So, those skills are so very, very tricky and important. So, the first session will be like this: so, we are PD, patient, simple cells, and then I want to make a healthy normal cells, and then good cells, then robot cells. So, first step is about those IPSC production. So, no, complicated, right? A lot of data and a lot of graph. And, you know, I hope not you feel bored already. You feel bored already, no? But what I want to say is, like, you know, we have a IPS sales, you know, the people who are working on the IPS cells is like, we know the one word, Japanese name, Yamanaka. Okay? So Yamanaka factor is world famous and he even didn't get the Nobel Prize for it. So this is a big step, big finding, big discoveries made. So the thing is like this: Yanganaga factories, four different factors. Factors, four different factors, including transcription factors, so molecular, the targets, right? If we put those four together, we can make the cells from five of us, the skin cells, to the pluripotent skin cells. That is the main idea. It's a big step, right? So we are changing the base. So from here to here, right? So we had that data, and then he had a great, you know, like a budget and applications too. So what can you do? So, what can you do it better? That was our approach. What we are doing is, you know, we use the miRNA. So, we use a different way, but in the related step. So, different, the approach to make these cells better, you know, and faster and better and efficient way to prove that the human IPS cells to make. So, we made new protocols with the. With the yamanatic factors or and then combination of the others, including the miRNA. But this miRNA is from those metabolic change. So we are, an easy way to explain about this one is like I am feeding the cells with the great nutrients. So I'll just say that. So trophic factors and all the ingredients, you know, I'm making and then making cells much better in this pre-colored one. So we say, okay, this is metabolically. Okay, this is metabolically solid and great, and then being more like a stem cells, okay? Fundamental cells. So, of course, we check all the details. We check all the details, important markers of those, the stem cells, stemness markers, and then we all check the differentiations of those cells. So, because these cells must not be differentiated much, so we call that, you know, we also see. that you know we also see those the tendency of these cells to make all the different kinds of ectodone endodone and acodone so this is like really big work a lot of work a lot of efforts and then also we also check the chromosome too because we don't want to make monsters right so this is important the cells must be natural and cells must be correct and cell must be safe and then and not chlorine And then not proliferated much. So we make it. So I guess that's, you know, we publish that. And then that part, we believe that this method is pretty good. Like compared to the other approaches, it's good, I believe. So then we decided to use this method to make our human eye cells. So IPS cells, and then we lay. Then next question is, okay, we have to differentiate these cells to the dopamine genre. The dopamine gene to make those cells right onto the brain. So we did it, but then questions, a lot of questions we have. So this protocol, this way to make the differentiation must be standardized. So if I am the only one to make, it's not useful, right? So it must be published and everyone can do it, right? Jump into the protocols. So standardized robots. It must be strong and reproducible and then efficient and more economic also. And more economic, also. Okay, I do care about it too. I have a very small grant by that time. So I do care about those economic too. And then must have a better survival, differentiation, safety, and snippet functions. So with those questions together, we had the first step to make a better differentiation protocol. So to do that, we have two different steps. So chemical environment, that means soluble environment, that means that morphogenes, that means that. That morphogenes that means that ingredients they say, okay? So, sugars and the salt, I have to put it in the right amount to make the cells survive better. Bed one, and then physical environment. That's what's a big issue these days, too. Somehow, with all the gradients, same thing, same companies, you know, it's the work, and then the sigmas, you know, same companies and same ingredients we put, but then some of the lab, you know, got the success, but the other lab cannot. So, what is the main Other lab cannot. So, what is the main thing? We were talking about those physical environments also matter. So, we are talking about this one in the different ways. So, for the chemical on the environment, I didn't put it in here all the experiments yet. Some of those are not published yet, so we are preparing the subscript, the manuscript. So, we can't really explain about all the details here yet. But then, what I'm trying to do is all works, not only my work, not my colleagues' work. Only my work, not my colleagues' work, but all the people in this group. So, from a long time ago, after we have the IPSL, Yamanaka, this discovers at 2010, then people studied a lot. So, people studied a lot about what kind of ingredients we have to put in their time and manner. So, here first, this one closed first, and this one boost next. So, we studied a lot of those features. Of those features, and then we have a kind of design we do recommend to others. So we use it. This is my first work actually with the HIA, I guess, in Ula IJSLAM. And then this one is about when we had IPES sales, for the first time we made PD IPES sales, PDIPE sales, and then from many of those candidates, PDIP sales, we got the old-fashioned. The old-fashioned way. By that time, we did not have a dispensary weight. So, old-fashioned way means we use the feeder layers. So, they cannot really grow themselves. This cell is not easy to grow. So that we have a feeder cells, mouse feeder cells, and grow on top of it. That means the problem is this cells, we found the great interesting features, but this one cannot be used for the cell replacing facilities. Because we don't want to put the mice cells into our brain. The mind cells into our brains, right? Of course not. So we cannot really use that protein. So we got the great discoveries, but you know, it's not only for that replacement result. So we found that mitochondrial function is different and their location is different, dynamics are different. You know, we found those things. But then, like recently, we found the physical environment is also different. So what we thought was, you know, cells must be attached. So be the cells might all be. So, beta cells, my own data was about this situation with the different cells, but then we use that GMP festival, the ECM protein. So we are trying to mimic those environments with that extracellular environment. So making those cells attach it to the environment in the tissues well. So that is it. And then those materials with all, of course, the chemist help have gotten a lot of the biological motives too. Biological motives too. So better and better. And now we are around here. So people are using that more synthetic and safe materials to grow these cells. So we can go this direction to make a better defined standardized protocol to use the cells. And also, not only for that, but I said the chemical environment is important, right? So, what is those chemical environments those morphogenes form? This is definitely about. His world. This is definitely about the development stage. So, if you don't know much about the development in the biology, even biologists, this is tough areas also. Because a lot of things happen from one egg cell, right? One egg and the small cells. Then, like, you know, to make it this kind of the big creatures, you know, this is not easy for understanding itself. But then, only for the mice case from E7 to E12, we have a complicated. We have a complicated transcription factor to make the gene expression different in a different timepose. This is for the dopamine neuron. Of course, for the glutamaturgy neuron and the chronology neuron, we have a different weight. We have a different ingredient to push those systems down. And then now, so I just change, I'm changing, you know, in this visual environment, changing those things, you know, to push those assistants here and there. To push those assistants here and there, and then making this whole thing better. So, for this paper, this paper, what we did was we did the smell in. I'm talking about this in detail, but if you don't understand what these words, then it's okay, right? This is too much details, I think. So, so the hijack activations, wind steal novels, and notch stealing, and then inductions. So, we did put all the things together. They put all the things together in different time points, different physical environments, and then attach the cells and then detach it. You know, the different things, and then you harvest and for the paraphrase. So the one thing I developed was the spotting. The problem was that by the time, the problem was like this. So I said the ingredients same, right? Same companies, cutter number same, lot number eight same, but then doesn't work in a in some way. Doesn't work in some lab. So we figured that I caused many, many, many, many problems. Then, okay, what is the problem? How many cases did you get success? And then I found out, what I found was in the two-dimensional structure, two-dimensional, so what we have is we do have the tissues, right? We do have a culture tissues, and then we put those cells on the culture tissues and let it grow. But then, if some kind of level, so that means if some time comes, these cells die. These cells die, so we have to do something. We have to do something. But then, what we found was a two-dimensional structure, the two-man environment, the cells grow and grow and grow, piled up, and then detached and lose. For me, the cell lose. So, at some time, end point, I cannot get the cells. Even those morphogenes are so good, then if I cannot get the cells, then what can I do? So, we are trying to have that kind of semi- That kind of semi-three-dimensional systems. So, that was so I was making with the metrigel, metrigel is a type of ECM molecules. So, with this specific molecules, I'm making island here and there. So, making this island to let them die like a Gustav metro areas, like a soul, the greater soul areas. So, maybe somewhere they just grow together. Maybe some guys they die. Maybe some guys they die there, but then around those edges of those, you know, around the island, they can survive well and can differentiate. So somehow we are trying to catch that. So we did it, you know, making those figures just like that, two-dimensional environment and three dimensions, I mean three-dimensional environment as a study. So we did make a different time course for this musical environment too. Physical environments too, the money gradients in the chemical environments. So, what we could find was from here, okay, from here, if you take a look, with the two dimensions, one of the layers, cells die. So, I cannot get the cells anyway. But then here, 28 days, 20 days, and here, I want to let you see these areas. If you take a look under the microscope, actually you can see the beautiful neurites outgrowing. So, they are really making friends out there. So, this one was very positive. So this one was very positive when I saw that, very positive even I can see the very healthy and very active and working than yours. So, okay, now I use that method. So you use that embryonic stem cells and that human IP cells together. So this was actually those patient cells. So the thing is, they die less. I can say this. They survive well, right? They survive well. Alright, so I could say that, okay, spotting is the solution for now. Really? Really? Oh man. Okay. Alright. I thought I have maybe 20 more minutes. Okay. Alright. I'll make it shirt. So, spawning is good, we thought. And then we checked all the materials for the coding group. So we found that. So we found that which one is better, right? So we checked those things also possible we can use for those GMP protocols. So that is what we could get for this protocol. So it's good, not dying, well, then after that, we differentiate the cells. Because the day 20 or the 15 is not good enough to see all the pictures as a viewer. So we do different. So we do differentiate until 40, then until 70, 40 here, until 70 here. So that means long time. This is very painful process. So after day 70, so culture in 70, not easy to get success, but we could get that very beautiful electrophysiological peak. No, that means they do communicate. Those neurons, they can communicate. Those neurons can communicate well, and then with that, we can see the pH, which is the marker for the dopamine neuron well, and then we can see the release of those molecules, materials, dopamine cells, and with the microdialysis method. So, so good. We found that functional differentiating cells here. Okay, beautiful. I love this picture. I am so proud of myself. So, this is so beautiful. You know, when I see it, I feel good. You know, when I see it, I feel good, you know, because I can see in the day 70, and then we can see all the neurons, and they are even hockey, right? So that was very exciting. And then, of course, this is not it. This is only happened in vivo, in vitro. So it must be confirmed in in vivo also before we go for the patients. So we did the in vivo experiments, then we used a lot of mice and a lot of the rats because we have to use those functional recoveries. Those functional recoveries, too. So, this figure is about the safety. So, they are not making chlorichloratine cells. So, that means no tumor we are expecting. Good. And then this one again, day 28, no tumor, no rose information. So, here in the PD model mice, we could see that recovery of those their behaviors. That means they couldn't move, but now they can move whoever. So, we can see it and then. So we can see it and then we can see the human cells because my cells know human cells, but this human industrial cells stay there and then making their survivals. So it was good. And then snucle positive the cells we also have here, then we stay away, making snaps there. And then that is also confirmed in the different kinds of those other PD models too, at the URLs. So now, just I use that very short. So now, just I use that very short examples, you know, the cell transplantations. So we did make, successfully make the human bacteria cells in the we pass the FA, past the IND. So we decided to go with that. And then in the Conan University and then NGH, Howard University, we worked together for the board. One side and the next, the other side for those two different positions, six. Positions six months more. So we made the cells, and then that just with the like escort with the police, we ran into the cells. And then this is the main neurosurgeon, the shoewriter, and then he was the one. He was the one, the first author for the dexter beaver. And then we did the make the surgeries. Surgeries and then we found that this is the in vivo, you know, those cells just before we put those cells into the patients, you know, we checked all the in vivo. So we found that successful the data for the survival, life survival, no harms. Then this is the result. The patients got his score much better. And then also his diversional MRI and then also CT and all the data he got was good success. He got was successful, so much better. And then, also, he even was very excited, and he even made his own YouTube there, like you know, like you know, the records also. So, it was very exciting because he couldn't really move himself. Like, you know, he cannot really ski, but in the last session, he is a skiing very well. Okay, he is still very young now. And so, that was the today I was talking about was this four different, four different Different four different papers that I relate, and then this was about the Alzheimer's disease. And we are making another two papers with this Alzheimer's disease. So now, I make this one, not totally. So we were talking about complicated brains. So brain is complicated, and the connection, very complicated. Circuitories, you know, maybe we have a new tomorrow coming out. So very complicated. How can you understand about this one? This is top. Understand about this one, this is tough, right? So, I'm studying about the molecular network, I'm studying about the cellular network and functional network. So, I'm trying to know what is wrong. But then, next, after we know this, after we know those clue, then we can approach for this kind of the staff replacement therapies. So, problem, I have no, right? We have to know. And then you can go for the potential therapeutics. So, for this, all the work, of course, you know, this is not only by my. You know, this is not only by my work, okay? So, we had a big team, you know, working together for all of these cell replacement therapy for the Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's disease. So, Hong Chu Kim was the main master author for those JCA paper and then NJN fever, NEJM fever. And then also a long time, like before the first trial for the Parkinson disease, they changed the clinical trial, but of course stem cells, the studies, of course, I guess the preparation. IPS, the preparation was with the owner Isaacson. And then for this AD, IPS cells, you know, Rose Coen and Kaison Tax my partner. And then also I have my lab now, and then Yangwon and Nbi in there, you know, they are here together in Li. And then we have a lot of people and then, you know, still I'm pushing them much, but, you know, they are not working hard enough. So data, I'm talking I'm talking to them. Yeah, I'm talking to them, right? Right, and then we are also, you know, just around the personalized part of the history. So, you know, the university just invested this part of the study, like, I don't know how to, like close to the 10 million dollars. So now we are kind of trying to make our own, personalize the institutes to get to the next level of the research. Thank you so much. Well, thank you so much for that very nice talk. I'm sure there are questions. Thanks for the talk. On your differentiation protocol, what fraction of the cells end up being the combination of the cells? Okay, it's a fraction. More of. Like I said, you always have a pool of very different cell types. Right, right, right. So this one actually leads me big questions. So after we get the final So after we get the fibroblasty cell, so this is a if I change your questions to other different directions, no these cells, we cannot do it more than one kind. So at least when I just collect the five of us, at least 20, sometimes 40, different cell batches we have. But then some cells can get success, some cannot. And then someone's cells can get really good, someone's cannot. Good, someone scanned. So, that kind of variations we still have. But then, if some cells I found good, then those cells, almost 100%, okay, can get to the IPS. That is a good sign. So, if that can answer your questions, then almost everyone, all the cells, can put their IPS cells together. So, in your final approach that you have before transplantation, pretty much all of the cells are coming. No, no, no, no, no. So after I pass, yeah, okay, sorry. So I test almost everyone. But then from I pass to the differentiation, not really. So people say that 20% of the dopamurogy is good enough. But then these days, a lot of people get that more than 70% of the dopamine concern. But then, another question we have then. Okay, so only, solely 100% of the dopamine urine is that better for the transition. Urine, is that better for the transplantation? Maybe not. The dopamine origin urine cell for the survival is not really, really promising. So sometimes mixture or gliosl-like cells combinations might be helpful. So for now, for these guys, when I transplanted the cells, that was 68% of the topometer at that point. I believe, you know, if I'm wrong, just number 10, right? But not one under. Number two, right? But not 100%. Yeah, that one I can say. Yeah. But then we don't do the flex, so that means I don't sort. But then we use those cells, kind of combination, right? Combination together for the transformations. I'll go to Aaron and then I'll be back. That's pretty amazing. It sounds like science fiction. I wouldn't believe that was possible. It's not fiction. But how, um one of the thing there's a lot of amazing things. There's a lot of amazing things. But from understanding you, so even in the rats and humans, you're re-implanting them in substantial microphone. And their processes are going to the right price. Right, right, yes, right. And not at other places. It sounds amazing that that would happen in the whole brain. Yeah, yeah. This is very important questions. So this is about the target areas. Is the substantial nigra the best place? This study is not actually targeting substantial niagraph. Targeting substantial nigra. This study is for the strain, which is the target of the substantial nigra cells. So, the reason for those transplantations, I said, you know, we have problems, right? You know, the surgical problems I have a lot, but I'm not surgeon, right? I'm not surgeon, I'm PhD. So, for that, too, that is why we need a lot of collaborators, right? But for that, targeting itself, straighten is big enough to target with 100% success. Target put 100% success. But then the substantia nigra, not easy. Because substantial nigra, we have a different path. So, nigra, trader path, and like we have a VTA path. That caused another problem so that we are not targeting it good enough. So we targeted in this transplantation straight-up. A lot of PDEs and ROPEs are doing this train-up for now. But then the But then somebody can ask, right? Because the sepsis substation diagram in those cells die, but then why are you targeting the stratum? Because the stratum is the major target area for the stratum, the substantial nibral cells. So those cells can work in there and making some environment, good materials and neurotransmitters will use the substance. Let's go to Maruki first and then we'll come back to you. Actually, that's two questions. I mean, it's all my words. So my question is that the online. Okay, so when... Okay, so you said that you don't want to sell the profiles to say rapidly, right? But at the same time, so you want to say have some, you know, mass of say you you want to say have more, you know, I mean, have the uncertainty for equation necessary to the damping part you say otherwise help you. Wow, so you really onto it? Yeah, this is an important question, really, because we need a certain amount of the cells, you know, to put those, you know, not only one, not only two. Today, one, tomorrow 100, you know, you can't do it, right? But then proliferation itself is important, but after those IPS cells and in the process of the dopamine differentiation itself, we don't count proliferation much. So that means Much. So that means in the differentiation protocol itself, cells are not proliferating much. So that's those ingredients. Should not. Yeah, pushing to the differentiation on the path more. But then another thing is, okay, so if they don't proliferate, how can you catch those numbers of the cells? So for those spotting cells, the spotting method also, we checked all the different environments in this population, the other population. This population, the other population, we got ten spottings, one hundred spuddings, and then those things, we found that we have some kind of the vision, like um the ranges, windows, to accept the best the best harvest of those cells. So that means proper cell numbers we require, we need. So that's, I think, the answer, that can answer your questions, but then still we have a very big problem. So proliferations, if we So, proliferations, if we cannot stop in somehow, only one cell, for example, right, they survive and they proliferate, and all of a sudden, differentiation is going on and it goes 100 to 100. But if this one cell goes to 1000, then what happens, right? So, we have no meaningful reason to for the transplantation itself, right? So, we have to block those at a certain point. We use this with the percentage, some blood one, yeah. Personalities. So blah blah blah. Yeah. So we have those data too, but then I didn't put it in. But so those cells must be stopped for the proliferations. So that was almost the potential, like, you know, the statistic potentials been calculated and we did experiment for a long time and then we could say zero. So that condition used. But important point, no, you really have to care about it. What do you have to care about? That's a second question, simple one. Oh, yeah, it's a simple one at all. Okay. So the so you said this is related to Parliament's question. I mean, it's okay, you create a stem cell and then differentiate, right? It doesn't open to community. Then you need to bypass this to produce some not totally some stem cell, but to price it this way with the passable. That'll be fantastic, right? So that is we call direct compulsion.
