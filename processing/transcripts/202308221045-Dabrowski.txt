But here we have quite heat wave also, close to Triaste, let's say. So I cannot be there, but I feel like I don't being in Mexico with you. Okay. So let me tell that this talk is based on works, three works actually quite recently with Andrei Sitas and Pavel Zaletsky, one published already and two are already already. Published already and two archive preprints last July and last in August. And I'm going to tell you about new spectral, I believe, completely new spectral functionals which are related, whose densities are related to metric tensor, Einstein tensor, and torsion tensor. So I start with spectral geometry. So I start with spectral geometry, which was already quite well presented during this conference. Also, Walter gave a quite nice talk about spectral properties. So the direct problem, spectral problem is of course related to computing the spectra. So it's absolutely important for quantum mechanics, mathematical physics in general. But I will be interested mainly in the inverse problem, which is nicely, let's say. Which is nicely, let's say, summarized by a slogan due to markets, which says, Can one hear the shape of a drum? And for that, we have a very nice eminence spectral scheme that generates geometric objects on Riemannian manifold shortage volume, scalar curvature, and other scalar combinations, curvature tensors or derivatives, using this small-time asymptotic expansion of the trace heat kernel, which is this. kernel which is this trace of the x negative exponential minus t for small times it's asymptotically expanded with powers of t with coefficients summation over l with coefficients al a sub l and here the delta capital delta is just the scalar laplacian for the metric g which in local components you know local components g j k low n j k reads as follows okay is given by the following expression By the following expression, where we have the erased indices of the metric g and derivations in some coordinates, partial derivations with respect to some coordinates. And we have also determinant of the matrix of components of J. These coefficients A L can be transmuted into some values of residues of the zeta function of delta and in turn expressed in during the non-commutative zodzitsky residue. Vodzitsky residue. So it is called usually by Vodjitsky residue, but he himself called it non-commutative residue, which is a unique tracial state on pseudo-differential operators, possibly on a vector boundary compact smooth manifold. So it with a real normalization which I'm using is divided by Using is divided by volume of the n minus one dimensional sphere, n-dimensional manifold consists of integration over a manifold n, integration over a cosphere bundle of cospheres of radius one of the trace of a symbol of the pseudo-version operator of order minus n integrated with respect to the Rougela standard measure on the sphere and minus one-dimensional sphere. So here I will focus on oriented manifolds M. Actually I was using volume of volume of the N and the form of volume on the manifold M and actually at the beginning at least on even dimension N which is twice M then it's known it's quite well known that quite old actually result that the Vojitsky nochmetativity residue of The Vojitsky novitativity residue of the Laplace operator raises to power minus m half-dimension of manifold, and doesn't matter that there is a kernel finite dimensional delta doesn't change the result, is given by the is equal to the volume of the manifold n computed with respect to the metric metric measure, metric volume of which the Laplace operator is constructed. And there is a localized form of this expression which is form of this expression which is a functional on smooth functions f which is just the same zoditsky residue of the laplace operator raised to the minus n times the function f and then in that case gives just the integral of a function so it's a non-commutative version of a usual integration of a function f with respect to volume metric volume of the Riemannian manifold n well of course this was already probably mentioned this is related to something which is mentioned This is related to something which is mentioned, which is related to Big Smear trace due to the con is related to the asymptotic growth of the eigenvalues of the Laplace, scalar Laplace operator. And it's clear, for example, from the constraint trace theorem, which tells us that the Vojitsky residue is in this case on field differential operators equal with some constant, overall constant, or is it proportional to the Dixmy attribute? Proportional to the Dixmere trace, okay, the logarithmic divergence of the partial sums of the eigenvalues of the operators, field differential operators. In 90s, Alan Kohn divulged a starting result, which was immediately confirmed by Kastler and Karlovaltz, that Vodickski residue of Laplace operator raised to one more power, so minus m plus one. Okay, so together. minus n plus one okay so together this is operator of order of order minus n plus two okay up to overall constant depending only on dimension is just equal to the integral of the scalar curvature of the metric G which is just the Einstein-Hilbert action function along without in general relativity without the matter in vacuum here r is the scalar curvature which is the Is the G trace of the Ricci tensor, which in turn is also the usual trace of the Riemann tensor. There is also a localized form of this one when you insert here f. So you can view this as a functional of smooth functions by inserting f in front of this Laplace operator raised to the power minus n plus one. In that case, it gives us up to a constant integral of the scalar. integral of the scalar curvature multiplied by f and so it is a complex linear in f of course i mean the integral the the density is complex linear it's linear in f spot function but after integration just complex linear so we have just recently encovered other new inherent localized in quotation marks functionals by placing some more general By placing some more general operators in place of F here. So let's start, for instance, with vector fields, in particular with a pair of vector fields V and W on a manifold M, which are viewed as derivations or one differential operators on smooth functions. Then we have the following result: the functional, which I call this gotic. gotic it should be gotic g superscript delta for the laplacian of pair so it's a function of a pair of vector fields given by the woditsky residue of a scalar laplacian raised to this power product with the variations v and w this is definition of this functional and theorem says actually that it's a bilinear symmetric with respect to v and w map whose density is proportional to map whose density is proportional to the metric G evaluated on this pair of vector features in W. So in a sense you can reconstruct the density by looking at density of this fun of this expression on the right hand side you can just reconstruct the scalar product of two vector fees looking on from spectral data so from the Laplace operator itself. What happens if we take one higher power of delta Laplace and Schiller Delta Laplace and Him Laplace operator here. So the functional capital G subscript superscript delta of a curve of vector feeds V and W given by Vojitsky residue of Laplacian raised to the power minus M times first order operators. Altogether, this is operator of order minus m plus minus n plus 2. It is also a bilinear symmetric map whose density is proportional this time to the Einstein tensor. At this time, to the Einstein tensor itself, which is a difference between the Ritzy tensor, second rank tensor, minus half scalar curvature times the metic tensor evaluated on the vector fields V and W. So up to a constant, sorry, 1, 6, you have this expression for this particular function. So instead of going with higher powers of Laplacians, which could be related to higher sub-linear currents of the expansion, heat current expansion, we are The expansion, heat current expansion, we are just instead placing some nice operators here and getting quite interesting tensors, important tensors in differential geometry and of course in general relativity. So how it's proved? I will won't prove it, of course. Let me just say two transparencies which is used here. So of course we need to make a composition of this differential, two differential operators and compute symbols of this of order minus n, which is standing in the. Border minus n, which is standing in the Vajitzki residue. And for that, we use, of course, the composition rule of symbols of symbol of the product is given by this sum of coefficients of partial derivatives with respect to co dual variables to coordinates x of the first symbol of p times the partial derivatives coordinate partial derivatives of the second symbol symbol of the operator q. Symbol of the operator Q. And in case we have, in our case, when this P and Q will be coming from the pass operators of Ferrari operators, there will be only finite summation in this case. So there are differential operators have only order two or one. The second ingredient of the proof is the Taylor expansion in the normal coordinates, which simplifies a lot. Which simplifies a lot and makes the computations really possible. I don't know how it would be possible to compute this expression once without using the computer using just general coordinate system, but there is a normal, there is a known fact that there exists normal coordinates around any point x centered at coordinates in which a metric g in these coordinates components look like the Euclidean delta AB plus a correction of second order, second equal. The second order, second polynomial, order polynomial in the normal coordinates contracted with the full Riemann tensor C, the C and D. Up to second order coefficient. That's the thing which will be, that's the order which will be important for us. All the others, higher orders, won't be irrelevant for our computations. Similarly, the volume element square root of the terminal G expands like that using the Using the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, sorry, up to order x square in the overall coordinates. I levichivita symbol expands as follows. So there is a Riemann tensor combination, sum of two combinations with the exchange at indices B exchanges, I mean this is lower indices, and its first order coordinates, normal coordinates. This This Riemann tensor are just values of Riemann tensor at the point X with coordinates, global coordinate 0 at this point, and RIB are values of the Richter tensor at the same point. Then, consequently, we can compute the symbols of the Laplace operator normal coordinates, and they are given by there are just two, A2 second order symbol and order one symbol, symbol of order zero is of course zero. Of course, zero, and then we can compute using the two differential calculus of symbols. Symbols the inverse of this operator and need only the expansion of the symbols of order minus two, minus three, minus four up to respectively second order polynomials. First order polynomials are just constants in x. Then we can compute the symbol, three leading symbols of. Three leading symbols of the Laplace operator arbitrary positive nature, Ponzon, nature of power, negative nature number. And the three leading symbols, so the symbols which we need starts, of course, with symbol of order minus 2k. It's like that. Symbol of order minus 2k minus 1 is given by the Ricci tensor contracted with the coordinates. Contracted with the coordinates x and co-coordinates ψ, and symbol of order C2k minus 2 is given by the contraction of rich with the xi a, xi b. So, combining all this using the usual computation of symbols, calculation composition of symbols, we are getting proof of our result. More generally, let me just tell you what happens with the Laplace type operator, general Laplace operator. Type operator, general lattice operator, this time not on scalar functions, but on vector bounded theta of rank R on a compact manifold M, where it has always such an expression. So it is a contraction of a metric tensor with the partial covariant derivatives in direction AB, which start, of course, with partial derivatives. And there is this gauge potential, let's say gauge potential, which is endomorphism of this boundary. Which is endomorphism of this bundle vector bundle theta. And possibly there is also term additional term of order zero, which is endomorphism. I saw endomorphism of this bundle theta, vector bundle theta. Then by quite a lengthy computation, even using normal coordinates, we get the following result, that the similarly defined metric functional on a pair of vector fields v and w corresponding to this. Corresponding to this generalized Laplace type operator given by the Vojitsky residue of this operator raised to the power minus n minus one. Well, we cannot insert directly the vector field derivations there do not lift in general to vector binding theta, but we can just use the covariant derivatives in direction of vector field V and correction direction of vector field W. And in that case, result of this theorem. Result of this theorem. Theorem assures that it is equal again to the metric tensor, to this spectral metric functional for the usual scalar Laplace operator evaluated on this pair of vector fields times the only difference is that the rank of this vector bundle theta r. Instead, the functional Instead, the functional Einstein functional for this generalized Laplace type operator calculated on pair of vector fields given by the same formula with one higher power of the Laplace type operator. Equals is a little bit more complicated. So it's up to a constant integral, so integral density, kernel, integral kernel of the operator is given by R times D. Is given by R times the Einstein functional for this. There should be the usual Laplace scalar Laplace type operator here is missing. I omitted it. But there is a modification. There is also curvature of this connection delta A, three times times the curvature of the connection contracted with the vector fields VA and VB. And there is a term which is trace of this zero-order addition. Zero order addition to the Laplace type operator times the metric tensor evaluated on VnW. So particularly interesting particular special case of the previous computation is so-called spin Laplace operator. So this works for spin or spin C suffices manifolds M and for theta the vector bound being just the spinnerbound. Being just the spinner band, the bundle of Dirac spinners of rank two to the half dimension of the manifold to the power n. So, in this case, the spin-Laplace operator defined as the spin connection composed with the adjoint operator spin connection, which has also this particular expression in local components in terms using the orthonormal basis by expands in with respect, so expands in order and also with respect to norm power of the normal. With respect to norm power of the polynomial, the order of the polynomial of normal coefficients as follows. So order two is starts with usual expression for the Laplace minus, so negative Laplace operator, plus combination contraction of the Riemann tensor with the coordinates x, j, x, k and the partial derivative. And the partial derivatives d I dl up to order two in normal coordinates. The order zero term of this operator starts with a Ricci tensor contracted with coordinates and partial derivatives. And there is also part of the second term which contains the Riemann tensor contract with coordinates, partial derivatives, and gamma matrices. So we have, of course, the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices on the spin orbang sigma on the spin C manifold and spin manifold, which satisfy the usual canonical anti-commutation rules. So, anti-commutation equal to delta ij. So, then by comparing the symbols of this operator with the previous one for the most general Laplace type operator, we just see that this spin Laplace operator corresponds to the value of this connection potential t given. Potential t given by this formula, so it's operator endomorphism of the bunch of spinals in this case, and the term of order zero is just absent, it's just zero. So, using the previous result, we get immediately the following results for the metric spectral metric functional on a pair of vector fields for the spin Laplace operator, given by this formula, of course, when we use here now the spin connections to leave the vector field. Now, the spin connections to leave the vector fields to spinners. It just reproduces the usual metric functional for the scale of Laplace operator on the sphero vector fields up to dimension of the bundle of spinal fields. Also, turns out that the Einstein functional for the spin Laplace operator, given by this formula with higher one power here, is just up to given to the spin Laplacian. Given due to the spectral Einstein functional for the scalar Laplace operator up to the coefficient 2 to the power n. So we already mentioned spinners, spin, we already are spinning, so why not consider the Dirac operator itself on the spinner bundle on Dirac spin or bundle on spinner manifold coupled possibly to one gauge fields, which has this expression with usual gammas and these are. usual gammas and this are covariant derivative spin covariant derivative is in direction of orthonormal j component of the autonomous frame band possibly with u1 form added to this so we can also consider spin c mindful scene or actually not the dirac operator itself at the moment but the spin square so then we know by rehnerovic theorem that its square differs from the spin Laplacian which we already just analyzed with respect to Analyze it with respect to our spectral tensors, up to one quarter, one quarter of the scalar curvature, and possibly also the curvature of this U1 gauge potential contracted with gamma matrices. So then we immediately get the results. So immediately we have to just compute what is the correction to the previous formula for the metric function. Formula for the metric functional and for the Einstein functional for the square of the Dirac operator charge of Dirac operator coupled to U1 gate field possibly. It turns out it's given by this expression this time. And again, as far as the metric functional is concerned, it's just the same result always. So it's quite stable, quite robust. It's just 2 to the power n times the metric functional for the scalar Laplacian. Well, instead, the I. Well, instead, the Einstein functional for the square of Dirac operator doesn't have just this term, but there is also another term, which is integration over the manifold n of the scalar curvature multiplied by this scalar product of the vector fields V and W. So now let me go a little bit to quantum, so quantum non-commutative geometry and all these functions which I mentioned, well, sometimes. Or sometimes admit non-commutative generalization. In particular, you can generalize them to non-commutative storage, which are prominent examples of quantum spaces. In that case, I just, instead of this non-commutative storage with parameter theta, n-dimensional one, I just consider the algebra, so-called smooth functions on it. The pipe will stay tau invariant under the external derivation delta j acting on this algebra of Algebra of smooth algebra on commutative torus, which I will interpret as non-commutative vector fields. For tetypo zero, they are just the usual derivations and they are just the usual vector fields on the usual torus. Then one usually regards the sum of partial derivatives squared over j, all partial derivatives from 1 to n as the flat metric operator, Laplace operator. And similarly, Similarly, for the Dirac operator, one just takes this particular combination, some partial sum of products of gamma matrices with partial derivatives, partial with derivations delta j. And also considers, because this is what happens in the classical situation, considers the bimodule, A bimodule over this algebra A generated by the Generated by the commutators of the Dirac operator with elements of the algebra, one can consider them as the bimodal of one forms. So I can multiply it from left and right by elements of the algebra, and that generates the bimodule of one forms. So this generalizes to some a little bit curved geometry, namely conformal errorscale geometry. And here we essentially follow the Let's say papers by Khan with collaborators, except with small, small, small modifications. So instead of considering, suppose modular situations or let's say twisted, in a moment they will come spectral trips, we consider the parameter from the commutant of the algebra, of this algebra. We will see in a moment. Well, also for simplicity, let's consider so-called strictly irrational. Consider so-called strictly irrational tori, and dimensional tori with parameter theta. Strictly irrational, I mean just that the center of this one is just a copy of complex numbers. Then, in that case, the trace extends to factorized trace on the enlarged algebra generated by the algebra A and some copy of this algebra in the commutant of the algebra A in the bounded operators. Okay, so all these operators are realized as operators on an L2 space. On L2 space of this non-mida distorus with respect to a metric, with respect to the state tau. And this copy actually is usually obtained using the so-called real structure on this torus, which exists, but I won't mention it. And such a trace tau extension is still invariant on the extended derivations, okay? Derivations, both of these are. Derivations both of this algebra and this one, and we use it to define the traitial state W on these symbols, which will be a head value. So we'll be taking values in the algebra A or possibly operators from the algebra A composite operator from the algebra, opposite algebra AO. So the usual substitution partial derivatives, the simple calculus just amounts to. simple calculus just amounts to this substitution to vectors ψ a similarly as for the usual manifold M or for the usual torus. So let's see what is this conformally rescaled flat multiple pictus. One starts with the positive and invertive element of the algebra of smooth functions. Let's consider just two-dimensional torus for simplicity. For simplicity, and by conformary scale Laplacian on such a torus, we mean the following self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space of spar integral function with respect to the GNS construction, with respect to this tracial state tau. Turns out that it should be taken as follows. It's just the usual flat Laplacian, so sum of squares of partial of the derivations delta j. Dress it. Dress it on both sides with the inverse of this element h from the algebra. Why it comes like that? Well, this is motivated by classical situation in which such an operator classical is unitary equivalent because we want to stay on the same field of the space. We don't want to go to another volume with respect to the conformally scalar metric on the formula. So, staying on the same space, we have to do unitary transformation, and then after that, this. after that this conformally transformed conformal operator the Laplace operator for the conformally transformed flat metric on the torus looks like that so accordingly this unitary transformation is actually addressing the age adjoint action by age so accordingly we also take for vector fields just these partial derivations partial Partial derivations, partial derivations, delta addressed by this unitary transformation, possibly with coefficients from the complex numbers. Actually, all the computation below should work also for elements from the commutant algebra, but I mean from VA coefficient taken from this algebra AOP. But I think in the paper we have computed it only for complex numbers, for coefficient of complex numbers. Then the proposition states that Proposition states that the metric, spectral metric functional, for this conformally transformed Laplace operator on the negative torus, calculated on a pair of such twisted derivations, okay, such derivations, unitary equivalent to derivations, okay, given by this formula is just what we one expects, the scalar product of the components of this coefficient of this. Of this coefficient of this vector field VH up to trace tau calculated on the fourth power of this conformal transformation. Instead, the spectral Einstein functional for this operator delta H calculated on a similar paid and a robust paid of derivations, twisted derivations, given by this formula, just vanishes. formula just vanishes. So in a sense, in a sense, we can say that spectral action functional, the Einstein functional vanishes. So in a sense, we can say that two-dimensional torus is Einstein manifold. Or it's analog of Einstein manifold according to our definition of spectral Einstein function. We have also computed four-dimensional torus. In that case, this expression for the matrix functional looks very similar. Very similar, except this one is no longer zero for spectral Einstein functional. Of course, it's not zero. Four-dimensional torso is not an Einstein manifold. Can do also tetra-deformed spaces or non-human spaces with sufficient number of derivations. However, it's better to go to spectral theaters. So it's better to use spinals in a deeper way. To define, for example, in order to define dual function as corresponding to contravariant tensors with rated indices s. tensors with raised indices as functionals on one forms instead of vector fields. Okay. So can we do, can we obtain also contravariant metric Einstein functionals, Einstein tensors obtained from density functionals, densities of the metric and Einstein function some functionals. Well, the answer is yes, provided that we use or we realize Use or we realize differential forms as differential operators. And a way to do this on spin C Manifold is, of course, to use the pre-fold representation of one forms as zero-order differential operators. So any form nu V is just the operator V hat given by three-four multiplication on the sendomorphisms of the bundle of spinal fields. Okay, just. Fields, okay? Just again. So again, this they form this one forms, this Creeper multiplication by forms form by modules, here infinity, smooth functions by module generated by commutators of Dirac operators with functions as in the usual situation. So in a sense, in that case, Dirac operators are self-sufficient for our purposes. You don't need to think, speak about vector fields. Fields separately, okay, to ask which may not exist in general for algebras which do not admit the algebras which sister algebras or smooth algebras which do not admit even one vector field derivation. So they are self-sufficient because we have beside the operator we have already one form defined as commutators of this direct operator itself with elements of the algebra. Itself with elements of the algebra. And they are also ready for when assembled to a spectral trip of all ancourts. And the Dirac operators come now really as a first person, really first line. There is a theorem. The following spectral function, we got the following theorem. The following spectral function is of one forms this time on the spin C minus at the moment of dimension n given by the matrix. given by the metric function are given by the, so with lower index d this time, okay, given by the Vojitsky residue of the crypto multiplication by one form V and W, the operator Dirac operator raised to power minus n, okay, and the metric functional, the Einstein functional defined as slightly more complicated. In a second we will see why we use this particular definition. So it's a This particular definition, so it's a multiplication, it's a composition of the Dirac operator with the power in minus and plus one higher three-form multiplication by one form we had, and the anti-commutator of the Dirac operator itself with the Clifford multiplication by the one-form W. Looks quite asymmetric, but turns out that's actually the same thing as the anti-commutative Dirac operator. The anti-commutator of Dirac operator with the first key for multiplication one form we have times the w hat keyframe multiplication one form w composite with this power of the direct operator itself. The theorem states that the first functional is actually up to the dimension of the space of vector space of Dirac, the space of Dirac spinors, rank of space of vector space of Dirac spinors, times the Of Dirac spinners times the metric functional again, the scalar product of this two one forms. Well, this time according to the metric with raised indices, so dual metric. So, you contract the components of the one form with respect to raised indices of the metric G. And also the Einstein functional defined like that gives us the Einstein, the integral. The Einstein, the integral, the Einstein tensor, this time with raise it in this. So, Richie tensor, we raise the indices with the metric JB, so with respect to the metric JB, and minus one half scalar curvature times covariant tensor, metric tensor, contracted with the components of this one form, with the basis. So, this matches dually. So, after raising the indices, the functionals we got from the functionals we got from the Laplace operator and from the Laplace operator for the metric spectrometric functional and spectral Einstein functional as functionals on vector fields. So going to one forms gives us the same results at least in this case. So in non-commutative spaces for non-commutative geometry I'm sorry, can I interrupt you? I'm sorry, can I interrupt? Sorry for that. You have four minutes, including questions. So, okay, so I will just keep that in mind, please. Thank you. Thank you. I will just skip the computations and tell you that for two-dimensional torus where gamma matrices are just Pauli matrices, we get also similar results for this conformal rescaling. So, with the operator decaying like that, okay. And again, the IH. And again, the Einstein functional for non-scale conformal transformation of two-dimensional torus is again vanishing. Okay, so it's also Einstein manifold after conformal transformation. We have also computed four-dimensional tori. So more generally, we can extend define extra functionals for spectral creepers, which is particular works also on a commutative torus. This actually was particular case. So in that case, it suffices to take n sum up and And some regular spectral treaties, in which case Colmos Covici assured us that there exists pseudo-differential calculus for this case, pseudo-differential algebra, calculus of symbols, and also threshold state, denoted material. So let me illustrate this particular by another still more recent, brand new three-linear spectra functional. So for three one forms. One forms in the Dirac calculus for this algebra A for a spectral table AHD. We just compute the spectral functional given by of three one forms here, elements here, with its key residue of product of U, V and W of these forms, zero order operators times d times d to the power minus n. This is so because if we really do the torsion, if we really do the Really, do the Dirac operator for a connection with torsion, which is defined as follows. Okay, let me recall you. Okay, torsion form torsion to form with values in the vector field will paint like that. In this case, the only modification with torsion of the Dirac operator without torsion, so for the Levitica connection related to spin connection, is just addition of the torsion contracted gamma matrices. And in that case, we really get We really get the theorem that this new torsion, spectral torsion functional trilinear functional on one forms U, V, and W in the classical situation, the classical situation for the spin manifold, it reproduces the torsion tensor contracted with the components of this one force. Okay, so corollary, the torsion T is zero, so this T is t is zero so this t is not present in the dirac operator even only if the torsion functional vanishes okay so in the classical case so we have computed several non-commutative examples so let me just list them hots dirac operators on full bundle of one forms arbitrary order with this hotch dirac operator einstein young mill system given by the spectral triple so we just answer functions on a manifold with Functions on a manifold with n by n matrices, conformal risk igno cometa histori, which we already know. So, okay, but we computed the torsion functional quantum SU2 group, the algebra of quantum SU2, given by these relations, which were studied with also, by the way, with Jan Landi, Baltimore Swilikom, André Schitas, and Giovarilli already some time, quite some time ago. Using these results, we could be able to compute the torsion in that case and show it. To compute the torsion in that case, and so it's the torsion function that vanishes. The only tension function which we so far computed that has torsion non-vanishing is almost commutative product of M with two-point space, okay, given by the spectral triple, tensor product with C2, copy, and Dirac operator is a matrix with respect to the C2 given by durable Dirac operator, and off-diagonal component besides of the gradient on this Mirac spin-offs contains a parameter. contains a parameter phi a complex number then the bimodal of one forms looks like that it's a two by two matrix and we computed in that case the torsion functional so vogitsky residue of this composition and it's zero in case when there is odd number of the diagonal elements or w minus while it is not vanishing and is proportional to value Value module modules of phi squared times some metric functional of this particular pair of skinodes, a particular pair of one forms, and also the Vojitsky residue of three product of three odd diagonal forms, which is proportional to f's, okay, so which is just this coefficient f is proportional to the fourth power of the modulus. To the fourth power of the modulus of. Okay, so essentially I have finished it and I don't speak about conclusion. Let me say that we conjecture that non-commutative almost commutative spectral peaks with non-seem direct sum of internal algebras, so not simple internal algebra should have a non-vanished intension, like Higgs fields. In the standard model, the Twelang collaborators, the Obertors. This connection should produce a non-vanishing torsion, actually, so the corresponds to torsion. And also, let me start, also make a conjecture that Einstein manifolds with two-dimensional, so regular spectral triples, should have the Einstein spectral functional vanishing. So they should be should be. So, this should be Einstein mindfulness. Okay, so let me finish with this moment and thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Any questions in the room? Yes? Things that works only for Riemannian manifolds, that you consider pseudo-Riemannian manifolds for your to get well I know there are papers there are people who are doing uh trying to get but well I need I need at the moment just Just elliptic operators to invert them properly, but probably one can also try to do something about the Lorentzian stuff, but of course, much more complicated. You saw Lorentzian situation is much of pseudo pseudo-Riemannian cases. Of course, much more complicated. And I think it's not yet settled. So it's still in development. Any other question? Okay, let me see if there is any question. Okay, let me see if there is any question from the people in Zoom. Yeah, if I may, I have a question. Yeah, please go ahead. Go ahead. Yes, Masotetio. Can I recognize you? I don't see you actually. Yeah, okay. Hi, Maso. Yeah, just a question. So, do I understand correctly that you also have a definition of Ricci curvature independently of Einstein? No, we don't have Ritri, we have okay. So, by choosing, by not taking this anti-commutator there or in this Vojitsky residue, we get some other combination, but always there is a Ricci minus some coefficient different from one half times Ricci times scalar times metric. So, probably at the moment, okay, we cannot kill the first one, Ricci. So, I don't know. It seems that we cannot kill this, make this coefficient zero. We cannot kill this, make this coefficient zero. I know that you have a paper, paper which you don't read this as a functional, but you have a paper with your post-doc or doctor or student in which you got Richie from the bundle of forms by projecting properly on zero and order one forms, probably. So use it in this insertion by something, by some projector, which was not just a function. Which was not just a function in a sense, but I think you did not consider this as functional with respect to this insertion. I mean, yeah, exactly. In that paper, I mean, we didn't relate it to Wojiski residue, but I guess now it should be. But actually, I didn't mention this, but I think you should do this also for the coefficients for the heat kernel expansion, small time expansion. You should also introduce some coefficients, some localizers that... Localizers there, so some operators there, some derivations, or some something else, and should get similar results, I guess. So we worked with the Vajisky residue, but the heat current expansion should work as well. Yeah. Okay, very good. Yes, thank you. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Any other comment or question? Yes, I have a question. I have a teaching this morning, so I just entered the room. When I noticed there is a Room. What I noticed, there's a spectral triple here. Is there any connection with the cyclical homology? Oh, well, of course, yes. Well, of this particular function, well, I don't know. We did not know yet. Okay, we have not looked into this direction, but of course, one should try to relate this probably to safety cohomology of con and collaborators. Yes, so far, we did not connect this to. So far we did not connect these two aspects. Okay, in the interest of time, let us thank the speakers of this morning and we have a half an hour back for people who are in Zoom.
