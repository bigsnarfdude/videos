I thought that I'd tell you what Steven and Bob first and then a whole variety second, but eventually when I prepared second and fourth time, then I decided to first talk about all varieties and then talk about stable envelopes. And then I will announce the theory and that is neurosymmetry works for them. So both of these are fascinating subjects. I'm very excited about them. Boganes are probably even more fresh and And unknown to the community, then a stable number of so I start with them. So both varieties will be certain varieties that are associated to combinatorial gadgets. This is a combinatorial gadget. This is, I will call this a grain diagram. These forward-leaning little segments, I call them NS5 rings. NS5 rings. The backward-leaning ones are called D5 brains. And the positions in between or sometimes longer segments between them are called D3 brains, so horizontal ones. So for us, this will be just a coin for your gadgets, so you might forget about these physical cognitive names. But since I realize that there are many people. I realize that there are many people in the audience who know physics. Let me give a little background in physics. So, what I'm going to say, you may not need to know for following this. So, in physics, this is really the Hanani written and also written D5 and S5 D three. 2B string theory realization of a D equals 3 and equals 4 QFT. And if you want to see this 3 and 4, maybe I give you a better indication. So what really happens here is that this commentary gadget is a picture in R10. For H10 will be the hydrogen. H10 will be the hyperglyptane. Consider it R10. And every brain, what is named, say, a phi brain, a K brain is always a K plus one dimensional F fine space in this one. So these are six dimensional and D3 brains are four dimensional affine subspaces here. All of these brains that we consider, these three different kinds of brains, they share. Different kinds of brains, they share a three-dimensional space, so that part we will not even draw. So, all of them share one particular direction, is three-dimensional, and that is the D perfectly. So, besides that, there are seven dimensions, and this seven dimension is cut into one-dimensional, a three-dimensional, and another three-dimensional part, and D3 occupies that direction. D3 occupies that direction, and you see altogether that's four-dimensional, which is consistent with its plane. And D5 occupies this R3, and together with the R3, which is shared in all of them, is six-dimensional, which is consistent with its name, and this NS5 occupies the other one. And because of this one, we are sort of lucky we have this ordering. So this this ordering. So this picture that I drew up here is really, so this R1, that's the horizontal direction in my picture. So there's an ordering, it's one-dimensional. And the way you should imagine these permanent audio gadgets that I put them is really a transverse of R3 that intersects my R1 here. And that's an other transversal R3, but because it's Other transfers are three, but because it's a different kind of brain, I draw it in a different direction. So you can think of this picture as like a calculus textbook picture where in calculus there should be x and y and c, okay, x and y and okay, whatever. You see the point. That there's one dimension and there are different ways of having those three dimensions from it. Right, and then because of these three dimensions, there is a S of. These three dimensions, there is a SO3 action here, and the SO3, which is essentially SU2, and there's an SU2 action, and this SU2 plus SU2 is 2 plus 2, that's the n equals 4 in the graph team. Anyway, all of this is just in parentheses. We can forget about this. What is mathematically interesting is that we have such a combinatorial gadget called brain diagram. To such an object, I will associate lots of geometry of combinatorics. I start with some geometry. So we will associate the space to it. Say this for the diagram D, ray diagram, and we associate the Boo variety due to Turkish and the Naka. And uh and the Nakajima. Okay. I will sketch the definition of this and it helps if you know about machogemophili varieties. The construction is somewhat similar. So what we will do is that whenever you see an NSY brain and you see two numbers on the two adjacent D3 brains, you think of them as dimensions again, just like You think of them as dimensions again, just like when you see a two, imagine a C2, to imagine a vector space. Then for that, you associate a form Cm to Cm plus form Cm to Cm. So we imagine that there's an M-dimensional vector space living here, an M-dimensional vector space living here, and you consider all the maps both ways. So the coting model is one of them. Of one of them. I will not draw these pictures in the future. I will just draw, I will not spell out these horns. I will just write this, draw this diagram, and this is the same information as the line about. So consider that, but whenever you see a D fibrain, then you associate another sum of holes, and then what we will, I will call it a three-way part. This one. And of course, C and C M live here, and Cm lives there. Jumping ahead, I want to put a little dot on some of them, which you should ignore for the time being. Right? And let me give names to these uh Right? And let me give names to these maps, A, B, B, E prime. And so far what I said, that you associate a huge linear space to it, right? Sum of some vector spaces. But not really, but I want to cut out whatever equation with F mine directly is that three different ways of going from here to here should be added to C. So A. So A followed by B, or B prime followed by A, or small V followed by small A. Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sorry, thank you very much. I just created one dimensional. Putting higher dimensions there is very relevant, but not today. So at every DeFi brain you created at the Fibrain, you created a line, that's the C. And then again, I'm just repeating myself: you get together all these spaces of maps and you cut down this quadratic equation. There's no A prime. First, you need B prime and then A. A and then B. That's okay, but the yellow. Oh, yes, sir. Thank you. First, B prime and then A. And then and actually, probably please check my paper. There's a negative strain somewhere. Okay, so that's an affine variety. So the next step is you add all of these together. Add all of these, you know, take the dialect sum of all these linear and affine varieties. Then there will be a natural moment map from that. To somewhere, take the inverse limit of zero, take an open, appropriate open subset of it, and then cut down by the product of the G at n sitting at the D3 brains. So, the construction, if you've seen the construction of microchumopurieties or injuries, Or in Joe's lecture, you sketch of it is pretty much the same. And if you think about where the action comes and where the bodies should go, you will see exactly how the correct guesses work. These GRNs, these are all of these reparametrizations. But about at the end, you have a line at the end. Oh yeah, yeah, so you imagine a zero there. Yeah, it's actually somewhat relevant when this is a DeFi brain, because there is this T-bay part sitting here, and this contributes. Of course, this part doesn't contribute, it goes from 0 to 2. This part doesn't contribute, this part doesn't, but this and that does contribute even if that was at the end. Got a little confused you said it all. You said that the X of one dimension goes along the line, but then you're giving different dimensions the segments of the line. Oh, yeah, no, that's a different dimension. This dimension is just a picture that's on the board. And or whatever is that decorate these segments with a given dimensional vector space. So this is an extra decoration on the. They have nothing to do with the seven dimensional vectors. Absolutely. They have nothing to do with it. You may have zeros in the middle. You may have zeros in the middle as well. Zeros in the middle. Yes, yes, zeros are permitted. In theory, you can put negative numbers as well, and then the space is empty. Actually, even if you put positive numbers, sometimes it's empty. So you have to be careful, and I will be a little more careful later for this. Okay, so that this is how deep I wanted to go into the definition. So this is a Hamiltonian reduction construction. Hamiltonic reduction construction. Uh and uh let's see what what do we get for free. So here are some some theorems that the obtained variety is smooth. But of course I have to be, I would have to be more precise about what I mean by What I mean by semester point where it's smooth with the correct choices, holomorphic symplectic. It comes with a total section. And so this is visible, so the torus is nothing else but the product of C stars parenthesis. C store D phi grains because you notice that when for every d phi grain we added this extra copy of C and that that is not part of the of the gauge group, we do not cut down by the parameterization of that. So we're reparameting that copy of C, it will act on the quotient as well. So for every B fibrain, there will be a There will be a C star acting on it. And there's an extra action plus another action, which we just artificially put by whenever I put the dot on those components, I just act by an extra C star. Wherever I put this dot, Wherever I put this dot, at the very beginning there's an XOC star action. Is there choosing a GRT parameter there and a T quotient? Correct, correct. Yes, yes. Have to choose the right stability condition. Yes. So maybe I missed this, but like, does it matter sort of the order of these? Because you sort of have just given like components. Oh, yes, but right. So the moment maps, they connect how they meet. So suppose if you have two NS5 rings next to each other, then you should have two such objects next to each other, and the moment that is that this commit this way and this way, has to be the same thing as going this way and that way. And if I could give, if there's a triangle way there, then going this way and that way has to be equal to that here. So that's the moment. That ear. So that's the moment map. And if you put two three ways together, then the two ears have to equal. So moment map keeps track of who is next to who. The scaling C star doesn't act on the tracks. You don't see my dots. Oh, okay. Oh, sorry. It does, yeah. And again, I don't know, probably not for today, but very long. But a very relevant part is when you don't do type A, but type A hat. This is all on the circle. Then there's an X, there's another H by. So there's an H by 1 and H by 2, but for today, let it be just type A. The Cisco acts by the character one. Just how? In in even papers, yes, in hot papers it acts by a negative one. To confuse the people. Confused me. There's no variation of that. That's correct. That's correct. So I'm sorry, that was a joke. The X-By character one. Okay, so the product of this tutorial I recorded, so the Torus, the large Torus actions. Maybe jumping ahead. Maybe jumping ahead, of course, I will do equivariant cohomological collisions. And as we see that what the tollus acts, there is an equivariant parameter at every DeFi grain. And there's an extra one h bar. So if you want to do accurate chromatic accuracy, the fourth bus will have these A's. These are the term classes of the relevant factor of Car. And there is H as well. Okay, so the third fact. Okay, so the third fact that there are finite geometrics points. I forget to say that A preserved the symplectic form and this C story, it scales it. But anyway, it will not be relevant for us. So let's consider just the finite fixed point. That I will come back to in two minutes, but I also want to say maybe a more obvious object that there are topological bundles corresponding to these three brains. So, at each of these positions, they used to leave a vector space, but after the quotienting, there will be a But after the quotienting, there will be a given rank bundle living on it. So, this object that we see in the world is like what we meet in graduate school, like you see a Grasmanian. Grassmannian is a smooth variety. If you consider the contingent bundle instead of the Grassmannian, but it's homework and syntactic. It's a nice toll section. In the coting direction, you can scale by an extra C star. And it has finite amount of two fixed points. And two fixed points, and it has some nice tautological boundaries over it. So that's my point: is that both varieties should be the natural playing ground for doing algebraic combinatorics, algebraic anumulative algebraic geometry. Because it sort of mimics everything that we want to have from a nice space. Maybe I write it here too that p store of partial f varieties. These are subsets of magic motivarieties and subsets of whole varieties. I'm talking about type A. So say type A partial fabric, type A in a future mobile actors, and type A mobilized. Is there a bobonic or whata type? B or C? It's a. My answer is much short. So the answer is yes and no. So yes, they exist, but they don't have the naturalized properties. Maybe our definitions are not the right ones. Oh, yeah, yeah, the tool is fixed points. Maybe that's what I want to tell you in a minute, but maybe since I started with. Maybe since I started, we'll give an example. So this corresponds to T star less than 2C4. This is a brain diagram, and I claim that the corresponding space, if you carry out the recipe that was on this board, will be that variety. And maybe I'll give an example here. Or maybe this one. So, if you know this, the language of civil varieties, then this is a combinatorial gadget to which an acoge multiple varieties are associated. The ball, the brain diagram corresponding to that is, and I hope after this you will see the pattern. So, maybe as I'm drawing it, I'm explaining the pattern. This fever variety has two sections. That would be more. In that case, I could draw more of these NS5. More of these NS5 intervals. I put as many D5 rings as the decoration at the framing. And I put the dimension vector sitting up here at everywhere in between. So probably that you recognize this as well. The T-star crescent you see for has this not catching but like code, and then since this is just one. And then I, since this is just one section, I put just one NS5 interval, I put four DS5 grains in between, and I put the dimensional vectors 2 in between. I just define what remains of these vector spaces in the quotient. What's the RAM? Exactly. What's the ram exactly this number? They say that there are very good. But you're not asking, there are a little too many tautological bundles here, just at the same time. There are many tautological bundles corresponding to each D3 way. And then the unasked question is: just for this grassmann to C4, I see too many tautological bundles. There is a two bundle here, there's a two bundle, a two bundle. It turns out they are the same. And here, over this. And here over this, in the Nakajoma picture, there was a one rank one, a tautojo band rank two, and here it is a rank one, a rank one, a rank two, a rank two, but these two turn out to be the same. But if you go back here, see there is this NS5 section. So there's a four bundle, here's a three bundle, they are not the same, for example, because they have the different lengths. Actually, it turns out that in K-theory, In K-theory, their difference is negligible in some sense. But yeah, let's not go into that details. Okay, so the next thing I want to tell you about is the combinatorial course for the two-dush exponents. Unless anybody has any more questions. In this description of Karasmania and 2C4, all those brains are all going this way, so they're all making triangles. So they're all making triangles. There's no two-way brain at all. That's correct. Yes. Yes. So I can give a little more detail. So there are no two-way ones because that comes from either dimension. But if you have these triangles and maybe some ears, because you can prove that the forces, these could be isomorphic, and you can push them together. And then what you will see is a two-dimensional space upstate and four-dimensional space. And four dimensions down you may see the correspondence. All right, then I move on to so combinatorial cohorts for two loose fixed points. I put on five diagrams And of course, not defining them, I give you an example, and I prepared for that on this picture. A tie diagram is, for example, this one. Tie diagram consists of ties. I've talked to my mistake. Okay, so at the tie is one of these curved lines. The tie connects two different type of vibrains. For aesthetic reasons, if the two different uh vibrains look like this, then I draw it out there, but this is just a m aesthetic reason. And if they look like this, then I draw it downstairs, but this is again just uh This is again just for clarity. A tie just connects two different fibrings. Between a pair, there is only either zero or one tie. So it wouldn't be permitted that I connect these two by two ties. That's not permitted. So you choose some of the pairs that you connect by a tie, but you want to be consistent with the dimension vector. So each D3 position has to be covered by as many ties as the number gives you. By as many times as the number given there. So this one, two, three. So this two is covered by two also. So now you can imagine that you only saw the brain diagram, and your task was to come up with tie diagrams that is consistent with those numbers. It's a combinatorial problem. The combinatorial problem is equivalent to a somewhat universal combinatorial problem that you imagine a matrix and you want to fill it in with zeros and ones when you know the column sums and the rows. When you know the column sums and the row sums. That's a universal problem in combinatorics in some sense, and this problem is equivalent to that. So, for this particular brain diagram that was on the board, there are 123 fixed points, or tie diagrams, and one is on the board. Oh yeah, so something is wrong. You can start just one more to the right. Yeah, maybe this comes from here. Oh, then this three is not. Oh, three is okay. No. I could check if maybe there's one here, and then this three is correct. Yes. Is it true that if there are no torus fixed points in the low right, where you have none of the low rights left, unfortunately it's not true. So my first answer is that from now on, I only consider Bohr diagrams which have at least one fixed point. But unfortunately, there are Bohr diagrams that the associated variety has no fixed point, but it's not empty. It's a Nakajimok. Not empty. Nakajima calls them the black matter. We know that they exist, but we know nothing about them. And it would be highly relevant if we knew something. This variety, by the way, is 16-dimensional. Maybe just another remark for experts: that I said that this should be in a natural place. I said that this should be the natural playing for doing algebraic combinatorics. However, there are things that we lose along the way. Cotingent numbers of partial pack varieties, or in general, objects that we look at in Schubert activities, they are so-called GKM spaces. Which means that the fixed points capture everything about the co-homology, activarium homology. And not only that, the restriction map is injective, but whoever is in the image in the restriction map to the Polish fixed point is very complex. The photo of fixed point is very combinatorial. So, this is a perfect playing ground. Here we lose half of it. The restriction map to fixed points is still injective, but it's not a GKM space. There are possibilities that fixed points are connected by a pencil of curves. And because of that, the description of the, again this is just a remark to the experts, the description of the image of the localization, but is not totally combinatory. And here we lose everything. The polarization map is not injective, not necessarily injective. Just. From a representation theoretic point of view, you still get the end of your chain, and you still get representations of things like the end. Yes, yes, yes. Something like that. Yeah, I want to get there, but I'm not sure anymore. I didn't see it in your apps. I wasn't even. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it in your answer. I wasn't. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, but this is funny. Steve remembers you connected with the quantum group representations on both rational, trigonometric, and elliptic level. It fixed points. Oh, yeah. But I have to tell you about two new operations, and maybe that will tell you what it does. One is an analogy anti-ration. Transition. This is just a Reidemeister move by theorem. But if I carry out a local rebuilding of this brain diagram, then the associated variety is isomorphic. It doesn't change. And the rebuilding is the following, that if you have two different fibrains consecutive, and you can replace them, And the only price you have to pay is that you have to change the dimension in the middle. So the theorem is that the associated right here is isomorphic to the on the other side. So for this, So this this uh formula looks like a some cluster issue, but also I hope that 20 minutes I will draw a diagram which will explain why this is the right function. No, no, they are not connected. So, you know, that's my kcm and that's my n minus kcm that is a. N minus K C M, an isomorphic, but I could have an accident. Because if you have a Porsche variety and you change two steps, and they are C infinity isomorphic, but not hydrogradi isomorphic, the only exception is when there are only two steps. So that's sort of a... Yeah, it's true. This this combinator doesn't see it. But o actually it's also highly dynamic in physics. That would correspond to replacing two MS5 brains. Two MS vibrants, and that's not permitted for us. In general, that changes even the dimension of my variety. And the same with the D vibrants. And again, it's important, but not for today. So I do not permit permuting NS vibranes or permuting D vibranes. I only permit the halon emulator. But it's the only naturalizable. And if the right hand side is negative, so the left hand side is complete. Yeah, so it may be negative, and then it turns out that this one. So it may be negative, and that it turns out that this was already empty. There were no stable points. Yeah, so in theory, this could go negative, and that gives you that alone. Empty means that there are no stable, semi-stable points. Okay. Another thing I want to tell you is combinatory of 3D neurosymmetry. 3D inverse symmetry. And that will be just an evolution on these diagrams. And the simplest possible thing, switch it and refract it. So if somebody gives you forget the tie diagram on this picture, it's just a brain diagram and just There's just a brain diagram and just turned upside down. In other words, you switch the role of NS5 and D5 brains. See, that's an obvious involution on brain diagrams. Something that doesn't exist on people writes. It's rather. We are happy about it. And jumping ahead, 30 minutes, in 30 minutes, I will tell you that this is not just combinatory. This is not just combinatory. So the theorem is that the relevant geomatic structures are in TV here relation with each other. Let's play a little game. Let's recover one of the examples that Joel told us yesterday. So I start with P star P2 and try to find its combinatorial 3D mirror there. In our language, or maybe in Mac. In in our language, or maybe in Nakajima language, this is one three one three non correct, yes. And in in our language, if you follow my recipe, it's uh it's that it's that blue picture. And uh now if I carry out 3D mirror, then I I get Now it would be nice if I could interfere this as a quiver variety. But you haven't played a lot with this, but my recipe, when I created a brain diagram out of a quiver, created always DeFi brains such that on the two sides of a DeFi brain were always the same number. It was balanced. But that was my recipe that I... But that was my recipe that I put the d fibrancy in between and I put the same numbers everywhere. And this is not balanced here. On these two sides of this d5 range, there's one and zero. And the two sides of this d5 range is zero and one. So it's not coming from a quiver. But of course, it's really high equivalence is built in. So maybe this is highly equival high aniguptum equivalent with a uh with the balance one, and it is. So let's uh let's carry out Hananibutem here. Let's carry off an anibiton here. So I'm switching these two fibrains. The price I need to pay is that I need to calculate a new dimension of vector in the middle. So the formula gives me 1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 1 minus 1, which is 1. Okay, so this is an accident. I didn't carry down this 1. I did some calculation. And now this D fibrillation. And now this D5 grain became balanced, you see? The numbers on the two sides are okay. Now this D5 grain is bad, but I can fix that. So let's carry out the Han algorithm here. Again, I have to do some math here, calculating the dimensional vector here according to the formula of the world. And this turns out to be again same one. And now this uh other brain diagram, it comes from a quiver because it's It comes from a quiver because there is this and this segment. So it will come from a quiver which has two, an A2 quiver. And the framing dimension vector is one. And there is one D vibraine and one D vibrain and here it is. And if you know Nakajima's story, then this is the resolution of the Klein singularity, which, in other words, In other words, consider a copy of this type V2, this type V1, this is a copy of T star P1, this horizontal curve represents P1 for me. These are the fibers. And on one of the charts, glued another copy of T star P1, but with the momentum position reversed. So to take the union of these two T star P1s. Why? Why are you? You drew a different picture of this. There was some. That's a nice picture. It's called K. So you see, we started with a four-dimensional variety, and the group acting on it for us was C3 plus C1. And it had three fixed points. By the way, again, if you are topologists, then the Trumpian graph of the The Trinity graph of the three-fixed point is a triangle. And we found that this 3D mirror, it's a two-dimensional. So from four-dimensional dependency two-dimensional. And the group acting here is C star squared plus C star. So different dimensional varieties, different groups acting, but the Groups acting, but the number of fixed points is the same. That's the first thing that we expect from 3D mirror-deal varieties. That has to be a given bijection between the three fixed points components. But here is fixed point seven. Maybe without writing, let's go back to my combinatory of 3D mirror dual. I said that forget the tie diagram here and just slap it down, reflect it down. But now, remember this tie diagram. That was one fixed point of. This tie diagram, that was one fixed point of the original variety. Well, you can deflect it down together with the diagram, and that gives you a fixed point on the other variety. So that is, again, a combinatorially most obvious bijection between the fluorus fixed points of one variety and another one. So, as you can see here, the GPM graph is just a chain. So, don't expect much more than a bijection between the fixed points. The whole GPM graph. The fixed points. The whole GPM graph explodes. Sometimes one of them is GPM, the other is not, and so on. But there's a bijection between the two fixed points, which is built in the combinatorics. Maybe I'll give you one more example, just for something to play with at home. Play with at home. This is the random one that I choose. You start with this Makajibakulariety, and you play this game that's on the other board, and you will find its zero-do. I didn't write down. One of them is, I think, six. I I didn't write down one of them is I think sixty four dimensional, the other is twenty dimensional, different size toduce axings, but uh there is a there is a combinatory or most obvious bijection between the two sequences. Um let me also say that if you start with two five seven so this is the contingent bundle of a four-shot-flag variety parameterizing two-dimensional. Variety parametrizing two-dimensional spaces living in five-dimensional spaces living in C7. Then it's this dual is not a quiver bracelet. What do I mean by this? That you can draw, of course, the quiver picture of this. From the quiver picture, you can create the bow picture. From the bow picture, you just reflect it down and you will have a spiritual. But there's no Hannah. Piradual, but there's no Hanovitan way of making it balanced. So it's an oddest Bow variety, which doesn't, it's not Hananibitan equivalent to a queer variety. So that's an advantage of several advantages of Bow varieties. One of them is that this combinatorial 3D variant is no standard. Do you have combinatorial conditions that tell you whether or not something can be combined like? Or not, something can be happening like it produced. Next one minute. Wonderful. Thank you. And maybe that will get me closer to answering the other question about the ganglience. So for that, I need one more definition. The definition will be the charge of an NS5 brain. So whenever you see an NS5 brain, I will associate an integer to it. And this integer will be. It and this integer will be n minus n for the number of d phi brains, so the other type of brains on the left. Okay, so that's just this is just the definition. I associated an integer to every d5, right? So let's calculate it. Calculated for the example of the board. For some reason, I will put these charges here as a column vector. So, what's the charge of this? This is 2 minus 0. What's the charge of this? It's 2 minus 0 plus 1. So, 2 minus 0 plus 3 is 1 D5 vein to the left of it. What's the charge of this? This is negative 1 plus 1, 2. So that's another 1. It's okay? What's the charge of this? 0 plus 1, 2. This is 1 plus 1, 2, so it's 3. And where am I? Maybe here. So negative 1 plus. I don't know. Okay, I lost the track, but okay, so imagine that you put the actually have it somewhere. 211232. You have to human mistake. You have to human mistake. These are the charges that we got for the MS fibrins. Okay. So I'm also defining the charge of a D fibrane. And this is just n minus m for the number of ns fibraines and right for it. Again in physics this uh the charges are results of some integrals but uh There's also some integrals, but for us, it actually combinatorial. So let's see some charges. And for example, calculate the charge of this D5 ring. This is, according to my definition, 2 minus 2, plus you have to count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5. So this will be 5. So this will be fine. And the next one we'll have two and two and zero and two. So here I put the charges of NS5 rings and here I put the charges of D fibrings and here LS5 rings. So maybe a few facts that the varieties, I don't know you can make Variety is anonymous and equivalent to a Quiber variety if this vector is a partition, if and only a partition. So if this is weakly decreasing, so does it answer your question? So what one over n factorial over the whole variety is the quiver variety. That's not a mathematical statement. Another fact is uh that oh yeah, the other fact is that the the uh the charge vectors is a computing variant for the high divided. Both of them together, correct, the two together, the pair. These two integer vectors cannot be arbitrary because of the definitions. The sum of the components of one has to be equal to the sum of the components of the other one. And then maybe I tell you the third factor answering the. I tell you that the third fact answering the quantum group representation question is that hormonology, gain theory, elliptic hormonology of this variety will be identified using stable envelopes with certain weight spaces of certain representations. Of certain representations of certain quantum groups. Which ones? So, first you need the height of this. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, this will be a GR6. For example, Jang here, if you are in homology, a loop edge of an elliptic quantum will be the other one. But let me write Jang here. Your presentation of what? But you read these charge vectors and multiply the fundamental representations of those numbers in that order. Okay, so these are the fundamental representations of this quantum group. There are three flavors. And you take a weight space And that wait space is rest from the other charge where it looks. I mean, there's just another version of the story when there is supersymmetry added, but certain columns and certain rows are. Certain columns and certain rules are stored, and then it's not the end of the symmetric power object, the vector representation of spring room. Anyway, so let's not do super symmetric yet. Okay, I think I have 10 minutes left. Is that correct? Okay, so maybe I should stop talking about bow varieties. And uh although Although the story is not over, there are other beautiful features of them. But I'll tell you about staple envelopes. So staple envelopes are characteristic classes associated to fixed points, but let X be a fixed point in the variety. And they live in co-homology or key theory or elliptical homology of the variety. Table number of three flavors: cohomological, k-theoretical, and elliptic homological. If you are not familiar with elliptic cohomology, don't worry, I am not familiar with it either, and it's rather sophistically much more difficult than the other two. And first, I want to tell you intuitively what they measure. mean the following. So here is my variety, and here is my fixed point. First of all, I fix a one-parameter subgroup of the torus generically. It's not some kind of wall. And then And then the C star acts on my variety. And just like in Joe's door, you can consider those points which flow into my point at that cis direction. So the stable manifold is dynamic. So roughly speaking, it's not true, but roughly speaking, you want this to. You want this to be, let's call it the attracting set, attracting set of F with respect to this choice, this sigma. Roughly speaking, we take the attracting set, close, and we take the chromological or k-theoretical relative homological fundamental class. Maybe this dash should also be decorated with sigma mini classes. Yes, very decorative, yes, exactly, yeah. So there is. So there is some choices. For example, everything depends on this choice. Now this is a fundamental case is a very problematic notion. So this is not how it is defined. But instead it is defined axiomatically by open programming workers. I will still not be absolutely precise. Obviously, the definition of the Steve-Member law is the unique class that satisfies axioms. One is that it is supported on the on the full attraction set. The full attracting set. Before writing the other two axioms, I will try to explain. So as we said, uh I can I could consider the uh the the attacking set of X, think of like a sugar cell if you are in some busy situation, but the on the boundary there will be other fixed points. The boundary, there will be other fixed points, and certain points flow into that. And you have that intuitive feeling that if somebody is living on the attracting side of this other one, then okay, it doesn't flow into X. Look at the perturbation it does. It flows into here. In a family, it would be constant. This full set would be constant. It flows into here and after a little perturbation, it flows into this. So I want to add all those extra on the boundary I've iterated. So there's the full attracting cell. So there's the full attract himself. It is a non-trivial. Did you call it the core? No, it was not the core. No, it was the union of these verbs. If you take the union of all of these for all x's, that would be the core of verb. Okay. Okay, some normalization condition. That the stable envelope of x restricted to x Restricted to x, it has to be the the Euler class of uh of the normal bundle, the attracting set. So, of course, the attracting set, or the full attracting set, is highly singular. That's the point. The story is really at the heart, it's about singularities, characteristic classes of singularities. But at this point, or at least rightly smooth, so at that point. Right is smooth. So at that point, there is a normal mantle. And you take the Euler class in development of corporate. And the key story is the third axiom. The invention of open code with different co-authors. Momolik, Smearno, Afghan Abic. The third exercise. The third axiom is a smallness condition, which is different in the three cohomology theories. I can only say it in words. In cohomology, it says that if you consider the stable envelope of this X and you want to restrict it to a fixed point on its boundary, then it has to be small in the cohomological sense, where smallness in cohomology is measured by degree. Cohomology is of course. Oh, geez, of course. It's great. So, some kind of degree condition you put there. So, you measure smallness with degree. In K-theory, smallness is measured by Newton polygon. So, you take the stable angle of this x, you stick to a point on the boundary, and it has to be small in the Newton polygon sense. One convex polygon has to be contained in another convex polygon strictly. And the miracle is that in phonetic. The miracle is that in any technology you don't need anything. So the smallest condition in any technology is empty. That was very confusing for me for very long, that very sophisticated smallest conditions in the degenerations, ellipticology degenerates to the other two. But still ellipticology is so rich and so rigid that only these two conditions fix the right object. I'm half cheating. Maybe it's worth telling you what I'm teaching is why I'm cheating. Because working in elliptic cohomology is the future of any related geometry, and it's worth understanding at least the basics. And this is what I would like to discuss. What is the equivalent common? What is the equilibrium homology of a point? What is the equilibrium K-theory of a point? And what is the elliptic homology of a point? So the equilibrium homology, the point as we know it's a polynomial. Another way of saying this is functions on C. You're on the affine line. What is the accurate key theory of a point? That's the Goram Polynomirian, which is functions of C star. Now you probably notice that C with addition is one of the one-dimensional algebraic groups. C star with multiplication is the second one-dimensional algebraic group. And there is exactly one third. There is exactly one-third uh one-dimensional edge of the group. But you fix a complex number with length less than one and take this quotient. If you take the exponential, you will see that this is the just the elliptic curve of stories. So you would like this to be to be the functions on this object. That is the natural if you come from homotopy theory or wherever you come with this. Or or wherever you come with these are for formal components and problem is that this is compact. So you have no functions on it. So that's why elliptic homology is very, very difficult, at least it is for me. But one way around is that you replace it with sections. Sections of line bundles. But then you can ask me what kind of line bundles and what kind of sections we permit. And my answer is that it's. Permit. And my answer is that it's your choice. Just like you made a choice here as well. What coefficient ring and maybe you want to localize and all that. All the choices that you built in cohomology or K-theory are a little richer choices. You have to choose the line bundle as well. So the only thing I cheated here is that the smallest condition of elliptic cohomology, it tells me which line bundle it has to be the section on. And that's a very rich thing, and that forces the convex polygon. Is the complex polygon MD that condition of the convergent paper? Okay, maybe I have negative two minutes left, so I will just tell you in words that stable envelopes, the way I presented them to you is a characteristic classes of singularities. But it's one of those rich notions in mathematics that have like a dozen different definitions, and they are all the same. You can approach them like a Chern-Schwarzman type of argument, or multi-diction classes. They also relate it to the quantum group actions that can be used as a definition. And there's a third way, or fourth, or I don't know which way, which is they are monodroming matrices of some differential or differential equations associated to the space. So to the space, you associate To the space, we associated some combinatorics and some geometry, but we can also associate a set of BDEs called the Q KZ equations. We can also associate another set of PDEs, the quantum or dynamical PDEs, and they have the same solution set. And there is a natural notion of monotromy and the stable envelope set and the monotromy of that solution set. Solution set. Based on this last interpretation of spigo envelopes, there is a conjecture that two associated objects called vertex functions and stable envelopes also satisfy 3D middle group. You have to see a nice theorem. So what myself is on the head had for a week or so, and it says that stable and The steeple envelope for a point, elliptic steeple envelope, point restricted to another fixed point is the same as the elliptic steeple envelope of the friend of that fixed point restricted to the friend of this fixed point, so there's a transposition called so-called equivariant. So-called equivariant and hero parameters are replaced. These are swabbed and blue, so H. Okay, I haven't talked about K-R parameters, but maybe just one word I want to say is that in the Krieber language, in the Criver communatorics, Kerr parameters are rather hidden. Commonatolics, kero parameters are rather hidden. But in the Boo variety, kilo parameters are associated to the other type of brains. That's another huge advantage of Boo varieties, that equivalent parameters and mass parameters, they come on the same footing. And also, it's rather obvious that at the combinatorial 3D mirror symmetry, they just switch places. Exactly what physics predicted. And okay, so the proof is not obvious. Okay, so the proof is not obvious if uses geometric fusion and some other stories there, but I already have over time. So thank you very much. Are there any more questions? What is 3D irresistible? If each kind of properties are preserved, it's a fixed point of preserved. Is that is the cohomology or cohomology is not preserved? No, homology is not preserved. So stable envelopes are preserved, and stable envelopes are a monotromy of some solution set, and the solution set is also preserved. It's for the space of vertex functions. That's conjectured and it's under... It's working progress. I think we have this geometric fusion that we developed for this maybe enough for vertex functions. That's animal. Yeah. So hopefully it will be animated uh geo geometry adaptation. Geometry applications. Are there anything like 60 that Grovik that has things? Oh, that I don't know. I don't know. Yes. Just also. So there is a cohomological whole algebra behind it, which I did. In each tree story, there is this concept I want to have cohomological or literary homological algebra. And because of that, Donaldson-Thomas invariance ideas are things they're complex. And if we believe in relation between DT and Chromo bit, then maybe there is a consequence. I'm so sorry, somebody. So the fixed point corresponds to some basis of solution of the differential or different equation? Fixed points corresponds to certain just a minute. So I'm asking. So in previous example, you have some three fixed points in TLP. And the corresponding differential equation you can run. And the corresponding differential equation is lengthy, for example. Oh, yeah, that has three components. And if you vary the stability parameter signal, then this acts as some of the thing? Yeah, so it depends on what? So on stable envelopes of x by R matrices. If you cross over all in the space of certain square matrices. It's actually related to this thing that I always don't want to talk about because it is very part of switching. Because it is very far of switching. Switching standard parameters can be realized by keeping the standard parameters there, but switching with the same kind of, and that's a little misleading in type A. It turns out in type A hat, even with the new freedom of switching same kind of brain fibrins, can never bring it down to something simpler. It has to be a override. Might not be the question you wanted to ask. That just came to my mind. What is the physics meaning of what in this ASEAN cohort you can say or I may not be able to answer the question, but what I know is that what I what I is is that uh what we would like to do is realize uh some contradictable systems. Some quantum integrable systems. So this imagine a quantum representation and which has a large center, the representation itself has a large center, and imagine just the center is acting. So you have a commutative edge of acting on a vector space. So there is a stick, the obvious basis, the 1, 0, 0, that kind of basis, and there's the eigen basis. And in cohomology of what you want to do. And in in co-homology of what you want you want to build up an an i uh an an identification of of these problems of modularized spaces with quantum method of a system. But in problems of modulized spaces as a acting condenser by matriculation, there's an obvious basis, the eigen basis. Eigen basis is that the class of the fixed points. The class of a fixed point is like a Dirac zeta in the language of differential forms is matrix. Language of differential forms. If you multiply it with anything, it will still be a different way. So it's always an eigen basis. And in this identification, so this beta vectors, the eigenvectors of the beta algebra, they obviously must match the eigen basis. So you can ask, what does this match? And the answer is stable envelope. So that is another way of defining stable envelope, one of the dozen ways. So that is I and O D. The analysis of the steeper envelopes are really the so-called spin bases in quantum interval systems. But it is rather remarkable. In quantum interlabor system, this is obvious, and this is what we are looking for. In geometry, this is the obvious, and this is what the characteristic classes are singularities. And in side identification, in this beautiful verb that Hokunkovan and he's looking at everybody, we are talking. Usewood and everybody builds up. The easy and the hard things are matching the other things. Yes? You gave some context saying that tangent to flag varieties, a complete quivers, are completely both varieties. Can you continue that to give us some more context within the universe of how much that was covered by both varieties? I don't know. I only know this example. So I don't, I can't. I only know this example. So I don't, I cannot make it larger. If I could, I would name it slingshot variety. But no, I cannot. But there are two little extra flowers on this universe. One is you can do hypercolic varieties, of course, and then the theory holds. And also you can play the full flag variety of other types. And then they turn out to be 3D mirror dual to the. To be 3D mirror dual to the long-run dual full-flag variety. They do not fall under this under both varieties, but these are the only examples I know. How about the classes? This lesson should completely be the next time. All right, well, let's thank Richard again and So we need a good question.
